Concept When designing Adventureland for Disneyland Paris, Imagineers intended to keep the original idea of blending exotic environments from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Yet, since the One Thousand and One Arabian Nights are part of the European vision of exotism, they decided to add a middle-eastern pavilion at the entrance of the land. Named Adventureland Bazaar, this small recreation of an oriental city also acts as a shopping and eating place. Adventureland Bazaar In 1992, at the opening of the land, the building featured a covered maze-like street network and many shops: * Les Trésors de Schéhérazade (Schaharazade's Treasures) * L'Echoppe d'Aladin (Aladin's Shop) * La Reine des Serpents (The Snake Queen) * Le Chant des Tam-Tams (The Tam-Tams' Song) * La Girafe Curieuse (The Curious Giraffe) In 1993, one year after the release of the Disney movie Aladdin, a walkthrough attraction opened in the Bazaar, named Le Passage Enchanté d'Aladdin. Agrabah Café In 1999, most of the building was turned into Agrabah Café, with the exception of Les Trésors de Schéhérazade and La Girafe Curieuse. All shops and streets were merged to make one whole restaurant, although the details of the place are left unchanged (except for the shop Le Chant des Tam-Tams which was fully modified). As such, this place now offers a table service for guests. The restaurant specializes in a wide range of mediterranean meals. Details of the Bazaar The Bazaar features many references to tales from Arabian Nights: * A mural of Aladdin and Genie popping out of the Lamp. * A mural of Sindbad the Sailor. * A mural of Shaharazade telling stories to her husband. * A mural of the Ebony Horse. * A mural of Princess Periezade. * A room themed to the Snake Queen. * A Roc's egg laid on top of a tower. Originally, the building featured a proper oriental soundtrack. Since the Disney film Aladdin was released in 1992, this soundtrack was soon replaced with the movie's one. However, the original soundtrack was brought back shortly after the park's 15th anniversary.

It was founded in 1999 with the goal of \\"safeguarding the intent of libertarian and conservative donors\\". As a donor advised fund, Donors Trust is not legally required to disclose the identity of its donors, and most of its donors remain anonymous. It distributes funds to various conservative and libertarian organizations. It is affiliated with Donors CapitalFund, another donor-advised fund. In September 2015, Lawson Bader was announced as the new president of both Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. Bader was formerly president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute and Vice President at the Mercatus Center. Overview Donors Trust is a 501(c)(3) organization. As a public charity and a donor- advised fund, Donors Trust offers clients a variety of tax advantages compared to a private foundation. Donors Trust accepts donations from charitable foundations and individuals. Grants from Donors Trust are based on the preferences of the original contributor, and the organization assures clients that their contributions will never be used to support politically liberal causes. As a donor advised fund, Donors Trust can offer anonymity to individual donors, with respect to their donations to Donors Trust, as well as with respect to an individual donor's ultimate grantee. As a donor advised fund and public charity, Donors Trust accepts cash or assets from donors, and in turn creates a separate account for the donor, who may recommend disbursements from the fund to other public charities. Donors Trust requires an initial deposit of $10,000 or more. Donors Trust is associated with Donors Capital Fund. Donors Trust refers clients to Donors Capital Fund if the client plans to maintain a balance of $1 million or more. Donors Trust president Lawson Bader said the goal of the organization is to “safeguard the intent of libertarian and conservative donors,\\" ensuring that funds are used only to promote \\"liberty through limited government, responsibility, and free enterprise\\". History Donors Trust was established in 1999 by Whitney Lynn Ball. According to Donors Trust, the organization was founded by a group of donors and nonprofit executives who were “actively engaged in supporting and promoting a free society as understood in America's founding documents.” In early 2013, Donors Trust was the subject of investigative journalism reports by the British newspapers The Independent and The Guardian, and the United States entities Mother Jones and the Center for Public Integrity. Mother Jones described Donors Trust as having funded a conservative public policy agenda in the areas of labor unions, climate science, public schools, and economic regulations. Donors As of 2013, Donors Trust had 193 contributors, mostly individuals, and some foundations. The Charles G. Koch Foundation and the Knowledge and Progress Fund, another of the Koch family foundations, contributed $3.3 million to Donors Trust between 2007 and 2011. The Knowledge and Progress Fund contributed $4.5 million to Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund between 2006 and 2012. Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund were the only grantees of the Knowledge and Progress Fund through 2013, according to The Independent. The Koch brothers, Charles and David Koch, were the top contributors to Donors Trust in 2011, according to an analysis by the Columbia Journalism Review published by Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. In 2010, Donors Trust received a 2 million grant from the Donors Capital Fund. Donors Trust account holders have included the John M. Olin Foundation, the Castle Rock Foundation, the Searle Freedom Trust, and the Bradley Foundation. The Bradley family contributed $650,000 between 2001 and 2010. The DeVos family foundation contributed $1 million in 2009 and $1.5 million in 2010 to Donors Trust. Recipients From its founding in 1999 through 2013, Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund distributed nearly $400 million, and through 2015 $740 million, to various nonprofit organizations, including numerous conservative and libertarian causes. Donors Trust requires that recipients are registered with the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) public charity. Whitney Ball, the former president of Donors Trust, told The Guardian in 2013 that Donors Trust has about 1,600 grantees. In 2014, Ball said that 70 to 75 percent of grants go to public policy organizations, with the rest going to more conventional charities such as social service and educational organizations. In 2010, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation received a Donors Trust grant of $7 million, nearly half of the Foundation's revenue that year. Other Donors Trust recipients have included the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Tax Reform, the National Rifle Association Freedom Action Foundation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Federalist Society, the FreedomWorks Foundation, the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, and the Center for Class Action Fairness. Donors Trust paid the legal fees of the Project on Fair Representation, a Washington, D.C.-based legal defense fund that assembled the plaintiff's legal team in Fisher v. University of Texas, a 2013 United States Supreme Court case concerning affirmative action college admissions policies. In 2011, the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, an online news organization, received $6.3 million in Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund grants, 95 percent of the center's revenue that year. Other Donors Trust recipients have included the Foundation for Jewish Camp, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, the James Randi Educational Foundation, the Marijuana Policy Project, and PragerU. =Climate change related funding= Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund distributed nearly $120 million to 102 think tanks and action groups skeptical of the science behind climate change between 2002 and 2010. According to a 2013 analysis by Drexel University environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, between 2003 and 2013 Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund combined were the largest funders of organizations opposed to restrictions on carbon emissions, which Brulle calls the \\"climate change counter-movement.\\" According to Brulle, by 2009, approximately one-quarter of the funding of the \\"climate counter-movement\\" was from the Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. As of 2010, Donors Trust grants to conservative and libertarian organizations active in climate change issues included more than $17 million to the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank; $13.5 million to the Heartland Institute, a public policy think tank; and $11 million to Americans for Prosperity, a political advocacy group. In 2011, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), the conservative Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization, received $1.2 million from Donors Trust, 40 percent of CFACT's revenue in that year. Climate change writer Wei-Hock \\"Willie\\" Soon received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Donors Trust. In 2015, The Guardian reported that Donors Trust gave $4.3 million to the Competitive Enterprise Institute over three years. =State-based policy funding= Between 2008 and 2013, Donors Trust granted $10 million to the State Policy Network (SPN), a national network of conservative and libertarian think tanks focused on state-level policy. SPN used the grants to incubate new think tanks in Arkansas, Rhode Island and Florida. Donors Trust also issued grants to SPN's affiliates at the state level during the same period. The American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model state-level legislation, is a Donors Trust recipient. = Project Veritas = Donors Trust donated $1.7 million to Project Veritas, a group run by conservative activist James O'Keefe, which attempts through undercover video stings to demonstrate the biases of mainstream media organizations and liberal groups. Donors Trust's relationship with Project Veritas came under scrutiny in 2017 after Project Veritas had one of its operatives contact The Washington Post, falsely claiming to have been impregnated by Roy Moore while she was a teenager. = Elections and the judiciary = In 2018, DonorsTrust funded more than 99% of the Judicial Education Project, a legal alias for Honest Elections Project and The 85 Fund.

It is Minnesota State Highway 77 in the busiest portion of the route, from Minneapolis to Apple Valley. The portions north and south of this are county roads, Hennepin County 152 and Dakota County 23, respectively. Its northern terminus in Minneapolis is at Washington Avenue in Cedar-Riverside, though its alignment is briefly interrupted by an interchange at Hiawatha Avenue to the south. The portion south of 250th St W in Eureka Township is no longer signed as Cedar Avenue for compliance with the Dakota County grid. Nevertheless, it remains Dakota County 23 and is usually referred to as Cedar Avenue (example ).  Route description  Cedar Avenue at East 24th Street in Minneapolis, looking southbound. Cedar Avenue begins as a two-lane, undivided road in the northwestern edge of Northfield at Greenvale Avenue. It goes north, following the Falk Avenue-Eveleth Avenue plane into Dakota county, jogs west to Foliage Avenue at 320th St and west again to Galaxie Avenue at 280th Street. From 280th Street northward, Cedar Avenue is relatively continuous, with official signage first showing the name near 250th Street. There is a small rural commercial district between 250th Street and Lakeville, containing multiple greenhouses and a Buddhist temple. In Lakeville just south of 215th Street, Cedar becomes a wider four-lane roadway, and gradually more urban as it enters Lakeville. In Apple Valley Cedar goes to six lanes, and becomes a main suburban thoroughfare. At the north end of Apple Valley, near 140th Street, the county road portion ends, and Cedar becomes Minnesota State Highway 77. Cedar Avenue continues north through Eagan and across the Minnesota River at the Cedar Avenue Bridge in Bloomington. North of East Old Shakopee Road, the Cedar Avenue name is not officially signed. Cedar Avenue passes the Mall of America near its junction with Minnesota State Highway 5/Interstate 494. It continues as a freeway on the east edge of Richfield before entering Minneapolis as a two-lane city street. At the southern border of Minneapolis, its designation at Highway 77 ends and it becomes Hennepin County Road 152. Cedar continues straight north, directly across a causeway over Lake Nokomis. At Lake Street, it passes the Pioneers and Soldiers Cemetery. At Hiawatha Avenue, the road jogs slightly east to facilitate an interchange. Traffic then goes west again, and north through the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, named after the avenue. The final junction of Cedar is at Washington Avenue. This final terminus is known as Seven Corners. Hennepin County Road 152 continues into downtown Minneapolis on Washington Avenue South.  Historical changes  In Dakota County, Cedar Avenue was re-routed between Interstate 35E and the Minnesota River, to accommodate the freeway and new river crossing. The old Cedar Avenue is now known as Nicols Road. In Hennepin County, Cedar Avenue was rebuilt slightly east of its old alignment. The old alignment is known as Old Cedar Avenue, and is no longer continuous; it is interrupted at Highway 5/494, 66th Street, and Minnesota State Highway 62. Old Cedar Avenue and Cedar Avenue merge at Edgewater Boulevard in Minneapolis. At Hiawatha Avenue, Cedar Avenue was rerouted slightly east to accommodate an interchange. Downtown, Cedar Avenue used to cross the Mississippi River at what is now the 10th Avenue Bridge; instead, it now ends at Washington Avenue.  Bus Rapid Transit  Between Mall of America and 155th Street, Cedar Avenue houses the Red Line, previously known as the Cedar Avenue Bus Rapid Transitway.

His brothers were the Dukes John Ernest the Younger of Saxe-Weimar, William IV of Saxe-Weimar, Albert of Saxe- Eisenach, John Frederick of Saxe-Weimar, Ernest I of Saxe-Gotha, and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. With his older brother, Duke John Ernest the Younger, he received his first lessons from the tutor and Hofmeister Friedrich von Kospoth. He also studied in Jena, like his brothers John Ernest the Younger and Frederick. The Fruitbearing Society was founded on 24 August 1617 at Hornstein Castle (now Williamsburg Castle). Frederick was a founding member. Prince Louis I of Anhalt-Köthen gave him the nickname der Hoffende ('\\"the Hopeful'\\") and the motto it will be so. His emblem was a half-ripe cherry, hanging on the three. In the register of the Society at Köthen, he is registered as number 4. A few weeks later, Duke Frederick began his Grand Tour.

She was built as H. M. Pellatt but was successively called Memling, Nicole Le Borgne, Giuliana Pagan, and Scillin Secondo before becoming Scillin in 1937. By the time of the Second World War the ship was in Italian ownership. In 1942, a Royal Navy submarine sank her in the Mediterranean Sea when she was transporting over 800 Allied prisoners of war (POWs) from North Africa to Italy, killing nearly all of them. The United Kingdom kept the cause of her sinking secret until 1996, more than 50 years after the event. History Russell and Company of Greenock, Renfrewshire built the ship in 1903 as H. M. Pellatt for William Petersen Ltd of Newcastle- upon-Tyne. She had a three-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine built by David Rowan and Company of Glasgow. It developed 196 NHP and drove her single screw, giving her a speed of . The Canadian Lake and Ocean Navigation Co of Newcastle bought H. M. Pellatt in 1905 and sold her in 1911 to the Merchants Mutual Line, also of Newcastle. Canadian Northern Steamships of London bought her in 1917 and sold her in 1918 to Canada Steamship Lines Ltd of Montreal. In 1920 the Société Belge d'Armement Maritime bought the ship and renamed her Memling. In 1924 or 1925 the Compagnie Charles Le Borgne of Marseille bought the ship and renamed her Nicole Le Borgne. In 1934 Giuseppe Pagan of Venice bought the ship and renamed her Giuliana Pagan. In 1935 Aurora SA di Navigazione of Genoa bought the ship and renamed her Scillin Secondo. In 1837 the company shortened her name to Scillin. By 1941 she was owned by Fratelli Bianchi Societá Di Navigazione of Genoa. Final voyage In November 1941, in Tripoli, Libya, 814 Allied POWs were embarked in Scillins hold, which, reportedly, was suitable for only about 300. The result was severe overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. More prisoners would have been embarked, but the British military doctor (Captain Gilbert, RAMC) made vehement and repeated protests. Some reports state that a further 195 POWs were embarked before Scillin sailed and that there were some 200 Italian troops aboard; others dispute these points saying that the only Italian troops aboard were guards and gun crews and the surplus POWs were never actually embarked. She sailed on 13 November 1942. A submarine, , intercepted Scillin on the night of 14 November off the coast of Tunisia. Sahib first fired two shells at the cargo ship and then launched a single torpedo, which hit Scillins hold and rapidly sank her. Prisoners in the hold had little chance of survival. Sahib rescued 27 POWs (26 British and one South African), Scillins captain and 34 Italian crew and soldiers before the arrival of an Italian warship obliged her to leave. Only when Sahibs crew heard survivors speaking English did they realise the ship's purpose. Official reaction Royal Navy submarine commanders had been ordered not to attack enemy civilian ships that were en route from North Africa to Italy. In an inquiry, Sahib's commander (Lt. John Bromage) was cleared of culpability, since he claimed that Scillin had borne no lights, he had believed that Scillin was carrying Italian troops, had appeared to be en route to Africa and had not responded to the initial shelling (two rounds), intended to halt her. In his log Lt Bromage never claimed to have fired any warning shots. > \\"Fired 12 rounds with the 3\\" gun and registered with 10\\". The ship was > brought to. Closed to 750yds and fired one Torpedo into the engine room. > Sgt W D Heath R.T.R. (survivor) mistook the missed rounds as warning shots.\\" The patrol report clearly indicates that the Sahib was put on a course to intercept Scillin. The order came from Malta and was received during a radio listening watch as recorded in Lt Brommage's log. Consideration was given to the prosecution of Italians for war crimes because of Scillins lack of life- saving equipment and Italian attempts to batten down (i.e. close) her hatches where the POWs were kept, thus preventing their escape. Prosecution was abandoned due to lack of evidence. 787 or 788 POWs died aboard Scillin. Another source mentions 806 POWs lost, as well as 79 Italians. Secrecy and disclosure The details of Scillins loss and the circumstances of the death of the Allied POWs were kept secret for more than 50 years until persistent inquiries by relations and historians brought a more open response. The reasons for such official reticence for such a long period are not clear, but there are claims that it was deemed necessary to protect intelligence sources. The first time information was made public was in 1996 when the Ministry of Defence records department put an account of the sinking and a list of POWs into an existing file at The National Archives. (WO311/304) Both the account of the sinking and the list of casualties were factually flawed. When the mistakes were pointed out the MoD accepted the errors, but no alterations have been made. It was deemed important to conceal the source of the intelligence (Ultra) that so accurately predicted Scillins position and schedule, enabling Sahib to intercept her, and also revealed that POWs were aboard. It should be remembered that Ultra was highly secret and great efforts were made to prevent the Axis discovering or disclosing that their signals were being read; Ultra's existence was not publicly disclosed until the 1970s. Many measures were applied to protect Ultra intelligence. One was to overfly any intended shipping target before directing any interception and attack. Scillins crew were interrogated when they were landed at Malta and disclosed that the ship had been sighted by aerial reconnaissance. Sahib was then given an interception course. This was standard practice when attacking shipping whose movements had been revealed by Ultra whether they had POW aboard or not. Thus if transports that carried POW were not attacked at all it would have been obvious that the Allies had prior knowledge of the ships' cargo. The most complete account of Scillins sinking and the role of Ultra was published in the September 2006 issue of the Royal Artillery Journal. Previous losses Scillin was only one example of Allied POWs being killed when enemy ships were sunk in the Mediterranean. Five others had been sunk in the preceding year with 2,000 casualties; Ultra had predicted each of the POW transportations. There is a memorial plaque at the National Memorial Arboretum to the POWs lost at sea on (9 December 1941), Ariosto (15 February 1942), Tembien (27 February 42), Nino Bixio (17 August 1942), (13 October 1942) and Scillin (14 November 1942).

It has existed in numerous different versions between that time and the Middle Ages, going by various titles and generally involving members of the corvid family. The lesson to be learned from it has also varied, depending on the context in which it was told. Several idioms derive from the fable. The main variations Harrison Weir's illustration of The Vain Jackdaw, 1881 While the details of the fable have always been varied,Francisco Rodríguez Adrados, tr. Gert-Jan van Dijk, The History of the Graeco-Latin Fable III, Leiden NL 2003 pp.133-7 two main versions have been transmitted to European cultures in modern times. The first of these is mostly found in Greek sources and numbered 101 in the Perry Index.Aesopica It concerns a daw or crow that dresses itself in the feathers of other birds before competing against them, only to have them recognised and stripped away by their owners; in some versions all its own feathers are also torn away. The lesson to be learned is that borrowed finery brings humiliation. The second version stems from the Latin collection of Phaedrus and is numbered 472 in the Perry Index.Aesopica In this a jackdaw (or jay in Caxton's telling) that has found some peacock feathers and stuck them among its own, looks down on its kind and joins the peacocks. When they realise the intruder is not one of themselves, they attack it, stripping away the borrowed finery and leaving its so dishevelled that it is afterwards rejected by its fellows. The moral of the story is not to reach above one's station. Some mediaeval versions have different details. In Odo of Cheriton's telling the crow is ashamed of its ugliness and is advised by the eagle to borrow feathers from the other birds, but when it starts to insult them the eagle suggests that the birds reclaim their feathers.John C. Jacobs. The fables of Odo of Cheriton, Syracuse University Press 1985, pp.74-5 Froissart's Chronicles have a certain Friar John advising church leaders that their possessions depend on temporal rulers and illustrating the lesson with a story of a bird that is born featherless until all the other birds decide to furnish it with some of their own. When it starts to act too proudly, they threaten to take their feathers back.An extract from the Lord Berners translation in a Harvard anthology Such stories addressed themselves to various kinds of pride and had given rise to the Latin idomatic phrase esopus graculus (Aesop's jackdaw) that Erasmus recorded in his Adagia.III.vi 91 But the story has also been used to satirise literary plagiarists in Classical times. In one of his Epistles, the Roman poet Horace alludes to the Greek version of the fable when referring to the poet Celsus, who is advised not to borrow from others ‘lest, if it chance that the flock of birds should some time or other come to demand their feathers, he, like the daw stripped of his stolen colors, be exposed to ridicule.’Epistles I.3, lines 18-20 It was in this sense too that the young William Shakespeare was attacked by the elder playwright Robert Greene as ‘an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers’.A Groatsworth of Wit Bought with a Million of Repentance (1592), quoted and commented on in the Penguin Shakespeare When Jean de la Fontaine adapted the story in his Fables Choisies (IV.9), it was the Latin version of a bird disguised as a peacock that he chose, but he followed Horace in applying it to 'The human jay: the shameless plagiarist'.\\"The jay in peacock’s plumes\\", in Norman Shapiro's Fifty translations of La Fontaine, University of Illinois 1997, p.45 The very free version of John Matthews, his English translator, develops the suggestion much further: :::If you closely examine the men of the quill :::And search for goods stolen with sharp piercing eyes, :::Taking these from the pages their volumes which fill, :::Huge quartos would shrink to a very small size.Fables from La Fontaine, London 1820, p.193 However, when La Fontaine's fable was rewritten to fit a popular air in the 18th century Nouvelles Poésies Spirituelles et Morales sur les plus beaux airs, its focus was changed to dressing above one's station.John Metz, The fables of La Fontaine: a critical edition of the eighteenth-century vocal settings, Pendragon Press 1986, p71 It is the Latin version too that lies behind the popular idiom 'to adorn oneself (or strut) in borrowed plumes', used against empty pretensions. This is made more obvious by the reference to peacock feathers in the Italian equivalent, Vestirsi con le penne del pavone.Lexicon of Common Figurative Units, University of Trier, part 1, p.19 Ivan Krylov wrote his own variation of the fable called \\"The Crow\\". The fable gave rise to two expressions in Russian (after two different phrases in it): \\"Left the crows, but didn't join the peacocks\\" (От ворон отстала, а к павам не пристала) and \\"Neither peacock nor crow\\" (Ни пава, ни ворона). While keeping close to the fable at the start, he ends by extending the application to the human example of a merchant's daughter marrying a noble and fitting neither with their family nor her own.Lydia Razran Stone, The frogs who begged for a tsar (a dual language text), Russian Information Service 2010 p.123 Artistic use Amelia Bauerle's Fine feathers make fine birds, 1897 In the 17th century, when paintings were popular home decorations but had to be justified by carrying a moral message, the Dutch artist Melchior d'Hondecoeter executed at least two of the Greek version of the fable in which many species of bird attack the daw.In the Mauritshuis (1671) and in the August Heckscher Collection He was followed in 1719 by Pieter Casteels III, whose \\"Fable of the Raven\\" shows flocks of brightly coloured birds descending for the attack.PX pixels English artists who have been influenced by their treatment of the subject include George Lance, whose “The vain jackdaw stripped of his borrowed plumes” was highly praised when he exhibited it at the British Institution in 1828,London Literary Gazette, 9 Feb. 1828, p.91 and Edward Bawden in the 20th century.See his print at the Fry Art Gallery Most illustrations of La Fontaine's fables, with their three or four peacocks bending to reclaim their plumes from the jay, show lack of originality.Some examples in French collections This is true even of Kano Tomo-nobou's Japanese woodcut version published from Tokyo in 1894.Choix de Fables de La Fontaine I.14 The most lively treatments of the theme are in political cartoons celebrating the defeat of Napoleon,Brown University Library, Napoleon satires in which feathered kings and emperors snatch away his finery. There was a slightly earlier Japanese woodprint by Kawanabe Kyosai in his Isoho Monogotari series (1870–80) which shows peacocks attacking a prostrate crow.View online In general the artist was dependent on John Tenniel's illustrations of the fables for his interpretations, but in this case the print is similar to the picture in the Croxall edition of 1814.View online There is an amusing nod in the fable's direction in Amelia Bauerle's etching \\"Fine feathers make fine birds\\" in The Yellow Book.April 1897 Although the proverb is an alternative for 'Clothes make the man', the benignant wallpaper peacock bending over the little girl as she shows off her plumed hat suggests that it might pluck away the feathers if it had a mind to. The print suggests the relationship between the proverb, which focuses on reputation gained by presentation rather than merit, and the idiom 'dressed in borrowed plumes', which draws attention to another fraudulent aspect of reputation.

The name \\"King John's Palace\\" has been used since the 18th century; prior to that the site was known as the \\"King's Houses\\". It is not known how or when the building became associated with King John as he only spent a total of nine days here. The earliest reference to the King's Houses dates back to 1164 during the reign of Henry II (1154–1189). The first period of significant building took place between 1176 and 1180, when Henry ordered £500 to be spent, and also created a deer park at Clipstone. Hunting game was the preserve of the aristocracy and deer parks provided a form of recreation, foodstuffs for feasting and an arena for crucial political and economic deals to be made. In 1194 Richard I arranged a meeting with William, King of Scotland at Clipstone, and in 1290, Edward I convened Parliament here. The King's Houses were once very well-appointed. The ruins that are visible today are the remains of a Romanesque chamber dating from around 1180. The stone chamber was accessed through a large, buttressed central doorway and had a timber upper floor which allowed views over the deer park from ornately carved windows. However, the chamber was only a small part of a large, multiphased complex of buildings which is known to have existed at Clipstone from documents, geophysical survey and archaeological excavation. These included a gatehouse, tower, individual hall and chambers for the King and Queen, several chapels, kitchens, stables for 200 horses, and lodgings for many royal retainers. There was also a Great Pond which provided 100 pike and 1600 roach during Edward II's visit in December 1315. Clipstone remained an important royal centre until the late fifteenth century when the English monarchy began to focus on other residences. In 1525 it was said of the King's Houses that \\"ther is great dekay & ruyne in stone-work tymber lede and plaster\\". By the mid 18th century the site had been reduced to the ruin that stands today. King John's Palace was consolidated during 2009 by Paul Mendham Stonemasons during a conservation project funded by English Heritage and Nottinghamshire County Council. The site is the focus of an ongoing archaeological project by Andy Gaunt of Mercian Archaeological Services and the buildings archaeologist James Wright. The King's Houses =Establishment of the Palace and Deer Park= Medieval beast-head discovered at the site in 1956 The establishment of the King's Houses was linked to Clipstone's location in the heart of the royal forest of Sherwood. In the medieval period a forest was a defined geographic area subject to the forest law brought to England by the Normans. The law protected beasts of the chase, primarily deer, for the king. It also protected the woodland that formed their habitat. Forest law was enforced over the land regardless of who owned it. In the 13th century the forest stretched from the River Trent in the south to the River Meden in the north, and from Wellow in the east to Sutton-in-Ashfield to the west. In the 12th century it may have covered all of Nottinghamshire north and west of the Trent. A reference to the forest in Nottinghamshire made in 1155-56 early in the reign of Henry II (1154–1189) points to there being a forest in the reign of Henry I (1100–1135), however a dispute over the keepership of the forest in the early 13th century suggests a forest in Nottinghamshire dating back to the reign of William I. Sherwood Forest was therefore well established by 1164.Gaunt, A. (2011) Clipstone Park and the King's Houses: Reconstructing and interpreting a medieval landscape through non-invasive techniques Wright is of the opinion that the extant building dates from the period of Henry II given that it bears several Romanesque architectural features which were phased out by the end of the 12th century.Mower, J. & Wright, J., (2011) Proposed Archaeological Evaluation — Clipstone, Nottinghamshire =History of the King's Houses and Clipstone Park= The site of Clipstone Peel Clipstone became a favoured residence of the monarchy for over two hundred years. The historian David Crook listed the following visits: Henry II in 1181 and 1185, Richard I in 1194, John in 1200, 1201, 1205, 1210 and 1215, Henry III in 1244, 1251 and 1255, Edward I in 1279, 1280, 1284, 1290 and 1300, Edward II in 1307, 1315, 1316, 1317, 1318 and 1320, Edward III in 1327, 1328, 1330, 1331, 1332, 1334, 1335, 1345 and 1363, and Richard II in 1387 and 1393Crook (1976), p. 44. Such visits could be brief, such as John's overnight stay on 19 March 1200.The Itinerary of King John Project The reign of King John saw the endowment of the chapel of St Edwin in 1205.The Sherwood Forest Book, ed. H. E. Boulton, Thoroton Society Record Series xxiii (1964), 57 He is also said to have held a parliament at the nearby Parliament Oak during one of his visits. During the reigns of Edward II and Edward III an extension to the park led to petitions lodged by the men of Clipstone, Warsop and Mansfield Woodhouse over their loss of their rights to husbote (timber for building), haybote (timber for hedging), collection of ferns and leaves (for compost and manure) as well as pastureland.Crook (2005) There are only three recorded visits to the King's Houses by Henry III. Philip Rahtz attributes the standing ruin to this phase of building,Rahtz (1960), p. 29. however J. Wright considers that the presence of Romanesque features associated with the extant structure which have been identified subsequent to Rahtz's fieldwork may push back the dating to Henry II's construction of 1176-80.Wright, J., (2004) 'A Survey of King John's Palace, King's Clipstone, Nottinghamshire' in Transactions of the Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire Vol. 108, 109 In 1282, Edward I ordered the construction of a stable capable of accommodating 200 horses, and John Steane is of the opinion that it was intended to provide for the entire entourage of the Household, or possibly even act as a royal stud.Steane, J. M., (1999) The Archaeology Of Power, 269 Monument to Edward III of England in Westminster Abbey Edward II constructed a peel at the castle, which has been viewed by Crook in the light of the pressures on the need for more agricultural land during the early 14th century coupled with the political background of Edward I's problems with Scotland and internally with Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. The early years of Edward III's reign saw a number of visits to the palace and the subsequent petitions by the local communities led to the reversal of most of Edward II's changes to the park.Crook (1976), pp. 41–43. Edward III also maintained the administration of the deer park. In 1340 Robert de Mauley was granted custody of the manor and park.Stapleton, A., (1890) A History of the Lordship of King's Clipstone or Clipstone in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire In 1341 the men of Clipstone and Warsop were granted permission to utilise the woodland resources within the park.Crook (1976), p. Colvin describes work in the late 1340s: \\"Works carried out in 1348-9 included the rebuilding of the knight's chamber and the repair of the great hall, the king's kitchen, the queen's hall, the king's kitchen, the queen's kitchen, the great chamber, Rosamund's Chamber, Robert de Mauley's Chamber, the treasurer's chamber, the chamber of Lionel the king's son, the great chapel, the chapel next to the king's chamber, the king's long stable, and the great gateway. The knight's chamber was a timber-framed building standing on a 'groundwall' of stone, but the more important buildings were of stone. The roofing material was Mansfield slate. In 1360-3 over £140 were spent on general repairs to the hall, king's chamber, Earl of March's chamber, pantry, buttery, gateway and other buildings, including the chapel of St. Edwin at Birkland which was served by the chaplain of Clipstone. Further considerable repairs were carried out between 1367 and 1375 by William Elmeley, who in 1360 had been appointed clerk of the works at the manor of Clipstone and the lodge of Bestwood.\\"Colvin (1963), p. 920 The Patent Rolls of this period also help to populate the King's Houses with recognisable historical characters. Robert de Mauley is almost certainly Robert de Morley, 2nd Baron Rodyn, who fought at the battles of Boroughbridge, Halidon Hill, Sluys (where he was captain of the English flagship) and Crecy. De Morley finished his career as Constable of the Tower of London between 1355-9.Sir Robert DE MORLEY 2nd Baron Morley of Roydon A map of Sherwood Forest dating to c.1400 survives in the archive at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire and shows Clipstone Park as a clearly defined emparked area circled by a pale fence. There are several place names marked relating to the medieval infrastructure such as \\"ye pele\\" (Clipston Peel), \\"Clipston ye dam\\" (the dam at the head of the Great Pond) and Clipston Parke; and the River Maun is shown flowing through the park.Barley, M. W. 'Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire', in Skelton, R. A. and Harvey, P. D. A., eds., Local Maps and Plans from Medieval England (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1986), 131-139 The manor passed to George, Duke of Clarence until his exacution in 1478 when once again Clipstone reverted to the crown.Colvin (1963), p. 921. =Decline= South-west elevation of King Johns Palace, Nottinghamshire displaying the Romanesque recessed arch The decline of royal interest in the King's Houses throughout the 15th century fits an overall national pattern. Steane has pointed out that the residences of the monarchy in the later Middle Ages focussed on south-east England. Additionally the numbers of palaces and castles under direct royal control dwindled, and as the size of the Household increased from c.120 in the reign of Henry I to 800 under Henry VI fewer but more grandiose palaces were the preference.Steane, J. M., (2001) The Archaeology Of Power, 43 A survey of \\"the dekayes of the manner of Clippeston\\" dated to 1525 records that: \\"First the southeast end of the hie Chamber ther is in great dekay & ruyne in stonework tymber lede and plaster & the gavell ende of the same is flede outwarde so that a part of the rove and of flour of the said Chymber is fallen doune.

This was promptly sold on to Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury the following year.Crook (1976), pp. 41–42. =William Cavendish= Portrait of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle 1592-1676 William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle purchased the estate in 1630 and immediately commissioned William Senior \\"professor of arithmetique, geometrie, astronomie, navigation and dialing\\" to make a map of his new possession.

The King's Houses. A geophysical Resistance survey of King John's Palace, Clipstone, Nottinghamshire. NCA-018. Unpublished archaeological report has identified as the survival of an ornamental landscape from the medieval period. The only other buildings represented on the site are a house to the north-west of the ruin, and a rectangular enclosure to the north which is probably the village pinfold and a property further east along the village street. This latter structure may represent the ruined foundations of the gateway to the palace as it sits in the same location as the modern Brammer Farm House and Maun Cottage both of which contain substantial stone walls over a metre in thickness and of similar make-up to the ruin of King John's Palace. High status stonework was found in the gardens of these properties in 2007.Wright, J., (2007) Unpublished archive of King's Clipstone masonry survey (Held by Nottinghamshire County Council) Prior to 1889 Maun Cottage was the Fox & Hounds public house. The earliest public house in King's Clipstone was called The Gate and was recorded in the List of Friendly Societies for 1794.Bealby, J. et al, (2001), 165 James Cutts was the landlord and was still there in 1813. It is suspected that the name change occurred when Lindley took over from Cutts. Cornelius and then his son, James, and finally his daughter in law, Sarah, continued the tenancy until 1889 when the public house closed its doors for the last time Bealby, J. et al, (2001), 174 Clipstone Park was virtually destroyed during the period of the English Civil War and Protectorate. Cavendish supported the Royalist cause and went into exile in 1644, and during his absence the pale fence and trees were used to fuel the Parliamentary war-effort and the deer stocks depleted. On returning from exile in France Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle estimated the losses at £20,000 and described the scene as she witnessed it in 1665: \\"The fences torn down and used in the production of charcoal whilst the park denuded of its great oaks, leaving the deer and other animals no food or shade, so causing their demise.\\"Firth, J.B., (1924) Highways and Byways in Nottinghamshire, 247 =Thoroton and the early antiquarians= King John's Palace illustrated by Francis Grose in 1772. The site is viewed facing north-east. The antiquarian Robert Thoroton described a similar scene in 1677, coupled with some architectural detail on the King's Houses: \\"There is scarcely any ruins left at all of the king's old house, except a piece of thick Stone Wall, and the Park is also cleared of the Gallant Oaks wherewith it was well furnished before the late Rebellion.\\"Thoroton (1971), p. 173. Thoroton's description backs up in words what Senior hints at in his depiction of the King's Houses – that there was only a single structure left on the site by the 17th century. Much of the fabric of the palace complex would have been robbed piecemeal for building projects within the village and wider estate such as Clipstone Hall (founded prior to 1609).Bealby et al. (2001), p. 67. Clipstone passed into the ownership of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland in 1734 on his marriage to Lady Margaret Cavendish-Harley.Bealby et al. (2001), p. 73.

The flood meadows were intended to increase the yield of hay to feed flocks of sheep during the winter. The scheme cost almost £40,000 and was notable by the philanthropic nature of the high wages that the Duke offered to pay the construction labourers in a time of high unemployment created by the mechanisation of industry and the recent wars against Napoleon. The flood meadows passed through the heart of Clipstone Park, and the construction of them seems to have taken its toll on the preservation of the King's Houses.Bealby et al. (2001), pp. 104–116. Shortly after the completion of the scheme in 1844, White's Trade Directory described the ruins: \\"The only part of the palace now remaining stands in a large field close to the village and seems to have been the hall. The foundations have been formerly extensive, with several large vaults, but in 1816 a great part of these were dug up, to be employed in draining, which the Duke of Portland then commenced upon his estate here; and it appears much spoliation was made on the venerable walls, though it is said his Grace had given strict orders to the contrary.\\"White, F., (1844) History, gazetteer & directory of the county of Nottinghamshire, 626 20th and 21st centuries View of King John's Palace, Nottinghamshire facing south-west during conservation work in 2009 The site continued in use as an arable field, with a preserved ruin and was known as Castle Field during the 20th century. It remained in the ownership of the Welbeck Estate until November 1945 when it was purchased by local farmers Fred and Molly Bradley. It has remained in the Bradley family as an arable field (and lately pasture) to the present day.Bealby et al. (2001), p. 134. Conservation work took place on the ruin in 1991 and 2009. A section of the structure was in imminent danger of collapse and was therefore underpinned by pre-cast masonry on a concrete lintel in 1991. The archaeological work prior to underpinning was carried out by Trent and Peak Archaeology; and the construction work was completed by Cranes, West Bridgford, Nottingham. Both elements of the project were overseen by Nottinghamshire County Council.Sheppard, R., (1991) Unpublished archive of archaeological watching brief prior to monument underpinning (Held by Nottinghamshire County Council) In 2009 Paul Mendham Stonemasons were instructed by the architect Peter Rogan to complete a full scale consolidation scheme including pointing, grouting, pinning back, under- building, and soft-capping the ruin. The decisions for the scheme of conservation were based on two condition surveys of the ruin by Wright (2005)Wright, J., (2005) A Condition Survey of King John's Palace, King's Clipstone, Nottinghamshire and Rogan(2008).Rogan, P., (2008) Unpublished archive including condition survey, schedule of works and correspondence (Held by Nottinghamshire County Council) The work was paid for and overseen jointly by English Heritage and Nottinghamshire County Council. Archaeological investigation Broadly there have been three distinct levels of archaeological research into the site. The first of these is evaluation excavations conducted by Philip Rahtz (1956), Trent & Peak Archaeology (1991) and archaeological television programme Time Team (2011). The second of these were geophysical surveys, which took place under Masters (2004) and Gaunt (2010). Masters surveyed limited sections of the site using both magnetometry and resistivity; Gaunt surveyed the entirety of Castlefield using resistivity. In the third level of research the built environment was analysed by Wright in 2004, 2005 and 2007; in the form of a condition survey of the extant ruin and a survey of stonework in a number of properties in the parish. Rogan also produced a second condition survey archive for the ruin in 2008. Philip Rahtz's 1956 excavation dug over of trenches and revealed a large medieval complex, spread over around two acres. Relatively little debris from the occupation of the site, however, was found during the work.Rahtz, P., (1960) 'King John's Palace, Clipstone, Notts.' in Transactions of the Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire Vol. 64. The 2004 geophysical survey of the site identified the hidden foundations of walls, \\"robber trenches\\" where older walls had been dug up in the past for their valuable stone, and ditches. A possible rectangular enclosure around the lodge was also discovered. High pass resistivity geophysical survey by Andy Gaunt, 2010 Andy Gaunt's 2010 resistivity survey widened the area selected by Masters to incorporate the entirety of Castlefield and proved many of Masters' findings as well as adding new anomalies to the data-set. Gaunt's work discovered the following anomalies and is summarised from: 1) A large rectangular area and surrounding the monument appears to be a courtyard area, with a number of buildings around the perimeter and a wall or palisade surrounding the possible courtyard. 2) A large high resistance linear anomaly is interpreted as probably a ditch filled with rubble or the remains of a wall, and probably represents the edge of the manorial complex this is corroborated by 17th century mapping evidence which shows the 'Manor Garth' (manor enclosure) being separated at this location from the 'water field' to the west. 3) A large sub-rectangular area probably representing the rubble spread from a substantial building. 4) The location of a road, with drainage ditches either side of a metalled higher resistance surface. One suggestion is that there was a gateway to the site from the road side to the north, which would fit in with this interpretation. 5) Potential robbed out wall foundations perhaps providing a defensive element, or to define the edge of the site to the northeast. A full condition survey was undertaken in 2004-5 by Nottinghamshire County Council and again in 2008 by Peter Rogan. The 2004-5 survey recorded the condition of the rubble core walls of what appears to have been at least a two-storey building.Wright, J., (2004) 'A Survey of King John's Palace, King's Clipstone, Nottinghamshire' in Transactions of the Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire Vol. 108 Wright also undertook a stone survey in 2007 of a sample of properties within the parish. This is unpublished with the archive held by Nottinghamshire County Council. It revealed the survival of stone fragments of both medieval and post medieval date, with notable high status examples of carved and chamfered material visible in the garden of Maun Cottage in particular and potentially relating to the gateway of the palace complex. Many of the properties have stone foundations, cellars and walls which may be the result of robbing from the palace.Wright, J., (2007): Unpublished archive of King's Clipstone masonry survey (held by Nottinghamshire County Council) In April 2011, Channel 4's Time Team filmed an episode of the long running archaeological television programme at King John's Palace. A number of evaluation trenches and areas were opened to test anomalies identified by Gaunt in 2010. The excavation was directed by Professor Mick Aston. On site experts included Paul Blinkhorn and David Budge (pottery), Andy Gaunt (landscape archaeology), David Crook (historian), Dr Naomi Sykes (zooarchaeology), Alex Rowson (researcher), James Wright (buildings) and regular members of Time Team. The project designMower, J. & Wright, J., (2011) Proposed Archaeological Evaluation - Clipstone, Nottinghamshire for the programme was written by Jim Mower and James Wright. A report was generated by Wessex Archaeology.Wessex Archaeology, (2011) King John's Palace, Clipstone, Nottinghamshire - Archaeological Evaluation and Assessment of Results High Status tracery discovered in 2014 by Keith & Andrea Laver, King's Clipstone land owners.During July 2012 James Wright, Andy Gaunt, Ben Crossley and David Budge opened two evaluation trenches to test whether or not the large 180m long geophysical anomaly identified by Gaunt in 2011 was in fact the palace boundary ditch to the south-west of the site.Wright, J., (2012) King John’s Palace, King’s Clipstone, Nottinghamshire - Written Scheme of Investigation for an archaeological evaluation The excavation discovered a ditch c. in width associated with the buried soil horizon of an internal bank coupled with archaeologically sealed finds of 13th-14th century pottery has led to the early conclusion that this was indeed the palace boundary. The total area enclosed would have been approximately which compares favourably with the sizes of Knole House (), Clarendon () and Eltham Palace () making the King's Houses one of the largest palace sites in England. The evaluation also revealed evidence for a 19th-century sandpit associated with construction work on either the flood meadows or rebuilding of the village by the Duke of Portland.Gaunt, A. & Wright, J., (2013) King John’s Palace, Waterfield Farm, Nottinghamshire - an archaeological evaluation Mercian Archaeological Services CIC Volunteers and staff excavated 15 test pits in Kings Clipstone, during February 2013.Nottingham Evening Post 18/04/2013 James Wright undertook a standing building survey of Brammer Farm House and Arundel Cottage during February 2013. The purpose of this survey was to ascertain whether any in situ medieval masonry survived within the two properties. The results Wright, J., (2013) Brammer Farmhouse and Arundel Cottage, King's Clipstone, Nottinghamshire - A standing building survey report suggest that the boundary wall of the King's Houses survives as a spine wall within both properties up to first floor level. There is also evidence for bonded return walls to both north and south as well as a splayed window. There are five phases of development to the cottages with the earliest post-medieval builds being north of the boundary wall into the village street. Keith & Andrea laver of Sherwood Forest Lodge B&B;, King's Clipstone, discovered a section of high status window tracery in November 2014 in a hedgerow on their land adjacent to King Johns Palace. The section was discovered approximately 100M S.E of King Johns Palace. David Budge of Mercian Archaeological Services CIC states \\"The architectural fragment recorded on the site of the King's Houses, King's Clipstone, Nottinghamshire appears to be a piece of high status window tracery made from Mansfield White stone. The glazing channel is clearly visible as are the soffit cusps of trefoil heads. A central mullion rises between the springers.\\" Tourism The palace site is a Grade II listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument standing on private land. However, the site is open to visitors subject to advance application to the Bradley family (the landowners) of Waterfield Farm, King's Clipstone. In the summer of 2009, a permanent interpretation panel was unveiled during an open day at the palace. The panel was written and designed by James Wright and features a reconstruction drawing, by local artist Ray Straw, of the palace complex as it may have appeared in the mid-14th century. The panel is fixed to the 1991 pre- cast masonry wall on the north-west elevation of the ruin. There is also an annual open day in July at the site known as the \\"Picnic at the Palace\\". Details of this are usually logged with the Council For British Archaeology's Festival of British Archaeology webpage.

Situated along the right bank of the Ghod River, it is considered to be the 'regional centre' of the Bhima Valley. Inamgaon is one of the most intensively and extensively excavated and well reconstructed Chalcolithic sites of the Deccan region as well as of India so far Geography The village is located approximately to the east of the city of Pune. The region, situated within the lower reaches of the Ghod, is characterized by Cretaceous-Eocene Deccan Trap basalt. Archaeological site An ancient site, measuring approximately by , is located about from Inamgaon. There are five mounds at the site. The largest mound is called 'Inamgaon I', and it has been extensively excavated, and studied for its archaeological finds. The site was occupied between 3800-3200 B.P. (calibrated), or 1800-1200 BC. The Chalcolithic settlement was excavated in order to better understand the early and later Jorwe culture. There are 3 phases of the Chalcolithic that are found at Inamgaon. The excavation was a landmark in India's archaeology history due to its extensive and systematic process. The excavations revealed multiple cultural phases including Late Jorwe Culture, Early Jorwe Culture, and Malwa Culture. Archaeology findings are available at different museums such as Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya https://incrediblehealthtips.com/pregnancy/news/Inamgaon.html Malwa culture  The Malwa culture is characterized by a distinctive pottery known as the Malwa ware. It is a black-painted-red pottery which is made of fine orange buff paste and is wheel thrown. It usually has a thick slip that is orange red in color and the designs are painted in purplish to brown-black pigment. The design elements are of great variety. Besides simple linear patterns, there also occur elaborate designs employing geometrical patterns painted into panels or registers. These include either hatched or solid triangles or diamonds in rows, concentric circles, and loops. In addition to the geometric patterns, there are some interesting animal motifs such as deer. The painted ornamentation is usually confined to the upper half of the vessels. The commonest shape in this ware is the typical Indian lota or a small water vessel with a globular body and high neck, sometimes with an outcurve rim. Jars with a flaring mouth and a variety of bowls and dishes are also common. While many of the characteristic shapes of the Malwa ware are present at Inamgaon, the drinking goblet or the chalice is conspicuously absent. A new shape is a vessel with a tubular spout which might be the result of contact with the Neolithic farmers from the south who used such spouted vessels. The Malwa ware is associated with coarse red and gray fabrics and a small amount of black burnished pottery. A casual glance at the repertoire of pottery is enough to bring home the conspicuous absence of dishes. It is therefore not unlikely that besides the dough, much of the food was in liquid or semi liquid form. The quantities are also significant inasmuch as they enable us to infer the probable use of each pottery form. Thus, the coarse red/gray ware basins and jars and the handmade jars were probably used for storage purposes. The painted ware bowls, concave and convex sided, could have served as the table ware and the spouted ones for drinking water. The channel spouted bowls may have been used as milk bowls and the high and short necked jars for storing water. From the number of eating bowls, it appears to be a rather large family, perhaps six to eight persons, young and old together. Even today this is the average size of a family in an Indian village. This information helps for calculating the population of Inamgaon in the Late Jorwe phase. The area occupied by the people during this phase is large enough for about 200 to 250 huts, and, if presume an average family unit of five to six persons, the population of Inamgaon in the first quarter of the first millennium B.C. would have been from about a thousand to twelve hundred. This is quite sizable. In fact, Inamgaon may have been one of the most populous settlements of the culture. A large number of curious pottery objects have been found. They are made of broken potsherds, the edges of which were ground. The striation marks on the shreds have been obliterated by constant use. These objects are oblong in shape and have rounded corners. They were probably used as skin rubbers. Except for the change in pottery styles and domestic architecture, there is no difference in the cultural equipment of the Early and Late Jorwe phases. As already observed, the culture was chalcolithic in character; the people used copper and stone tools. As in the Malwa culture, most of the tools for cutting and chopping, etc. were made on chalcedony blades. Numerous cores and flake- blades are strewn over the surface of the ancient mound. Most of the blades are comparatively small; the longest one is about 7 cm in length. They are all made on the crested ridge technique. Besides the rich blade assemblage, we also recovered ground and polished stone axes. A small number of these were found in the course of excavations, but many have been found on the surface. It is possible that the axes were ground locally in huge querns, several of which were found in the excavations. A few ring-stones or mace-heads have also been found. They were probably hafted on wooden shafts and were used for turning the soil. They thus give us an idea of the agricultural operations. Sling balls of stone also occur Copper being scarce, was used on a restricted scale. Only a few copper tools such as a pair of tongs, a fishhook and a chisel have been found. It is very different. Ancient disposal of dead No evidence of the burials of the Malwa culture has so far been obtained except a solitary extended burial at Daimabad. But of the Jorwe both Early and Late, there is now definite evidence that the dead were buried within the house. In the Early Jorwe phase, only extended burials have been found. One of these was a child burial and the other that of an adult. The skeleton in each case was accommodated in a small pit just large enough for the purpose and was oriented in a north-south direction . The child seems to have been buried most unceremoniously, for no grave goods accompanied the dead body. In the other burial, a carinated bowl and a spouted vessel, both of the painted Jorwe fabric were found. It is significant that both the burials occurred within the floor of the house. In the Late Jorwe phase, the dead were buried in pits, the children in urns, and the adults in complete inhumation. For the children, two gray ware urns were placed horizontally mouth-to-mouth in a pit .These are fractional burials, but a complete skeleton has been found in a twin urn burial. Children were also buried in a single urn, though rarely. Usually a bowl and a spouted vessel accompanied the burial urns. Adults were buried in pits in which the whole skeleton was kept. Vessels containing food and water were also placed in the pit. Both types of burials were found within the habitation area, either inside or in the courtyard of the house. Regarding culture contacts, one may say, on the basis of excavated evidence, that the first comers to the site were a people from central India, called the Malwa people. They were soon displaced by the Jorwe people, who, like the southern Neolithic people, buried the dead in pits and pots within the habitation. Later, in the last phase, the Jorwe people borrowed the black-and-red ware as well as the channel spouted bowl from their counterparts in the south. The chronology of the Late Jorwe phase can be computed on the basis of one radiocarbon date that has been obtained from a sample from a late level of the Early Jorwe phase. Lying stratigraphically above this is the cultural debris of the Late Jorwe phase which is about a meter in thickness. It would not therefore be far off the mark if we date the Late Jorwe phase to 1000-700 B.C. This also explains the introduction of the black-andred ware of the megalithic fabric in the Late orwe. The Inamgaon excavations have thus narrowed the hiatus between the chalcolithic phase and the early historic period by nearly three centuries. It may be stated here that the early historic period starts in about the sixth century B.C. It is hoped that continuing excavation will close this hiatus in the not too distant future. Current Social Life The moderate day Inamgaon is on developing verge. Farming and Allied business are prime income source for Inamgaon. The Ghod River is being conducive for the cultural and social buildings. Inamgaon have been allotted with two Reservoirs & Small Dams for water storage projects by Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority. These Reservoirs & Small Dams for water storage helps to store water and ease the water availability. The settlement have all types of Preschool, Primary school & Secondary school . The New English School Inamgaon. is secondary school. Inamgaon farmers have the capital shares in two different cooperative Sugar factory. The Shrigonda Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana and Ghodganga Sugar Factory. The industrial establishments are closer and are conducive for the villagers employment. Inamgaon is catered by Petrol station and Social gathering hall. The settlement is being served by various National banks, however only Pune District Central Cooperative Bank scores the presence. The united capital shares of villagers and Pune District Central Cooperative Bank support have established Cooperative society, which, indeed contributes to needy farmers to have monitory support when requires. This Cooperative society governing body is formed by elective people by the villagers.

It is the lowermost formation of the Adelaide Subgroup of the Beaufort Group, a major geological group that forms part of the greater Karoo Supergroup. It represents the first fully terrestrial geological deposits of the Karoo Basin. Outcrops of the Abrahamskraal Formation are found from the small town Middelpos in its westernmost localities, then around Sutherland, the Moordenaarskaroo north of Laingsburg, Williston, Fraserburg, Leeu-Gamka, Loxton, and Victoria West in the Western Cape and Northern Cape. In the Eastern Cape outcrops are known from Rietbron, north of Klipplaat and Grahamstown, and also southwest of East London.  Geology  The Abrahamskraal Formation comprises the majority of the Middle Permian Beaufort sequence, and are thought to range between 268 - 259 million years in age. The lowermost deposits of the Abrahamskraal Formation found in the Eastern Cape until recently were named the Koonap Formation, but these outcrops have been amalgamated into the Abrahamskraal Formation due to recent stratigraphic and biostratigraphic research. The Abrahamskraal Formation incorporates the entire Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone in its upper sections and the entire Eodicynodon Assemblage Zone its lowermost southern deposits. In the west and northerly deposits the Abrahamskraal Formation overlies the Waterford Formation and the Middleton Formation in the south, both formations containing the uppermost deposits of the Ecca Group. The rocks of the Abrahamskraal Formation comprise mainly greenish-grey to blueish-grey mudstone coupled with rarer instances of greyish-red, reddish-brown or purple mudstones. These include subordinate greenish-grey, fine-grained sandstones which are normally observed in fining upward cycles. The sandstones vary in thickness from several metres to several tens of metres in some localities. Siltstones are also found interbedded with the mudstone beds. The presence of these rocks reveal much about the past environment that they were deposited in. They were formed by sedimentary material being deposited in the Karoo Basin - a retro- arc foreland basin - by vast, low-energy alluvial plains flowing northwards from the south. The lowermost deposits are considered to be deltaic and grade laterally into the underlying Ecca Group deposits in its southern localities. Deposits grade steadily younger in the northeast where the sedimentary facies turn fully terrestrial. The greenish-grey mudstones are usually associated with the deltaic sedimentary facies while the redder mudstones with the terrestrial.Rubidge, B. S. (ed.) 1995b. Biostratigraphy of the Beaufort Group (Karoo Supergroup). South African Committee of Stratigraphy. Biostratigraphic Series 1. Pretoria, Council for Geoscience. All sedimentary rocks of the Karoo Basin were transported downhill from the south in the shadow of the rising Gondwanide mountain range. The Gondwanides were the result of tectonic uplift that had previously begun to take course due to subduction of the Palaeo- pacific plate beneath the Gondwanan Plate. Orogenic pulses from the growing Gondwanides mountain chain and associated subduction created accommodation space for sedimentation in the Karoo Basin where the deposits of the Abrahamskraal Formation and all succeeding deposits of the Karoo Basin were deposited over millions of years.Kitching, J.

Paleontological significance  The Abrahamskraal Formation is highly fossiliferous and well known for its biozone assemblages of therapsid fossils. The Eodicynodon and Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zones to which this geological formation incorporates preserve the first appearance of the earliest dicynodonts, dinocephalians, biarmosuchians, therocephalians, gorgonopsians, and pareiasaurian parareptiles.Cluver, M.A., 1975.

The presence of this basal synapsid is indicative of this geological formations significance. For decades, paleontologists have puzzled over what has been termed Olsen’s Gap, which is used to describe the evolutionary gap in the tetrapod fossil record between the appearance of the more derived therapsids and their ancestors, the pelycosaurs. The rocks of the Abrahamskraal Formation and its geological correlates abroad hold the promise of that fossil gap being bridged through future research endeavors in the years to come. More notable fossil species includes the dicynodont Diictodon feliceps which first appears in the upper sections of this formation, remaining ubiquitous until the Permian-Triassic boundary.Cluver, M.A. and Hotton, N., 1981. The genera Dicynodon and Diictodon and their bearing on the classification of the Dicynodontia (Reptilia, Therapsida). South African Museum. Finally, fossils of temnospondyl amphibians such as of Rhinosuchus, the fish Namaichthys, invertebrate fossils of molluscs, invertebrate trackways and burrows, vertebrate footprints of therapsids, and a variety of plant fossils such as Dadoxylon, Equisetum modderdriftensis, Schizoneura africana, and several different species of Glossopteris have been recovered.  Correlation  The Abrahamskraal Formation corresponds with numerous localities abroad. Currently it is considered to correlate chronostratigraphically with the Rio do Rasto Formation from the Paraná Basin in Brazil, the Madumabisa Mudstone Formation of Zambia, the Ocher and Isheevo faunas of Russia, and to the Dashankou fauna from the Xidagou Formation of China. However, correlative dating between the Xidagou Formation and the Abrahamskraal Formation remains inconsistent and needs further study.

Cast * Mamnun Hasan Emon * Kusum Sikder * Masum Aziz * Haidar Ali Khan * Arifur Haque * Abul Hayat * Khaleda Akter Kolpona * Shams Sumon * Salim Sultan Release The film was released on 26 March 2010. Plot Nura is a street beggar. During the 1971 liberation war in Bangladesh, one of his legs became paralyzed. The Razakars anti-liberation forces attacked him, subsequently making him a crippled man. As a father, he has familial obligations that he could not abandon: he begs in the streets through rain and shine to make his dream a reality — to ensure that his daughter, Swapna, completes her education. She is a university student. Nura took part in the liberation struggle against the Pakistan Army. His attitude to life is different. He does not have any regrets over his poverty, rather he enjoys begging as he sings in his mother-tongue Bengali. He feels that Bangladesh would not have been liberated if he had to speak and sing in Urdu: an alien language for him. On the other hand, the Talukder family is rich and well educated. The senior Talukder was a pioneering personality in photojournalism starting from the language movement of 1952 to the 1971 liberation war. These are all now historical documents. But nobody is happy in this family. The senior Talukder tries to implant progressive ideas to his grandchildren because the present generation are not aware at all of this liberation struggle. At the same time, the anti-liberation forces try to exploit the liberation war in their won interests. Niloy — a scion of this family — is in contrast with the poor Swapna, the university student daughter of Nura the beggar. Niloy fell in love with Swapna listening to her songs while preparing for the Bengali New Year celebration. He proposes to her. Swapna tries to convince him that this is rather impossible as they are poles apart. She tells him her parents are almost starving to educate her. Led by impulse, Niloy vows to marry her — saying he would go deep down her heart, explore the dark resonance of her heart, and marry her. But Niloy is defeated before the reality of life: He can never accept the fact that his would-be father-in-law is a street beggar. He escapes from life, escapes from her, fleeing to another country.

Along with the Cathedral of St. Joseph it is the seat of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. It is a contributing property in the Quality Hill neighborhood, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Rev. Benedict Roux arrived in Kansas City in 1833. Two years later he built a church out of logs at Eleventh and Broadway that was named St. John Francis Regis. From 1845 to 1880 the parish was served by the Rev. Bernard Donnelly who was a circuit-riding priest. He had a brick church built in 1857 that was named Immaculate Conception. Cathedral façade on the left of the picture The Diocese of Kansas City was established by Pope Leo XIII in 1880. Bishop John Joseph Hogan selected Immaculate Conception as the cathedral for the new diocese and laid the cornerstone for the present cathedral in 1882. While the interior of the building was incomplete and temporary windows filled the spaces, the first Mass in the church was celebrated on Trinity Sunday in 1883. The Cathedral was built on the highest ground of the city and at 250 feet (76.2 m) it was the tallest structure in Kansas City at the time. During the early years, the parish sold tickets to allowing residents to climb the steps in the tower to see the view. A carillon of eleven bells was placed in the tower in 1895. The bells are named after the following saints: St. Anna, St. Bernard, St. Catherine, St. Cecilia, St. Edward, St. Elizabeth, St. Helen, St. John, St. Mary and St. Thomas. The largest bell, St. Thomas, is rung more than the others. The stained glass windows, created by local artisans at the Kansas City Stained Glass Works Company, were installed in 1912. The windows depict various Biblical scenes and the life of Christ. From 1903 to 1945 the Cathedral operated St. Christopher's Inn, on Main Street, a Single Room Occupancy facility for homeless men. Bishop Edwin V. O’Hara led a major renovation of the cathedral's interior in 1955. On August 29, 1956, Pope Pius XII merged the western part of the Diocese of St. Joseph with the northern part of Diocese of Kansas City to form the Diocese of Kansas City–St. Joseph. The rest of what was the Kansas City Diocese became part of the newly established Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau. As a result, the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph has Co-Cathedrals: the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and the Cathedral of St. Joseph. The copper dome on the cathedral tower started to deteriorate. It was replaced by a new dome, cupola and cross covered in 23-carat gold leaf in an effort led by Bishop John Cody in 1960. A diocesan capital campaign, Gift of Faith, began in 2001 to provide necessary funds for another major renovation and restoration of the cathedral. Bishop Raymond J. Boland dedicated the renewed cathedral on February 23, 2003.

It is located in the immediate vicinity of the Arc de Triomphe, at number 40 Avenue Friedland, in the 8th arrondissement. History In 1923 the Martinez group commissioned the architect Henri Porteau, to build a luxury home in the place of the old private residence of Count Tolstoi. Later on, the residence changed hands and was acquired by the Rothschild family. The Napoléon Bonaparte was opened in 1928 as a \\"hôtel de charme\\" (small distinctive hotel or boutique hotel). Literary figures of the time frequented the hotel regularly. In 1929 the hôtel de charme became a hôtel de luxe (luxury hotel) and reached the grade of \\"petit palace\\". It was then named Napoléon Paris as a reference to its location right by the Arc de Triomphe. In March 2013, the French Agency of Tourist Development classified the hotel as a 5 star hotel. French Agency grants its 5th star to the Napoleon hotel. Since its inauguration, the Napoléon has seen countless celebrities pass through its doors. Among these were Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Salvador Dalí, Errol Flynn, Orson Welles, Miles Davis, Josephine Baker, Ella Fitzgerald, all of whom, as well as many others, signed its Golden Book.

Jean Brody tells that 40 years later, when her husband returned to Paris, he was very surprised to meet the same doorman who recognized him and said: \\"You were here when the war ended, didn't you?” Fratoni was extremely warm towards the Brodys, who were deeply moved. The winner of the Nobel Prize in literature, the Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa, tells about his \\"extraordinary\\" memory of his first trip to Paris, which he won at a literary contest organized by La Nouvelle Revue française: “I stayed at the Napoléon, and there I remember meeting Miss France for 1958, Annie Simplon.” Mario Vargas Llosa, le Prix Nobel enfin, Paris-Match dated October 15, 2010, by Olivier O’Mahony: «I presented one of my stories to a literary contest organized by La revue française.

The manager, a Pole whose name was Mr. Makovski, took us to L’éléphant blanc, a fashinable nightclub, and I danced with her...» A French–Russian fairy tale One story involving the hotel connects Alexander Pavlovitch Kliaguine, a rich Russian businessman and a young Parisian, a student of literature (later to become the baroness de Baubigny). They fell in love instantly. As proof of his love, Kliaguine offered the young student the Napoléon Paris so that she would be able to entertain the high society of the time. The Parisian girl married the rich business man. They had a family and lived at the Napoléon Paris for many years. To this day, the Napoléon Paris continues to be owned by the Kliaguine family. Décor The Napoléon Paris is the only hotel completely decorated with Napoleonic art, and furnished in the Directoire style.

Dictionary of royal lineage of Europe and other countries. Volume 2./March 1890 - 9 October 1925) born Obren Christich was the natural son of King Milan I of Serbia and his Greek mistress Artemisia Hristić (née Joanides). After the regicide of his half brother King Alexander in 1903 George became a claimant to the Serbian throne in opposition to the new king, Peter I Karadordevic before ending his life in obscurity. Birth and family background Although commonly known as George Obrenović he was born in Belgrade as Obren Hristić. Acknowledged by King Milan as his son, he was given the name Obren at birth to underline his kinship to the ruling House of Obrenović. The husband of George’s mother was Milan Hristić, the king’s private secretary and son of the Serbian statesman Filip Hristić. The relationship between the parents of George and the fact his mother was living in the Royal Palace, caused a great scandal and resulted in Queen Natalie fleeing Belgrade with her son Crown Prince Alexander for Wiesbaden in the German Empire. His mother’s husband was subsequently removed from his position as private secretary and sent abroad as Serbian Minister to Berlin on condition his wife stays in Belgrade. This appointment fell through however after the Berlin court made it clear he was unwelcome so he was instead sent to Rome. Although King Milan had given a written promise of marriage to Artemisia his attempts to divorce Queen Natalie were opposed by Michael, the Metropolitan of Belgrade. Eventually both of George’s parents secured divorces from their respective spouses. Five months after his divorce on 6 March 1889 King Milan abdicated from the Serbian throne angering George’s mother. After eventually growing tired of ex-King Milan’s demands for money from her, Artemisa took George to live in Constantinople where her father lived and had acquired substantial wealth first as a landscape gardener and architect to the Ottoman sultan and later in Banking. Ex-King Milan then broke off his promise of marriage and turned instead to the Serbian government for financial assistance and was eventually even reconciled with his ex-wife Queen Natalie on 8 March 1893. Serbian pretender With the breakdown of the relationship of his parents George was raised in a privileged environment by his mother in Constantinople. Following the death in 1901 of his father in exile in Vienna, George’s life changed. Some of his late father’s friends who were appalled by his half brother King Alexander’s treatment of King Milan took an interest in him as a possible candidate for the Serbian throne. One friend, the Hungarian count Eugene Zichy, assumed the role of his guardian. Count Eugene generally treated him as his own son and attempted to get the agreement of Emperor Franz Joseph I to enrol George in the Theresian Military Academy. However, as his pretensions to the Serbian throne were not viewed favourably in Vienna the emperor refused to allow his enrolment. Although the natural son of King Milan and even though his half brother and his consort Queen Draga were without an heir George was not seen by his half brother as a possible successor to the throne. Instead the queens brother Nikodije Lunjevica and Prince Mirko of Montenegro, who was married to Natalija Konstantinović (granddaughter of Princess Anka Obrenović) were talked of as being named the heir. After the regicide of his half brother King Alexander and his consort Queen Draga in 1903 the throne of Serbia was offered to Prince Peter Karageorgevich whose family had a decades long feud with the Obrenović’s over the throne. As the sole male line descendant of the Obrenović’s, George’s guardian Count Eugene claimed that his father King Milan had legally adopted him and as such this was enough to legitimise him, and his claims to the throne and make him the heir to his father and half brother. George had support within Serbia in the aftermath of the regicide with his supporters posting proclamations in Belgrade and fighting with supporters of the newly elected king, Peter Karageorgevich. Although there were reports that George and his mother were to cross over into Serbia nothing came of this and the Ottoman sultan advised his mother that he should be kept off the streets over fears that he would be assassinated. In 1906, three years after the death of his half brother and the accession of King Peter Karageorgevich, George made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the throne of Serbia. In June while studying in Klausenburg, Hungary a dispute in a coffee shop led to a duel with swords being fought between George and a university student. Although he survived the duel he came off worse sustaining injuries to his head, shoulder and breast. He suffered a further blow at the end of that year when his guardian Count Eugene Zichy died on Boxing Day leaving George little in his will having used his own money to support his pretensions, as King Milan had left nothing to his son. All was not lost however as he still had a large inheritance to look forward to from his grandfather in Constantinople. Fall into obscurity Back in the Ottoman capital in February 1907 George survived an assassination attempt when a man wielding a dagger attempted to stab him in his chest, however he escaped with just a scratch after the dagger hit a thick pocket book he was carrying. Five months later in July 1907 a bomb went off outside the US Embassy in Constantinople. As George lived in a house adjoining the embassy word spread that it was an assassination attempt by agents of King Peter Karageorgevich. This explanation for the bombing was met with some scepticism and viewed by some as an attempt to use the explosion to keep George in the public eye. The following month it was reported that he had attempted to take his own life after the Ottoman authorities had refused to allow him to assume the surname Obrenović. There may however have been other issues on his mind as an investigation into the bombing concluded that George had set it up himself to make it look like an attempt on his life. As a result, he was expelled from Turkey by the Sultan. The discovery also cost George his inheritance from his grandfather who was furious at his grandson's actions and wrote him out of his will. His grandfather died later that year before any chance for reconciliation could ever take place. Now banished from Turkey George made his way to Paris before heading to Austria-Hungary where he received some support from his late father’s friends who saw the potential that he may one day ascend the Serbian throne. To help boost his finances failed attempts were also made to secure a rich wife from Austria-Hungary or America for him. When the support came to an end he largely disappeared from view travelling around Europe and falling into debt. Eventually he fell into comparative poverty and tried his hand at a number of different jobs to survive. After his attempt to work in the Austro-Hungarian state ministries failed due to his lack of qualifications, he worked at various jobs such as a stable boy and professional jockey before trying his hand at singing in cafés and on stage, until he was forced to abandon that career by the police due to the fact he had been billing himself as a prince. He then went on to work as a waiter, and a porter in sleeping cars on the Orient Express. His name reappeared in connection to his old pretensions during World War I when it was falsely reported in January 1916 that he had been proclaimed King of Serbia by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians. George later went on to become a writer, however the only book he ever wrote, which was about the life of his father King Milan, was suppressed by the Serbian government. George Obrenović died penniless in a Hungarian poorhouse on 9 October 1925. Possible descendants According to a 2003 article by the Serbian media company Novosti AD, George had a son called Stefan who served as a cavalry captain in the French Army. Stefan in turn had a son named Panta (Panka) Obrenović (also known as Mark Eme) who served as chairman of the \\"Fund Obrenović\\" until his death in Paris in early 2002.

He is sometimes considered an usurper. Life 16th-century Greek sources show an extended bias against Pachomius: he is labeled as \\"dissolute\\" by Pseudo-Dorotheos and Leontios Eustrakios stated that he \\"inflicted immeasurable grief upon the Christians\\". Pachomius was native of Lesbos. He was a man of great education, a scholar, and he served as a teacher of philosophy and mathematics of Sultan Mehmed III. Around 1580 he became rector of the Patriarchal Church in Constantinople. On about 1583 or 1584, thanks to the support of his brother, who was a wealthy merchant, he bought his election to the Metropolitanate of Caesarea. However, Patriarch Jeremias II Tranos, who as Patriarch had the right to validate any Metropolitan's appointment, refused to confirm and consecrate him. Pachomius led a group of Greek prelates who tried to overthrow Jeremias, accusing the latter of having supported a Greek uprising against the Ottoman Empire, to have baptized a Muslim and to be in correspondence with the Papacy. Jeremias II was arrested and beaten, and three trials followed: the first charge was proven false, but the last resulted in his deposition on 22 February 1584. With a personal decision Sultan Mehmed III appointed Pachomius as Patriarch of Constantinople. The appointment was due not only to Pachomius's personal relationship with the Sultan, but also to a promise to increase the annual tax paid by the Church to the Ottoman state. During Pachomius' patriarchate, a synod was held in Constantinople with the participation of Patriarch Sophronius IV of Jerusalem, which condemned the Gregorian calendar and exiled the former Patriarch Jeremias II, whom it charged not to have been opposed enough to the new calendar. Same bishops tried to overthrow Pachomius, offering to Sultan Murad III the great amount of 40,000 florins. The Sultan however received the same amount from friends of Pachomius and kept him in place. Pachomius remained unpopular with most of his flock; when he was due to pay the increased annual gift he had promised to the Sultan, he tried to collect it from the Orthodox faithful, who refused their help. To obtain money Pachomius sold church properties, but he nevertheless failed to gather the promised amount. Pachomius also failed to address the ongoing polemic launched against him by the deacon of Jeremias II, Nikephoros, who considered his election as illegal. Finally Pachomius was deposed by a meeting of prelates on 26 or 27 February 1585, and the Sultan did not oppose to the synodal decision. Pachomius was succeeded by Theoleptus II, who had leagued with him in overthrowing Jeremias the year before. A year later Pachomius was acquitted of the charges and was sent to Egypt and Cyprus to collect donations. During his travel Pachomius was charged of immoral behavior, and he returned to Constantinople, where he worked and continued to pose problems. He was finally exiled in Wallachia, where he died.

At the time, the location was intended to be the permanent home for the Saskatoon Farmers’ Market, but City of Saskatoon planning decisions necessitated a move.

Along with the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Kansas City, Missouri it is the seat of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. The Cathedral Church, rectory and convent are all contributing properties to the Cathedral Hill Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. The school building and the auditorium do not contribute to the historical nature of the district. History =St. Joseph Parish= Joseph Robidoux settled the area that is now the city of St. Joseph in 1826. The Rev. Pierre- Jean De Smet, SJ was the first priest to visit the area in 1838. He met with Robidoux and expressed his desire to establish a chapel in his settlement. The first Mass in the settlement was said by another Jesuit missionary the same year in Robidoux's log house. The Jesuits continued to visit the area between 1838 and 1845. Robidoux platted the town of St. Joseph in 1843. The Rev. Thomas Scanlan arrived in St. Joseph of October 15, 1845, and began plans to build a church. He had a brick church built on the northeast corner of Fifth and Felix Streets. Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick of St. Louis dedicated the church, named St. Joseph's Church, on June 17, 1847. The parish had 20 families at the time. Father Scanlan died in 1860 and was replaced by the Rev. John Hennessy who served the parish until he was named first Bishop of Dubuque in 1893. =Cathedral of St. Joseph= On March 3, 1868 Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of St. Joseph. St. Joseph's Church became the new diocese's cathedral. Bishop John J. Hogan bought property at the corner of Tenth and Isadore Streets to build the present cathedral. The cornerstone was laid on September 12, 1869. The construction of the cathedral was slow due to continuing budget shortfalls. This may have been partly due to the Panic of 1873. Several prominent parishioners connected with the St. Joseph Improvement Company sponsored a raffle of real estate in the cathedral neighborhood to raise funds. The raffle involved 60 lots valued between $200 to $500, with tickets offered at $3 each. Ticket sales were slower than expected and the drawing was delayed from November 22, 1870 to April 10, 1871. The cathedral was not finished according to its original designs. When the first Mass was celebrated on March 17, 1871, the interior had yet to be plastered and the stained glass windows were not installed and construction continued to 1883. The old church was eventually demolished and the property was sold with the proceeds helping fund construction of the new cathedral. The Rev. Ignatius Conrad, O.S.B became the Rector in 1876 and served the parish until he was named the Abbot of Subiaco Abbey in Subiaco, Arkansas. The rectory was built in 1893, when the Rev. Andrew Newman was rector. The parish's priest up to this time had lived in an apartment in the church. The rectory was also used as the chancery for the diocese. Bishop Maurice F. Burke oversaw the renovation of the cathedral in 1900. The two towers were built as was a portico entrance according to the original plans. In 1924, the Rev. Leo Ruggle came to the cathedral as associate pastor. He was the diocesan chancellor from 1926–1936, served as the Rector from 1937–1964 and then became Rector-emeritus until his death in 1984. He was the Diocesan Administrator from 1961-1962. A year before he died the renovated church basement was named in his honor. On August 29, 1956, Pope Pius XII merged the Diocese of St. Joseph with the Diocese of Kansas City to form the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph. The eastern half of the St. Joseph Diocese became part of the newly established Diocese of Jefferson City and the southern half of the Diocese of Kansas City became part of the newly established Diocese of Springfield Cape Girardeau. The Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph has Co-Cathedrals: The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Kansas City and the Cathedral of St. Joseph. The Cathedral of St. Joseph was renovated from 1969-1970 following the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Other renovations were completed in 1981 and 1995. The parish opened a food pantry in the 1980s. Catholic schools In the 1850s Religious of the Sacred Heart and the Christian Brothers came to St. Joseph and opened schools. The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul came to St. Joseph in 1869 and began to operate a school and a hospital. From 1891 to the 1980s they operated St. Joseph's Hospital. The Religious of the Sacred Heart opened St. Joseph's first parochial school in 1901. They were replaced by the Benedictine Sisters of Mt. St. Scholastica in 1920. Christian Brothers High School, now Bode Middle School, was built during the episcopate of Bishop Francis Gilfillan. The school building was renovated in 1954 and a combination gymnasium and auditorium was built in 1958. It was named in honor of Msgr. Charles Nowland. Pre-school was added in 1981. By the late 1980s the faculty was composed of all lay people. The convent was turned into a day care center and now houses the Cathedral Early Childhood Center. Architecture The Cathedral is a brick masonry building designed in the Romanesque Revival style by Patrick F. Meagher. He would later design the Buchanan County Courthouse. It features a transept, two corner towers on the main façade with pyramidal roofs. The narthex, featuring three entrance doors was added in 1956. The rectory is a three–story brick structure. \\"The facade features three-story, projecting box bay and side, two- story, projecting polygonal bays.\\" The L-shaped porch is supported by Romanesque-style columns. The auditorium features Art Deco elements on its design from the 1950s. The convent is influenced by the Colonial Revival style. It features a hipped roof and an entrance portico with Doric columns and capitals. The school building is similar in style with the convent. It is a two-story brick building that at-one-time had a third floor that has since been removed.

This is problematic because non-intervention rejects the common-assertion of R2P, that state sovereignty cannot justify non-action in the face of genocide or mass atrocity.International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, The Responsibility to Protect: Report of the ICISS (International Development Research Centre Ottawa, 2001).

Chinese reticence to forcible intervention can be traced back to its historical experiences during the First and Second Opium Wars of the nineteenth century, semi-colonization and the Cold War alongside the continued motivations of the Chinese government to maintain dominance over the regions of Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan.Shuisheng Zhao \\"Chinese Pragmatic Nationalism: Is it Manageable?\\" (2005) 29 The Washington Quarterly 131. China have also advocated the principles of state sovereignty and non-intervention to obstruct US-hegemonic expansion.: Zhang Li “A Few Issues Concerning International Intervention” (paper presented at the International Intervention and State Sovereignty Conference, Beijing, 14–15 January 2002); Lu Gang “Preventative Diplomacy and State Sovereignty” (paper presented at the Preventative Diplomacy and State Sovereignty workshop, Shanghai, 8 January 2002); Guo Xuetang “Presentation for Conference on ‘Preventative Diplomacy and State Sovereignty,’” Shanghai, 8 January 2002.

However, this clashes statements made by Ban Ki-moon, that R2P must be integrated into all cultures \\"without hesitation or condition,\\" to reflect its universality.Ban Ki-moon, Implementing the Responsibility to Protect: Report of the Secretary- General UN GOAR, 63rd sess, A/63/677 (2009) at [20].

China has also provided a strong regional dimension to its implementation of R2P, see for example the cases of Darfur and Myanmar.Jochen Prantl and Ryoko Nakano Global Norm Diffusion in East Asia: How China and Japan Implement the Responsibility to Protect (2011, Centre for Non- Traditional Security Studies, Singapore) at 2. = Darfur = China thwarted proposed Security Council resolutions aimed at ending the atrocities that had already claimed nearly 300,000 civilian lives in Darfur.CNN News “U.N.: 100,000 more dead in Darfur than reported” CNN News (22 April 2008), available here . There were two resolutions involved:  Resolution 1672  This sought to impose travel and financial sanctions on four alleged war criminals, impeding the peace process.

Resolution 1706  This sought to place peacekeepers in the region and was the first reference to R2P in Resolution in relation to a specific conflict.

China believed this could derail progress at implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.Security Council Resolution 1706 United Nations Security Council Verbatim Records S/PV.5519 (2006) at 5.

On July 5, 2017, her achievements in Science, and developing and promoting programs to enhance diversity in Science were recognized in the annual Tynwald Day Ceremony, by the Isle of Man Government. She attended the University College of Swansea, from which she graduated with a first class honours degree in biochemistry. A graduate scholarship took her to the United States to study journalism at the University of Idaho for her master's studies. Local reporting resulted in her being awarded a Sigma Delta Chi Award for science journalism. She completed her PhD in neuroscience at Penn State University in 1991. She completed postdoctoral training fellowships in neuroscience and neuropathology at the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, before taking up a professorial position at the University of British Columbia. In addition to her appointments in zoology (Faculty of Science) and psychiatry (Faculty of Medicine), Roskams is also a professor in the Dept of Neurosurgery at the University of Washington. Roskams also served as an associate dean.  Research  Currently a recognized leader in Brain Big Data and Open Data sharing, Roskams previously made significant contributions to the field of regeneration and epigenetics, focusing on how cells interact during brain development. She researched how neural stem cells and specialized glia in the brain can aid in promoting nervous system development and repair. In 2008, she collaborated with the Allen Institute for Brain Science to bring together a group of experts to produce an annotated gene expression map of the spinal cord, which is now freely used by researchers across the world as a genetic map for discovery. Between 1999 and 2014, the Roskams Lab received more than $1.7 million in funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Her study of olfactory ensheathing glia has been funded by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. In 2011, her lab identified radial glial cells in the periphery of the adult spinal cord. As of 2015, Roskams and the Allen Institute for Brain Science were working on a project known as BigNeuron. This effort joins computer programmers and scientists for \\"hackathons\\" in which participants test computer algorithms that could allow for the automated analysis of neurons. Dr Roskams is also thecCo-developer of Mozak - a NSF/NIH-funded game-based approach to engaging \\"citizen scientists\\" in analyzing large-scale brain data, and currently leads analytics and training initiatives for the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP). As a former advisor to the US BRAIN initiative and the Obama White House, she contributed to the development of the 21st Century Cures act, and served from 2014-2016 as an advisor to Governor Jay Inslee in Life Sciences and Global Health. In 2016, she then co-founded the non-profit Cascadia Data Innovations - catalyzing and enabling enhanced collaboration across the non-profit, academic and tech sectors in Seattle and Vancouver to tackle shared challenges in health big data. Roskams is on the founding executive of the Global Brain Consortium, and is actively engaged in advising a number of international projects fostering collaboration to drive discovery from shared brain data. An outspoken proponent of women in science, Roskams has received multiple recognitions for mentorship, and has served on advisories for the National Academy of Sciences in creating more optimal environments to enhance diversity in STEM, training the next generation of neuroscientists, and developing data sharing guidelines for funders of clinical research. Awards In 2013, Roskams received the Bernice Grafstein Award for Outstanding Accomplishments in Mentoring from the Society for Neuroscience. Books and publications She was the co-editor of \\"Genome Analysis: A Lab Manual\\" (ColdSpring Harbor Lab Press) the first definitive guide to analyzing multiple genomes, and Lab Ref, a how-to manual of basic research resources for scientists. That work has been reviewed in publications such as Biochemistry (Moscow) and the Journal of Cell Science. She has also been published in Glia, and in Brain Research. Roskams is on the editorial board of BrainFacts.org.

The loch lies in the South Ayrshire Council Area, Parish of Dalrymple, Scotland. The loch Lindston Farm, plantation and feeder burn. In the 1870s the OS map shows that the loch was circa 200 yards (180 metres) long by 100 yards (90 metres) wide, roughly oval in shape, and of an extent of 1.125ha or 2.78 acres however a section to the south-west had been infilled, possibly with quarrying waste from the nearby abandoned quarries. The loch was fed by burns running down from near Boghall and Balsarroch. =Drainage= The loch's drainage may have begun in the 18th century when Alexander Montgomerie, 10th Earl of Eglinton, was pursuing a number of agricultural improvements on his extensive estates and other landowners followed his example. Some drainage work may have taken place in the 1740s because of the improvements undertaken to provide employment for Irish estate workers during the Irish potato famines of the 1740s and the mid 19th centuries. Many drainage schemes also date to the end of World War I when many soldiers returned en masse to civilian life.MacIntosh, Pages 37 & 39 =Uses= An outflow once ran down towards Dustyhall and joined the Purclewan Burn that powered the mill at Burnton. It is recorded that drainage works were carried out in 1790. Curling matches are recorded at the loch on 15 January 1850 and on 19 December 1844. A curling pond was still recorded in the late 1890s.Curling Pond Sites Retrieved : 13 September 2011 Archaeology Perclewan Mill.

Nelly Kilpatrick When Robert Burns was 15 he met his first young love, Nelly Bone, better known as Nelly Kilpatrick in this part of Ayrshire. Nelly was the daughter of the Purclewan hamlet miller and they met when William Burns hired some extra help to bring in the harvest while they were at nearby Mount Oliphant Farm. It was with Nelly in mind that he wrote his first song \\"Handsome Nell\\" – \\"O once I lov'd a bonnie lass, Aye, and I love her still; And whilst that virtue warms my breast, I'll love my handsome Nell.\\"'' Some years later Burns wrote of this song, saying – \\"I never had the least thought or inclination of turning poet till I got once heartily in love, and then rhyme and song were, in a manner, the spontaneous language of my heart. I remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to this hour I never recollect it but my heart melts, and my blood sallies at the remembrance.\\"The World Burns Club.

History The church was founded in 1721, when the town was first settled. The original wooden meetinghouse was completed in 1723 and replaced on the same site in 1761. The early meetinghouse served not only for public worship but also as a venue for town meetings and other community gatherings. Also, gunpowder and shot were stockpiled there for the defense of the community, and the meetinghouse was the recruiting site for a Continental Army that was formed in Litchfield early in the Revolutionary War. The adjacent church parsonage was built in 1787. =Lyman Beecher= The prominent American preacher Lyman Beecher served the First Congregational Church as its minister from 1810 to 1826. Beecher's fame as a preacher attracted people to the church. Six sermons on intemperance that he delivered in the church in 1814 were widely republished and are considered to have been influential in advancing the cause of temperance. While in Litchfield he also gained widespread attention for his preaching against Unitarianism, which he regarded as heresy. Beecher's eloquence in his opposition to Unitarianism led to his being invited to leave Litchfield in 1826 to serve a church in Boston, where his fame as a preacher grew. =Church building= The current building, constructed in 1829 in the Greek Revival style, is the congregation's third meetinghouse. In 1969, the New York Times called it \\"one of the best examples of early 19th-century church architecture\\" and in 2005 the same newspaper called it \\"a New England icon\\" and \\"one of Connecticut's familiar landmarks.\\" It is described by the National Park Service as the \\"anchor\\" of the Litchfield Historic District, which is a National Historic Landmark. It is also called \\"the best known symbol of Litchfield\\" and is reputed to be the most photographed church building in New England. The 1829 meetinghouse was built after the church had outgrown its 1761 building, due in part to the popularity of Lyman Beecher's preaching. There is no definite record indicating who designed the 1829 church. Five other Congregational churches were built on essentially the same design in the Connecticut towns of Old Lyme (the 1816–17 Old Lyme Congregational Church), Milford (1823), Cheshire (the 1827 First Congregational Church of Cheshire), Southington (1830), and Guilford (the 1830 First Congregational Church of Guilford). All six churches are fronted by Ionic porticos with four fluted columns, the doors of all six churches have the same dimensions, all six steeples are of the same design (described as a \\"four-stage Gibbsian tower and spire\\"); the specific prototype being James Gibbs' St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. All are surmounted by weathervanes that all appear to have been cast from the same mold, and all six churches have twenty-over-twenty double-hung windows. The similarities suggest that some of the building elements may have been prefabricated. The 1829 meetinghouse remained in use for several decades, until its architectural style fell out of favor during the years after the Civil War. Henry Ward Beecher, a leading Congregational minister of the era who had been born in Litchfield during the years when his father was the church's minister, said of the building: \\"There is not a single line or feature in the old building suggesting taste or beauty\\". The building was moved a short distance down the road, without its steeple, to make way for a new church building. The fourth meetinghouse, which was completed in 1873, was a wooden structure in a Victorian Gothic style, with stained-glass windows and dark-colored pews and pulpit furniture. By the early 20th century, church members had lost their fondness for the new building and sought to return the church's third meetinghouse to its original location. In 1929, the meetinghouse that was built in 1873 was razed. In 1930, the third meetinghouse, which had been in use at various times as a dance hall, armory, cinema, gymnasium, and roller skating rink, was reconstructed on its original site and rededicated \\"for the town's use in public worship\\". The church restoration project, done at a cost of $75,000, was part of a colonial revival initiative in Litchfield, in which townspeople also replaced a modern stone tower on the courthouse with a brick tower more consistent with colonial style, painted their houses and shops white, and added black shutters and other Colonial era architectural details to give the community a look reminiscent of 18th-century America. The community effort was inspired by news reports about plans to build a replica of an old English village in a suburb of Chicago; several New York City residents who maintained summer homes in Litchfield resolved to undertake a similar project to restore the town center to a look consistent with its own history. A major restoration project, with an estimated cost of $1.9 million, was undertaken in 2005 to address problems due to serious structural deterioration, as well as to install a sprinkler system and renovate the church parsonage. A Save America's Treasures grant in the amount of $200,000 was awarded in 2004 to assist with the project. Affiliation The church was founded in the Congregationalist tradition. Since 1960, the congregation has been affiliated with the United Church of Christ.

The school was planned for as part of a 1960s urban renewal project. It was designed as a large comprehensive high school to serve 3000 students in grades 9 through 12. 25% of the school's capacity was reserved for an elite math and science magnet program that would draw students from throughout the city. The remaining 75% was for students from the school's local catchment area. In addition to the magnet program, the school's educational program included a wide range of courses from college prep to vocational education subjects like industrial arts and home economics. The school's building was designed by H2L2 and included advanced educational, vocational, and recreational facilities, on a 14-acre urban campus. Despite the best intentions of its planners, the school failed to prosper. Enrollment in 2010–2011 was 637 students. That same year, it became a Promise Academy, offering extra enrichment as well as replenishing the staff to accommodate a better education for all students. The school was one of 23 School District of Philadelphia schools closed in 2013 by the School Reform Commission. The building was demolished in 2015 as part of a $1B redevelopment project. Background Between the early 1900s and the 1960s, the area where this school was built was known as Black Bottom or simply \\"the bottom\\". As the name suggests, the area was primarily populated by poor African Americans. In contrast, the largely white and affluent University of Pennsylvania (Penn) was located nearby. In 1959, Penn led a group of local institutions to create the West Philadelphia Corporation (WPC), which had the legal power to take land under eminent domain and the financial and political support of the local and federal governments. The WPC developed plans to clear most of Black Bottom and build a science center and a high school. Naturally, this led to conflict with the existing residents, and the plans were significantly revised. Ultimately the neighborhood was razed for redevelopment. Estimates of the number of displaced people vary from 2,500 to 10,000. The name \\"University City\\" was widely used in this area after these and other major redevelopment efforts.  Planning  On April 30, 1966, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it had approved a grant of almost $13 billion to the Redevelopment Authority RDA for the Redevelopment of Urban Societies; the RDA is a law to save residential structures. The University City Science Center submitted development and marketing proposals to the RDA in July 1965, and the City Council held a public hearing on October 14, 1965 to discuss these plans. Due to this new development, 250 citizens living in the West Philadelphia area formed a Citizens Committee of University City, Area3. They protested against the government taking homes from West Philadelphia to build science centers and other construction that benefitted the universities in the area (University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University). As the issue became more and more public, students and faculty members of the universities in the area got involved in protests with the community against the government. The key, they said, was collaboration. The people in the center wanted to create a high school that reflected new approaches to education. ES'70 Cycle I (An Educational System for the Seventies) was created to help change overcrowding, low test scores, and generally improve Philadelphia's high schools. Through this system, three new high schools were built, reflecting a traditional comprehensive school challenging the new advances of technology in the 70s. The district, community, and universities of West Philadelphia argued to make UCHS a math and science magnet school. The most gifted (mostly white students at the time) students were eligible to attend. UCHS was created to represent a new approach to learning in urban education, new in the sense that it would utilize the latest education, technology, and community resources to provide a meaningful individual program for each student, regardless of race or economic background. It aimed to create a college-based environment before entering college.  Early struggles  UCHS 1971 cornerstone, painted in the school colors UCHS' first day of school was Dec, 10, 1972. It was opened as a regular high school (not the original mission) because the curriculum and teachers were not ready, and construction of the school was continuously delayed, pushing the opening date to December. The first cohort of students at UCHS were exclusively ninth graders, and the school expanded grade by grade until it reached its full 9-12 grade range in 1976. The building was designed for a capacity of 3,000 students, but on the first day of school only a few hundred students had been identified by their sending schools. Since other high schools in West Philadelphia were overcrowded, by February the school numbers rose as new students were transferred to University City High School. The school's mission was lost due to gang-related crimes. There was no structure or discipline from the beginning, allowing the students to get out of control. The initial mission of the school was implemented with the creation in 1973 of the Individualized Study Program (ISP) as an alternative school program open to students from throughout Philadelphia. This program only lasted through the end of the 1976-77 school year, when the School District of Philadelphia suspended funding for ISP and most other alternative schools in the city. During the 1980s, University City High School was known for its racial clashes and tension among black and Asian students. There were incidents of stabbings and massive brawls inside and outside the school grounds. Drug abuse also increased. According to the \\"Standing up for their school and neighborhood\\" article written by Martha Woodall on February 3, 1986, \\"UCHS are going to lose more people in one year from drug overdoses than all the lynchings in history.\\" In 1994, school security was increased to help reduce the violence. School officials also created a single lunch period at the end of the day, brought in Chicago police officers to speak to the students about violence, and started a peer mediation/conflict resolution program.  Demise  An empty third floor classroom in June 2013 (after the school was closed). A sign reads: \\"ALL THE PIECES MATTER.\\" During the 21st century, University City High school struggled to keep up with the required test scores of the Philadelphia school district system. In 2009-2010 it became a Promise Academy school. An additional hour was implemented to support academic and social enrichment. While other high schools were released at 3pm, UCHS Promise Academy students left school at 4pm. The extra hour was in place so that students could participate in a sports or club as well as receive additional help or tutoring from staff to ensure students were well-rounded and successful. There were a handful of community groups and organizations that provided assistance to the school through the change initiative. The empty lot in 2016, where UCHS once stood The Student Success Center played a huge role in providing and coordinating services to each student. The main focus of SSC was to provide students with academic and social advancement. Located in the basement of UCHS, the SSC Staff provided resources to help students achieve their post- secondary education goals. Students from all grades were provided with help with career planning, the college planning and application process, internships, jobs, academic support, and college decisions and visits. Throughout the academic school year, student interns from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University partnered with the SSC to provide academic resources to students. On March 7, 2013, the Philadelphia School Reform Commission voted to close University City High School. Displaced students were enrolled in Paul Robeson High School for Human Services, Microsoft's School of the Future, and Benjamin Franklin High School.

Students developed websites for local businesses within the University City area and the program gained national recognition from USA Today in 1998. UC Graphics & Multimedia was one of the first school programs of its kind to be started in America. Some notable clients include The University of Pennsylvania, Habitat for Humanity, and the Paul Robeson House.

The RSBI is defined as the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT). People on a ventilator who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly (high frequency) and shallowly (low tidal volume), and will therefore have a high RSBI.  Equation  RSBI = \\\\frac{f}{V_T}  Measurement  Measurement is done with a handheld spirometer attached to the endotracheal tube while a patient breathes room air for one minute without any ventilator assistance.  Example  As an example, a patient who has a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min and an average tidal volume of 250 mL/breath has an RSBI = (25 breaths/min)/(0.25 L) = 100 breaths/min/L. In contrast, the 'average' patient breathing 12 breaths/min, with a tidal volume of 420 mL/breath (70kg x 6 mL/kg) would have an RSBI = (12 breaths/min)/(.420 L) = 28 breaths/min/L. The higher the RSBI, the more distressed the patient is generally considered to be.  History  The concept was introduced in a 1991 paper by physicians from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Stritch School of Medicine at Loyola University in Chicago.  Weaning readiness  A RSBI score of less than 65 indicating a relatively low respiratory rate compared to tidal volume is generally considered as an indication of weaning readiness. A patient with a rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) of less than 105 has an approximately 80% chance of being successfully extubated, whereas an RSBI of greater than 105 virtually guarantees weaning failure. Other criteria that have been suggested for a successful weaning trial include (1) the ability to tolerate a Spontaneous breathing trial for 30 minutes (in most patients, SBT failure will occur within approximately 20 minutes), (2) maintain a respiration rate of less than 35/min, and (3) keep an oxygen saturation of 90% without arrhythmias; sudden increases in heart rate and blood pressure; or development of respiratory distress, diaphoresis, or anxiety. Once the SBT is tolerated, the ability to clear secretions, a decreasing secretion burden, and a patent upper airway are other criteria that should be met to increase extubation success. Patients should be assessed daily for their readiness to be weaned from mechanical ventilation by withdrawing sedation and performing a spontaneous breathing trial.

Synopsis The author of this book, Dr. H.K. Vedavyasachar, has done an illuminatingly scientific and historical study of the whole range of Dasa Sahitya and its thoughts in a scholarly and systematic manner. The distinction of this work lies in the fact that for the first time a study has been done (on Dasa Sahitya) in relation to the history of religion, philosophy and mysticism in general, - as they developed in different parts of the world and not merely as an offshoot of a prejudiced sect of Brahmanism. The reader of this book gets a fair glimpse into the cravings (or philosophical enquiries) of the human spirit through ages; the way such enquiries coursed through historic times in ancient Sumeria, Assyria, Egypt, Greece and Israel and later in Europe and Arabia and found its fulfilment in the long course of the development of Vedic thought in Hinduism, in the north and south of India through successive phases of Vedic, non-Vedic, Puranic and Darsanic thought. The study in this book is divided into two major parts. * History of Religions * Detailed analysis of Haridasas of Karnataka Major Parts History of Religions The first part is devoted to the study of the history of the religion as such. Religion is the governing principle of civilized life. The author inquires into its meaning, reason for its existence and its relation to science, and politics, into the values and sanctions of religion, the different aspects of the manifestations of the religious spirit among the great religions of the world and their variations. The author faces the challenge to religion brought up by Subjectivism, Rationalism, Logical Positivism, Dialectical Materialism and other ways of thinking and shows how none of them is in a position to dismiss religion and the religious spirit and instinct from our midst or disprove their authenticity. He supports his views with relevant citations from the writings of eminent thinkers like Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, Locke, Berkeley and others. He has quoted extensively from Sanskrit philosophical classics like the words of Shankaracharyaru, Madhwacharyaru, Jayateertharu, Vyasarayaru, Udayanacharyaru, Sri Raghavendra Swamigalu and others to give point to his arguments. The major topics covered in the first part are as below: * ಧರ್ಮದ ಅವಶ್ಯಕತೆ (Necessity of Religion) * ಧರ್ಮಗಳ ಇತಿವೃತ್ತ (History of Religion) * ವೈದಿಕ ಧರ್ಮದ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಪ್ರಮೇಯಗಳು (Prime Subject of Vedic religion ) * ಭಕ್ತಿಯ ಪ್ರಮುಖ ವಿವೇಚನೆ (Insight into Devotion) * ಯೋಗ (Mysticism) * ಭಾರತದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಕ್ತಿ (Devotional movement in India) Detailed analysis of Haridasas of Karnataka Author: Dr.H.K.Vedavyasachar. In the second part, we have the detailed treatment of the Haridasas of Karnataka led by Sri Madhwacharyaru. The part played by his distinguished successors like Narahariteertharu, Sripadarajaru, Vyasarayaru, Vadirajaru, Purandaradasaru, Kanakadasaru, Vijayeendrateertharu, Kumara Vyasaru, Vaikunthadasaru, Sri Raghavendra Swamigalu, Prasanna Venkatesharu, Vijayadasaru, Giriyamma, Varadendrateertharu, Vyasatatvagna Yatigalu, Mohanadasaru, Gopaladasaru, Jagannathadasaru, Bhagannadasaru and Praneshadasaru in the development of the Bhakti-Siddhantha through Haridasa Sahitya is sketched with an unerring eye for significant details. The major topics covered in the second part are as below: Kannada Haridasaru * ಹರಿದಾಸರ ಪರಿಚಯ (Introduction to Haridasas) ** ಆರಂಭಕಾಲ (Birth of Haridasa Movement) ** ಉನ್ನತಿಕಾಲ (The Rise of Haridasa Movement) ** ವಿಸ್ತಾರಕಾಲ (The Spread of Haridasa Movement) ** ಅವನತಿಕಾಲ (The decline of Haridasa Movement) * ಹರಿಯ ವಿಶೇಷ ಮಹಿಮೆಗಳು (Lord Vishnu's Divine Powers) * ಭಗವಂತನ ಸೃಷ್ಟಿ ವೈಚಿತ್ರ್ಯ (Wonders in God's Creation) * ತಾರತಮ್ಯ (Hierarchy) * ಹರಿದಾಸರ ಪ್ರಶಂಸೆ (A tribute to Haridasas) * ಹರಿದಾಸರ ಗ್ರಂಥಗಳು (Great literatures of Haridasas) * ಹರಿದಾಸರು ಮತ್ತು ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ ಸಂಗೀತವು (the relationship between Haridasa literature and Carnatic music) Striking Feature The author has provided the readers a peep into the devotional enthusiasm of the Vyshnava Mystics of Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The author has given short but lucid accounts of the works of each of the great Dasas mentioned above and brought out literary and philosophical excellences of their writings. One striking feature of Dr. Vedavyasachar's work is the bold step he has taken in including the famous Kannada Mahakavi Kumaravyasa (alias Gadugina Naranappa) in the family of Haridasas. Conclusion From the beginning till the end of this thrilling study of about 500 pages, the young and alert mind of this enterprising scholar and earnest researcher, holds the attention of the reader riveted to the subject, filling him with genuine admiration for the mighty work of social and spiritual rehabilitation of the human spirit that the selfless Haridasas had done for the benefit of the sons and daughters of Karnataka and through them to the whole of humanity.  Publications  Before being published as a book in 1965, the author submitted this as a thesis (\\"Karnatakada Haridasaru\\") and obtained PhD from the University of Bombay in 1954. After this, Parimala Research and Publishing House, Najangud brought out the contents of the thesis as a serial in the magazine Parimala (posthumously for the author). Later on, the same publishing house went on to release the first edition in 1965, second edition in 1992. The third edition in 2005, however, was brought out by Sri Raghavendraswamy Mutt, Mantralayam. The book continues to be used as reference by the students taking Dasa Sahitya exams.

Along with the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Annunciation in Cape Girardeau, Missouri it is the seat of the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau. History Interior =St. Agnes Parish= Catholicism was established in Springfield when Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick of St. Louis sent Father Graham to the area in 1866. He celebrated the first Mass in the city on March 6 in the home of William Dailey, and then went on to establish Immaculate Conception Parish. The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad came through Springfield in 1870 and the number of Irish and German immigrants increased the number of Catholics. The railroad tracks also divided the city and crossing them, especially for school children, was considered dangerous. H.A. and L.S. Meyer bought a house south of the tracks at South and Elm Streets. It became St. Agnes Elementary School. The school opened with an enrollment of 35 children and the Sisters of Loretto as teachers. As the Catholic population increased on the south side, Bishop John Joseph Hogan of Kansas City was petitioned to establish a new parish to serve their needs. St. Agnes Parish was established in 1908. The Rev. Dennis J. O’Driscoll arrived on September 18, and the parish leased the vacant Central Congregational Church for the first year. A new church was dedicated on November 24, 1910, by Bishop Thomas F. Lillis. The school was relocated to the parish property the same year. St. Agnes High School, now Springfield Catholic High School, was established in 1916. The stained glass windows of Our Lady of the Lillies and Saint Agnes were created by Stanley Uthwatt and Bernard Schahuber in 1921. In 1935, a fire in the basement of the church building destroyed the wood floor and a new concrete floor was installed. A new high school building was constructed in 1938. During World War II, the old high school building was used as a U.S.O. Center. After the war, it was used as a parish recreation center before it was torn down. The Solemn High Mass of Christmas in 1954 from St. Agnes was the first televised religious service from a church on Springfield. =St. Agnes Cathedral= In 1956, Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Springfield- Cape Girardeau. St. Agnes was chosen as the new diocesan cathedral and St. Mary of the Annunciation in Cape Girardeau was chosen as the co-cathedral. St. Louis Auxiliary Bishop Charles Herman Helmsing was chosen as the diocese’s first bishop, and he was installed in St. Agnes Cathedral on November 28. The present elementary school building was constructed in 1958. St. Agnes Chapel was added to the cathedral in 1986 when the church building underwent a major renovation. The same year, the old elementary building was torn down. Pastors/Rectors The following priests have served St. Agnes Parish as Pastor and as Cathedral Rector after 1956: *Rev. Dennis J.

Life  Silvius was the son of Duke Julius Frederick of Württemberg-Weiltingen and Anna Sabina of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. In 1638, he participated in the army of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar besieging Breisach. On 1 May 1647, he married in Oels Elisabeth Marie, Duchess of Oels, whose father, Duke Charles Frederick I died a few weeks later. Since Charles Frederick was the last reigning Duke of Oels, the Duchy fell to the Crown of Bohemia as a vacant fief. Emperor Ferdinand III, in his capacity as King of Bohemia, inherited the Duchy. After lengthy negotiations, Silvius Nimrod was invested on 15 December 1648 in Vienna with the Duchy of Oels, in exchange for and the Moravian Lordship of Jevišovice. Silvius Nimrod then began rebuilding the Duchy, which had suffered during the Thirty Years' War. He focused on education and the Church. In 1652, he founded the Order of the Skull, which existed until the 19th century. Angelus Silesius was his court physician from 1647 to 1652. Matthäus Apelt was until 1639 his ducal councillor and court music director. Silvius Nimrod died of a stroke on 26 April 1664, during a visit to Brzezinka. In accordance with his last will and testament, Duke Christian of Liegnitz-Brieg took up the guardianship of Silvius Nimrod's underage children. To prevent an imperial guardianship, which would probably imply a Catholic education, Christian sent the young princes to Tübingen, where they studied at the Collegium illustre.Norbert Conrads: Bildungswege zwischen Schlesien und Wien, in: Schlesien in der Frühmoderne: Zur politischen und geistigen Kultur eines habsburgischen Landes, in the series: Neue Forschungen zur schlesischen Geschichte, ed. by Joachim Bahlcke, Weimar, 2009, , p. 186 ff  Marriage and issue  Silvius married on 1 May 1647 in Oels Elisabeth Marie, Duchess of Oels (1625-1686).

The cause of the War of the Limburg Succession was the death of Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg in 1280, and his only daughter Ermengarde of Limburg in 1283. Waleran IV had no sons and Ermengarde had no children. Ermergarde had married Reginald I of Guelders, who now claimed the Duchy of Limburg. However, Waleran's nephew Adolf VIII of Berg, son of his elder brother Adolf VII of Berg, also claimed the Duchy. Unable to assert his claims, he sold them in 1283 to the mighty John I, Duke of Brabant. Between 1283 and 1288, several smaller confrontations occurred between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archbishop of Cologne and ruler of the Electorate of Cologne, traditional enemy of the Duke of Brabant, forged an alliance with Reginald I, joined by Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Luxembourg, Lord of Ligny, as well as by Adolf, King of Germany. On the other side the Counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg, and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg. The citizens of the City of Cologne, eager to emancipate themselves from the Archbishop's rule, also joined this alliance. After the decisive Battle of Worringen in 1288, won by Duke John I of Brabant and his allies, the Duchy of Limburg came in the possession of the Duke of Brabant.

The film is noted today for the appearance of Moore, and for Lupino's performance as the aggressively cruel warden. In the 1980s the film became rather popular, Sony Pictures subsequently released it in the boxed set Bad Girls of Film Noir: Volume II along with One Girl's Confession and Over-Exposed. Plot A ruthless superintendent of a prison, Amelia van Zandt, makes life hell for the female inmates. Her rules are rigid and she makes no exceptions. The newcomer Helene Jensen is not a hardened criminal by any means, but a woman convicted of vehicular homicide after she accidentally killed a child. Out of place here, Helene is so distraught that Van Zandt has her placed in solitary confinement, making it even worse. Helene nearly dies. The prison has two wings, one for women, one for men. One of the inmates, Joan Burton, has been illicitly having conjugal relations late at night with her husband, Glen, a convict in the other wing. Now she is expecting a baby, and brutal men's warden Brock issues a stern warning to Van Zandt that she'd better find out how the two prisoners have been arranging these meetings. Joan has the sympathy of the decent Dr. Crane who's in charge of the infirmary and disapproves of the cruel treatment of prisoners he sees. But the heartless Van Zandt goes into a literally homicidal rage while interrogating Joan, beating the pregnant prisoner to death. A protest erupts in the women's cell block, beginning with a hunger strike organized by Joan's cell mate, Brenda Martin, then turning into a full-scale riot. Naive or timid inmates are swept up along with the vicious, veteran ones, and there is much bloodshed before the uprising is quelled.

The temple is believed to be built by the Pandya kings, Achutappa Nayak (1529–1542 CE.), Muthuveerappar and other kings of Ramanthapuram at various times. The temple has been glorified by the hymns of 9th-century saint Manickavasagar and 15th- century saint Arunagirinathar. The temple is considered sacred along the lines of Ramanathapuram, Sethu Madhava Theertham and Lakshmana Theertham. The temple is a prominent tourist destination of Ramanathapuram district. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Mangalanathar, Mangalambigai and Natarajar being the most prominent. The temple houses a tall ancient maragatha Nataraja idol carved out of emerald, being the one of its kind. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., and six yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend thumb As per Hindu legend, once hundreds of rishis (ascetics) performed penance worshipping Shiva. Shiva told the rishis that he would appear in the form of a fireball to acknowledge the penance of Mandothari, the wife of king Ravana in Sri Lanka. Shiva appeared in the form a small child in Ravana's palace. Ravana lifted the beautiful child and there was a small wound out of it. Simultaneously, there was a fireball out of the Agni Theertham (temple tank), which the rishis felt were on account of Shiva attacking Ravana. Out of thousand, 999 killed themselves by falling in the fire, while one of them remained to save the vedic books. Shiva was pleased by the rishi and appeared as Sahasralingam (thousand lingams) for the 999 and one more for himself in the temple. The single rishi was believed to have emerged later as Manickavasgar in his later birth. History thumb Uthira Kosa Mangai is a tiny hamlet. It is considered to be one of the very ancient Hindu temples which Tamil literature describes as \\"Mann Mundhiyo Mangai Mundhiyo?\\" meaning \\"Did the mud (mann) come first or is the Mangai (The Female Deity of the Temple)?\\". This is the place where Siva transferred the secrets of Vedas to Parvati. Uthiram means (upadesam) kosam (secrets) Parvati (Mangai) hence this place is known as Uthira Kosa Mangai. The temple is believed to be built by the Pandya kings. Achutappa Nayak (1529–1542 A.D.), a Hindu ruler of Thanjavur, Muthuveerappar and other kings of Ramanthapuram Sethupathy dynasty have contributed to the temple. The last renovation was carried out by the queen of Ramanthapuram. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture The temple is located 32 km East from Paramakkudi and 17 km west from Ramanathapuram. The temple has a seven-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower). The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Mangalanathar, Mangalambigai and Natarajar being the most prominent. There are separate shrines for Mangalanathar (Shiva) in the form of lingam and Mangalambigai. There is a tall ancient maragatha Nataraja idol carved out of emerald inside the temple. A hall of Saharasralingam has a thousand lingams enshrined in it. At the entrance of the main precinct,the temple features exquisite stone carvings of Yali (mythological dragon), depicted with a rolling stone ball inside its mouth. The granite images of the deities Ganesha (son of Shiva and god of wisdom), Murugan (son of Shiva), Nandi (Representative of all our Souls) and Navagraha (nine planetary deities) are located in the hall leading to the sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Erumbeeswarar has images of Thenmugaparaman (Dakshinamurthy-Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). Worship and festivals The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaiva community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for all the deities in the temple. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. The major festival of the temple are Tirukalyana Vaibhavam (sacred marriage) during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April–May), Vasanthotsavam during Vaigasi (May–June), Pathunal Siva Uthsavam during Aaani (July–August), Annabishekam during Aipasi (October–November), Tiruvathidirai during Margazhi (December–January) and Sivarathri during Masi (February–March). The Tiruvathidirai festival in December attracts a large number of tourists. Religious significance The temple is considered sacred along the lines of Ramanathapuram, Sethu Madhava Theertham and Lakshmana Theertham. The emerald image of Nataraja is anointed with sandal paste round the year except on Tiruvathidirai festival day when special worship is practiced. It is believed that even small vibrations can damage the image and hence no percussion instruments are used during worship practises. The front hall has lingams made of Padigam (spatika), that are anointed with cooked rice every afternoon. As per Hindu legend, Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied with the help of a thazhambu (Pandanus odorifer flower / Screw Pine Flower / Ketaki flower) and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship and all Shiva temples do not use thazhambu during worship practises. This is one such temple where thazhambu is still used for worship practises. This story is found in Shaivaite scriptures and they are considered Thamasic Puranas and are not accepted by majority. So, the supremacy of Shiva exists only for a minority. Manickavasagar, the 9th century Tamil saivite saint poet has revered Mangalanathar and the temple in his verses in Thiruvasakam, compiled as the Eighth Tirumurai. Arunagirinathar, a 15th-century Tamil poet has composed Tamil hymns glorifying Murugan in the temple. As per Hindu legend, Muruga was awarded the Airavata (white elephant) of celestial deity Indra at this place.

Along with St. Agnes Cathedral in Springfield, Missouri it is the seat of the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau. History Plans were made as early as 1858 to establish a parish for Cape Girardeau's German population. The Civil War caused a delay in carrying out the plans. Property was acquired at the corner of Sprigg and William Streets for $650. Ground was broken for the parish church on the Feast of the Annunciation of the Lord, March 25, 1868 and the cornerstone was laid on August 2. The first Mass was celebrated in the church on February 2, 1869. A rectory was built in 1885. In 1891 the church was redecorated and the bells were placed in the tower. The Sisters of St. Francis arrived to teach in the parish school in 1875. Two years later they built a convent on the northwest corner of Sprigg and William Streets. They expanded the building in 1882 and opened St. Francis Hospital. St. Mary's Cemetery was established in 1903. Major renovations of the church occurred in 1954 and 1968. The Magnificat windows were added in 1954. On July 2, 1956 Pope Pius XII established the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau St. Agnes Church in Springfield was named as the new diocese's cathedral and St. Mary as the co-cathedral. The current rectory was built in 1957. St. Vincent De Paul Church became a part of the Cathedral Parish in 1977. St. Vincent's Church was named a chapel of ease at that time. The parish hall was added in 1978 and another renovation of the cathedral's interior occurred in 1985. The steeple was restored and a new organ was installed from 1990-1991. The parish office building was completed in January 2000. Catholic schools St. Mary of the Annunciation Grade School The parish grade school was established in 1875 with the Sisters of St. Francis serving as the faculty. A new school building opened in 1882. The Franciscans were replaced by the School Sisters of Notre Dame in 1903. They continued to teach in the school until 1993. A new convent was built for the Sisters in 1905. The main part of the present grade school building was built in 1912. St. Mary's High School, now Notre Dame High School, was opened in 1925. The front part of the grade school building was built in 1937. Yet another new convent was built in 1955. It is currently used as a youth center.

German and Italian influence in Argentina was strong mainly due to the presence of numerous immigrants from both countries, and Argentina's traditional rivalry with Great Britain furthered the belief that the Argentine government was sympathetic to the German cause. Because of the close ties between Germany and Argentina, the latter stayed neutral for most of World War II, despite internal disputes and pressure from the United States to join the Allies.Galasso, 117–252 However, Argentina eventually gave in to the Allies' pressure, broke relations with the Axis powers on January 26, 1944,Galasso, pp. 194–196 and declared war on March 27, 1945.Galasso, pp. 248–251 History =First years= At the beginning of World War Two, in 1939, Roberto María Ortiz was the president of Argentina. The country was in a period of political conservatism and economic crisis known as the Infamous Decade. The Concordancia was accused of electoral fraud and corruption. The Radical Civic Union was divided between FORJA, a line supporting the deposed radical president Hipólito Yrigoyen, and the official leadership of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, close to the Concordancia. The Socialist Party and the Progressist Democracy were conservative as well. The Communist Party was initially close to the trade unions but gave priority to advancing the interests of the Soviet Union.Galasso, p. 117 The Argentine army was highly Germanophile, an influence that predated both world wars, having been steadily growing since 1904. It did not involve a rejection of democracy but rather an admiration of German military history, which combined with an intense Argentine nationalism influenced the main stance of the army towards the war: maintaining neutrality. The arguments in favor ranged from Argentine military tradition (as the country had been neutral during both World War I and the War of the Pacific), to Anglophobia, and to a rejection of foreign attempts to coerce Argentina into joining a war perceived as a conflict between foreign countries with no Argentine interests at stake. Only a handful of military leaders were actually supporters of Adolf Hitler.Galasso, p. 118 The war resulted in a small boost to the Argentine economy, as imports from Britain was reduced. Thus began a process of import substitution industrialization, which had some antecedents during the Great Depression. This led to a process of internal migration as well, with people living in the countryside or in small villages moving to urban centers.Galasso, pp. 118–119 =Growing divisions= Reactions and stances towards the war became more complex as the conflict developed. The main political parties, newspapers and intellectuals supported the Allies, yet Vice-President Ramón Castillo maintained neutrality. Ortiz, who was ill of diabetes, was unable to serve as president, but did not resign. The position of Argentina vis-à-vis the war generated disputes between them, with Castillo prevailing.Mendelevich, pp. 138-139 The FORJA supported neutrality and saw it as an opportunity to get rid of what it considered British meddling with the Argentine economy. Some Trotskyists promoted the fight against the Third Reich as an early step of an international class struggle. The army and some nationalists supported industrialization and promoted neutrality as a way to oppose the United Kingdom. Plans were made to invade the British-held Falkland Islands, but were never put into operation.Falklands: the Argentine military planned invasion during World War II, Merco Press 14 November 2013 On the other hand, the newspaper El Pampero, financed by the German embassy, supported Hitler.Galasso, p. 133 There is a number of interpretations of Castillo's reasons for staying neutral. One such perspective focuses on the Argentine tradition of neutrality. Others see Castillo as a nationalist, not being influenced by the power structure in Buenos Aires (since he was from Catamarca), so, with the support of the army, he could simply defy the pressure to join the Allies. A similar interpretation considers instead that Castillo simply had no power to go against the wishes of the army, and if he declared war he would be deposed in a military coup. A third point of view considers that the United States was the sole promoter of Argentina's entry into the war, whereas the United Kingdom benefited from Argentine neutrality as it was a major supplier of livestock. This, however, fails to acknowledge the constant requests to declare war from Anglophile factions.Galasso, p. 135 Most likely, it was a combination of the desires of the British diplomacy and the Argentine army, which prevailed over the pro-war factions.Galasso, p. 137 Socialist deputy Enrique Dickmann created a commission in the National Congress to investigate a rumored German attempt to seize Patagonia and then conquer the rest of the country. The conservative deputy Videla Dorna claimed that the real risk was a similar Communist invasion, and FORJA believed that a German invasion was only a potential risk, whereas British dominance of the Argentine economy was a reality.Galasso, pp. 133–134 A diplomatic mission by the British Lord Willingdon arranged commercial treaties whereby Argentina sent thousands of cattle to Britain at no charge, decorated with the Argentine colours and with the phrase \\"good luck\\" written on them. Alvear, El Pampero and FORJA criticised this arrangement, and Arturo Jauretche said that there were Argentine provinces suffering from malnutrition.Galasso, p. 134 ;Pearl Harbor U-37, U-201.Victoria – Historia y Arqueología Marítima The situation changed dramatically after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Washington's subsequent declaration of war upon Japan. The United States wanted every Latin American country to join the Allies in order to generate a continent-wide resistance.Mendelevich, p. 31 The Argentine refusal to comply motivated an embargo and blockade against Argentina.Galasso, pp. 137–138 Castillo did, however, declare a state of emergency after the attack on Pearl Harbor.Mendelevich, p. 142 =Military plots= Castillo's term was due to end in 1944. Initially, it was arranged that Agustín Pedro Justo would run for president for a second time, but after his unexpected death in 1943 Castillo was forced to seek another candidate to propose, finally settling on Robustiano Patrón Costas. The army was neither willing to support the electoral fraud that would be necessary to secure Costas's victory, nor to continue conservative policies, nor to risk Costas breaking the neutrality. A number of generals reacted by creating a secret organization called the United Officers' Group (GOU) in order to oust Castillo from power. Future president Juan Perón was a member of this group but did not support an early coup, recommending instead to postpone the overthrowing of the government until the plotters had developed a plan to make necessary reforms. The coup was to take place close to the elections, should the electoral fraud have been confirmed, but it was instead carried out earlier in response rumors of the possible sacking of the minister of war, Pedro Pablo Ramírez.Galasso, pp. 153–154 It is unknown whether Costas would have maintained neutrality or not. Some weak declarations of support to Britain and his ties with pro-allied factions may suggest instead that had he become president he would have declared war.Galasso, pp. 151–152 The military coup that deposed Castillo took place on 4 June 1943. It is considered the end of the Infamous Decade and the starting point of the Revolution of '43. Arturo Rawson took power as de facto president. The nature of the coup was confusing during its first days: German embassy officials burned their documentation fearing a pro-Allied coup, while the United States embassy considered it a pro-Axis coup.Galasso, pp. 155–158Mendelevich, p. 146 Rawson met with a delegate from the British embassy on 5 June and promised that he would break relations with the Axis powers and declare war within 72 hours. This turn of events enraged the GOU, as did Rawson's choices for his cabinet. A new coup took place, replacing Rawson with Pedro Pablo Ramírez.Galasso, pp. 159-161 Thus, Rawson became the shortest non- interim president in Argentine history.Mendelevich, pp. 144-145 =Revolution of 1943= A newspaper announcing the beginning of the Revolution of '43. The new government proceeded with both progressive and reactionary policies. Maximum prices were established for popular products, rents were reduced, the privileges of the Chadopyff factory were annulled and hospital fees were abolished. On the other hand the authorities intervened trade unions, closed the Communist newspaper La Hora and imposed religious education at schools. Juan Perón and Edelmiro Julián Farrell, hailing from the Ministry of War, fostered better relations between the state and the unions.Galasso, pp. 162–166 The Communist Party aligned itself with the diplomatic policies of the Soviet Union. As a result, it supported neutrality and opposed the British influence in Argentina during the early stages of the war, in line with the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union. The launching of Operation Barbarossa and the consequent Soviet entry in the war changed that attitude. The Communists became pro-war and halted its support for further labour strikes against British factories located in Argentina. This switch redirected workers' support from the Communist Party to Perón and the new government.Galasso, pp. 167–169 As a result, the Communist Party turned against the government, which it viewed as pro-Nazi. Perón countered Communist complaints by declaring that \\"The excuses they seek are very well known. They say we are 'nazis', I declare we are as far from Nazism as from any other foreign ideology. We are only Argentines and want, above all, the common good for Argentines. We do not want any more [electoral] fraud, nor more lies. We do not want that those who do not work live from those who do\\".Galasso, p. 174 The government held diplomatic discussions with the United States, with Argentina requesting aircraft, fuel, ships and military hardware. The Argentine chancellor Segundo Storni argued that, although Argentina refrained from participating in the war, it remained closer to the Allies, sending them food, and that up to then the Axis powers had not taken action against the country to justify a declaration of war. Secretary of State Cordell Hull replied that Argentina was the only Latin American country to not have broken relations with the Axis, that Argentine food was sold at lucrative return, and that United States military hardware was intended for countries already at war, some of which were facing more severe fuel shortages than was Argentina. Storni resigned after this rejection.Galasso, p. 178 The United States took further measures to increase pressure on Argentina. All Argentine companies suspected of having ties with the Axis powers were blacklisted and boycotted, and the supply of newsprint was limited to pro-Allied newspapers. American exports of electronic appliances, chemical substances and oil production infrastructure were halted. The properties of forty-four Argentine companies were seized, and scheduled loans were halted. Hull wanted to weaken the Argentine government or force its resignation. Torn between diplomatic and economic pressure as opposed to an open declaration of war against Argentina, he opted for the former in order to avoid disrupting the supply of food to Britain. Nevertheless, he also saw the situation as a chance for the United States to have a greater influence over Argentina than Britain.Galasso, pp. 193–194 The United States also threatened to accuse Argentina of being involved with the coup of Gualberto Villarroel in Bolivia, and a plot to receive weapons from Germany after the allied refusal, to face the possible threat of invasion either by the United States itself or Brazil acting on their behalf. However, it would be unlikely that Germany would provide such weapons, given their fragile situation in 1944. Ramírez called a new meeting of the GOU, and it was agreed to break diplomatic relations with the Axis powers (albeit without yet a declaration of war) on 26 January 1944. The break in relations generated unrest within the military, and Ramírez considered removing both the influential Farrell and Perón from the government. However, their faction discovered Ramírez's plan. They broke up the GOU, to avoid letting the military loyal to Ramírez know they were aware of his plot, and then initiated a coup against him. Edelmiro Julián Farrell became then the new president of Argentina on 24 February.Galasso, pp. 196–197 The United States refused to recognise Farrell as long as he maintained the neutralist policy, which was ratified by Farrell on 2 March, and the United States broke relations with Argentina two days later. Winston Churchill complained about the harsh policy of the United States against Argentina, pointing out that Argentine supplies were vital to the British war effort and that removing their diplomatic presence from the country would even force Argentina to seek Axis protection. British diplomacy sought to guarantee the supply of Argentine food by signing a treaty covering it, while US diplomatic policy sought to prevent such a treaty. Hull ordered the confiscation of Argentine goods in the United States, suspension of foreign trade with her, prohibited US ships from mooring at Argentine ports, and denounced Argentina as the \\"nazi headquarters in the Western hemisphere\\".Galasso, pp. 198–200 At this point, the Washington was considering supporting Brazil in an attack against Argentina, rather than attacking Argentina themselves. The Brazilian ambassador in Washington pointed out that Buenos Aires could be completely destroyed by the Brazilian air force. This would have allowed Argentina to be dominated without the open intervention of the United States, who would support Brazil by providing ships and bombs.Galasso, pp. 215–216 =End of the war= U-977 moored at Mar del Plata, after being surrendered to the Argentine Navy in August 1945. The Liberation of Paris in August 1944 gave new hopes to the pro-Allied factions in Argentina, who saw it as an omen of the possible fall of the Argentine government and called for new elections. The demonstrations in support of Paris soon turned into protests against the government, leading to incidents with the police.Galasso, pp. 230–231 It was rumored that some Argentine politicians in Uruguay would create a government in exile, but the project never came to fruition. President Franklin Roosevelt supported Hull's claims about Argentina with similar statements. He also cited Churchill when he stated that history would judge all nations for their role in the war, both belligerents and neutrals.Galasso, pp. 237–238 By early 1945, World War II was nearing its end. The Red Army had captured Warsaw and was closing in on East Prussia, and Berlin itself was under attack. Allied victory was imminent. Perón, the strong man of the Argentine government, foresaw that the Allies would dominate international politics for decades and concluded that although Argentina had successfully resisted the pressure to force it to join the war, remaining neutral until the end of the war would force the country into isolationism at best or bring about a military attack from the soon to be victorious powers. Negotiations were eased by the departure of Hull as Secretary of State, replaced by Edward Stettinius, Jr., who demanded that Argentina hold free elections, declare of war to the Axis powers, eradicate all Nazi presence in the country and give its complete cooperation to international organizations. Perón agreed, and German organizations were curtailed, pro-Nazi manifestations were banned, and German goods were seized. The Argentine merchant navy was instructed to ignore the German blockade.Galasso, pp. 247–248 These measures eased relations with the United States. When the Allies advanced into Frankfurt, Argentina finally formalized the negotiations. On 27 March, per Decree 6945, Argentina declared war on Japan and, by extension, on Germany, an ally of Japan. Then, FORJA distanced itself from the government, but Arturo Jauretche would understand the reasons a year later. Jauretche reasoned that the United States opposed Argentina because of its perceived Nazism by refusing to declare war although neutrality was based instead on Argentine interests; which were no longer at stake with a declaration of war when the country would not actually join the conflict. Jauretche admitted that Perón's pragmatism was better for the country than his own idealistic perspective of keeping a neutral stance to the end of the war. A few days later, on 10 April, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the other Latin American countries restored diplomatic relations with Argentina. Still, diplomatic hostility against Argentina from the United States resurfaced after the unexpected death of Roosevelt, who was succeeded by Harry S. Truman. Ambassador Spruille Braden would organize opposition to the government of Farrell and Perón.Galasso, pp. 251–252 The final Axis defeat in the European Theatre of World War II took place a month later and was greeted with demonstrations of joy in Buenos Aires.Galasso, p. 252 Similar demonstrations took place in August, after the surrender of Japan, bringing World War II to its final end.Galasso, p. 274 Farrell lifted the state of emergency declared by Castillo after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.Mendelevich, p. 152 =Argentines in World War II= During World War II, 4,000 Argentines served with all three British armed services, even though Argentina was officially a neutral country during the war. Over 600 Argentine volunteers served with both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force, mostly in No. 164 (Argentine) squadron,Argentine pilots break silence over World War Two – Reuters whose shield bore the sun from the Flag of Argentina and the motto, \\"Determined We Fly (Firmes Volamos)\\". Maureen Dunlop, born in Quilmes, left her Australian/English parents to join the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). She recorded over 800hrs service, ferrying Spitfires, Mosquitos P-51 Mustangs, Typhoons, and bomber types including the Wellington and Lancaster to the frontline RAF stations. After being photographed exiting her Fairey Barracuda, she featured on the cover of Picture Post on September 16, 1942, and became a wartime pin-up. Dunlop returned to Argentina after the war, and continued work as a commercial pilot who also flew for and trained pilots of the Argentine Air Force. She later raised pure-blood Arab horses with her husband on their stud farm, \\"Milla Lauquen Stud\\". Nearly 500 Argentines served in the Royal Navy around the world, from the North Atlantic to the South Pacific.Maffeo, Aníbal José – Proa a la Victoria (2014) Many were part of the special forces, such as John Godwin. Many members of the Anglo-Argentine community also volunteered in non-combat roles, or worked to raise money and supplies for British troops. In April 2005, a special remembrance service was held at the RAF church of St Clement Danes in London. On May 9, 2015, the remains of the Argentine volunteer Group Captain Kenneth Langley Charney DFC & Bar, were repatriated and buried in the British Cemetery in Buenos Aires. Charney was born in Quilmes, Argentina, in 1920, and died in Andorra in 1982. =Nazi presence= Before the war Argentina hosted a strong, well-organized pro-Nazi element that was controlled by the German ambassador. In the late 1940s, under Peron's leadership the government quietly allowed entry of a number of war criminals fleeing Europe after Nazi Germany's collapse. The number of Nazi fugitives that fled to Argentina surpassed 300. In May 1960, Holocaust administrator Adolf Eichmann was kidnapped in Argentina by the Israeli Mossad and brought to trial in Israel. He was executed in 1962. Gallery File:Av General Paz inauguración 1941.jpgThe grand opening of the Avenida General Paz in 1941.

English state schools and colleges It is used, and will be used, by schools for admission to sixth forms or GCSE courses. Each Connexions area (usually one local education authority or an education partnership of two nearby LEAs) may have a separate Common Application Process (CAP) website. This standardises the application, and allows students to know the whole complement of choices available - not just those in their local town, or local school or college. The name Common Application Process, using websites for each Connexions area (LEA), is applying the UCAS method (of applying for university courses) to school admissions - to widen knowledge of the scope of courses available. It makes it a more up-front and transparent method, less informal, of applying to further education and GCSE courses. It also saves time and duplication, by not re-inventing the wheel each time a school has to design an application system - it has been combined into one for each Connexions area. It has only been possible since improved access to the internet has made it viable. It is aimed specifically at people at school or college ages 14 to 19 and is linked to the local Connexions office (Connexions Centre) for that area. It is the infrastructure and interface for applications to education after 14, allowing easy access to the Area Wide Prospectus (AWP) for that Connexions area. It is a joined-up service of education application - Connexions itself is designed similarly as a joined-up service. Education of the age bracket from 14-19 was partly maintained by Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) before replaced by Young People's Learning Agency (YPLA). The provision of 14-19 education has now been placed much more in the hands of local education authorities. Education at the 14-19 level is planned by Area Strategy Groups (ASGs) within each Connexions area, which look after the relevant district council areas. Where the term Common Application Process is used in the context of English schools, it denotes an unambiguous and uniform method of application across the Connexions area. It is the responsibility of the relevant area (LEA or similar) to provide a CAP for all the courses available after 14.DfE Action Plan for the 14-19 Prospectus and Common Application Process However although it is a common application, access to more demanding academic courses after 16 will depend on exam success at 16, and therefore not available to all. =Project history= At the moment the CAP is being trialled in some LEAs (or partnerships).

It was written over three decades, between 1935 and 1961. She carried it with her, redrafting, as she worked and lived in towns and cities across the Soviet Union. The set of poems was conspicuously absent from her collected works, given its explicit condemnation of the purges. The work in Russian finally appeared in book form in Munich in 1963, the whole work not published within the USSR until 1987. It would become the best known poetry work about Soviet Great Terror. Overview The set of poems is introduced by one prose paragraph that briefly states how she waited for months outside Leningrad Prison, along with many other women, for just a glimpse of fathers, brothers or sons who had been taken away by the NKVD in Soviet Russia. Following the introductory paragraph, the core set of poems in Requiem consists of 10 short numbered poems, beginning with the first reflecting on the arrest of Akhmatova's third husband Nikolay Punin and other close confidants. The next nine core poems make references to the grief and agony she faced when her son, Lev Gumilev was arrested by the NKVD in 1938. She writes, \\"one hundred million voices shout\\" through her \\"tortured mouth\\". While the first set of poems relate to her personal life, the last set of poems are left to reflect on the voices of others who suffered losses during this time of terror. With each successive poem, the central figure experiences a new stage of suffering. Mute grief, growing disbelief, rationalization, raw mourning, and steely resolve are just a few that remain constant throughout the entire cycle. Writing sometimes in first person and sometimes in third person, Ahkmatova universalizes her personal pain and makes a point to connect with others who experienced the same tragedy as herself. Since the topics chosen were controversial at the time, Requiem was written in 1940 but was not published. Akhmatova believed publishing the work during that period would be too dangerous and felt it was better to keep it reserved in her head, only revealing it to some of her closest friends. Requiem was first published without Ahkmatova's consent in 1963 in Munich. The complete text was not published in the Soviet Union until 1987. Structure Requiem is separated into three sections which set the structure of the entire cycle. 1\\\\. The introduction also known as the prose paragraph is located at the beginning of the cycle. It details the background story of how Anna Akhmatova came to the decision of writing this poem and also explains the environment they were a part of during that period in history. Below is the paragraph that introduces the cycle: \\"During the frightening period of the Yezhov terror, I spent seventeen months waiting in prison queues in Leningrad. One day, somehow, someone \\"picked me out\\". On that occasion there was a woman standing behind me, her lips blue with cold, who, of course, had never in her life heard my name. Jolted out of the torpor characteristic of all of us, she said into my ear (everyone whispered there) \\"Could one ever describe this?\\" And I answered, \\"I can.\\" It was then that something like a smile slid across what had previously been just a face.\\" 2\\\\. The second section of the cycle is the first ten poems after the introduction, which are references to her personal grief. Her husband Nikolay Punin had been arrested for his second time and placed into jail where he died. In the first poem of this set titled \\"Dedication\\", she references her unsettling feelings toward his arrest and his death, and also reaches out to her close friends who had also been arrested. While the first paragraph is a dedication to people who were very important to her, the other nine of the second section directly relate to the arrest of her only son Lev Gumilev. Akhmatova expresses her inner sadness, pain and anger about the situation she and many other women were put in. For 17 months, she waited outside the prison in Leningrad just waiting for a glimpse or notification of what was going to happen to her son. This section concludes with Akhmatova describing how no one can take away the important things that go unnoticed such as a touch, a look, visits, etc. 3\\\\. The third and last section of this set starts with the title \\"Crucifixion\\". This set of poems is from the perspective of the other women who also stood outside Leningrad prison waiting for just a glimpse or notification from their fathers, sons, or husbands who had been arrested also. Through intricate details, she describes the grieving, pain, weakness, and fear she observed while waiting along with them during this time of terror. Overwhelmed with sadness, the ending closes with: General themes Requiem is often said to have no clearly definable plot but has many themes which carry throughout the entire poem. One of the most important themes that also stands as part of the title is the theme of \\"A poem without a hero\\". Throughout the entire cycle and the many poems within, there is no hero that comes to the rescue. It is important for the readers to know that because it is almost always a piece that people are looking for. Akhmatova wants her readers to recognize that they had to overcome this together, not by being saved by a figment of the imagination. Also, grief, disbelief, rationalization, mourning, and resolve are just a few themes that remain constant throughout the entire cycle. These themes all connect with one another because they are all stages of suffering. Whether it be the suffering of Akhmatova herself, or the suffering of the many other women who had to face the same tragedy they all are an important part in creating the purpose for the poem. Another visible theme in the cycle is the reference to biblical people. Mary Magdalene, Mary Mother of Christ, John a disciple are people who Akhmatova references. It is said that she incorporates this theme into the complex cycle to reinforce the idea that although there has been a large amount of suffering amongst all of them, there is nothing left to fear. It also allows her to transcend her personal circumstances in a mythical, and supernatural way. The last theme that seems very prominent at the end of the cycle is the idea of keeping this tragedy as a memorial. By remembering what happened and not allowing yourself to ever forget is a part of the stage of suffering that allows you to move on in life. This again ties back into the stages of suffering, so it is all interconnected. Critical reception Akhmatova feared that it would be too dangerous for herself and those around her if she released the poem during the 1940s when it was written. It wasn't until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 that she finally decided that it was the right time to have it published. The whole cycle of Requiem was finally published in the USSR by 1987. After finally being published, Akhmatova's critics described Requiem as a blend of graceful language and complex classical Russian forms of poetry.

Marriages and issue  = First marriage = On 2 or 6 February 1576, she married Count Philip Louis I of Hanau-Münzenberg. This marriage has some interesting features for its time. First, it seems to have been a love match. In the medieval view of nobility, Magdalene was ranked lower than Philip. Politically, the marriage could also represent a conscious withdrawal on her groom's part from the politically dominant influence of his guardian, Count John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg,Compare Menk, p. 154 ff and G. Schmidt, p. 548 who would have preferred that Philip Louis marry a member of the Nassau family. Her own family was more oriented toward the Landgraviate of Hesse and the Archbishopric of Cologne.

Magdalena took up the Calvinist confession of her second husband. She moved with him to Dillenburg, where they took in the two surviving children from her first marriage. This led to Philip Louis II being raised as a Calvinist. When Philip Louis II became Count of the Hanau- Münzenberg in 1595, he made Calvinism the established faith there, the so- called \\"second Reformation\\" of the county.

It has recently been restored and is open to the public. France had occupied the Austrian Netherlands (a territory roughly corresponding to the borders of modern Belgium) during 1792 and 1793 in the Flanders Campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars. During the War of the Fifth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte expected a British assault from the sea on the port of Ostend, and the fort was constructed in the sand dunes close to the mouth of the harbour in 1811. The British attack never materialised and the fort was used as for troop accommodation and as an arsenal until the end of the French occupation in 1814 when it was abandoned. During World War I, the fort was used as accommodation for a German headquarters, and decorated with murals by German soldier Heinrich Otto Pieper. The heavy coastal artillery battery \\"Hindenburg\\" was stationed nearby; it had been transferred there from Fort Heppen, Wilhelmshaven in 1915, and it was armed with four 280 mm (11 inch) guns of 1886-1887 vintage in heavily armored turrets on semi-circular concrete platforms.

It was captured by the Belgian army in 1918. The fort was also used as German artillery headquarters during World War II. After the war, it served as a museum and then a children's playground before falling into decay. In 1995, the fort came into the care of Erfgoed Vlaanderen vzw (the Flemish Heritage Association) and following a five year restoration programme, was opened to the public in April 2000.

He is best known in the United States for his collegiate career at the University of Idaho from 1991 and 1994 in which he was a two-time Big Sky Conference Player of the Year and graduated as the all-time leading scorer in conference history (2,102 points; record has since been broken). Since retiring from basketball he has become an account manager for a trucking company in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Early life Born in Chattanooga, Lightfoot played basketball at Chattanooga High School. He was named a Parade magazine All- American, was the 1989 Class AA Tennessee Mr. Basketball recipient and had signed a National Letter of Intent to play for the Oklahoma Sooners. Lightfoot's grades were so poor, however, that the NCAA's Proposition 48 did not allow him to enroll at the university. To improve his academic standing and to become eligible to play at a four-year Division I institution he enrolled at Hiwassee College, a junior college in Madisonville, Tennessee. College =Hiwassee= During Lightfoot's time at Hiwassee, his grades remained fairly poor. He played for the basketball team while enrolled, and even though he did not receive stellar marks in the classroom, they were good enough where he could play for a four-year school. After one year at the junior college, Lightfoot left. Due to NCAA rules, by leaving the two-year school early, he was forced to sit out on what would have been his true sophomore season but still afforded him the ability to retain three years of eligibility. During this one year off, he was determining which school to attend. Larry Eustachy, then-head coach of the Idaho Vandals men's basketball team, had approached Lightfoot during his freshman season at Hiwassee. One of Lightfoot's coaches at Hiwassee became an assistant to Eustachy at Idaho, and after encouragement from several of his junior college teammates who had visited that school and had loved it there, and thus he decided to play at Idaho. =Idaho= Lightfoot played for the Vandals for three seasons: 1991–92 through 1993–94. During his first year with the team, Idaho finished with an 18–14 (10–6 conference) record. He led the team in scoring with 21.8 points per game, and Sports Illustrated named him their national player of the week on February 17, 1992. To earn that honor, he had averaged 33.7 points, 10 rebounds and shot 54% from the field in wins over Southern Utah, Northern Arizona and Nevada. At the end of the season, Lightfoot was named to the All- Big Sky First Team as well as the recipient of its Newcomer of the Year Award. As a junior in 1992–93 he once again led the Vandals in scoring with his 22.3 points per game average. He set the still-standing single season school record by scoring 715 points en route to leading Idaho to a regular season conference championship. They finished with a 24–8 overall (11–3 conference) record, but did not earn a berth into either the NCAA Tournament nor the National Invitation Tournament. On February 15, 1993, Sports Illustrated named him their national player of the week for a second time, almost exactly one year after his first national honor. He averaged 32.5 points and 16 rebounds in wins over Idaho State and Boise State. Against Boise State, Lightfoot scored a then-school record 44 points. The media recognized Lightfoot's outstanding season and named him the conference player of the year. In Lightfoot's final season, the Vandals finished with an 18–10 (9–5 conference) record. For the third consecutive season he led the team in scoring, this time with a 25.4 points per game average. On December 21, he scored a still-standing school record 50 points against Gonzaga, including a career-high 8-for-11 shooting performance on three-point field goals. He had been in foul trouble early in the game and was forced to sit out for 10 minutes in the first half, so his 50 points came in only 30 minutes of playing time. In addition, his teammates only scored a combined 19 points, and the Vandals lost the game 76 to 69. Lightfoot then repeated as the conference player of the year, joining Montana's Larry Krystkowiak at the only two players to achieve the feat at least twice up until that point. Although the team achieved moderate success that season, they were not good enough to play in any postseason tournaments. Lightfoot's individual success during the year, and over the course of his career at the school, saw him graduate in 1994 as the most decorated player in the university's history and one of the Big Sky Conference's greatest players of all time. In just a three-year career, Lightfoot scored 2,201 points, which stood as the Big Sky's highest total up until the 2017–18 season when it was broken by Eastern Washington's Bogdan Bliznyuk. In each year, he averaged 20+ points per game for a career average of 23.1 – nearly four points per game better than the next closest player at Idaho. He was a three-time first team all-conference selection, two-time conference player of the year, and currently holds 13 different records in the Vandals' record book. Among them are the top three single season scoring averages and four of the top six single game scoring marks. His career scoring record is also more than 500 points greater than the second closest player in school history. While at Idaho, Lightfoot also excelled in the classroom, which was the opposite of what had been occurring at the high school and junior college levels. He did not miss a single class in his three years and graduated on time. Years later, he had this retrospective on the change: \\"I was not dumb, just lazy and spoiled. I was put on probation at Idaho and they would have kicked me out of there if I screwed up even once. Basketball was everything to me and it was my out, so I gave it all I had and buckled down in school.\\" Professional Lightfoot did not get selected in the 1994 NBA Draft. Rather than try out for a number of NBA teams in hopes of making a final roster, he decided right away to play professional basketball internationally. Between 1994–95 and 2006–07 he played for teams in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. During his 12-year career he averaged at least 20 points per game in eight seasons and at least 18 per game in two others. His best statistical season came in 1995–96 while playing for Geneva in Switzerland. He averaged 27.5 points and 9.2 rebounds per game. His career highlights include: *Belgian League All-Star Game (1999) *German Bundesliga All-Imports 2nd Team (2000) *German Bundesliga Cup Semifinals (2002) *Dutch Eredivisie All-Star Game (2005) *Eurobasket.com All-Dutch Eredivisie 2nd Team (2005) *Dutch Eredivisie Semifinals (2005) *Swedish Basketligan All-Star Game (2006) **Also won the Three-Point Competition The final team of his career was KFUM Jämtland Basket in Sweden. He appeared in 15 games that year and averaged 19.0 points and 5.5 rebounds per game. Since his professional basketball retirement, Lightfoot has moved back to Chattanooga, Tennessee and become a trucking company's accounts manager. He has also become a father after his wife gave birth to their son. When asked how he would like people to remember his basketball career, he responded, \\"I want people to say that he played for the big game. When the game was on the line and everything mattered, he made all the big shots and led his team to a win.\\" References Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Argentina Category:American expatriate basketball people in Austria Category:American expatriate basketball people in Belgium Category:American expatriate basketball people in France Category:American expatriate basketball people in Germany Category:American expatriate basketball people in Lebanon Category:American expatriate basketball people in Luxembourg Category:American expatriate basketball people in the Netherlands Category:American expatriate basketball people in Spain Category:American expatriate basketball people in Sweden Category:American expatriate basketball people in Switzerland Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Tennessee Category:Hiwassee Tigers men's basketball players Category:Idaho Vandals men's basketball players Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:Shooting guards Category:Small forwards Category:Sportspeople from Chattanooga, Tennessee ","title":"Orlando Lightfoot"},{"id":"33056000","text":"Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola (14 November 1871 in Sète, France - 29 March 1950 in Paris) was a French painter. He is known for his pioneering leadership of the Camoufleurs (the French Camouflage Department) in World War I. Early life De Scévola was a student of Fernand Cormon and Pierre Dupuis at the École des beaux-arts de Paris. Pastellist De Scévola was a pastellist, remarkable for his silky, velvety and smooth style. \\"Making his only aesthetic concern accuracy of the most naked kind\\" (E. Benézit), he left an extensive body of work including scenes of alcoves, landscapes, flowers and society portraits. However his Symbolist-inspired works are particularly esteemed. He exhibited at the Salon des artistes français. De Scévola was a member of the Société des Pastellistes Français and the Comité de la Société des Beaux-Arts de Paris. He was made an Officer of the Légion d'honneur in 1914, by which time he was known as an elegant society portrait artist. Military camouflage Sabre presented by the French army's \\"Section de Camouflage\\" to its head camoufleur, de Scévola De Scévola is considered one of the inventors of military camouflage during World War I, together with Eugène Corbin and the painter Louis Guingot. At the start of the war, in September 1914, De Scévola, serving as a second-class gunner, experimentally camouflaged a gun emplacement with a painted canvas screen. On 12 February 1915 General Joffre established the \\"Section de Camouflage\\" () at Amiens. By May 1915 the Section de Camouflage put up its first observation tree, an iron lookout post camouflaged with bark and other materials during the Battle of Artois. Example of observation tree made of steel and painted metal sheets at Armancourt (Somme) in March 1915. By the end of 1915, De Scévola became commander of the French Camouflage Corps, employing cubist artists such as André Mare, a specialist in camouflaging lookout posts. By 1917, De Scévola's team had grown to 3000, taking in artists including Jacques Villon, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Charles Camoin, Louis Abel-Truchet and Charles Dufresne.

Publication history The character first appeared in Thunderbolts #145 (August 2010) and was created by writer Jeff Parker and artist Kevin Walker She has appeared as a regular character in Thunderbolts since issue #157, and has remained with the team since the title transitioned into Dark Avengers beginning with issue #175. Fictional character biography Troll is the offspring of an Asgardian mother and a male member of the Magzi Troll tribe.Thunderbolts #146 She was originally held prisoner in Asgard until the Siege of Asgard destroyed her jail cell. Apprehended by the Thunderbolts, Troll was placed in a cell on The Raft despite protests by Valkyrie that she should be returned to Asgard. When Luke Cage lead the Thunderbolts on their first mission to the Raft, they run into the young Gunna, who attacks and disables Ghost suit with her axe. Ghost tries calling for help, as the attacking girl wearing troll skin is about to slice him in two. Luckily for Ghost, Crossbones hits her in the side with one shot, causing her to fall down. Cage reprimands Crossbones for the seemingly lethal action, though the latter defends that he simply used a dart to penetrate the girl's ear. Later at the Raft, Valkyrie identifies the girl as Gunna, an Asgardian who was captured by the Magzi Trolls. She was locked in Asgard along with the rest of the Magzi in hopes of rehabilitating her, before the Trolls escaped after Asgard's fall. Valkyrie wants to take Gunna home but Warden Walker objects, stating that she and her Troll brethren killed and apparently ate U.S. citizens and therefore, Gunna will stay at the Raft until a court trial could be enacted. Valkyrie retorts that if the Siege on Asgard never happened, then the Trolls would never have been released. Luke Cage mediates the dispute, stating that they will leave the decision to Commander Steve Rogers. Valkyrie accepts the proposal and agrees to let Gunna remain in the Raft until then. As both Valkyrie and Walker depart, Cage advises Songbird to orientate Gunna for the duration of her stay and more importantly, teach her not to eat anybody. During a prison riot in which the power was knocked out, Songbird is attacked by a group of female prisoners. After bending the bars of her cage, Troll runs out to save her while screaming in broken English. When Moonstone (who earlier just left Songbird) runs out and claims to save the day, Songbird points out that she did nothing while Gunna saved the day.Thunderbolts #147 While at lunch, the other female prisoners criticize her eating habits and describe her like an unbroken house pet. When they jokingly ask if she was a cannibal, she shocks the prisoners with a deadpan \\"Aye.\\"Thunderbolts #148 Thor also visited Troll in her jail cell to offer her a place at Asgard, but she rejected his offer telling him that she was not Asgardian.Thunderbolts #150 When a trio of male prisoners tease Gunna from behind the forcefield separating the men's courtyard from the women's. Gunna tries pouncing on them only for the forcefield to block her way. Warden John Walker and the prison guards show up to defuse the situation and discipline the prisoners. Once it is settled, one of the guards confides in Walker that Gunna is too powerful for a juvenile facility but too young for the Raft. A new Thunderbolt team is drafted in case the primary team dies on a mission with Songbird selected as leader. Therefore, she and John Walker go around the Raft and select potential recruits.Thunderbolts #155 Recently, Troll was recruited to join their Beta team of the Thunderbolts nicknamed 'The Underbolts'.Thunderbolts #156 On the first mission, Troll saves Boomerang from being eaten by zombies.Thunderbolts #157 During the Fear Itself storyline, Troll was seen fishing people out of the ocean after Juggernaut in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone destroyed the Raft and was \\"enjoying herself.\\"Thunderbolts #158 Troll escaped together with several other inmates who were members of the Thunderbolts. Due to a failure of the teleportation technology of their tower caused by Man-Thing, the tower began to move in time as well as in space. They ended up in World War II teaming up with the Invaders to battle the Nazis.Thunderbolts #163 Troll as well as the rest of the team up in the 1940s due to time travel. She promptly goes hunting. After a brief skirmish with some Nazis, she starts to hang out with Mister Hyde. Troll's war axe is also a pivotal tool for the Thunderbolts in the present trying to track her through time.Thunderbolts #164 Troll and the rest of the Thunderbolts next end up in Victorian London.Thunderbolts #166 Then Troll and the Thunderbolts go even further back in time ending up in King Arthur's court in Camelot.Thunderbolts #169 Troll and the Thunderbolts eventually bounced back to the time of the original Baron Helmut Zemo-led Thunderbolts team.Thunderbolts #170 After Fixer killed his younger self which began to cause a collapse in reality and forced Fixer to assume his younger self's place, Troll returned to the future with the rest of the Thunderbolts.Thunderbolts #173 While the other members of the Thunderbolts went their criminal ways, Troll stayed behind in the care of Luke Cage and Songbird, to - as the latter put it - \\"Show the world who you really are.\\"Dark Avengers #183 At the time when the Mother Parasite plotted to take over the world, Troll is among the younger characters that assist the Young Avengers into fighting the Mother Parasite as children and those who are young at heart can see the Mother Parasite's machinations.Young Avengers Vol. 2 #11-15 Powers Troll has been shown to have superhuman strength, displayed by bending the metal bars on her jail cell and wielding a battle-axe that mortal men find impossible to lift.

Biography At eight years of age Tim Prendergast began losing his sight, and within five years his vision had depleted by over 90 per cent. Despite this and the troubles he experienced whilst he was coming to terms with his impairment. Success was not a given, and Prendergast tried and failed in many races as a junior. In his final year at Wellington College, Prendergast received a standing ovation from the crowd at the McEvedy Shield in honour of commitment to the sport. In 2004 Prendergast represented New Zealand at his second Paralympic Games in Athens, winning a gold medal in the T13 800 metres contest. He also ran in the Beijing Games in 2008 where he was suffered from heat exhaustion and didn't win any medals. At London 2012 Prendergast ran his fastest time at a major championship but was edged out of the medals. Now in his seventh year as an Athlete Mentor, Prendergast hopes that sharing his own experience of overcoming disability to succeed will inspire the pupils he meets to overcome their own obstacles. Prendergast, now as mentioned, an Athlete Mentor, visits many schools in England to share his stories of success and hardship, and continues to motivate many. In April 2013 Tim Prendergast's partner, Lisa, gave birth to baby boy Finn.

A variant, the Lascelles Ornis, was displayed at the 1910 Aero Show at Olympia in London. Development In October 1909 Wright and Manning started work on a new tractor monoplane design. Unlike earlier aircraft, which had used steel tubing, the fuselage was constructed from wire-braced ash wood, but was otherwise similar, being a square-section box-girder tapering to a vertical knife-edge at the back. The tail-mounted control surfaces were similar to those of the Howard Wright Cooke Monoplane, consisting of a triangular rudder mounted on the sternpost and a rectangular horizontal stabiliser with tip-mounted elevators mounted below the lower longerons. The undercarriage was also similar to the Cooke aircraft, with a pair of mainwheels on sprung trailing arms and a large tailwheel. Wing warping was used for lateral control: this was controlled by a lever which also operated the elevator on one side of the cockpit, the rudder being operated by a lever on the other side. A 35 hp Lascelles 5-cylinder semi-radial air-cooled engine was probably fitted to the examples built, although any suitable engine could be installed. Work was started on at least three airframes in an early effort to reduce costs by some measure of standardisation of design, and Wright claimed that he could deliver an aircraft within fourteen days of receiving an order.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1909/1909%20-%200776.html Although only a few of the type were built, it was quickly followed by a number of very similar aircraft. The Lascelles Ornis, built for the Lascelles company and exhibited on their stand at the 1910 Aero Show at Olympia, differed in having a 2 ft (0.6 m) longer fuselage, a rectangular balanced rudder, and different control arrangements. It was fitted with a propeller made by José Weiss. After the Olympia show the Ornis was bought by A.G. Power, who flew it at Brooklands during 1910.

Albert Friedrich The Buckhorn Saloon & Museum began as a private collection of Albert Friedrich (1864–1928) in 1881. He was the youngest son of Wenzel and Agnes Urbaneck Friedrich. The elder Friedrich was an award-winning cabinetmaker who expanded into horn furniture and included Queen Victoria, Otto von Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm I among those who owned his creations. First business establishment Friedrich eventually acquired a saloon on Dolorosa Street and opened his collection for display in the saloon. The name and date of the first saloon is undocumented. In 1890–95, Friedrich purchased a seventy-eight point buck that remains on display in the museum. By 1896, Friedrich opened the first Buckhorn Saloon on the corner of Soledad and West Houston streets. Friedrich amassed his collection from his own hunting trips, and from other hunters and trappers, eventually acquiring the collection of a hunter named Capt. Ernest Dosch. In its early years, Friedrich would swap a drink for anyone who would bring in a set of horns to be displayed. The collection became known as the Buckhorn Hall of Horns. A collection of firearms and a mirrored bar were added to the collection of horns. The saloon was reputed to be frequented by Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders during the time period that the Rough Riders were deployed to San Antonio. Lone Star Brewery When Prohibition went into effect, Friedrich could no longer sell alcohol. In 1922, he relocated his business to 400 W. Houston Street, renaming it Albert's Curio Store and eventually the Buckhorn Curio Store and Cafe. In 1956, the Buckhorn Saloon and the Buckhorn Hall of Horns collection were restored at the Lone Star Brewery. The collection added a 1964 Hall of Fins, as well as a 1973 Hall of Feathers.  SA Live- KSAT-TV  The Buckhorn Museum hosts the SA Live television show. Museums and Displays When Lone Star Brewing Company changed owners in 1977, the Buckhorn collection was sold off. Mary Friedrich Rogers, granddaughter of Albert Friedrich, and her husband Wallace Rogers, acquired the collection in 1997. The collection was moved to 318 E. Houston Street and became managed by Twisthorn Holdings and the Buckhorn Museum and Saloon Limited. =Buckhorn Museum= The Buckhorn Museum features mounted wildlife from all over the world, including mammals, birds and fish.

Internal migration between Rarotonga and the Outer Islands is relatively high due to lack of schooling and employment opportunities, and increased living standards and availability of medical and educational services in Rarotonga.Buchanan- Aruwafu, H “An Integrated Picture: HIV Risk and Vulnerability in the Pacific: Research gaps, priorities and approaches” (February 2007). Noumea, SPC at p 11 The Cook Islands are a state in free association with New Zealand since 1965, and has the power to legislate its own laws and enter into international human rights instruments of its own accord.Cook Islands Government Online: Parliament The country has a Westminster parliamentary system that is democratically elected. Rights are generally well respected, as provided for in the 1965 Constitution, but a number of issues still exist. These include the limitations that remain upon legislated rights and freedoms, political participation, women's rights, the rights of sexual minorities, and limits on freedom of religion. International Human Rights Obligations The Cook Islands is not a member state of the United Nations. Since 1988, treaties signed by the Government of New Zealand do not extend to the Cook Islands unless expressly stated. Prior to this, New Zealand treaty action extended the application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its first Optional Protocol, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), to the Cook Islands.New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade: New Zealand National Universal Periodic Review Report (9 April 2009) at p5 It is of note that the Cook Islands are yet to ratify in its own right seven of the nine core human rights treaties. The two instruments to be ratified by the country since 1988 include the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1997, and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 2006. The Cook Islands has also ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Constitutional Protections Fundamental civil and political rights are protected by the Constitution Act 1964, Part IV, introduced by the Constitution Amendment No. 9 in 1981.Cook Islands Law: Introductions Rights protected include: * Right to life, liberty and security of person (section 64(1)(a)) * Non-discrimination (section 64(1)) *Equality before the law (section 64(1)(b)) * Property rights (section 64(1)(c)) * Freedom of thought, conscience and religion (section 64(1)(d)) * Freedom of peaceful assembly and association (section 64(1)(f)) * Due process and fair trial (section 65) Each of these rights is subject to limitations through section 64(2) of the Constitution Act by: any enactment or rule of law in force; for protecting the rights and freedoms of others or in the interests of public safety, order, or morals; the general welfare; or the security of the Cook Islands. To this extent the statutory protections are not absolute until the limitations described are removed. The Ombudsman Office In November 2007, Cabinet appointed the Ombudsman to head the Cook Islands Human Rights Office. This has been interpreted to mean that Cabinet has issued a directive for the Ombudsman to set up a Human Rights Division within its portfolio.Office of the Ombudsman: Extensions to the Ombudsman’s Jurisdiction Under the 2008 Cook Islands Disability Act, the Ombudsman's jurisdiction was further extended to investigate complaints of discrimination against the disabled. The Cook Islands is the first Pacific Island country to develop a rights-based disability policy and action plan. Capital Punishment The death penalty was not abolished until 2007, although it had never actually been utilised.Amnesty International, “Death Penalty: World trend down but secrecy surrounds China execution figures- new report” (Posted 14 April 2008) Prior to reform, capital punishment only ever applied to the crime of treason, for which it was the automatic sentence. Political Participation Suffrage is universal to those above 18 years of age. Female parliamentary participation is present, but not equal. In 2009 there were three women in the 25 seat Parliament of the Cook Islands.US State Department, “2009 Human Rights Report: New Zealand (including Cook Islands)” (March 11, 2010) 2009 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices There is at present one female Member of Parliament, Ngamau Munokoa, who was the first woman to hold the post of Cook Island's Deputy Prime Minister.Cook Islands Government Online: Current Members of Parliament A relevant issue is the presence of the House of Ariki, a parliamentary body of Cook Islands high chiefs that are not elected, but appointed by the Queen's Representative. The group is supposed to only discuss those matters allocated to it by the democratically elected Parliament, and in reply it responds only with its opinions. A threat to democracy was posed in June 2008 during a coup claim by a small majority of the House of Ariki members, claiming to take control of the country's leadership. The claim passed fairly quickly and was a one-off incident. In terms of chiefly participation within the House of Ariki, Christianity is credited with according women recognition as ariki (chiefs).James, M \\"The Cook Islands: Approaching Equality\\" in Institution of Pacific Studies (ed) Land Rights of Pacific Women, (University of the South Pacific, 1986) 111, at p 113-114 Women are equally acknowledged as chiefs on Rarotonga, but less so in the Outer Islands.Crocombe, R and Jonassen, J T \\"Political Culture, Representation and the Electoral System in the Cook Islands: Paper for the Conference on Political Culture, Representation and Electoral Systems in the Pacific\\" (10–12 July 2004), at p 10 Women’s Rights Although the Cook Islands has, in its own right, ratified CEDAW, domestic violence against women remains at issue. There is no reliable data on the prevalence of domestic violence in the country, however anecdotal evidence does indicate it to be widespread, but largely going unreported Lievore & Fairbairn Dunlop, Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme: Cook Islands Report (2007), at p 31 The Crimes Act 1969, while providing for major sexual offences, does not include the full range of acts usually involved in domestic violence cases. There exists a “no- drop” policy response to domestic violence arrests, meaning that police must proceed with the case notwithstanding the wishes of the victim. Victims who wish to have their case withdrawn must make their request to the court.Lievore & Fairbairn Dunlop, Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme: Cook Islands Report (2007), at p 55 Progress has been made through the Non- Governmental Organisation Women's Counselling Centre, Te Punanga Tauturu Incorporated, which delivers educational awareness programmes across the Islands.Lievore & Fairbairn Dunlop, Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme: Cook Islands Report (2007), at p 35 Sexual Minorities Lesbian and gay rights in the Cook Islands are a pressing issue. Male homosexuality is illegal under the Crimes Act 1969. Consensual male sodomy is punishable by a maximum term of seven years imprisonment. Crimes Act 1969, section 155 Civil unions for both males and females are not legally recognised. There are no laws against discrimination based upon sexual orientation. Freedom of Religion The Religious Organisations Restrictions Act of 1975 limits the introduction of new religions to the only four authorised in the Act.

Synopsis Directed by Vincent McEveety (Firecreek) and written by William James Royce, the episode guest stars musician Bobby Short as bluesman Chester \\"Ches\\" Collins and actor James Best as Nathan Bedford. The story revolves around the forty-plus-year-old, unsolved racially motivated murder of Sergeant Willson Sweet's grandfather, Louis Sweet, a story loosely based on the 1963 murder of Mississippi civil rights activist Medgar Evers. Although the crime went unsolved and the elder Sweet's body was never found, there was a witness, a young black man named Ches Collins. Ches is determined to see that justice is done, even if it has been delayed all these years. On several occasions he notices young Sweet (Geoffrey Thorne) come into the night club where he plays to hear him sing \\"The Bad Sweet Blues\\", a song he wrote about the incident. The tune supposedly tells the story of what happened to Sweet's grandfather, and mentions the names of people who were responsible for the crime they committed and were now either dead, or close to it. The song, written by series star Carroll O'Connor and performed by Bobby Short, begins Sweet's heroic quest to see that justice is served before the aging murderer of his grandfather is allowed to pass away, taking his secret with him. Most notable was the name of one of the characters in the episode, the retired sheriff, Nathan Bedford. He was purposely given that name by Royce because a Confederate general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, was named Nathan Bedford Forrest. In the episode, Nathan Bedford, in the twilight of his years, regretted his involvement in the lynching of Sweet's grandfather and sought peace and forgiveness for his past actions from God, even though he was not the gunman - however, he was there and took part. The trigger man was a man named Delbert Mueller, who was dying in a local hospital. Mueller admits to Chief Gillespie on his deathbed that the story about Louis Sweet's disappearance that was originally told was, in fact, a lie, but wouldn't implicate himself being involved. After investigating various clues and finally learning the complete story and the location of his grandfather's remains from Collins, Sweet confronts Bedford at the end of the episode. He informs the older man that he now knows the truth, and is aware of his complicity in his grandfather's murder, which leaves Bedford visibly shaken. That season, In the Heat of the Night won its first NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Dramatic Series and James Best won the Crystal Reel Award for Best Actor. Production notes The inspiration for the episode is taken from the true life story of civil rights activist Medgar Evers who was murdered in front of his home in Jackson, Mississippi on June 12, 1963. Although it was widely known that Evers was shot by white supremacist and Klansman Byron De La Beckwith, in 1991, when this story was written, Beckwith had apparently gotten away with murder. In 1994, thirty years after the two previous trials had failed to reach a verdict, De La Beckwith was again brought to trial based on new evidence, and Bobby DeLaughter took on the job as the prosecutor. An aging Klansman who had heard De La Beckwith brag about the killing felt compelled, after all these years, to come forward and give testimony in a court of law. De La Beckwith was convicted of murder on February 5, 1994, after having lived as a free man for much of the three decades following the killing. He appealed, unsuccessfully, and died in prison at the age of 80, in January 2001.  In popular culture  Bob Dylan with Joan Baez during the civil rights \\"March on Washington\\" August 28, 1963 The Medgar Evers story has inspired numerous works of art, including literature, music, and film, helping to assure that his legacy endures. Musician Bob Dylan wrote his 1963 song \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" about the assassination of Medgar Evers. On August 28, 1963, at the historic “March on Washington,” Dylan sang “Only A Pawn in Their Game” at the Lincoln Memorial – where Dr. Martin Luther King made his famous “I Have A Dream” speech. Medgar's widow, Myrlie Evers co-wrote the book For Us, the Living with William Peters in 1967. This book is the basis for the 1983 award-winning PBS biopic. For Heat actor Howard Rollins, this was the second project relating to the slain civil rights worker. In 1983, Rollins starred in For Us the Living: The Medgar Evers Story, a made-for-television biopic that aired on PBS's American Playhouse. The movie won the prestigious Writers Guild of America award for Best Adapted Drama, and netted Rollins the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series in 1983. In 1996, director Rob Reiner's film Ghosts of Mississippi was released. The film, starring Alec Baldwin, Whoopi Goldberg and James Woods, details the 1994 trial and subsequent conviction of Beckwith.

Overview Choose Life, Uvacharta Bachayim, is staged with costumes, scenery, and lighting; several numbers have also been choreographed for dance. MonaReese.com Many musical styles and sounds combine in the score. There are frequent musical references to Jewish tradition: The processional hymn and overture “O Holy One All-Wise”, uses the melody Leoni from the hymn “Yigdal”. The score includes the Jewish melody “Ani Ma'amin” in several places. The music of Adonai (God of Israel) and Lazar includes traditional Jewish modes and hymnody, recitative, and Klezmer music. Music in the Christian tradition such as Gregorian chant, polyphonic motets, Anglican Verse and Choral anthems also appear in the work. Music and text express bitterness, anguish, and anger with God who permits tragedy, sorrow and need for comfort, the will to overcome evil, and determination to choose life over death. The six readings, found in Siddur Sim Shalom and Gates of Prayer, are taken from memoirs, diaries, and reflections on the experience of the holocaust. Several pieces in Choose Life, Uvacharta Bachayim are based on the Jewish text and melody “Ani Ma'amin”, a prayer for the dying. The Angel Choir sings both text and melody during the first reading (#4). The Angel Choir sings the text in “How Could I Forget You” (#14). Lazar sings the “Ani Ma'amin” melody in “In Your Likeness” (#16). The text for “Stay With Me, God”, (#13) is from Poems from the Desert, 1944; it was written by an anonymous member of the Eighth Army (United Kingdom). The text of “How Could I Forget You”, and “Adonai” (#14 and #15) illustrates two Yom Kippur texts: “To look away from evil: Is this not the sin of all ‘good’ people?” and “Let there be no forgetfulness before the Throne of Glory; let there be remembrance within the human heart.” The following sung texts are direct quotations or paraphrases from the Hebrew Bible: *Hear Me, My People (#1) :Isaiah 55:8-9 and Deuteronomy 30:11-14, 15-20 *O God of Israel (#3) :Psalm 22:2-2, 4-5 *A Voice Is Heard in Ramah (#5) :Jeremiah 31:15 *Tender God, Have Mercy (#9) :Psalm 51:1-2, 7, 10 *All Ye Who Pass By (#11) :Lamentations 1:12-13 *How Could I Forget You?

Prior to that year, it has its early origins as the Transvaal Chamber of Mines in 1887, then evolved over many years reforming as the Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines in 1889, the Chamber of Mines of the South African Republic from 1897, Transvaal Chamber of Mines from 1902 and lastly from 1953 until 1967 as the Transvaal and Orange Free State Chamber of Mines. On 23 May 2018, the South African Chamber of Mines rebranded themselves as the Minerals Council South Africa.  Early history  On 21 October 1887, the Transvaal Chamber of Mines met for the first time at Central Hotel in Johannesburg. Forty seven people attended the first meeting and its first President was Henry Struben. The organizations main aim was to disseminate information, the reading of technical and scientific papers, publishing monthly gold returns, financial issues and other mining issues but after a few meetings the group petered out. More than a year later in 1889, the Chamber was reconstituted as the Witwatersrand Chamber of Mines. Its new President was Hermann Eckstein and the honorary President was Paul Kruger. The early work of the Chamber was a uniform standard of treatment for black mine workers on the members mines, advocated for changes to the Gold Law legislation and for a railway system with the South African Republic government. By 1892, Eckstein took up post in London and Lionel Phillips took over as President of the Chamber on 1 January 1893.

Educated at St Peter's School, York, Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Malcolm was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders as a second lieutenant on 20 February 1889.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives He was promoted to lieutenant on 23 August 1893, and served with the 2nd battalion under Sir William Lockhart in the Tochi Field Force on the North West Frontier of India in 1897–98. Following a stint in Uganda, where he conducted operations in Shuli country, he was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and promoted to captain on 21 December 1898.Hart's Army list, 1901 He served with mounted infantry in the Second Boer War in South Africa from late 1899, and took part in the Battle of Paardeberg in February 1900, where he was severely wounded by a gunshot in his thigh. After his return to the United Kingdom, he was made Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General at Army Headquarters in 1906 and Secretary of the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1908 before becoming a General Staff Officer at the Staff College, Camberley in 1912. He served in the First World War as a General Staff Officer with the British Expeditionary Force, with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and then as Chief of Staff to Hubert Gough's Fifth Army in France. He was then General Officer Commanding 66th Division from December 1917, 39th Division from 1918 and 30th Division from later that year. After the war he was Chief of the British Military Mission to Berlin from 1919 and then General Officer Commanding the Troops in the Straits Settlements in 1921 before retiring in 1924. It has been suggested that Malcolm, while in Berlin, provided the origin of the phrase 'stabbed in the back' to describe the reason for the German defeat. In the autumn of 1919, when Erich Ludendorff was dining with Malcolm, Malcolm asked Ludendorff why he thought Germany lost the war. Ludendorff replied with a list of excuses, including that the home front failed the army. > Malcolm asked him: \\"Do you mean, General, that you were stabbed in the > back?\\" Ludendorff's eyes lit up and he leapt upon the phrase like a dog on a > bone. \\"Stabbed in the back?\\" he repeated. \\"Yes, that's it, exactly, we were > stabbed in the back.\\" And thus was born a legend which has never entirely > perished. Later life  In retirement he was President of the North Borneo Chartered Company from 1926 to 1946 and High Commissioner for German refugees from 1936 to 1938. Family In May 1907 he married his cousin, Angela Malcolm; they had a daughter and two sons.

It supports artistic cooperation among festivals and offers programs for new festival and artistic managers. It represents more than 100 music, dance, theatre and multidisciplinary festivals along with national festival and cultural organizations from about thirty eight, mostly European, countries. The association is officially headquartered in Ghent, Belgium with an office in Brussels in the European House for Culture. It is governed by a General Assembly, which meets once a year. The current president is Darko Brlek from Ljubljana. Vice presidents are Jan Briers from Flanders and Michael Herrmann, founder and director of the Rheingau Musik Festival. For 2011, some of the projects include the Ars Nova meeting for new music experts in Belgium, a meeting of the Associations Collective and Affiliate Members, the General Assembly and Conference, the Ateliers for Young Festival Managers in Singapore and Izmir, Turkey, two new books to publish and joint projects with the European House for Culture in Brussels. The EFA is a source of information about more than 100 events, many lesser-known, and is based in the Chateau de Coppet near Geneva. The association was established in 1952. Small towns and cities alike sponsor cultural festivals as a way to attract tourism, with about 400 in Europe alone, including the Edinburgh International Festival. The rapid growth of festival events since the 1980s has put pressure on the towns and cities that compete for public funding and competition for better known performers has raised their prices. The association has more than seventy members. The oldest and best known member festival is the Edinburgh International Festival, which began in 1947. Its annual program features classical music, opera, theater and dance. International Festival Wratislavia Cantans is held in the Polish city of Wroclaw focusing on oratorios and cantatas from Bach to Handel and their contemporary Pawel Mykietyn.

She was sent off as the favorite and won by 1 1/2 lengths over Flat Out, joining the 2009 American Horse of the Year, Rachel Alexandra, as the only female horses to win the race. Her Woodward victory was followed by the October 1 Grade I Beldame Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, in which she scored by 8 1/4 lengths over eventual Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic winner Royal Delta. Havre de Grace closed out her 2011 campaign in the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 5, 2011, at Churchill Downs where she was again pitted against male horses. However, she fell short in her attempt to join Zenyatta in becoming only the second female racehorse to win the richest horse race in North America, finishing fourth behind the winner, Drosselmeyer. Despite her Breeders' Cup defeat, voters considered her accomplishments worthy enough to crown her as American Horse of the Year. She became the third straight filly or mare to win horse racing's top honor (following Rachel Alexandra in 2009 and Zenyatta in 2010). Retirement On November 5, 2012, Havre de Grace was sold in the Fasig Tipton November Sale in Lexington, Kentucky, by Taylor Made Sales Agency. She was labeled as Hip #76 and sold for $10 million. Mandy Pope, Whisper Hill Farm, of Citra, Florida, was the high bidder and now boards Havre de Grace at Wayne and Cathy Sweezey’s Timber Town Stable in Lexington, Ky. Havre de Grace was bred to Tapit in 2013. Sweezey explained, “Having a mare like Havre de Grace in [Mandy Pope's] broodmare band, she is looking forward to trying to make money with the horse and maybe even racing a few out of her, and having that ilk of genetics. Really, she understands that the chances of making that kind of money back are slim. With that being said, when I presented [Irish-based] Galileo to her, we talked about it at length, and she came back and said, ‘You know, it makes perfect sense from a business standpoint, but for me, I want to be able to come to the farm and pet my mare that I paid $10-million for, and I want to feed her carrots and watch her babies be born. That’s why I’m in this game, because I really love the horses.’” On February 7, 2014, Havre de Grace produced her first foal, a filly by Tapit named Heavenly Grace, who earned her first victory on May 27, 2018. Graceful Princess, her second filly by Tapit foaled in 2016, won in her first start on September 2, 2018. Pedigree Havre de Grace is inbred 5 X 3 to Mr. Prospector and 5 X 4 to Northern Dancer.

A sniper rifle variant, the Mambi-2 SR was developed soon after the completion of the anti-material rifle. It fires 12.7×108mm rounds. Design The Mambi was designed to be used against a variety of soft-skinned ground vehicles, small boats, and even helicopters. It uses the powerful Soviet 14.5×114mm round. The Mambi appears to be a Bullpup since its 5-round magazine and action are placed behind the trigger group. It is fitted with a muzzle brake to help reduce recoil created by the round it fires. The rifle weighs approximately 14 kg and its design is similar to the Barrett M82A2. The weapon is designed to be fired from a prone position due to large amounts of recoil.

It is dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and release of sick and injured marine animals, public education, conservation, and research. Clearwater Marine Aquarium opened in 1972 at its current location on Clearwater Beach, in a former water treatment plant (the large pools being well-suited for rehabilitation operations). Numerous forms of marine life are permanent residents at the aquarium, all of which have serious injuries that prevent their return to the wild. The aquarium's best-known permanent resident is Winter, a bottlenose dolphin who was rescued in December 2005 after having her tail caught in a crab trap. Her injuries caused the loss of her tail, and the aquarium fitted her with a prosthetic tail which brought worldwide attention to the facility. Winter later starred in the 2011 film, Dolphin Tale, and the sequel, Dolphin Tale 2, shot partially on location at the aquarium. History In 1972, a group of private volunteers decided it was time to establish a permanent marine biology learning center in the Clearwater area. They were incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization under the name Clearwater Marine Science Center (CMSC). In 1978, the city of Clearwater agreed to donate the aquarium's current facility, an abandoned water treatment plant, to CMSC. With its huge holding pools and bayside location, the building was a perfect fit for a marine facility's needs. In 1979, marine biologist Dennis Kellenberger was hired as CMSC's Executive Director. Kellenberger's main duties were teaching summer camp classes for children and spearheading a massive remodeling effort of the facility. Gradually, the cement and steel building was modified for aquarium purposes and in 1980 was granted a USDA Research Facility permit, allowing it to prepare two 65,000 gallon pools for the rehabilitation of dolphins and sea turtles. In 1981, the first exhibit room was opened to the public. The room featured old exhibits from the Sea-Orama, a mounted fish exhibit which was formerly on display at the Clearwater Marina. Over the next few years, thanks to individual and corporate donations and immense volunteer efforts, CMSC continued to grow. In 1984, CMSC rescued a stranded Atlantic bottlenose dolphin named \\"Sunset Sam\\". This was the first dolphin in Florida to survive a beaching. However, due to chronic liver problems, Sunset could not be released into the wild and became CMSC's first resident dolphin. Sunset Sam was taught how to paint as a form of animal enrichment, and the sales of his paintings were used to fund the CMSC's operations and stranding program. In the 1990s, as renovations continued to provide more public area and education programs, the facility's name was changed to Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA) to reflect the increasing level of community interaction. In 2005, CMA's most famous permanent resident, a bottlenose dolphin named Winter, was rescued by CMA after being discovered entangled in the ropes of a crab trap. The ropes cut off the blood supply to the dolphin's tail, and resulted in its loss. To give Winter the ability to swim normally, CMA worked with a team of experts to create a prosthetic silicone and plastic tail for her. Winter's story brought international recognition to CMA and inspired two major films, Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2, each of which was partially filmed at the aquarium. Education During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, the Clearwater Marine Aquarium is offering a variety of free educational materials for teachers and parents. First, if you follow their Facebook account, you can learn about different animals at the aquarium at 11:30am daily. Second, there is free downloadable curriculum on their website, available for Grades 1-5. There is a variety of worksheets for each grade level in subjects such as language arts, mathematics, and science. You can also find fun arts and crafts to do with children also. Finally, there are Live Cameras set up throughout the aquarium, where you can observe behaviors and visit with the animals. Animals Clearwater Marine Aquarium currently is home to North American river otters, Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, Rough-toothed dolphins, green sea turtles, Kemp's ridley sea turtles, cownose rays, southern stingrays, nurse sharks, great white pelicans, and other fish, including gag, hogfish, and red drum. Each permanent resident was rescued by CMA and is unable to return to the wild due to injuries or other impairments. Dolphins =Winter= Winter, the most famous aquarium resident, is a female Atlantic bottlenose dolphin who was rescued in 2005 by Clearwater Marine Aquarium team members and others after being found caught in a crab trap. She lost her tail due to her injuries. Winter developed a way to swim without a tail in an unnatural side to side motion, but because this was damaging her spinal cord, a prosthetic tail was made especially for her by Kevin Carroll and a team of experts from Hanger, Inc.. Winter starred in the 2011 movie Dolphin Tale and the 2014 sequel Dolphin Tale 2, which was inspired by her story and the sequel inspired on Hope's story. She currently resides in the \\"Winter Zone\\" along with another female dolphin named Hope. =Hope= Hope is a resident dolphin at CMA. In December 2010, she was discovered in the shallows of Indian River Lagoon as an orphaned 2-month-old calf, still attempting to nurse from her mother, who had died after becoming beached. It was ultimately determined that Hope did not make a good candidate for release because she was very young and had not learned the necessary survival skills to be out in the wild. Hope currently resides in the same area as Winter, and co-starred in Dolphin Tale 2, a sequel to the original movie which dramatized her rescue. Nicholas (2018) =Nicholas= Nicholas is an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, and the only male dolphin currently residing at CMA. On December 24, 2002, he was rescued with his mother as a 6-month-old calf after both became stranded near Gibsonton, Florida. The mother dolphin died three days later due to respiratory illness. Nicholas remained in critical condition, suffering both from malnourishment and severe sunburns which covered over thirty percent of his body. CMA provided 24-hour care for Nicholas for several months, bottlefeeding him and providing wound care. Nicholas was eventually weaned by the animal care staff at CMA, and his wounds completely healed. Like Hope, it was determined that Nicholas did not make a suitable candidate for release because of his dependent status at the time of his stranding and rehabilitation. He lacks the necessary survival skills, which he could only learn from his mother, to survive in the wild. Nicholas lives in his own pool on the aquarium's \\"Stranding Deck\\". Nicholas featured briefly in the movie Dolphin Tale, playing a female dolphin alongside Panama named Christa. He appears in Dolphin Tale 2, portraying Mandy. Sharks The aquarium is home to two fully-grown nurse sharks, Thelma and Louise. A private collector illegally took the sharks out of the wild as young pups. When the animals outgrew their tank, the collector could no longer care for them and donated the animals to CMA. At the aquarium, they share an exhibit with hogfish, red drum, gag grouper, mangrove snapper, black sea bass, common snook, pinfish, red grouper, lookdown, and white grunt. Sea turtles Clearwater Marine Aquarium currently has one loggerhead, seven green sea turtles, and three Kemp's ridley sea turtles. Many of them were rescued by CMA after being hit by boats, entangled in fishing line, or sustaining other permanent injuries that prevent their return to the wild. They permanently reside in the \\"Turtle Cove\\", \\"Turtle Bayou\\", and \\"Mavis's Hideaway\\" exhibits. North American river otters The aquarium currently has two North American river otters. Walle was rescued from the wild as an orphaned pup by a private individual, and was transferred to CMA after becoming too dependent on humans. He currently resides in the Otter Oasis exhibit at Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Walle has a new friend Boomer who has come to the Aquarium to be his best friend and keep him company. Pelicans Four great white pelicans, currently reside at the aquarium Ricky, Tyndall, Skylar and Matthew. They are the only aquarium residents that are not native to Florida. Ricky was trained by a film company to play the role of \\"Rufus\\" for the films Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2. Rays Twelve cownose rays and two southern stingrays currently reside in the Stingray Beach and Touch Tank exhibits, where they can be touched and fed by aquarium visitors. Past residents CMA is known for having many animals in the past. Three dolphins have died at the aquarium. Sunset Sam died in 2001. Panama died of natural causes in 2013. In 2012, Indy, a young male, died leaving Nicholas to be the last male for now. CMA has rescued a large number of sea turtles such as Abe, Orchid, Alice, among many other names. They also had an otter named Cooper who died at the age of 17 in 2018. CMA once rescued a young sperm whale named George. Due to his apparent illnesses, George died 43 days after rescue. Planned expansion Clearwater Marine Aquarium's expansion will allow the rescue and rehabilitation of more marine life, create an enhanced living habitat for the resident non-releasable animals, and provide more space for guests. The expansion will include tripling rescued dolphin habitat space consisting of 5 connecting pools, with approximately of water, nearly triple the current amount. This enhanced, more natural habitat will be home to non- releasable dolphins Winter, Hope, PJ, and Nicholas. New hospital facilities and expanded education areas with total new guest space of 103,000 sq feet, and more hospital facilities for our rescued marine life. CMA is currently researching the ways in which it can utilize the adjacent waterway for our rescue and rehabilitation work. There is a new parking garage consisting of 400 parking spots. Estimated expansion timeline is opening in 2020.http://www.seewinter.com/get-involved/support-our-expansion References Notes Sources *\\"Sea turtle restored to health at Clearwater aquarium released back in Gulf\\" *\\"Clearwater Marine Aquarium gets $50M project under way\\" *\\"City leaders host groundbreaking expansion for Clearwater Marine Aquarium\\" *Aquarium 2012 Annual Report External links * External links * Category:Aquaria in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Clearwater, Florida Category:Dolphinariums Category:Marine conservation organizations Category:Non-profit organizations based in Florida Category:Educational institutions established in 1972 Category:Environmental organizations established in 1972 Category:Zoos established in 1972 Category:1972 establishments in Florida Category:Tourist attractions in Pinellas County, Florida ","title":"Clearwater Marine Aquarium"},{"id":"33057219","text":"Admiral Henry Curzon (24 May 1765 – 2 May 1846) was a Royal Navy officer who held commands during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. Curzon was the fifth son of Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Scarsdale, and his wife Caroline. He first entered the Navy on 14 October 1776 as an able seaman aboard . When Aeolus returned from the West Indies in 1780, he became a midshipman aboard . Magnanime was sent out to assist in the Relief of Gibraltar in 1781, and then to the East Indies in 1782, to reinforce the fleet under Sir Edward Hughes. Curzon transferred aboard the flagship, , and fought in the battles of Providien, Negapatam, and Trincomalee. On 1 February 1783, he received a lieutenancy on Monarca and was with that ship at the Battle of Cuddalore in 1783, his last action in the East. From July 1784 to March 1790, he was successively lieutenant aboard , , and , and first lieutenant of , then flagship of Sir Richard Hughes on the North American Station. He was sent home in 1790 as acting commander of . His rank as commander was confirmed on 21 September 1790 and he was given the fireship . On 22 November 1790, he was promoted post captain. In June 1791, Curzon was given the sixth rate , and was sent to Villefranche-sur-Mer to protect British property at the capture of Nice by the French in 1792. When France declared war in 1793, Lapwing escorted a convoy back from Gibraltar. On 22 January 1794, Curzon was given the fifth rate frigate , which he commanded at the Glorious First of June and in Cornwallis's Retreat. At the latter action, Cornwallis, in , kept Pallas close by to repeat his signals to the fleet, and Curzon was mentioned in despatches for his good performance. Pallas was lost when she went aground under Mount Batten in a storm on 4 April 1798. On 28 February 1799, Curzon took command of , and took part in a number of captures, including that of the corvette in 1800, accompanying the expedition to Ferrol in the autumn of that year. In June 1801, he was invalided out of the service due to severe ill-health. He did not return to command until 10 June 1807, when he was given the third rate . Elizabeth was part of the fleet under Sir Charles Cotton that blockaded Lisbon during the \\"Anglo-Russian War\\", escorted the Russians to Portsmouth, and helped cover the evacuation after Corunna. He was sent out to the Brazil station in early 1809 to search for a French fleet supposed to be bound for the River Plate. Having made a junction with the forces there and found no sign of the French, Curzon escorted a homeward-bound convoy and returned in April 1810. He found he had been appointed a Colonel of Marines on 25 October 1809. His last command was of a squadron blockading Cherbourg. On 31 July 1810, Curzon was promoted to rear admiral on 31 July 1810, ending his seagoing command.

Generally, the Government respects the human rights of its citizens however a number of issues have arisen relating to the rights of women, conditions in prisons, government corruption and access to education. In 2009 the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) carried out Vanuatu's Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The review identified a number of the above concerns and made recommendations to Vanuatu as to how to address its human rights issues. International treaties In 1980 Vanuatu became a member of the United Nations,Member States of the United Nations the same year that independence was gained. Vanuatu has ratified five of the nine core human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Vanuatu has also ratified a number of International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions that aim to protect and uphold the rights of its workers.Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Vanuatu A/HRC/12/14 (4 June 2009), para 7, 38 Vanuatu has also ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and the Optional Protocol to CEDAW. Women’s rights There are a number of human rights issues relating to women. Domestic violence is a concern, although there is a lack of current statistical information. The NGO coalition reported that assault ranked as the main form of physical violence between 1988 and 2002 and according to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, in 2002, men were responsible for 62% of unlawful assaults on women.Universal Periodic Review: Stakeholders Submissions: Vanuatu A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/3 (23 February 2009) para 15,16 The Vanuatu Women's Centre since its establishment in 1992 in Port Vila has dealt with 2,954 cases of domestic violence. Domestic violence is not well reported to police, particularly in rural areas due to cultural norms, stereotyping, prejudices and lack of access to town centres and health facilities. At law women have equal rights, however Vanuatu's traditional culture can at times conflict with this. The concept of the bride price in which a groom or his family gives money to the bride's family in exchange for her hand in marriage is an example of this conflict. Despite the revocation of the 800,000 minimum vatu bride price, the practice is still widespread and effectively puts a commercial value on the women and has been seen as a justification for violence against women. Women also face discrimination in relation to land ownership. Although land ownership is not barred by law, tradition has been a preventative of this.2010 Human Rights Reports: Vanuatu (US State Department) In 2009, it was reported that women owned 28% of the total leases in Vanuatu.Universal Periodic Review: National Report: Vanuatu A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/1 (23 February 2009) para 18,33-41,50 In 2009 Vanuatu accepted the recommendations set out in its Universal Periodic Review in relation to human rights issues regarding women. The recommendations advocated for Vanuatu to continue to incorporate principles of CEDAW as well as the other human rights conventions that it is party to into its domestic legislation and to undertake further actions to combat discrimination, and to ensure equality for women.Universal Periodic Review: Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the state under review: Vanuatu A/HRC/12/14/Add.1 (24 September 2009) no. 26, 27-30 = Domestic violence = Vanuatu has progressed in the protection of women's rights by passing the 2008 Family Protection Act (FPA). The purpose of the act is to \\"provide for an offence of domestic violence and family protection orders in cases of domestic violence.\\"Family Protection Act (VUT) 2008, s 1 Under the act, violators face five years imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 100,000 vatu. The Government established a ‘Family Protection Unit’ to deal with issues related to the FPA. A protection order allows police to issue an order where a threat of violence has occurred, proof of injury is not a requirement. Police are also undergoing specialized training to deal with cases of domestic and sexual violence and have implemented a no drop policy in which they do not drop cases of domestic violence, if the victim wishes for the complaint to be withdrawn they must go to court and formally make a request. Women's groups such as the Vanuatu Women's Centre and NGOs are also heavily involved in promoting and protecting the rights of women in Vanuatu.Jolly, Margaret \\"Women Ikat Raet Long Human Raet O No? Women's Rights, Human Rights and Domestic Violence in Vanuatu\\" Feminist Review no.52 The World Upside Down: Feminisms in the Antipodes (Spring, 1996) pp. 169-190 at 185 Prison conditions There have been ongoing issues relating to the prison and detention center conditions in Vanuatu at the two prisons that are currently in operation in Port Vila and Luganville. There have been increases in prison numbers resulting in overcrowding and poor security led to a number of escapes. In 2006 the Government released 52 prisoners citing poor sanitation and overcrowding as the reason for release. In December 2008, detainees published a detailed report on the abuse of human rights by Correctional Services Officers and the Police.Universal Periodic Review: National Report: Vanuatu A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/1 (23 February 2009) para 18, 33-41, 50 The report covers a wide range of issues such as \\"unlawful arrest and unlawful custody, right to life, security of the person, freedom from inhumane treatment, freedom from expression being denied, poor living conditions, poor hygiene, denial of medical care, unlawful use of restraint, denial of visits of relatives and legal counsels and adult and juvenile prisoners sharing the same facilities.\\" Following the report the Ministry of Justice and Social Welfare appointed a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the allegations in the report. In 2009 Vanuatu accepted the recommendation under its UPR to take appropriate measures and continue working towards improving conditions in prisons and detention centers. Vanuatu also accepted the recommendation to support further human rights training for police and corrections and to promote regular, independent monitoring of detention facilities and ensure that detainees have immediate and effective means of redress and protection when their rights are violated.Universal Periodic Review: Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the state under review: Vanuatu A/HRC/12/14/Add.1 (24 September 2009) no. 27-30 Vanuatu also accepted the recommendation to ensure a timely and thorough investigation into the allegations in the detainee report and initiate reform of corrections where necessary.Universal Periodic Review: Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the state under review: Vanuatu A/HRC/12/14/Add.1 (24 September 2009) no.26,27-30 Government corruption There have been some ongoing issues in relation to government corruption in Vanuatu. The office of the Ombudsman and the Auditor General are the key government agencies responsible for combating governmental corruption. The major causes of governmental corruption in Vanuatu are classified in two ways. The first classification, economic causes, is where a governmental officer may use the Government assets allocated to him for personal gain.Universal Periodic Review: National Report: Vanuatu A/HRC/WG.6/5/VUT/1 (23 February 2009) para 18, 33-41 Secondly, political causes, is where once appointed in a ministry a leader may use his power to appoint people from his party to a particular post. The Vanuatu government has introduced mechanisms in order to address these corruption issues. The Leadership Code Act 1998Leadership Code Act (VUT) 1998 (the code) forbids a leader from using public money for personal gain, from accepting any loan which he might have an advantage or other benefit or from bribing a person. Under the code a person is also forbidden to hold any public office or position for which he or she receives a salary if that office or positions conflicts or interferes in any way with the ability for a leader to fulfill his or her duties. The code also sets out the Ombudsman's role in investigating and prosecuting leaders who have been found to be in breach of the code. Since its establishment the Ombudsman has issued a number of reports that have been critical of government institutions and officials. There have been concerns over some reports of the Ombudsman not ending up in court. This is mainly due to the law and Court Rules dealing with evidence, which obliges the Public Prosecutor to request further investigation in relation to the report of the Ombudsman if they are not satisfied they have received sufficient evidence. This has placed limits on their ability to prosecute, as by 2009 only one case has occurred where the Public Prosecutor has successfully prosecuted a leader following a report from the Ombudsman. In relation to the limitations on holding the government to account for corruption there is no law that provides for public access to government information, and the media's request for information has been met with an inconsistent response from the government. In 2009 Vanuatu accepted the recommendations from its Universal Periodic Review which advocated for Vanuatu to continue strengthening the role of the Ombudsman's office, including its ability to follow up on the results of its investigations and namely to increase efforts to provide it with sufficient funding and allocate more funding to the Ombudsman to allow for more aggressive prosecution of corruption cases.Universal Periodic Review: Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the State under review: Vanuatu A/HRC/12/14/Add. 1 (24 September 2009) no. 17 Education There are some significant issues in relation to education in Vanuatu. While the Government has stressed the importance of children's rights and welfare and in 2010 implemented the policy of free and universal education for children 1-8, school attendance is not compulsory.2010 Human Rights Reports: Vanuatu (US State Department) There is a discrepancy between girls and boys, although the attendance rates are similar at primary school fewer girls advanced to the higher grades and a significant portion of the population, up to 50 percent is illiterate. There are also concerns in relation to the educational needs of children with disabilities and their ability to access facilities.Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Vanuatu A/HRC/12/14 (4 June 2009) para 38 In the 2009 Universal Periodic Review of Vanuatu the delegations recommended that Vanuatu promote awareness raising programmes on the importance of the education of children, which the Vanuatu accepted. Vanuatu did not accept the recommendation of considering applying adequate sanctions for parents who fail to send their children to school.Universal Periodic Review: Views on conclusions and/or recommendations, voluntary commitments and replies presented by the State under review A/HRC/12/14/Add.1 (24 September 2009) no. 20 Sending their children to school is considered to be the parents' choice not the State's.

The population at the 2012 census was 10,837 (2012 Population & Housing Census Preliminary Analytical Report). Tuvalu has a written constitution which includes a statement of rights influenced by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.Farran, Sue. \\"Human Rights in the Pacific Region - Challenges and Solutions\\" LAWASIA Journal (2005) at p. 41. While most human rights in Tuvalu are respected, areas of concern include women’s rights and freedom of belief, as well as diminishing access to human rights in the face of global warming. The latter has played a major role in the implementation of human rights actions in Tuvalu given its geographical vulnerability and scarce resources. Constitution The Constitution of Tuvalu states that it is \\"the supreme law of Tuvalu\\" and that \\"all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution\\"; it sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. International treaties Tuvalu became one of the smallest members of the United Nations on 5 September 2000.Member States of the United Nations It has ratified two of the nine core human rights treaties - The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). During its Universal Period Review in December 2008, Tuvalu accepted recommendations to ratify human rights treaties to which it is not yet a party, although the report noted that Tuvalu was not actively combating discriminatory societal behaviours, including by working at reforming domestic laws, in particular land and family laws, which require amendments in order to be in compliance with CEDAW.UPR Recommendations Tuvalu has ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.). Tuvalu has commitments to ensuring human rights are respected under the Universal periodic Review (UPR), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Te Kakeega III - National Strategy for Sustainable Development-2016-2020 (TK III), which sets out the development agenda of the Government of Tuvalu. Women’s rights Tuvalu acceded to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1999, however, it has not been implemented into Tuvalu’s national legal system.Universal Periodic Review: Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Tuvalu A/HRC/WG.6/3/TUV/1 (12 September 2008), para 29, 46-47, 40, 41, 48-49. Tuvalu law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, colour, and place of origin, with no mention of gender. In 2005 the High Court of Tuvalu held that this omission was deliberate, therefore there is no constitutional protection against sex discrimination. Domestic violence is a problem in Tuvalu, with a 2007 demographic and health survey conducted by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community reporting that approximately 47 percent of the women surveyed had experienced some type of violence in their lifetime. Police have been criticised for seeking to address violence against women using traditional and customary methods of reconciliation rather than criminal prosecution. The problem of violence against Tuvaluan women was highlighted during a week of events in recognition of International Women's Day in March 2013. The traditional cultural values prevent or discourage women from reporting assaults. Legislative changes are proposed to give the Tuvalu police increased powers and allowing the courts to pass tougher sentences for crimes of violence against women. The UN CEDAW Committee observations on the 2015 review of Tuvalu notes the introduction of new domestic violence legislation, more participation by women in local council meetings and the end of some discriminatory education practices. Violence against women is also described as a concern because of the \\"cultural and the silence and also impunity and this also really stop women to report the cases.\\" Tuvalu has generally progressed through gender equality in the community and workplaces in adherence to Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and continues to address violence against women. In 2014, Parliament passed the Family Protection and Domestic Violence Act which marks a big step forward for the country in its fight for violence against women. In Te Kateega II, the government addressed the need for more representation of women in high government positions, Parliament and in local councils. It was emphasized that if the country wants to successfully implement its policies of gender equality then it needs women to be also present at the decision-making table to offer their views, as women, on how they want to be treated in society. Children's rights Tuvalu ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1995. It was the first international human rights convention for the country to ratify recognizing the protection of children in society. The Family Protection and Domestic Violence Act were passed in 2014 to help protect children. Further studies are planned. The government of Tuvalu remains committed to the protection of children's rights within sound legal framework and have worked with governments, regional and international organisations to help safeguard this. Sexual minorities There is a transgender population in Tuvalu. Transgender women were called . While sodomy is illegal in Tuvalu and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, this law has not been used to prosecute citizens in recent years, and discrimination based on sexual orientation is not common. Rights of persons with disabilities Tuvalu ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2013. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) is supporting a disability study in Tuvalu with the partnerships of the government and Fusi Alofa, to inform other areas that need support around disability rights. Freedom of speech and the press Part II of The Constitution of Tuvalu provide for freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and the government generally respects these rights as they are fundamental to a democratic society. The three branches of government effectively work together to promote freedom of the press and speech so the nation is informed of important information beyond their reach. The Tuvalu Media Corporation is the sole media organization in the country with a sole radio station that keeps the nation informed on significant national and international affairs. It is not a private media organization and is, therefore, run by the government. Tuvalu remains peaceful and free and the press, although under government control, is an independent organization. Right to vote Tuvalu uses the First-past-the-post voting system where one person equals one vote, held by secret ballots based on universal and equal suffrage. General elections are held every four years, unless the Prime Minister, with the support of his government, decides to call an earlier one. After the 2010 general election (Elections and political parties in Tuvalu), there was a controversial issue regarding the Nukufetau constituency. In Nukufetau v Metia, the Nukufetau local Council requested that Lotoala Metia, one of the two representatives of the constituency in Parliament, to support the bid of the other representative, Enele Sopoaga, of Prime Minister.Nukufetau v Metia [2012] TVHC 8; Civil Case 2.2011 (11 July 2012) Metia’s refusal to follow through caused an uproar that ran a wedge through the community culminating in protests on the streets of Funafuti demanding that he step down. The plaintiff, argued that the seat held by Metia is for the people of the constituency, and the local council, are the voice of the people, therefore, it is their seat and they have the right to fill the seat with the person of their choice. The defendant argued that the people had just elected him the previous year to serve another term therefore, they have chosen him to fill the seat. Furthermore, he argued that the involvement of the local council is purely political. This issue brings to light the integrity of the ballot boxes and the right of the people, in a democratic society, to elect their preferred candidates. Once the victorious candidates take the oath of office, they are the voice of the people, and local bodies should, as always, stay out of the jurisdictions of the legislature. The way members of parliaments vote in Parliament, whether in a Parliament sitting or party internal votes, should be at their own discretion and not dictated by an outside body. Global warming As it is a low lying island, it has been predicted that Tuvalu will be the first nation to be wiped out due to global warming.Duong, Tiffany T.V. \\"When Islands Drown: The Plight of \\"Climate Change Refugees\\" and Recourse to International Human Rights Law\\" University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law Vol.31 Issue 4 The impact of global warming is curtailing some of the human rights of Tuvalu’s citizens including the right to life and the right to health. If Tuvalu is able to establish these human rights violations, it may be able to seek injunctive relief to prevent States from continuing to contribute to global warming through the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Those seeking to leave the island due to global warming do not fit the legal definition of a ‘refugee’, as set out in the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Thus as current international law stands, Tuvaluans seeking to escape the effects of global warming are not privy to the extensive legal protections offered to those who do fulfill the definition of refugee. The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation visited Tuvalu in July 2012. Report of Special Rapporteur Visit In 2014 attention was drawn to an appealed to the New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal against the deportation of a Tuvaluan family on the basis that they were “climate change refugees”, who would suffer hardship resulting from the environmental degradation of Tuvalu. However the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim. The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were “exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature” that justified the grant of resident permits as the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family which had effectively relocated to New Zealand. Indeed, in 2013 a claim of a Kiribati man of being a “climate change refugee” under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable. Permanent migration to Australia and New Zealand, such as for family reunification, requires compliance with the immigration legislation of those countries. Te Kakeega III - National Strategy for Sustainable Development-2016-2020 (TK III) sets out the development agenda of the Government of Tuvalu. TK III includes new strategic areas, in addition to the eight identified in TK II. The additional strategic areas are climate change; environment; migration and urbanization; and oceans and seas. National human rights institution Tuvalu lacks a national human rights institution, and most enquiries from the public relating to human rights are received by the Tuvalu National Council of Women (TNCW)’s Legal Rights Training Officer and the Office of the People’s Lawyer. Both NGOs and Youth Groups alike run human rights workshops to inform their respective audiences of their rights. In 2014 the office of the Chief Ombudsman was established, with the appointment of Sa'aga Talu Teafa. The primary role of the Chief Ombudsman is to work to achieve good governance through the enforcement of the Leadership Code Act. Freedom of belief The Church of Tuvalu, (Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu) is the de facto state church of Tuvalu, although in practice this merely entitles it to \\"the privilege of performing special services on major national events\\". Theologically the Church of Tuvalu is part of the Reformed tradition. Its adherents comprise about 97% of the 10,837 (2012 census) inhabitants of Tuvalu. According to the 2008 Universal Periodic Review, the People’s Lawyer’s Office has received complaints from religious organizations concerned by limitations on their activities in the outer islands. In 2009 the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu confirmed the freedom of religious organisations to carry out their activities in a case that considered the freedoms of religion, expression and association that are set out in the Constitution of Tuvalu against the values of Tuvaluan culture and social stability that are also referred to in the Constitution. Religious groups remain free to proselytizing or holding meetings, although the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom Report for 2014 noted reports of discrimination against followers of non-traditional and minority religious groups who are viewed by some Tuvaluans as disrupting traditional societal structures. Improvement of human rights Tuvalu has its shortfalls in the protection of individual rights. In 2016, the Tuvalu government published the (Tuvalu Human Rights National Action Plan 2016-2020) to bridge the gap and improve its national image regarding human rights. Tuvalu has engaged with both cycles of the Universal Periodic Review (2008 and 2013) and has issued an open invitation onto the United Nations special rapporteur in April 2013. In 2012, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to water and sanitation visited Tuvalu and issued crucial recommendations that the government is in the process of implementing within its limited resources and capacity. It is recognized that genuine improvements to human rights observance require not just resources and finances but also political will. To bring about a strong culture of human rights, including the prevention of domestic violence or child abuse, there is a need for an attitude change, education and training, capacity building and a strong judiciary. The Government of Tuvalu is working towards strengthening its commitment in these areas as well as ensuring that the dialogue to better protect human rights is ongoing.

After the World War II, the building was used for secular purposes because the Smíchov Jewish community ceased to exist in the Shoah. In the present, the building is used for an archive of the Jewish Museum in Prague. Former appearance The first synagogue of the Smíchov Jewish community was in ruins and dangerous for its visitors after only three years of use. The Jewish Community, indebted since the original building project and totally unprepared for another expense, gained financial means to replace the ruin with a new synagogue from Franz Ringhoffer II, Smíchov mayor, businessman (founder of the important Smíchov railway car factory) and surprisingly enough, a gentile. The building was finished on 30 August 1863. Its outside was built in Romanesque Revival style while the inner space was formed in Moorish Revival style. The Smíchov Jewish Community belonged to reform rite; therefore there was a pump organ in the synagogue, yet later it was replaced by more representative organ. Capacity of the synagogue was more than 180 seats for men and about 140 seats for women. As for size, the synagogue was much smaller than synagogues in traditional areas of Jewish settlement – for instance, the Spanish Synagogue in Josefov, former Prague Jewish ghetto, has about 800 seats and seats of the Smíchov Synagogue would fill only the women section of this synagogue. The reason is plain enough – development of Jewish community in Smíchov was tightly interconnected with a boom of industry in Smíchov in the 19th century. In 1897, the central government of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire failed to enforce a law that would guarantee equal rights to Czech- and German-speaking people. This unwelcome result caused riots in numerous Czech towns and cities including Prague and its vicinity. The violence was aimed against the considerable German population of the Czech lands and also against Jews who were considered pro- German at large. Before the rampages were suppressed, also by the aid of martial law, the Smíchov synagogue had been severely damaged. The situation was apparently so grave that also The New York Times informed about it.  Modern history  Since the 1920s the Smíchov Jewish Community had looked for a site to build a new synagogue but because they did not succeed, they decided to rebuild the existing one. A modern purist design of 1930–31 by Leopold Ehrmann gave the synagogue a functionalist outside; the inner space was probably designed in Art Nouveau style. However, the renovated synagogue served religious purposes for only a decade. In 1941, Nazi administrative of the country decided to use the building for storage of confiscated properties. After the World War II, the Smíchov Jewish Community was not re-established and the building passed to hands of a near factory Tatra, which used it as a warehouse. Some structural interventions were made (new concrete floor, change of storey disposition and construction of elevator), they caused damage to the synagogue and in 1986 it was proposed that it be demolished. This decision was not carried out, only because the synagogue was enlisted among historical architectural monuments. After the Velvet Revolution, in 1990, the synagogue became a property of the Prague Jewish Community, which hired it to Jewish Museum in Prague in 1998. During following five years the synagogue was completely reconstructed. Nowadays, the Museum uses the building as an archive and a reading room. Self-supported structure provides space for this purpose, while the original disposition and decoration remains intact.  Inscription  Quotation over the arcade attracts much attention. At the northern side there is \\"Peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near\\" (Isaiah 57,19) in Czech, and at the western side \\"Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts\\" (Zechariah 4,6) in Hebrew. Gematrical value of the Hebrew inscription hints at date of reconstruction of the synagogue (5)691/1931.

Clifford House Maine Historic Preservation Commission It was built for George Franklin Clifford, son of United States Supreme Court Justice Nathan Clifford. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 10, 2010. Description and history The house is set in the main village of Cornish, at the northern side of the junction of High Road and Fiddle Lane. Immediately to the northwest, facing Main Street, stands the Caleb R. Ayer House, the home of George Clifford's uncle, Secretary of State Caleb Ayer.Mitchell, Christi (2010). NRHP nomination for George F. Clifford House; available by request from the Maine State Historic Preservation Office It is a 2-1/2 story wood-framed structure, with a side gable roof, twin interior chimneys, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The south-facing main facade is five bays wide, with paired windows flanking a center entrance with window above. The entrance is set in a recess that is demarcated by pilasters, and includes sidelight windows and a rectangular multi-light transom window. The corners have paneled pilasters, which rise to an entablature and cornice that encircle the building. A hip- roofed, single-story porch extends across the front and around to the east, with a geometrically patterned railing and square posts with scroll-cut brackets. The house is joined via a narrow hyphen to a period carriage house. Its interior retains a high degree of original woodwork and hardware. According to family history, the house was built for George F. Clifford by his father, United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Nathan Clifford in about 1874; it is not depicted on an 1872 map of the village. The younger Clifford was at that time already in a law partnership with his uncle, Caleb Ayer, and the north-facing secondary entrance faces the Ayer house. It is unclear why the house was built in the Greek Revival style, which had effectively been out of fashion for over ten years.

It was closed by the Allied occupation government after the German capitulation in May 1945. The agency was founded in 1914 in response to Britain’s cutting of transatlantic cables to Germany during the World War I. In the 1920s and until Adolf Hitler rose to power in 1933, Transocean was a reputable news agency. Then the Nazis put it under control of the Foreign Office and the Propaganda Ministry. Transocean, however, presented itself as an independent news agency and not an official government run institution like the German News Bureau (). The news agency became active in the United States in August 1938 with the arrival of Dr. Manfred Zapp and Günther Tonn, Transocean's U.S. managers from Germany. It maintained an office at 341 Madison Avenue, New York City. In the summer of 1941, before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States Government ordered the closure of Transocean and the withdrawal of the German nationals connected with it after a trial in which it was found guilty of having failed to register with the State Department as the agent of a foreign government. During the German National Socialist period the news agency provided articles to small papers in South America, Asia and some of the 178 German language papers in the United States for free or at a nominal rate. Transocean was largely subsidized by the German government.US House Committee on Un-American Activities, page 20 Transocean's most famous dispatch was early on June 6, 1944, when its German language broadcast announced the landing of Allied parachute troops on the French coast.

An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on May 20, and into a tropical storm around noon on May 21\\\\. The cyclone turned northeast, reaching its peak as a strong tropical storm on May 23\\\\. Aletta meandered and gradually weakened, dissipating a few hundred miles southwest of Acapulco on May 29\\\\. Moisture from the tropical system spread over Honduras and Nicaragua, causing flooding. Throughout the two countries, 308 people were killed and total damage was at $466 million (1982 USD). In the aftermath of the storm, many programs provided relief to the victims of Aletta. Meteorological history The origins of Aletta are from a tropical disturbance that was first noted on May 18 about 500 mi (800 km) south-southwest of Acapulco. On May 20, satellite imagery showed evidence of a weak atmospheric circulation. Based on this, the disturbance was upgraded into a tropical depression. Moving northwest, the depression became Tropical Storm Aletta 36 hours later over sea surface temperatures. The system re-curved towards the northeast due to strong upper-level westerlies, reaching its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) on May 23. Shortly after its peak, Tropical Storm Aletta began to weaken. However, the tropical cyclone managed to maintain winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) for 30 hours before resuming a weakening trend. While the steering currents weakened on May 25, Aletta slowed and moved in a large clockwise loop until May 28\\\\. Shortly thereafter, Tropical Storm Aletta was downgraded into a depression. Tropical Depression Aletta dissipated on May 29 roughly 180 mi (290 km/h) southwest of Acapulco. Impact and aftermath The outer rainbands of Tropical Storm Aletta produced torrential rains and high winds over Central America for several days, and precipitation totals were as high as in some areas with a peak of in Chinandega. A red cross official stated that \\"Entire families were swept away by [flood waters] and we know nothing about them\\". Because all sewers in Nicaragua were damaged, the water was contaminated. Ninety percent of the banana crop and 60 percent of the corn crop was completely destroyed. Throughout the country, 108 people were killed, (10 of which drowned in floodwaters). Roughly 20,000 people were homeless and total damage was estimated at $365 million (1982 USD); damage to highways, factories, and farms exceeded $100 million. In the northern portion of the country, a mudslide buried three small mountain villages, leaving 270 missing and only 29 survivors. About 15,000 sought to two emergency shelters. Many bridges were damaged. Since the capital city of Leon was hardest hit, a disaster area was declared for the nearby area. Aletta was considered the worst disaster in the country in three years. Across Honduras, 200 people were killed and 5,000 people were without food or water in just 13 communities. A total of 80,000 people were homeless which were later housed in schools, churches, and health victims. Total damage was placed at $101 million (1982 USD). On May 27, the governments of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for international aid. Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. A second appeal was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1 million in medicine and other supplies. The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3 million in international relief. The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that this would not be enough. The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000 via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines which costs $5.1 million. The U.S. Embassy in Managua provided $25,000 in donations. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.

Racotumomab triggers an immune response against the tumor antigen N-glycolyl (NGc) GM3 (NGcGM3), a type of ganglioside present on the cell surface of malignant cells from lung and breast, melanoma, as well as neuroectodermal pediatric tumors. Racotumomab has successfully completed a proof-of concept clinical trial in advanced non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is currently being tested in a large, multinational study for the same indication.  Mechanism of action  Gangliosides are concentrated on the surface of mammalian cells and play an important role in cell growth and differentiation. NGc gangliosides, however, are practically undetectable in healthy human tissues and fluids due to a genetic deletion in the human gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of NGc, the CMP-N-acetyl hydroxylase. Nonetheless, the NGcGM3 ganglioside is highly expressed in several human cancers, including lung, breast, melanocytes, colon and neuroectodermal pediatric tumors, making this neoantigen an attractive target for cancer therapy. Racotumomab is an anti- idiotypic mouse monoclonal antibody that mimics NGc gangliosides, thus triggering an immune response against the tumor antigen NGcGM3. Therefore, rather than being a passive antibody therapy, Racotumomab acts as a therapeutic vaccine. In melanoma, breast, and lung cancer patients, Racotumomab was able to elicit a specific immune response that recognized and directly killed tumor cells expressing the neoantigen by a mechanism of oncotic necrosis. The specific expression of NGcGM3 in malignant cells reduces the potential risk of an immune cross-reactivity that could cause serious adverse effects.  Treatment administration and side effects  Racotumomab is administered in patients who have previously received the oncospecific treatment established in the oncological therapeutic standards (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy). A Racotumomab-alum solution is administered by intradermal injection every 14 days for the first 2 months (5 doses), followed by monthly booster doses. Racotumomab is well tolerated by patients. The overall toxicity of the vaccine has been classified as grade 1 and 2, according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Treatment is mostly associated with mild to moderate injection-site reactions (local erythema, induration and pain), which disappear within 24–48 hours. Systemic reactions, such as flu-like symptoms and chills are less frequent, reversible, and self-limited.  Approvals and indications  Racotumomab has been approved in two countries, Argentina and Cuba, for the treatment of recurrent or advanced NSCLC, or NSCLC independent of the disease stage when no other standard therapy can be administered.  Clinical trials  A randomized, multicenter, phase III study of active specific immunotherapy with Racotumomab plus best support treatment, versus best support treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC who have achieved an objective response (partial or complete) or stable disease with standard first-line treatment is underway in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Uruguay. 1,082 patients with NSCLC in stages IIIA (non-resectable), IIIB or IV will be evaluated in the study. The study is sponsored by Recombio in collaboration with Elea Laboratories (Argentina), CIM (Cuba), Europharma Laboratories (Brazil), Innogene Kalbiotech (Singapore) and several public research institutions.

Baby Born at Sea The Argus (Melbourne, 11 September 1936) \\"Changte How Lum\\" After 12 years in the Australian trade, during which she has made 72 round voyages between Melbourne and Hong Kong, the Australian-Oriental liner S.S. Changte arrived at Victoria Dock yesterday after a voyage that made history for the ship. A baby boy was born aboard the vessel when it was steaming through the Banda Sea from Manila to Thursday Island. The ship's surgeon (Dr. J. S. MaCfarlan) and the stewardess. (Miss E. Farrell) were called to a cabin occupied by Mrs. William (\\"Munsok\\") How Lum, a Chinese passenger traveling from Hong Kong (via Zhongshan, Guangdong, China) to Townsville (Qld). They later reported that a baby boy had been born and that mother and child were well. The christening ceremony was performed by the commander (Captain P. Gambrill), and the many passengers who attended were delighted when the mother chose the name of the ship for her infant son. Captain Gambrill then formally entered in the ship's log-book the details or the historic incident, and presented the child with a silver christening cup and a silver spoon, both inscribed with the child's name Changte How Lum (known as Frederick How Lum). Operational history Changte was requisitioned by the Royal Navy as a Naval Stores Issuing Ship on 27 August 1939 and was known as RFA Changte (Y1-9). She was returned to her owners in 1946. Fate Changte was broken up at Hong Kong in August 1961. MYSTERY AND TRAGEDY, THE VOYAGE OF THE CHANGTE. TWO PEOPLE DISAPPEAR. During the voyage of the Changte from Hong Kong to Sydney a lady passenger and an officer disappeared at different times, and were not seen again. Sydney, 2 May. When Captain Gambrill took the liner Changte to sea from Hong Kong on Friday, 13 April, he and his crew paid little heed to the old marine superstition regarding sailing on that day of the week, but before Sydney was reached to-day all hands on board had reason to regard their sailing day as the blackest Friday in their experience. Two mysterious deaths occurred on the voyage, and not a clue to the disappearance of the deceased persons could be traced. In northern waters an elderly English lady passenger, who was travelling round the world with Miss Jean Mackenzie, her young niece, kissed her protege good-night as usual and read a prayer before retiring at 10 o'clock' one evening. No one ever saw her again, and an examination of her personal effects established no suggestion of a motive for her disappearance. It was concluded that she walked in her sleep and fell overboard. This tragedy was followed by a fatality equally uncanny. The third officer, Mr. J. A. Allan, vanished off the Australian coast. He was seen by the quartermaster smoking in his cabin about an hour after he was relieved on the bridge at midnight by the second officer. Then he disappeared without a word or sign. He had been on the ship for some time, and was highly respected and popular. He had a substantial bank balance, in addition to a private income, and so far as any of his colleagues knew he had no trouble in the world.

Major League Football, Inc., is a publicly traded company. League history Major League Football was founded in December 2014 with the intention of a being a spring football league in an attempt to fill the void left by minor or development football leagues such as the World Football League, the United States Football League, the XFL and United Football League (all of which lasted less than five years), and the then current Fall Experimental Football League (FXFL). The league looked to establish teams in unrecognized U.S. markets such as Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; Las Vegas, Nevada; Orlando, Florida; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; and San Antonio, Texas.MLFB vs. Past Leagues, MLFB website, November 23, 2015 It also planned to develop a non-conflicting and competitive league to the National Football League and other sports leagues in the United States (including the Arena Football League and Indoor Football League) and expand the media platform. The league named former NFL player Wes Chandler as its first president.Company Overview, MFLB website, November 23, 2015 The MLFB is a single-entity business model where the league owns and operates all of the teams with franchises in cities that are absent of NFL or Major League Baseball teams. The MLFB's goal is to have franchises be individual owner and operated by 2019 or 2020. Average attendance is expected to be between 12,500 and 15,000 fans by the end of the first season and run from April to July.League Overview, MLFB website, November 23, 2015 The MLFB originally planned on having its inaugural season in spring 2016. In January 2016, the MLFB held a draft for eight teams based on territory. However, in February 2016, a major financial backer of the league backed out of a $20 million commitment putting the league's first season in jeopardy. The league continued to push forward in an attempt to start games in April 2016, but the league was unable to come up with the needed financials in order to operate a full season. On March 31, the league announced that the first season would be postponed and 2016 would be considered a \\"developmental\\" year. However, by June 2016, the league would miss at least four months of rent payments on its headquarters in Lakewood Ranch, Florida, and eviction papers were served for non-payment of rent beginning in March 2016. In early 2017, the league registered websites for some of their teams that listed eight teams in the league: Alabama Airbourne, Arkansas Attack, Florida Fusion, Ohio Union, Oklahoma Nation, Oregon Crash, Texas Independence, and Virginia Armada. In mid-2017, the league operations were taken over by Jerry C. Craig and a new group of directors based out of Huntington Beach, California. However, by October 2017, Craig apparently had failed to follow through with a purchase agreement and the general counsel resigned. On October 14, Craig also vacated his position as CEO and Director leaving the publicly traded company without management. Craig then went on to announce he was starting another league, with proposed start in spring 2018, called the Professional Football League. His new league also stated they would start with eight cities and listed several of the general managers and coaches associated with the MLFB as part of the new league. Craig also clarified the PFL is a privately held entity and has no official association with the publicly traded MLFB. On April 25, 2018, MLFB filed a Form 10-K with the intent to restart the league with an abbreviated 2018 season beginning in June or July prior to fully launching in March 2019. However, the start date was postponed every time the company filed a quarterly financial report. By July 2019, the league stated it was planning a 2020 start with six teams and that it had agreed to purchase most of the equipment from the recently defunct Alliance of American Football (AAF). The AAF equipment had been bought by former Arena Football League commissioner Jerry Kurz in a bankruptcy auction earlier that month. In January 2020, CEO Frank Murtha stated that the MLFB is \\"a developmental showcase league, with games in May and June in six midsize cities - Little Rock, Arkansas; Norfolk, Virginia; Canton, Ohio; and so on - that aren't served by the NFL or, for that matter, Major League Baseball\\" and said that the annual operating budget will be in the \\"ballpark of $30 million\\" as a single entity. The centralized all- players training camp was stated to be scheduled for April in Lakewood Ranch, Florida, where the league is headquartered. These tryouts did not take place in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and MLFB then announced plans for tryouts and camps in Lakewood Ranch for December 2020 through March 2021 for a 2021 season. =Rules differences= The rules of the MLFB are basically the same as the NFL with a few differences such as:MLFB Rulebook, MFLB website, November 23, 2015 *A 30-second play clock instead of the NFL's 40 seconds. *50-yard field goals being worth 4 points (former NFL Europe rule). *The ground can cause a fumble. *In the case of overtime, a 10-minute period will be played to determine a winner. Similar to former NFL rules, first score wins the game. In the event the game is still tied after overtime, there are alternating possessions from the 10-yard line; teams get four plays to score a touchdown and 2-point conversion. Teams While currently unannounced, the MLFB has filed trademarks for ten regional teams and have held a territorial draft for eight teams in which coaches draft based on region.

Previously, he had spent 21 seasons as the head coach at Hofstra. Danowski coached Duke to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Lacrosse Championship in 2010, 2013, and 2014, and appearances in the national championship game in 2007 and 2018. He is a three-time winner of the F. Morris Touchstone Award as the NCAA men's lacrosse coach of the year, earning the honor in 1993, 2010, and 2013. One of nine coaches to lead three NCAA Division I championship teams, Danowski has won more games than any other Division I lacrosse coach. In addition, he is the head coach of the United States men's national lacrosse team, which he led to the gold medal at the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. Early life and college Born in Bronxville, New York, Danowski attended East Meadow High School and played lacrosse from 1969 to 1972, helping his team win the county championship twice. He went to Rutgers University and played for the school's men's lacrosse team for four seasons, from 1973 to 1976. He led the team in assists three times and, as of 2011, is Rutgers' record-holder for assists in a season, having assisted on 54 goals during the 1973 season. That year, Danowski also set the team record with 13 assists in a game against Penn State, and in 1974 he compiled a school-record 14 points in a game. Danowski graduated from Rutgers in 1976, and gained a master's degree in 1978 at C.W. Post. Coaching career =C.W. Post= In 1982, C.W. Post hired Danowski as an assistant coach for its men's lacrosse team, under Tony Seaman. The following year, he was promoted to head coach. Danowski spent three seasons as head coach for C.W. Post, compiling a 27–16 win–loss record. =Hofstra= Danowski became the head coach at Hofstra before the 1986 season. In the year before Danowski joined the school, the team had a 3–11 record. Hofstra improved under Danowski, and by 1988 the team had reached the top 15 in national polls. That year, Hofstra earned the East Coast Conference championship, and added another in 1989. In 1993, Hofstra reached the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 15 seasons, defeating three teams ranked in the top 10 during the season. Hofstra won its first-ever NCAA Tournament game before losing to Syracuse in the quarterfinals. Danowski was honored as coach of the year in the NCAA's Division I. The 2006 season was Danowski's last coaching at Hofstra. The team went on a 17-game winning streak, tying the record for most wins by an NCAA men's lacrosse team in a season. Hofstra achieved a national ranking of number two, but was unable to advance past the quarterfinals of that year's NCAA Tournament. In his 21 years with Hofstra, Danowski's teams were 192–123, appeared in the NCAA Tournament eight times, and won as many conference titles. =Duke= 2007–2013 In 2006, as the Duke lacrosse case played out, the university's head coach, Mike Pressler, was forced to resign after being in the position for 16 seasons. The team was suspended from competition by Duke's president, but in June 2006 the suspension was lifted. The following month, Duke hired Danowski to fill its vacancy at head coach. The first season for Danowski at Duke saw him lead the team to a 17-win season, the fourth in NCAA men's lacrosse history. Duke reached the championship game in the 2007 NCAA Tournament, losing 12–11 to Johns Hopkins. Danowski won the Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year award. In 2008, Duke entered the NCAA Tournament as the top-seeded team, only to lose again to Johns Hopkins, this time in the national semifinals. Duke lost again in the semifinals of the 2009 NCAA Tournament, falling to Syracuse 17–7. Danowski won his first national championship as a head coach in the 2010 season, his fourth at Duke, in which the team posted a record of 16–4. In the title game, Duke defeated Notre Dame in overtime, scoring the winning goal five seconds after the start of the extra period. The championship was the first for Duke in men's lacrosse. Following the season, Danowski again was named Division I Coach of the Year. Danowski's Duke team again reached the semifinals of the 2011 NCAA Tournament, but lost in that round against Maryland. Inside Lacrosse's Geoff Shannon described Danowski's 2011 performance as among \\"his most impressive yet in terms of pure coaching acumen\\", as his team was relatively inexperienced and he opted to make two freshmen starters early in the year. Danowski interviewed with Rutgers for that school's head coaching position after the season, but decided to remain with the Blue Devils. With a Duke victory in the first game of the 2012 season, Danowski earned his 300th win. Duke made it to the 2012 NCAA Tournament semifinals before losing to Maryland 16–10. In 2013, Duke began the season by losing four of its first six games, but posted a 14–1 record afterwards. The Blue Devils made the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament for the seventh straight year, and a 16–14 victory over Cornell gave them a spot in the national championship game. Duke won its second national championship by defeating Syracuse 16–10 in the title game, held in Philadelphia. The Blue Devils finished the season with a 16–5 record, and Danowski was named the Division I coach of the year for the third time. 2014–present The 2014 Blue Devils went 17–3 and reached the program's eighth consecutive NCAA Tournament Final Four and fourth national championship game during Danowski's tenure as coach. After earlier NCAA Tournament victories over Air Force and Johns Hopkins, Duke faced Notre Dame for the championship. With an 11–9 Duke win, Danowski earned his third NCAA Division I championship, becoming the ninth coach to achieve this feat. In addition, he became the eighth coach to lead a team to consecutive NCAA Division I men's lacrosse titles. The Blue Devils' attempt to win a third straight national title ended in the first round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament, as Ohio State defeated the fifth-seeded Duke team 16–11. The 2016 Blue Devils advanced no farther in the NCAA Tournament that the previous year's team, falling to Loyola in the opening round. A 13–6 Duke win over Jacksonville on March 13, 2017 was the 376th of Danowski's head coaching career, breaking the Division I record which had previously been held by former Brown and Virginia coach Dom Starsia. The Blue Devils again reached the NCAA Tournament and advanced to the quarterfinals before a 16–11 defeat against Ohio State. Duke ended the 2017 season with a 13–5 record. In 2018, Danowski's Duke team again participated in the NCAA Tournament, earning the fourth seed. With a win over Maryland, the Blue Devils reached their first NCAA championship game in four years, ultimately losing 13–11 to Yale. At the end of the season, Danowski stood one win shy of 400 for his career. He signed a new contract with Duke that goes through 2023. The 400th victory for Danowski as a head coach came in the first game of the 2019 season against Furman, making him the third NCAA men's lacrosse coach, and first in Division I, with that many wins. The 2019 Blue Devils were the number two seed in the NCAA Tournament and made it to the semifinals for the 10th time in 13 seasons, where they faced Virginia. Duke lost a two-goal lead in the last minute, and a 13–12 defeat in double overtime left the team one win short of a second straight NCAA title game. Duke began 2020 by winning six of their first eight games, before the rest of the season was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. =United States men's national team= In 2015, Danowski was selected by US Lacrosse to coach the U.S. men's national team at the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. The U.S. went undefeated in its seven games at the tournament, facing Canada in the gold medal match. A goal with one second remaining by Tom Schreiber proved the margin of victory in a 9–8 win that gave Danowski's U.S. team the world championship. US Lacrosse announced in November 2018 that Danowski would coach at the upcoming World Lacrosse Championship, which would make him the first coach to lead the U.S. men's team in multiple world championships. Family Danowski is married and has two children. His father was Ed Danowski, a National Football League quarterback for the New York Giants. One of his sons is former Duke lacrosse player Matt Danowski, who was named to the USILA All-American first team three times and is an assistant coach for the Blue Devils.

The film stars Wagner Moura and Alinne Moraes. It was shot in Paulínia and Campinas in the state of São Paulo, and in Rio de Janeiro.  Plot  In 2011, João \\"Zero\\", a bitter but brilliant physicist, spends his days brooding over a fateful night 20 years before when he was publicly betrayed and humiliated at a college party by his then-girlfriend, Helena. He now heads one of the largest scientific projects in Brazil, but his eccentricities and tantrums have brought him to the verge of being fired by his former college roommate and current sponsor, Sandra, although she still believes in his project, and tries to defend him. Aided by his best friend and fellow scientist, Otávio, João turns on the unfinished machine he has developed that was supposed to ensure his wealth as well as a new source of sustainable energy. Entering the machine, he thinks of the night when Helena humiliated him. To his surprise, the reaction caused by the machine opens a bridge to the past, leading him to the year 1991. In 1991, a confused João wakes up and tries to go to his apartment, but finds that the key does not match. Upon asking the date to a stranger, the realizes that he has traveled through time. He goes to the party, where he sees his younger self having sex with Helena, after which she tells him that she loves him. After she leaves to sing on stage, the future João tells his younger self that he will invent a time machine, and he has come back to fix things. They find the young Otávio, and the future João tells them future technical and political events, so they will have money for the rest of their lives. After this, João tells his younger self that Helena's ex-boyfriend, Ricardo, will bring her champagne with a drug, and due to the effects, she will humiliate him on stage, by putting honey and feathers on him. After this, Helena will go with Ricardo to Spain, becoming a model and never seeing João again. The young João meets up with Helena, and tells her not to drink Ricardo's champagne. She doesn't, and an excited João tells her that he's going to be rich, and they will be together for the rest of their lives. The future João, watching the scene, disappears. João wakes up in an alternate 2011 in which he is rich, but is not married to Helena. He learns that with his knowledge of the future, he founded the \\"Man From The Future\\" company; however, he has betrayed Otávio, divorced four times, and put Helena in jail after she was discovered holding a bag of his cocaine. He explains to Otávio that he is the João from the original timeline in the body of his new-timeline-self. After this, he has Helena released, and he donates to her all of his belongings. He reinstalls the time machine, dresses up as a spaceman, and then travels back to 1991. In 1991, the João in the spaceman suit finds the original-future João and the young João in their meeting; this last one faints of the impression. The spaceman-João tries to convince the original-future João that he must live his life normally, but the original-future João refuses. The spaceman-João holds him at gunpoint, and makes him leave and let the original events of the night unfold. However, they are both encountered by the alternate-future Otávio, who traveled back in time after João left the alternate 2011. Meanwhile, the young João meets with Helena, disregarding his meeting with his other selves as a dream, and Ricardo approaches them with the champagne. João, however, is the one who drinks it, and he becomes drugged. The original-future João and alternate-future Otávio, wanting to change events, tie the spaceman-João in a separate location, in where he meets the young Sandra, to whom he proves he is from the future by showing her his iPhone and having her record a video. She unties him. The original-future João and alternate-future Otávio find the Helena and the drugged João, and hold them at gunpoint. They bring them where the spaceman-João is, and since he has been untied, he knocks out Otávio, and ties the original-future João. The spaceman-João then tells Helena to leave the young João, become a model, and meet him again 20 years in the future. They bring the young João on stage, in which he is put honey and feathers, humiliated, and given the nickname \\"Zero\\". The alternate-future Otávio disappears, as well as the original-future João and spaceman-João. In 2011, after João enters the time machine and disappears, the spaceman João emerges, and destroys the source code of the time machine. He explains to a shocked Otávio that he has traveled through time, but the machine is too dangerous. He then shows him the video of the young Sandra, to prove his words. He leaves, and via Twitter he communicates with Helena, and they happily meet in an airport, where she fires Ricardo after 20 years of working with him. A year later, João is found not guilty of destroying a science project. After exiting the courthouse, they meet with Sandra. At this point, it is revealed that before Sandra untied him in 1991, he told her to invest in Google and sponsor in João's projects, meaning that this timeline was the original one all along. Knowing that they have money for the rest of their lives, Helena and João look ahead to a better life, although Helena tells João that he \\"cheated\\".

It has been identified by BirdLife International as a 220 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) for its significance for birds, especially estrildid finches. Description The IBA comprises the entire irrigated area of the Ord River Irrigation Scheme around and downstream of Kununurra, with the adjacent Lake Kununurra extending upstream from the town. The establishment of irrigated farmland has formed perennially moist areas of cumbungi and native wetland grasses, which support larger numbers of several bird species than does the surrounding non-irrigated bushland and dry pasture. The cumbungi and grasses occur along waterways and the edges of Lake Kununurra, as well as in agricultural fallows. The average annual rainfall is 790 mm, falling mainly from October to April. =History= The irrigation and drainage infrastructure was constructed in the early 1960s, with commercial farming taking place from 1963 when Kununurra's Ord Diversion Dam was completed. Using water first from Lake Kununurra, and later from Lake Argyle, a reservoir formed by the completion of the main Ord Dam in 1972, some 140 km2 of cattle grazing land became productive farmland. Farm blocks are typically 260-360 ha in size, on heavy, black cracking clay soils. The main crops include sugarcane, sandalwood, fruit, vegetables and cotton.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Ord Irrigation Area. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 12/09/2011.

Other birds found in the IBA include brolgas, little curlews and black-backed bitterns.

Lycoperdonosis is a respiratory disease caused by the inhalation of large amounts of spores from mature puffballs. It is classified as a hypersensitivity pneumonitis (also called extrinsic allergic alveolitis)—an inflammation of the alveoli within the lung caused by hypersensitivity to inhaled natural dusts. It is one of several types of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by different agents that have similar clinical features. Typical progression of the disease includes symptoms of a cold hours after spore inhalation, followed by nausea, rapid pulse, crepitant rales (a sound like that made by rubbing hairs between the fingers, heard at the end of inhalation), and dyspnea. Chest radiographs reveal the presence of lung nodules. The early symptoms presented in combination with pulmonary abnormalities apparent on chest radiographs may lead to misdiagnosis of the disease as tuberculosis, histiocytosis, or pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii. Lycoperdonosis is generally treated with corticosteroids, which decrease the inflammatory response; these are sometimes given in conjunction with antimicrobials. The disease was first described in the medical literature in 1967 by R.D. Strand and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine. In 1976, a 4-year-old was reported developing the disease in Norway after purposely inhaling a large quantity of Lycoperdon spores to stop a nosebleed. Lycoperdon species are sometimes used in folk medicine in the belief that their spores have haemostatic properties. A 1997 case report discussed several instances of teenagers inhaling the spores. In one severe case, the individual inhaled enough spores so as to be able to blow them out of his mouth. He underwent bronchoscopy and then had to be on life support before recovering in about four weeks. In another instance, a teenager spent 18 days in a coma, had portions of his lung removed, and suffered severe liver damage. In Wisconsin, eight teenagers who inhaled spores at a party presented clinical symptoms such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia, and fatigue within a week. Five of the eight required hospitalization; of these, two required intubation to assist in breathing. The disease is rare, possibly because of the large quantity of spores that need to be inhaled for clinical effects to occur. Lycoperdonosis also occurs in dogs; in the few reported cases, the animals had been playing or digging in areas known to contain puffballs. Known species of puffballs implicated in the etiology of the published cases include the widespread Lycoperdon perlatum (the \\"devil's snuff-box\\", L. gemmatum) and Calvatia gigantea, both of the family Lycoperdaceae.

The struggles by the eunuchs, led by him, against the chancellor Cui Yin, who wanted to eliminate the powerful eunuchs, led to the eunuchs' kidnapping of Emperor Zhaozong and then a major military confrontation between two powerful warlords — the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Cui's ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Eventually, Li, unable to stand up to Zhu's military pressure, surrendered the emperor to him and slaughtered Han and the other eunuchs. After this, Zhu was in firm control of the imperial court, leading to the dynasty's end four years later and its replacement by Zhu's Later Liang.  Background  It is not known when Han Quanhui was born. It is known that at one point, both he and fellow eunuch Zhang Yanhong (張彥弘) served as monitors of the Fengxiang army, but Han was later recalled to the imperial capital Chang'an to serve as a director of the palace communications (Shumishi) and was serving in that post as of early 901, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong.New Book of Tang, vol. 208.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262.As, typically, there would be two directors of palace communications at one time, and Wang Yanfan and Xue Qiwo were the directors of palace communications until early 901 when Wang Yanfan was executed for his involvement in a coup against Emperor Zhaozong and Xue, who was also involved, committed suicide, Han was probably made a director of palace communications at that time. Earlier (in late 900), Emperor Zhaozong had been briefly deposed and imprisoned by the eunuch commanders of the Shence Armies, Liu Jishu and Wang Zhongxian (王仲先) and the directors of palace communications Wang Yanfan (王彥範) and Xue Qiwo (薛齊偓), but was restored in early 901 in a countercoup led by the Shence Army officers Sun Dezhao (孫德昭), Dong Yanbi (董彥弼), and Zhou Chenghui (周承誨). (For their contributions, Sun, Dong, and Zhou were all bestowed the imperial surname of Li, and Sun and Zhou were given new names of Jizhao (繼昭) and Jihui (繼誨) respectively.) After the countercoup, the chancellor Cui Yin suggested transferring the command of the Shence Armies from eunuchs (which had traditionally been the case) to the chancellors — himself and Lu Yi — to permanently end the eunuchs' hold on the armies. When Emperor Zhaozong asked Li Jizhao, Li Jihui, and Li Yanbi for their opinions, however, they opposed. Emperor Zhaozong thereafter decided to put Han and Zhang in command of the Shence Armies. He initially tried to make the retired eunuch Yan Zunmei (嚴尊美) the overseer of both Shence Armies, but Yan declined. Cui, apprehensive of this development, secretly requested Fengxiang's military governor Li Maozhen, who was in Chang'an at that time to pay tribute to Emperor Zhaozong, to leave a detachment of 2,000 men at Chang'an, to counterbalance the Shence Armies. Li Maozhen agreed, and left his adoptive son Li Jiyun (李繼筠) in charge of the Fengxiang detachment.  Kidnapping of Emperor Zhaozong  Meanwhile, Cui Yin tried to cut down on the independent financial resources of the Shence Armies by ending the yeast monopoly that the army (which included the Shence Armies) held and allowing the general population to sell yeast. This also ended the monopoly that the circuit armies held. Li Maozhen did not want to give up the Fengxiang army's hold on the yeast monopoly, and went to Chang'an to try to dissuade Emperor Zhaozong from implementing Cui's proposal. After Li Maozhen arrived at Chang'an to discuss this matter with Emperor Zhaozong, Han Quanhui did all he could to foster a relationship with Li Maozhen, and Cui, seeing this, began to fear a Han/Li Maozhen alliance. He thus strengthened his alliance with Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit. Emperor Zhaozong had believed that after the countercoup that restored him to the throne, the eunuchs would be held in check in his restored administration. However, that turned out to be not the case — with Han and Zhang Yanhong in command of the Shence Armies, they got Li Jihui and Li Yanbi (who, along with Li Jizhao, received independent commands after the countercoup), in addition to Li Maozhen, on their side as well. Cui suggested to Emperor Zhaozong that all eunuchs be slaughtered and replaced with ladies in waiting. Emperor Zhaozong was initially resistant to the proposal, and the eunuchs eventually found out. Fearing that Emperor Zhaozong would eventually accept Cui's proposal, they had the Shence Army soldiers surround the palace and claim that Cui had been refusing to provide them with winter clothes. Emperor Zhaozong had to remove Cui from his secondary post as the director of salt and iron monopolies to placate the soldiers. Cui became aware that the eunuchs knew of his proposal. Fearing that the eunuchs would attack and kill him, he wrote to Zhu, requesting that he bring an army to Chang'an to wipe out the eunuchs. After receiving the letter in fall 901, Zhu mobilized his troops and headed toward Chang'an. Han, hearing of Zhu's impending arrival, had Li Jihui and Li Yanbi take their soldiers to the palace to force Emperor Zhaozong and his household to head for Fengxiang. The imperial officials, led by Cui, remained at Chang'an, protected by Li Jizhao (who refused to side with the eunuchs). The eunuchs and their allies then took the emperor to Fengxiang after setting the palace on fire.  At Fengxiang  Zhu Quanzhong quickly put Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege, despite Han Quanhui's issuance of edicts in Emperor Zhaozong's name claiming that his visit to Fengxiang was a voluntary one and ordering him to return to Xuanwu. In addition, Zhu attacked Li Maozhen's other holdings in the Guanzhong region, gradually forcing them to surrender to him. Later in 901, Han sent eunuchs with edicts in Emperor Zhaozong's name, ordering the southeastern circuits to attack Zhu; those eunuchs were intercepted and killed by Feng Xingxi the military governor of Rongzhao Circuit (戎昭, headquartered in modern Ankang, Shaanxi) and never reached their destination. Li Maozhen sought aid from Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan); Wang reacted by outwardly claiming to rebuke Zhu, but instead sending secret messengers to Zhu to encourage him to continue the campaign, while he himself attacked Li Maozhen's possessions south of the Qinling Mountains, taking them one by one. By late 902, Fengxiang was in a dire strait — with Li Maozhen's Guanzhong possessions having fallen into Zhu's hands and southern possessions into Wang's hands, Fengxiang was running out of food, causing the people to resort to cannibalism. Li Maozhen began making secret overtures to Zhu, offering to kill the eunuchs and surrender the emperor to him while blaming Han for seizing the emperor. In spring 903, after Li Maozhen presented the proposal to Emperor Zhaozong, Emperor Zhaozong issued an order to have Han, Zhang Yanfan, the directors of palace communications Yuan Yijian (袁易簡) and Zhou Jingrong (周敬容), a group of other high-level eunuchs, Li Jihui, Li Yanbi, and Li Jiyun all executed. Their heads were presented to Zhu, who eventually agreed to peace with Li Maozhen.  Notes and references  * New Book of Tang, vol. 208. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 262, 263.

They were appointed as the founding members of the Puerto Rico Anemia Commission, established in 1904 by the Insular Government. Ashford had discovered that hookworm infestation was the principal cause of anemia on the island. He served on the Commission from 1904–1906. Medical research in Puerto Rico had its beginning with the \\"First Anemia Commission.\\" In 1911, Ashford together with doctors Isaac Gonzalez Martinez, Pedro Gutiérrez Igaravides and Walter King, proposed that the local government create an Institute of Tropical Medicine to further the research initiated by the Anemia Commissions. In 1912, the local legislature approved the proposal and established the Institute of Tropical Medicine.Fundador - Biografía del Doctor Isaac González Martínez =School of Tropical Medicine= The President of the Puerto Rican Senate, Antonio R. Barceló, was attending a conference in New York City when he was approached by professors Jose Antonio Lopez Antongiorgi and Abraham L. Goodman from the Medical School of Columbia University. They spoke about the need for establishing a medical school in Puerto Rico where scientific investigations could be conducted into tropical diseases. Senator Barceló became interested in the idea and, on June 23, 1924, he sponsored the legislation which provided Governor Horace Towner, with the prerequisite funding for the school.Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barceló, 1868-1938; by: Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); The School of Tropical Medicine was formally dedicated in 1925. It was the first school in the United States and its territories, founded for the purpose of researching and training physicians in the cause and prevention of tropical diseases. Located in Puerta de Tierra, San Juan, the school's building is one of the few examples of the Neo-Plateresque architectural style on the Island. In 1926, new legislation expanded the Institute of Tropical Medicine into the School of Tropical Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico, which was operated under the sponsorship of Columbia University. An agreement was made between the University of Puerto Rico and Columbia University in regard to the finances of the institution. Having completed a 30-year Army career, Ashford assumed a full-time faculty position at the school and continued his interest in tropical medicine.Tropical School of Medicine of Puerto Rico Together with doctors Isaac González Martínez and Ramón M. Suárez Calderon, he continued his research and study of anemia. González Martínez conducted many investigations and experiments in parasitology, bilharzia, lepra and typhoid fever.Isaac González Martínez, Retrieved October 4, 2008 During his years at the institution, González Martínez founded Anales de Medicina de Puerto Rico, a scientific journal. He was elected president of the Medical Academy of Puerto Rico in 1917. In 1919, he published a chapter on his findings of the Intestinal Bilharzias in the book La Práctica de la Medicina en el Trópico. Suárez Calderon identified the proper and effective treatment of a type of anemia known as tropical sprue, the application of complex methods, such as electrocardiography and radioisotope, to be used in clinics and the identification and treatment of the disease which causes heart rheumatism. Suárez Calderon continued Ashford's work and investigations on anemia after the latter's death. In 1938, he published his scientific findings on tropical sprue.Revista para los Medicos de Puerto Rico In 1927, the institution offered courses in tropical medicine and nutrition. Most of the students continued their graduate work at Columbia University. In May 1930, the University of Puerto Rico offered two degrees of Master of Arts for the students who continued their education and work at the School of Tropical Medicine. In 1931, William B. Castle and his assistant Cornelius P. Rhoads studied hookworm and tropical sprue in relation to anemia. They were able to treat some patients with liver extract, which efficacy was being studied. Dr. George C. Payne continued to study anemia in 1936 and 1937.\\"Puerto Rico and the Rhoads \\"joke\\" of extermination\\"; Published by Regina Emmanuelle =UPR School of Medicine= The agreement between the University of Puerto Rico and Columbia University in regard to the School of Tropical Medicine was terminated by mutual consent in 1948. In May 1949, the Puerto Rican Legislature authorized the creation of the School of Medicine of the University of Puerto Rico, also known as the UPR School of Medicine. The School of Tropical Medicine was merged into the new school, and admitted its first class in August 1950.

The Convention requires member states to meet the following requirements: * Development of strategies, plans or programs for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity (Article 6); * Monitoring and identification activities to ensure sustainable use of biological diversity (Article 7); * Development of protected areas to conserve biological diversity (Article 8); * Development of guidelines and regulations to protect the ecosystems and natural habitats in the conservation areas (Article 8); * Requirement for sustainable development in areas adjacent to protected areas (Article 8). For Australia to meet the requirements of the treaty, conservation strategies need to be integrated into the development process, including land-use planning, marine and coastal zone planning, forest management plans, and environmental impact assessment. To address the requirements of the treaty, the Government of New South Wales established marine parks with zoning that allows or prohibits particular activities with the aim of conserving the diversity of marine life and ensuring that marine resources are carefully managed for use and enjoyment now and in the future. Review of zoning On 25 May 2011, Government of New South Wales proposed to undertake a scientific audit of the effectiveness of the current marine park zones. On 26 May 2011, the new zoning plan implemented by the former government on 1 March 2011 was abolished and the original zoning plan in place since 2002 restored because of \\"concerns about the consultation process\\" and pending the outcomes of the audit.

Biography Hatch was born in Lincoln, Addison County, Vermont. In 1840, Hatch and his entire family joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, where the majority of the Latter Day Saints were gathering. In 1850, Hatch and four of his siblings moved to Utah Territory. Hatch settled in Lehi, Utah, where he established himself as a merchant and innkeeper. He often traveled east to obtain merchandise and to help other Mormon pioneers come to Utah. He made a total of 11 trips between the Missouri River and Utah Territory before the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869. From 1864 to 1867, Hatch was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the United Kingdom. During this time, he was the president of the Manchester and then Birmingham conferences of the LDS Church. Hatch returned home to Utah after touring western Europe in 1867. Abram Hatch house in Heber City, Wasatch County, Utah. Upon arriving in Utah, Hatch became the presiding bishop in Wasatch County.Andrew Jenson, LDS Biographical Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, p. 358. In the mid-19th century the Church had regional presiding bishops that oversaw multiple local bishops in temporal matters. This office was especially prevalent in the Salt Lake Stake which covered multiple counties in Utah. With the organization of Wasatch and several other new stakes in 1877 the office of regional presiding bishop was largely eliminated, which also coincided with Hatch's release from this office and calling as a stake president. When the Wasatch Stake was organized in 1877, Hatch became its first president and would hold this position until 1901. In this capacity, Hatch helped to found many settlements in Wasatch County and elsewhere in Utah: today, along with his brother Jeremiah Hatch, he is recognized as the founder of Vernal, Utah. Hatch served as probate judge of Wasatch County, the main judicial office in Territorial Utah, especially since it was the highest judicial office that the people and not the outsider federal appointment process chose. Hatch was a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature for 23 years. Hatch was the first representative who proposed that women in Utah be given the vote; the territory granted the vote to women in 1870. The voting rights of women in the territory were abolished by the federal Edmunds–Tucker Act in 1887. Hatch became a member of the Council of Fifty on June 29, 1883, and was a member until his death. Hatch was married to Parmelia Jane Lott from 1852 until her death in 1880; the couple had seven children. In 1882, after his first wife's death, Hatch married Ruth Woolley, with whom he had six children, including Vermont Hatch. Hatch died in Heber City, Utah at age 81. He was buried in Heber City Cemetery. Legacy In 1975, Hatch's house in Heber City was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Wasatch County, Utah. Hatch's older brother Jeremiah is a great-grandfather of U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch. Notes References *Wm. James Mortimer (1963).

The original German title was Der satanarchäolügenialkohöllische Wunschpunsch.  Plot  The evil sorcerer Beelzebub Preposteror has contracted with His Excellency, the Minister of Pitch Darkness, to perform a certain number of evil deeds each year. This year, however, he did not meet the requirement because the High Council of the Animals has sent the cat Maurizio as a spy, which forces Beelzebub to be more cautious. He is threatened with a \\"seizure\\" by Maledictus T. Maggot, an official of the devil, should he not fulfill his quota of evil deeds until midnight. On New Year's Eve (called, not unimportantly for the plot, St. Sylvester's Day in Germany) he joins forces with the evil witch Tyrannia Vampirella, who has the same problem due to the raven Jacob who is spying on her. Together they try to brew the eponymous Notion Potion that will grant them all wishes, in order to fulfill their part of the contract before midnight. If they succeeded to brew the potion they wouldn't even have to keep it secret from the animals, because due to the nature of the potion every wish they make will have the exact opposite effect - i.e. if they wish someone good health, he'll become sick instead. The plot starts on New Year's Eve at 5 pm and the chapters each represent one hour until midnight to illustrate the increasing time pressure that the characters are under. On the one hand, the sorcerers have to complete a five-meter-long recipe to brew the potion, while constantly getting in each other's way. On the other, the cat and the raven must find a way to stop their evil plan while tackling their own problems, namely the obesity of the cat and the chronic diseases of the raven. As the animals, in their search for help, arrive in the city near the cathedral, Jacob remembers a weakness of the potion: if the potion has not been fully drunk up before the first ring of the bell at midnight, the potion won't reverse the meaning of the wishes - as expected by the two sorcerers - but instead grants them as wished. So they need such a bell tone. After the first enthusiasm, however, Jacob soon realizes the impossibility of this idea since that tone can only come from the real New Year's chime exactly at midnight. Maurizio is nevertheless thrilled by this unexpected glimmer of hope and ignores all of Jacob’s objections and warnings. Since the cathedral tower is locked, Mauricio climbs up the icy tower from outside in darkness and storms. Jacob reluctantly follows him because he is worried about his friend’s wellbeing. With the last of their strength, they reach the belfry where they pass out. When they wake up, they are surprised to find themselves facing Pope Sylvester I, who, as every year, has appeared from the hereafter to ring the bells. Although it will only ring at midnight, he is able to give the animals a frozen sound of the midnight chime prematurely since space and time play no role for him as a saint. So, as a last challenge, the animals have to put this tone into the potion without the magicians noticing. Thanks to the saint, who enables them to fly back to the Villa Nightmare at the speed of sound, they just manage to do this,. The magicians begin their intended work and wish the world all the best with every sip from the wishing punch. This punch, however, is strongly alcoholic.Shortly before midnight they decide, already dead drunk, to \\"wish their two pets something good\\". The two animals then become completely healthy and their lifetime wishes are fulfilled. The magicians are stunned, but too drunk to understand what had happened. While the raven and the cat flee from the house, the magicians now try to curse each other by means of the wishing punch, but this fails completely. When a few seconds before midnight they finally realize what is going on, it is already too late. The punch is used up and they fall into a deep alcohol coma. While His Hellish Excellency has Maledictus T. Maggot impound the magicians' souls after midnight, the raven and the tomcat are outside and enthusiastically plan their future while they watch the sky as the world turns into a bright future.

The Crane-Phillips House is now a museum operated by the Cranford Historical Society that offers visitors a glimpse of what life was like for a modest family in the Victorian era of opulence. It illustrates the late 19th century as the era of invention and highlights inventions that changed everyday life for the average person by way of the house's second owners, the Phillips family.

Mitchell (1846–1905) was an American song lyricist and newspaperman who wrote lyrics for a number of popular songs in the 1870s.Americana, Volume 7, Part 1, p. 536 (1912) (\\"One of the best known men in the profession forty years ago was Samuel N. Mitchell, a bard of no small note, the writer of hundreds of songs, and associated with the newspapers for many years and the only one who could be found to ...\\")Story on Mitchell, Skaneateles Democrat (November 1905?) (reprinted story in column 5 from New Bedford Standard, lists many of Mitchell's popular songs, but noting that many are rarely song today, such being the nature of popular music)(28 November 1905). Songs and Their Writers, Boston Evening Transcript (New Bedford Standard article, more readable copy) Songwriter Sheet music cover for The Sweet Sunny Smile of My Darling (1877) Mitchell wrote lyrics for many hundreds of songs, and collaborated with a number of composers. One of his most popular songs during his life was Just Touch the Harp Gently, My Pretty Louise, first published in 1870. An 1890 profile of Mitchell in the Boston Globe reported that an astounding (and surely exaggerated) four million copies of the song had been sold.(11 December 1890). A Composer of Songs: He Wrote Sweet Ballads, But Others Got The Ducats, The Day (reprinted from the Boston Globe) Mitchell claimed to never have received any payment for the song, however, as the lyrics were \\"stolen bodily\\" from him and brought to London, where Charles Blamphin set them to music. It became popular in England, and eventually theatrical producer Lydia Thompson brought it back to America in the play Bluebeard, and it became popular in the United States as well. Not making a living on his creations, Mitchell was toiling in a newspaper mailroom despite his lyrical successes.(21 February 1891). Songs of the People, The Illustrated AmericanBooks at Brown, Volume 21, p. 192 (1966) Perhaps Mitchell's most enduring song is Put My Little Shoes Away, which he wrote with Charles E. Pratt in 1873.Erbsen, Wayne.

It is made up of Fijians (57 per cent), Indo-Fijians (37 per cent), Europeans, Chinese, other Pacific islanders, and people of mixed racial descent (6 per cent). Fiji has been in a state of political unrest since their independence from Britain in 1970. Normally the Fijian political system is one of a parliamentary representative democratic republic. There have been four military coups since Fiji's independence from Britain in 1970. Since 1987 the military has either had a significant influence in the politics of Fiji, or have been directly ruling. Fiji was governed by military-backed régime from December 2006 to September 2014, at which point a general election restored a parliamentary civilian government. International Treaties Fiji became a member of the United Nations 13 October 1970.Member States of the United Nations Fiji has acceded to some, but not the majority, of the key human rights treaties. It is a party to the conventions against racism (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination) and discrimination against women (Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women), and on the rights of the child (Convention on the rights of the Child). In March 2016, Fiji ratified the (Convention Against Torture). Fiji has not acceded to the covenants on civil and political rights (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), or on economic, social and cultural rights (International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural rights). Fiji is also not a party to the convention on persons with disabilities (Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities). Protection of human rights in the Constitution and domestic legislation The most current constitution of Fiji was introduced in 2013, laying the groundwork for the restoration of democracy. The fourth chapter of the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, titled the Bill of Rights, comprised a total of twenty three sections and contained provisions for human rights protections. The 1997 constitution was the supreme law of Fiji from the creation of it in 1997 until April 2009. However, it was suspended by President Josefa Iloilo in April 2009 after the Fijian Court of Appeal ruled that the military government that was in power, who took over as a result of a coup d’etat in 2006, illegal. Even though the Constitution of Fiji was abrogated in 2009, the President on 10 April 2009, issued the “Existing Law Decree 2009” stipulating that all “Existing Laws in force immediately before the 10th day of April 2009 shall continue in force....” “Existing Laws” meant all written laws other than the Constitution Amendment Act 1997. This decree guaranteed the continued existence of all human rights related local laws existing in Fiji during and including the time of the abrogation of the Constitution. The new Constitution introduced in 2013 includes a Bill of Rights (chapter 2, articles 6 to 45). It protects, among others, the right of habeas corpus, the right to due process, freedom of expression, freedom of movement and association, freedom of conscience, the right to privacy, the right to participate through elections in the political process, protection from discrimination (on any grounds including ethnicity, gender, social origin, sexual orientation, age, \\"economic or social or health status\\", disability or religion), property rights, the right to education, \\"the right of every person to work and to a just minimum wage\\", the right to adequate housing, access to food and water, and the right to health and to social security schemes. It also guarantees (article 40) \\"the right to a clean and healthy environment, which includes the right to have the natural world protected for the benefit of present and future generations\\". Fiji Human Rights Commission [Information here removed as copyright violation. The information may be found at its original source here.] The Human Rights Commission Decree 2009 was passed by the military regime to establish the Commission and lays the groundwork in its work in and out of the country. Since then, the Commission have played a vital role in promoting human rights in Fiji and advocating it abroad. During the 2009 Fijian constitutional crisis, the Fiji Human Rights Commission showed support for the then President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, stating that \\"the President had no choice but to abrogate the 1997 Constitution after the Fiji Court of Appeal ruled that the interim government was illegal.\\" However, the Head of the Fijian Human Rights Commission, Shaista Shameem, also stated that the Commission would act as if the Bill of Rights part of the Constitution was still legally in effect. Human Rights Violations The Universal Periodic Review, which is a progress which involves a review of the human rights records of the Member States of the UN, by the Human Rights Council, every four years, reviewed the human rights situation in Fiji in August 2009. “Fiji remains a military dictatorship that denies its citizens the right to take part in self-government through free and fair elections, as well as the freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and religion. Since the December 5, 2006 coup d'état, the military and police have arbitrarily arrested and detained human rights defenders, journalists and others perceived as critical of the administration. Four people have died in military or police custody and dozens of people have been intimidated, beaten, sexually assaulted, or subjected to degrading treatment. Fiji's interim administration continues to fail to uphold the rule of law and has seriously compromised the independence of the judiciary. No UN special procedures have visited since the 2006 coup. A visit by the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers is pending, though the Fiji government has failed to advise a suitable time for this visit. The government has not responded to the request to visit of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” Summary of main issues of concern in the Submission by the Human Rights Watch to the Universal Periodic Review on Fiji Key recent developments # Fiji ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT) in March 2016 # Fiji seeks UN Human Rights Security Council bid in 2015 but withdrew later with the Prime Minister stating that Fiji should tackle current issues that need immediate actions such as climate change and global warming first before officially bidding for a seat on the Council \\"Fiji declines to bid for UN Human Rights Council\\" , Fiji Times, March 3, 2017 # Creation of the People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress in 2008 to improve human rights relations in the country and abroad.\\"Building a Better Fiji for All through a People's Charter for Change and Progress\\" , Fiji government website, April 2007 # The Human Rights Commission Decree 2009 passed by the military regime to establish the Commission and lays the groundwork for its work in and out of the country. =Areas of key concern= # Equality and non-discrimination # Freedom of religion or belief, expression, association and peaceful assembly, and right to participate in public and political life # Right to life, liberty, and security of the person # Administration of justice, including impunity, and the rule of law # Right to marriage and family life # Freedom of movement # Right to work and to just and favorable conditions of work # Right to education # Rights of Minorities and indigenous peoples Proposed Reforms In July 2009, the interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama announced that Fiji would have a new constitution by 2013.\\"Fiji constitution plan unveiled\\" BBC News, July 1, 2009 This new constitution would derive from the People's Charter for Change, Peace and Progress and well as from “extensive consultations with political parties, non-governmental organizations and ordinary citizens.\\"Work on Fiji's Constitution to start in 3 years\\" , Fiji Times, July 1, 2009\\"PM Bainimarama - A Strategic Framework for Change\\" , Fiji government website, July 1, 2009 The United Nations special rapporteur has urged the government of Fiji to strengthen its Human Rights Commission by ratifying several key international agreements including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the ILO agreement on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989. He urged the strengthening of the Fiji's Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission and the peaceful dealing with hate speech on social media without infringing on people's freedom of expression.

Morse is located along the Bad River south- southeast of Mellen. History In 1881 the newly formed Bad River Lumbering and Improvement Company began building a milltown where the Wisconsin Central Railroad line touched the Bad River. The town would later be named Morse, but it was initially called Jacob's Station, named after William H. Jacobs, the leader of the Bad River Company. At the same time they began improving a stretch of the Bad River for driving logs from their timber lands upstream to the mill. By next spring the company had completed the sawmill, a shingle and lath mill, a boarding house, a store, a blacksmith shop, and lumber sheds. The mill began sawing in June 1882. That winter the company ran three logging camps out in their forests. In 1884 the mill employed 50 to 75 men and shipped out as many as five railcars of lumber a day. The town had added a hotel named the Bad River House, and in 1887 a schoolhouse. In 1887 the company town and its holdings were purchased by the Penokee Lumber Company, an enterprise of some New York investors and Augustus W. Morse. Morse, from Saginaw, Michigan, was the local manager. Under his direction machinery was upgraded, the plant was reorganized, and he added electricity and a planing mill. To reduce the hazard of fire, scraps of wood were cleared from the mill's yard daily and large barrels of water stood watch. The mill kept about 70 Clydesdales in its stable. It was held up by the Northwestern Lumberman journal as a model mill. The town's name changed to Morse in 1889. Most of the lumber sawed in this period went west by rail to Omaha or east to Tonawanda, New York via the Wisconsin Central Railroad to Ashland and via ships on the Great Lakes. 275 men worked for the company and it provided twenty employee houses. All buildings, including the homes, were painted \\"Morse red.\\" In 1890 Penokee contracted to ship 3,000,000 feet of lumber to England. In the dry year of 1891 when the rivers were too low to drive logs, the mill ran out of logs and had to shut down for a while in the fall. In 1892, when millworkers went on strike along the Wisconsin River to reduce their work day to ten hours, the workers at Morse didn't strike, but the Penokee Lumber Company adopted the ten-hour day anyway. 600 people lived in Morse in 1895. Then Penokee Lumber shut down, possibly due to its timber running out, possibly a result of the Panic of 1893. In 1900 F. B. Chase from Oshkosh bought the town and timber nearby and resumed logging and milling operations. But in 1903 a fire destroyed the sawmill. Many people moved away. In 1917 the Kneeland-McClurg Lumber Company of Phillips began to use Morse as staging point for shipping logs to its sawmill in Phillips. Later it rebuilt a sawmill in Morse and built homes and a boarding house for the millworkers there. Population grew until the town had to expand the school. After Kneeland-McClurg left in the early 1930s, manufacturing was intermittent. In the early 1940s the Templetons used the old mill's kilns to manufacture cedar shingles. In 1946, Cohen and Carlson started making hampers and ladders. Today only a handful of buildings remain.

It is a shrub with pinnate leaves, and small groups of pink flowers in leaf axils. It grows in coastal areas in forest. Description Boronia mollis is an erect shrub that grows to high with branches densely covered with star-like hairs but which become hairless as they age. The leaves have mostly between three and nine leaflets and are long and wide in outline on a petiole long. The end leaflet is broadly elliptic, long and wide and the side leaflets are shorter and narrower than the end leaflet. The leaflets are usually glabrous on the upper surface and paler with a few hairs below. The leaves have an unpleasant citrus/bitumen type scent. Between two and six, usually three flowers are arranged in leaf axils on a pedicel long. The four sepals are long and about wide but enlarge as the fruit develops and are hairy on the back. The four petals are pale to deep pink, mostly long and wide but enlarge slightly as the fruit develops and are hairy on the back. The bases of the petals do not overlap. There are eight stamens, with those nearest the sepals longer than those near the petals and the anthers are yellow. Flowering occurs from June to November. Taxonomy and naming Boronia mollis was first formally described by John Lindley from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham and the description was published in Edwards's Botanical Register. The original specimen was collected by the Nepean River in 1825. The specific epithet (mollis) is a Latin word meaning \\"soft\\", referring to the leaf, and the hairs on the stem. Distribution and habitat Soft boronia is a rare species that grows in dry eucalypt forest from the Kendall district to the Wollemi and Blue Mountains National Parks. Use in horticulture This is one of the hardier boronias and is popular in cultivation. It requires moist but well-drained soil, preferably in dappled shade.

The television show aired on The CW as part of that network's \\"Daytime\\" block (the name is no longer used on-air but remains as the definition of the block for the network's affiliation agreements). The Bill Cunningham Show, produced by ITV Studios America, debuted on September 19, 2011, and lasted until September 9, 2016. In the first season before the move to the CW, the program had limited distribution, airing only on Tribune Broadcasting owned stations, such as KAUT-TV/Oklahoma City, WGNT/Norfolk, and Raycom Media-owned WXIX in Cunningham's hometown of Cincinnati.\\"New Season, New Timeslots\\" from Cincinnati Enquirer (August 31, 2011) In February 2012, The CW announced that the program would be distributed nationwide for the 2012–13 season, as part of the network's CW Daytime lineup; the series made its CW debut on September 17, 2012, replacing Dr. Drew's Lifechangers. In November 2013, The Bill Cunningham Show was renewed for a fourth season. On May 27, 2016, Cunningham announced that he would not sign a new contract, resulting in cancellation of the show. The Robert Irvine Show, hosted by Robert Irvine, replaced it on September 12, 2016. Background The series offers the traditional tabloid-style conflict-resolution format with Cunningham's conservative point of view on the subjects presented. An expert weighs in and comments with questions and comments from audience members. The hour-long show is taped in front of a live audience at NEP Broadcasting's Penn Studios. The show is produced by former Montel producer Kim Brechka. Ratings In New York City, where the show airs locally on CW affiliate WPIX, The Bill Cunningham Show averaged a 0.7 in adults 18–49 in January — better than any other talk show in the market, across all timeslots. On February 9, 2012, it won its time slot with a 1.2 rating in adults 25–54 (it also finished first in that time slot in the demo in Los Angeles and Dallas). During the second week of the February 2012 sweeps period (through February 9), airings of The Bill Cunningham Show on WPIX averaged a 1.4 household rating. Cancellation On May 27, 2016, Cunningham announced that he had opted not to sign a new contract to continue the show, citing a grinding taping schedule which included recording all the episodes of the last season of the series between August and September 2015 before the season started, which kept him away from family in Cincinnati and disrupted the schedule for his WLW radio show. The new contract also included a non-negotiable three-year commitment that Cunningham was unable to agree to. The Robert Irvine Show, a talk show hosted by Food Network personality Robert Irvine, replaced it in September 2016.

They then moved to New Zealand, where she studied fashion design, and the two started the Chandler House department store, with Tzarev designing clothing sold there. Chandler House achieved national success, becoming a chain of ten stores, and was sold in 1986 for $10 million. Artistic career Peace by Ana Tzarev, displayed on Millbank, London In December 2008, she opened the Ana Tzarev Gallery at 24 West 57th Street close to Fifth Avenue, New York. The 14,000 square feet, two-floor gallery was designed by James Harb Architects, and only shows her work, with the first exhibition being entitled Voyage of Discovery, even though she had \\"never sold a painting or held a public viewing of her work\\". The rent on the gallery space was $2 million a year, and her billionaire son Richard Chandler loaned her $4 million to launch the gallery. The gallery was still open in 2013.

He served as chair of the California High Speed Rail Authority from 2001-2003. He currently chairs the advisory board of the United States High Speed Rail Association, and he chairs the National Heritage Area Project for Santa Clara County, California. The New York Times calls Diridon \\"a tireless advocate of public transport for the Bay Area.\\" Diridon has also been active in Silicon Valley in leadership on environmental issues, the arts and culture, higher education, community organizations, and philanthropy. Early life and education An Italian- American, Rod Diridon Sr. was born on February 8, 1939 in Yreka, California, the son of a railroad brakeman and a piano teacher. He grew up in the small town of Dunsmuir, at the foot of Mt. Shasta in Siskiyou County, California. Diridon worked his way through college as a railroad brakeman and fireman. He graduated from San Jose State University in 1961 with a BS in accounting and finance, continuing to earn a Master of Science in business administration with a concentration in statistics in 1963. Diridon then attended US Naval Officer's Candidate School and served on active duty in the US Navy from 1963-1967. Diridon served two combat tours on destroyers in Vietnam as an anti-submarine warfare officer and a weapons officer. His collateral duties included serving as ship's chaplain, cryptographer, auditor, legal officer, and communications officer. He completed his service with the rank of lieutenant jr. grade. Career After returning from Vietnam, Diridon became a management systems analyst at Lockheed Missile and Space Corporation in Sunnyvale, California. He founded the Decision Research Institute in 1969, which did statistical research, needs assessments, and organizational consulting for public agencies and candidates for public office. Chairing his neighborhood homeowners' association in Saratoga, California, Diridon successfully advocated for retention of a neighborhood park, mobilizing the support of 17 other homeowners' associations in the city. He was then approached by local leaders and encouraged to run for the Saratoga City Council. Diridon was first elected as the youngest-ever member of the Saratoga City Council in 1973.Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors , \\"Congratulatory Proclamation\\" (June 1st, 2002 - retrieved on September 12th, 2011).

During his service on the Board, Diridon chaired several San Francisco Bay Area regional government agencies, including the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD). The papers from Diridon's 24 years in public office are archived at San Jose's Martin Luther King, Jr. Library. Silicon Valley transportation leadership After he chaired the successful 1976 campaign for the first half-cent sales tax for a transit district in California, Diridon became known as \\"the father of modern transit service\\" in Silicon Valley. The sales tax funded, among other projects, a light rail system for Santa Clara County. While in office, Diridon chaired nine public rail construction and operation projects. These included the Santa Clara County Rapid Transit Development Project, which created a master plan for transportation for Silicon Valley. Diridon proposed the half-cent sales tax to fund transportation projects and chaired the 1976 campaign that won voter approval of the tax. From 1975-1991, Diridon chaired the Guadalupe Corridor Light Rail Project Joint Powers Board to design and build that 21-mile project. Following that, Diridon chaired the 1982-1996 project to design and build the Tasman East Corridor and Tasman Corridor West light rail projects. Beginning in 1974, Diridon convened and chaired the Peninsula Transportation Alternatives Project that led to the CalTrain commuter rail system from San Francisco to San Jose and Gilroy. He served on the Joint Powers Board that guided the negotiations to acquire and manage that system until his retirement in 1995. From 1982-1995, Diridon convened and chaired the Vasona Corridor Light Rail Joint Powers Board that designed and built the light rail line from San Jose to Los Gatos. He assisted the creation of Joint Powers Boards to begin and operate commuter rail systems between Stockton, in California's Central Valley, and San Jose (the Altamont Express), and for the Capitol Corridor rail between Sacramento and San Jose. Beginning in 1988, Diridon chaired the San Jose Station Study Joint Powers Board to determine whether the historic main Southern Pacific/Amtrak train station in downtown San Jose should be retained after being damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The study recommended the retention of the station and expansion of the facilities to accommodate additional rail service including CalTrain, light rail, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, high speed rail, a bus interchange point, and the Capitol Corridor and Altamont Express trains. The construction was completed in 1994. San Jose's Diridon Station was renamed for Rod Diridon in 1994 at the time of his retirement from the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. California High Speed Rail Authority In 2000, Diridon was appointed to the California High Speed Rail Authority by Governor Gray Davis and was then re-appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Diridon chaired the Authority Board from 2001-2003, serving two years beyond the eight-year limit for the board and stepping down in 2010.San Jose Mercury News , \\"Longtime San Jose transportation leader Rod Diridon Sr. leaves high speed rail authority board,\\" by Tracy Seipel (December 31st, 2010 - retrieved on September 12th, 2011). During his tenure as Chair, the California state legislature authorized a ballot measure for bond funding of the high speed rail project, Proposition 1A, which was approved by voters in 2008. National and international transportation leadership Diridon has served as vice chair of the International Association of Public Transport (UITP) in Brussels, Belgium. He has chaired the American Public Transit Association (APTA) and its High Speed Intercity Rail Committee, and he co-founded APTA's Diversity Council. Diridon chaired the National Council of University Transportation Centers (CUTC). Mineta Transportation Institute In collaboration with then-House Transportation Committee Chairman Norman Y Mineta, Diridon prepared the legislative language for Congress to create a new university-based transportation research center that focused on mass transportation policy studies. Through the 1991 ISTEA legislation, the US Congress authorized the creation of the new center. Santa Clara County voted in term limits for county officials in November 1992, precipitating Diridon's retirement from the county Board of Supervisors. After his retirement at the end of 1994, Diridion became the founding executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute (MTI), based at San Jose State University. Diridon directed the Institute from 1993-2014. He is now the emeritus executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute.Mineta Transportation Institute , \\"Faculty\\" (retrieved on September 12th, 2011). Under his leadership, MTI performed an annual needs assessment with the US Department of Transportation and California Department of Transportation, which identified research priorities. Based on these priorities, MTI conducts peer-reviewed research involving teams of academic and professional specialists, distributing the reports via publications, conferences, and the Internet. MTI research focuses on best practices internationally, through case studies on issues such as transit systems security, transportation financing, and transportation-related land use policies and sustainability. A needs assessment in the early 1990s identified the lack of a master's degree program teaching transportation systems management in the United States. MTI designed a Master of Science in Transportation Management (MSTM) degree program, which was accepted for accreditation by the California State University Board of Trustees in 1996. Three specialized certificates are also offered—in transportation security, transportation finance, and high-speed rail management. Diridion arranged for the classes to be taught via the California Department of Transportation video-conference system at 28 locations throughout California. With degrees granted through San Jose State University, the program has graduated more than 300 students. Other higher education roles Rod Diridon chairs the board of Lincoln Law School of San Jose, which focuses on educating veterans, moderate- income, and minority students. Not-for-profit boards Diridon has chaired non-profit boards at the local and regional levels. He served as president of the San Jose Symphony, the San Jose Rotary Club, the San Jose Junior Chamber of Commerce (Jaycees), the San Jose United Service Organizations (USO), and the Central San Jose YMCA. He chaired the Santa Clara County Mental Health Association and is the founding chair of the Santa Clara County branch of the National Council on Alcoholism. He chaired the board of Breathe California of the Bay Area, formerly the American Lung Association. Environmental leadership Diridon is the immediate past chair of the Santa Clara County League of Conservation Voters. California Trolley and Railroad Corporation Diridon founded CTRC in 1982 to collect and restore historic trolley cars for use on rail lines in San Jose. He chaired CTRC from 1982-2014, retired for a year, and then resumed chairing the organization in 2016. In 2014, the CTRC historic trolley barn in San Jose's History Park, where work on the historic rolling stock is completed, was named the Rod Diridion Sr. Trolley Barn. Philanthropy Diridon served for 20 years as the chair of the Joseph B. Ridder Foundation, administering funds donated by friends of the late newspaper publisher, which funded journalism and mass communication fellowships primarily at San Jose State University. He also co-chaired the late-1990s fund drive efforts for three of the perimeter gate monuments for San Jose State University. He served on the Tower Foundation board at San Jose State University, which advises the university president and raises funds for the university. He established and funded Diridon Leadership Scholarships at the College of Business and the women's athletic program at San Jose State University. He worked to establish a scholarship endowment at the Mineta Transportation Institute, for which he is also a donor. Diridon founded the San Jose Symphony Foundation and served on its board. He served on the regional Wells Fargo Bank Corporate Advisory board. He chaired capital campaigns and annual fund drives for the San Jose Metropolitan YMCA, the Santa Clara County Music and Arts Foundation, and the California Trolley and Railroad Corporation, and for 11 years, he chaired the annual Jamboree and fund drive for the Santa Clara County Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Corporate boards Rod Diridon has served on a number of corporate boards, including the San Jose Business Bank and San Jose National Bank. Since 1970, he has been a director of Empire Broadcasting Corporation, owner of South Bay radio stations KRTY 95.3 FM and KLIV 1590 AM, among the last locally owned radio stations in Silicon Valley. Honors and awards In 1973, Diridon was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in America, by the US Junior Chamber of Commerce.

It is suited to all types of roof, including flat, pitched, and domed. History The concept of liquid roofing has existed since (at least) the early 1800s, when natural bitumen was combined with jute, straw, rag felt and other man made materials to provide a waterproofing solution for roofs. In the early twentieth century the manufacture of liquid roof coatings became a commercial activity, with the earliest coatings being based on liquefied rubber. The 1960s and 1970s saw the introduction of acrylics, acrylic emulsions, styrene butadienes and unsaturated polyesters, which led to improved quality and durability of the coatings. In 1975, the first water based elastomeric roof coatings were introduced. In the late 1980s, single component moisture-cured polyurethane coatings were developed and remain the basis of the majority of today's cold liquid applied roof coating technologies. Concept A typical liquid roofing installation Liquid roofing involves the application of a monolithic, fully bonded, liquid based coating to a roof. The coating cures to form a rubber- like elastomeric waterproof membrane, capable of stretching and returning to its original shape without damage. Such coating systems are usually reinforced with secondary materials such as glass-reinforced plastic to provide additional tensile strength. The coatings can be applied over most traditional roofing materials, including felt, asphalt, bitumen, and concrete. Liquid spray-applied roofing membranes have been one of the fastest growing roofing systems in North America and Europe.https://www.wbdg.org/resources/integrity- testing-roofing-and-waterproofing-membranes Benefits =Cost- effectiveness= The process of liquid roofing provides a cost-effective method of making a new or existing roof waterproof. It can deliver up to 25 years performance depending on the coating system employed. It is estimated that liquid roofing is 70% less expensive than overall roof replacement in refurbishment situations. =High performance= Liquid roofing can be undertaken with high performance materials. Many of the products used in the liquid roofing process have been independently tested and their performance verified. In the United Kingdom, the leading testing and approvals house the British Board of Agrément (BBA) has been issuing approvals for liquid roofing systems since 1975. =Safety= Unlike the installation processes of felt, asphalt and bitumen membranes, liquid roofing does not involve hot works. Hot work on roofs is an extremely high-risk process, that poses a significant fire risk to contractors as well as the building and its occupants. The coating material used in the liquid roofing process is applied cold, thus negating any fire risk. =Encapsulation= When applied, liquid roofing systems encapsulate the surface they are applied to, preserving whatever is underneath and protecting it from weathering. This is especially desirable when dealing with asbestos roofs, as attempted removal of asbestos roofing can damage it, releasing material that can trigger asbestosis. Using a liquid coating system instead seals the asbestos, therefore making disturbance of the material more difficult. = Easy Application = Rapid curing even in winter. Excellent adhesion to all kinds of surfaces and chemical resistant. High resistance to extreme temperatures (between-40 °C and + 80 °C ). The membrane is completely waterproof and no heat or special equipment required.

They are known from his account of the Gallic War, and are generally also equated with the Caeracates mentioned briefly by Tacitus in his Histories.\\"Histories\\" 4.70. They were one of a group of tribes listed by his local informants as the Germani, along with the Eburones, Condrusi, Paemani (or Caemani), and Segni.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 2.4 and 6.32 These tribes are referred to as the \\"Germani Cisrhenani\\", to distinguish them from Germani living on the east of the Rhine, outside of the Gaulish and Roman area. Whether this meant that they actually spoke a Germanic language or not, is still uncertain, but it was claimed by Tacitus that these Germani were the original Germani, and that the term Germani as it came to be widely used was not the original meaning. He also said that the descendants of the original Germani in his time were the Tungri.Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, nongentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur.  Name  = Etymology = Both tribal names 'Caeroesi' and 'Caeracates' are generally considered to be Celtic, and linguistically related to the names of the Brittonic Caereni and the Pictish Kairènoi.'''' The name 'Caeracates' probably meant 'those of the sheep, sheep-folk', i.e. 'the shepherds'. It stems from the Gaulish root *caerac- ('ewe' or a similar animal; cf. Old Irish caera gen. caerach 'ewe', and Welsh caeriwrch 'roe deer') attached to the suffix -ates ('belonging to'). The variant 'Caeroesi' has an unexplained suffix () which is not found in either Celtic or Germanic languages, although -oso- is a known suffix in Gaulish. A Proto-Celtic root *caero- (< *capero) has thus been posited for the first element caer-, and compared with Latin caper or Old Norse hafr, 'billy goat'. Caeroesi could have meant 'the sheep', 'the rams', or 'rich in sheep', although its exact translation remains uncertain.' Alternative relations with the Old Irish cáera ('berry'), or with the Middle Irish céar ('dark brown') have also been proposed. = Toponymy = Boundary marker of the Pagus Carucum.The region of pagus Carucum, a subdivision of the Treveri during the Roman period, later known under the Franks as Pagus Coroascus, may be named after the tribe, although the linguistic connection is not regarded as certain by some scholars. The name has been discovered on a Roman era boundary marker, in a wooded area near Neidenbach bei Kyllburg, carved with the inscription 'FINIS PAGI CARV CVM' ('boundary or end of the pagus Carucum').Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum XIII 4143 To the east of Neidenbach, the Vinxtbach, a small river flowing eastwards to the Rhine, marked the boundary between the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior. The name Vinxtbach is in fact thought to derive from the Latin word finis, meaning an end or boundary. Today the Vinxtbach is still a boundary between modern German dialects, with Ripuarian to the north, and Moselle Frankish to the south. Also nearby is the modern boundary of modern German Länder of Rheinland-Pfalz and Nordrhein-Westfalen.  Geography  The general area of the Belgic Germani was between the Scheldt and Rhine rivers, and north of Luxemburg and the Moselle, which is where the Treverii lived. In modern terms this area includes eastern Belgium, the southern parts of the Netherlands, and a part of Germany on the west of the Rhine, but north of Koblenz.  History  Tacitus mentioned the \\"Caeracates\\" in his Histories, in his description of the Batavian revolt. They were called with the Vangiones and the Triboci, to reinforce a Treveri force.IV 70.

Work  = Lewis and Scientific management = Lewis was a boyhood friend of Frederick Winslow Taylor, participated in the development of Taylor's work since the late 19th century, and became a promoter of scientific management in the first decennia of the 20th century. Taylor himself had developed his system of management at the Midvale Steel company. Afterwards he had introduced his system among others in the shops of the William Sellers and Company machine tool firm, sponsored by William Sellers himself, but this collapsed when Sellers retired.Judith A. Merkle. Management and Ideology: The Legacy of the International Scientific Management Movement. University of California Press, 1980. p. 56-57 As one of its directors Lewis had become acquainted with Taylor's system, but this didn't make a lasting impression. About their further interaction Merkle (1980) summarized: Planning department bulletin board at the Tabor manufacturing company, 1911 :\\"...The two great showcases of Scientific Management, Tabor and Link-Belt, were not originally converted to Taylorism on the grounds of rational inquiry. Although after the Scientific Management fad had begun, the example of these two companies helped to convert other businesses to Taylorite organization, Taylorism was accepted at the Tabor Manufacturing Company as part of a debt, and at Link-Belt as part of the ideological conversion of one of Taylor's personal friends. Wilfred Lewis, a boyhood friend of Taylor, who had risen from draftsman at Sellers to become a mechanical engineer, had come to be one of the heads of the Tabor company. Shortly after 1900, Tabor started to lose money, and the process was accelerated by a series of strikes. With the new, higher wages, other companies were producing the same product at a lower cost, and the company went from selling stock to outright borrowing. Lewis went to his friends for money, among them Taylor. \\"Use my system,\\" said Taylor, in effect, \\"or you shall have no money.\\" In desperation, Lewis accepted, in spite of the fact that the genteel inhabitants of Philadelphia considered his friend a management crank. Straightaway, Barth, and then Taylor himself descended upon the Tabor plant, where they created the first showplace of Scientific Management...\\" Over the years Wilfred Lewis became strong believer and promoter of scientific management. About one of his latest stands, Kyle and Nyland (1993) summarized:Bruce, Kyle, and Chris Nyland. \\"Scientific management and market stabilisation, 1914-1930.\\" (1993). :\\"In December 1927 the industrialist Wilfred Lewis delivered a paper to the Taylor Society in which he lauded the achievements of the scientific management movement. Lewis claimed the four key objectives of the movement had become the reduction of costs, the raising of wages, the encouragement of collaboration between employers and employees and the full employment of workers and machinery. The extent to which these objectives were being attained, he concluded, enabled the people of \\"America to look forward hopefully to the future\\" (Lewis 1927, 557).\\" About the response Kyle and Nyland (1993) summarized: :\\"The response to Lewis' paper indicated that not all members of the Taylor Society shared his optimism. While he was praised by some commentators, his suggestion that there was wide acceptance amongst employers of the positive value of high wages was challenged. It was also observed that his belief the good times were \\"practically certain to continue .... is an assumption which may well be questioned\\" (Muste 1928, 47)\\"  Selected publications  * Wilfred Lewis.

The film follows his son, Yuval and his classmates who are studying in an international high-school, United World College, in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina.The film also exposes the recuperating city, which has been greatly damaged during the Bosnian War and is now geographically divided between the Bosniak and Croat populations. This is the second film in the family trilogy created by Fisher that started with the critically acclaimed Love Inventory (2000) and completed by Six Million and One (2011).  Plot summary  Tito's Palace in Mostar. The film depicts several buildings and structures that have been damaged during the Bosnian War, including Stari Most (the old bridge) which has been restored after being mostly destroyed during the war. From left to right: Director David Fisher, Neus Rodeta and Yuval FisherFrom left to right: Yuval Fisher and Salam Sa’adi A year after 17-year- old Yuval leaves home in Israel to attend the United World College in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, filmmaker David Fisher, his father, follows. While the film centers around the young students inhabiting the college, David uses the film as a tool to contemplate and examine his role as a parent, acknowledging that one of his deep regrets was not getting to know his own father, who was an introvert affected by Holocaust. During three Round-Trips to Mostar, Yuval’s relationships unfold: between him and his father, his Israeli peers and his Spanish girlfriend, Neus, a relationship which is ultimately doomed - because of Yuval’s impending military service. The film addresses different issues concerning Coming of age such as alienation, love, family and military service (part of the film is set during the Gaza War). These stories are set against the backdrop of this college, situated on what used to be the frontline between the Croatians and the Bosniaks, during the Bosnian War that ended in 1995. Although Yuval is far from home, this actually brings him and his father closer together. Their talks reveal father and teenager son tension with great honesty, maturity and openness. Yuval's roommate is Salam, an Israeli Arab, with whom he holds passionate political debates. Salam is a \\"playboy\\" and a charmer, so it's no wonder Yuval brings him a sugar cube to bed, one morning after a bitter fight they had over Middle Eastern politics. With them are also Niv, who talks very honestly about his encounter with Arab peers, stating that back home the word \\"Arab\\" is used in a derogative way amongst his friends, a fact he is now ashamed of; and Niva – she just wants to be an actress and doesn't know what to expect from her army service. The film is filled with John Hughes like scenes of the life of youngsters at the college, but with the ironic setting of a city that doesn't leave them indifferent. The UWC college is portrayed as microcosms which proves as a highly valuable and substantial stage in preparing the students for a mature and challenging life as grownups.  Production  The film was shot in video and is available in Digibeta format. Two versions of the film are available - a 73 minutes Festival cut and a 52 minutes TV and educational cut. The film was produced for The Second Authority for TV and Radio in Israel with the support of The Makor Foundation for Israeli film – the Israeli Film Council. Amnon Fisher, the director's brother wrote and performed the film's theme song \\"Father and Son\\".

The first model was the ME11AB, capable of running 11 stations on two schedules. A scaled-down residential model, the RC-8, was formally introduced in 1968 and was marketed as the \\"first appliance for the garden\\". The Los Angeles Times reported in 1967 that architects incorporated the RC-8 into a suburban housing development in Glendale, California, planning on adding the cost of the system to the mortgage.\\"Glendale Houses Offer Automatic Sprinkling\\". Los Angeles Times, Section J, p. N2. July 9, 1967. The controllers were used in controlled experiments of swine waste lagoon systems. The product line would later range from compact 3-station mechanical units to 23-station multi-program devices. The Rain Clox series controllers were known for their durability. In 1997, Rain Bird held a contest to find the oldest functioning controller, eventually locating an RC-8 manufactured in 1964 which was still functioning after it survived a tornado.

The nature reserve is situated along the western bank of the River Idle and east of the villages of Sutton cum Lound and Lound. The nature reserve is managed by the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust.  History  The lakes within the nature reserve have been formed over seventy years of extraction of gravel and other aggregates, and since 1981 by Tarmac Limited. Tarmac agreed to hand over all of its land within the SSSI to the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. In 2002, Natural England designated the site, formally known as the Sutton And Lound Gravel Pits, a SSSI. The Idle Valley Learning Centre which offers diploma courses in environmental conservation from North Nottinghamshire College was opened in 2008 and is owned by the college. The nature reserve received £1 million in Lottery funding in 2008. Paths, fencing and clearing of land has also taken place since the handover of the land, the efforts of which in 2011 won Tarmac the Mineral Products Association Cooper-Heyman Cup double award. In 2017, a new boardwalk was constructed adjacent to the visitor centre in order to improve access to the reserve, as part of a partnership between the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust and the Rotary club of Retford.  Geography  The reserve is over 3 miles long from the northernmost tip to the southern base of the site and covers over 450 hectares. It is the largest wetland in Nottinghamshire and the 5th largest SSSI in the county, covering 320 hectares. Access and facilities Idle Valley Nature Reserve is next to the A638 road and buses stop outside the reserve. Multiple public rights-of-way cross the reserve, including one around the majority of Bellmoor Lake. The reserve is open all year, and access is free, although visitors are asked to donate for using the car park. The main part of the reserve is accessed from the visitor centre. The northern end of the reserve can be accessed by walking from the visitor centre, although it is also accessible via Lound village. The visitor centre and shop are open daily except Christmas Day. Most of the reserve and its facilities are wheelchair accessible, but some areas can be muddy and unsuitable for wheelchairs at times. Fauna and flora =Birds= The site contains a rich number of breeding wetland birds and a nationally important population of wintering gadwall, one of 17 species of wildfowl that can be regularly found at the site each year. Key breeding species include shoveler, great crested grebe and tufted duck, along with locally scarce breeding species such as wigeon and pochard. A number of breeding waders are also present, such as lapwing, Eurasian oystercatcher, little ringed plover and redshank. The gravel pits contain a large winter population of coot. 259 bird species have been recorded across the site, including nationally rare species. Recently, these have included a gull-billed tern in 2015 and blue-winged teal and lesser scaup in 2014.

In May 1951, her captain refused to enter the harbour at Cairns, Queensland, Australia as there was insufficient depth of water for Wave Ruler. As a result of this, the harbour authorities purchased a dredger. On 3 April 1952, Wave Ruler caught fire whilst anchored off Greenock, Renfrewshire. At the time, she was fully laden and all non-essential personnel took to the lifeboats. The fire, which was in a pumproom, was under control within two hours. It damaged Wave Rulers steering gear and she had to be assisted by four tugs to berth for the discharge of her cargo.

It was established in 1466, after the construction of the Elbasan Castle of the territory that belonged to the preceding Ottoman sanjak, Sanjak of Albania.  Territory  The territory of the Sanjak of Avlona extends between Shkumbin river on the north and Ceraunian Mountains on the south. This sanjak had two kazas: kaza of Berat and kaza of Valona. Before establishing of the Sanjak of Delvina in the middle of 16th century following towns (kazas) also belonged to the Sanjak of Avlona: Delvina, Gjirokastër, Myzeqe and Labëria.  Politics  Valona was conquered by the Ottomans in June 1417. In 1431, the Sanjak of Albania was created out of areas in present- day western Albania. At the end of the 15th century, in order to stimulate trading, Ottomans settled small community of Sephardi Jews. Gedik Ahmed Pasha was sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Avlona in 1479. Bali Bey, son of Yahya Pasha, became sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Avlona in 1506. Mehmed Beg Isaković, son of Isa-Beg Isaković, was appointed as sanjabey of Avlona in January 1516. Muzaffer Pasha was sanjakbey of Avlona before he was appointed for the first governor of Cyprus in 1570, after Cyprus was captured by the Ottoman Empire. Mustafa Pasha (Bin Abdullah), who had been on position of sanjakbey of Bosnia and Morea, was sanjakbey of Valona at the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th century. Avlonya was captured by Venetians in 1690, but it was recaptured by Ottomans in 1691. In 1691, centre of sanjak was relocated to Berat and the sanjak was gradually named as Sanjak of Berat. Sari Ahmed Pasha was appointed as sanjakbey of Avlona at the end of 1712 and in the 1714 he was transferred to position of beglerbeg of Rumelia. In the middle of the 18th century a sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Avlona was Ahmet Pasha Kurt from the Muzaka family who was later appointed to the position of derbendci aga (guardian of the mountain passes) which he held until the sultan appointed Ahemt's grandson, Ali Pasha Tepelena, instead of him. In 1809, the sanjakbey of the Avlona was Ibrahim Pasha. According to Eqrem Vlora members of his family were de facto (not de jure) sanjakbeys of Sanjak of Avlona in period 1481—1828. In 1834 Mahmood Hamdi pasha was appointed to govern the Sanjak of Delvina, Yanina and Avlona. Ismail Qemali, first Prime Minister of Albania, was elected a member of Ottoman parliament in December 1908 for the Sanjak of Berat.

The ~22 nucleotide mature miRNA sequence is excised from the precursor hairpin by the enzyme Dicer. This sequence then associates with RISC which effects RNA interference. miR-296 has been named an \\"angiomiR\\" due to being characterised as a microRNA which regulates angiogenesis, the process of growth and creation of new blood vessels. miR-296 is thought to have a specific role in cancer in promoting tumour angiogenesis. It achieves this by targeting HGS mRNA, reducing its expression in endothelial cells which then results in greater number of VEGF receptors. miR-296 has predicted target sites in the transcription factor NANOG and may also contribute to carcinogenesis by dysregulating p53.

Ramos. He was Vice Chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and Chairman of the MNLF Reformist Group, where he negotiated with the Ramos administration in peace talks with Moro rebel front leaders.The Moro National Liberation Front- Reformist Group Career =Moro National Liberation Front= In the fight against the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos, Pundato led the Maranao forces of the MNLF from 1973 to 1985, eventually becoming MNLF Vice- Chairman in 1978. He also fought internally for reforms in the rebel movement. Among the three pillars of the MNLF, Pundato, the new Chairman of the MNLF Reformist Group became the only one actively engaged in the fighting on the ground while the rest were staying abroad and managing their forces literally by remote control. In 1980 he severed his relations with MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari when the latter refused the reforms demanded by Pundato of the organization with allegation of ideological differences and a leadership style tilting MNLF to one-man rule. This led to the creation of the MNLF Reformist Group which he headed. =As government official and the Mindanao Peace Process= Pundato in his long stint in the government became Assistant Secretary, Undersecretary on Muslim Affairs in the Office of Presidential Adviser for Peace Process (OPAPP) with focus on Muslim affairs, conflict resolution and mediation with Moro revolutionary groups. As Executive Director of Office on Muslim Affairs and provincial warden, he executed development management and resource mobilization programmes in Muslim constituencies. =Self-exile and opposition to President Marcos= During self-exile, Pundato and the MNLF Reformist Group met with President Aquino's late father, the Senator Benigno S. Aquino Jr. in Kuala Lumpur. Believing in the reforms that Senator Ninoy fought for against Marcos, Pundato and the MNLF Reformist Group helped to fight Marcos' dictatorship. But even then after the death of Senator Ninoy on August 21, 1983, in continuing their support for his dreams for the country, one year before the historic EDSA People Power Revolt, Pundato and the MNLF Reformist Group signalled support and political cooperation with the Ninoy Aquino Movement in San Francisco, California and in the country. As a gesture, President Cory Aquino in 1986, tasked former Senator Aquilino \\"Nene\\" Pimentel, currently the DILG Secretary to convince Pundato in Kuala Lumpur to return and be part of her government. Pundato then told Secretary Pimentel to first convince other Moro rebel leaders, such as Misuari and Salamat if they would accede to the peace negotiations since he and his reformist group agreed not to become an obstacle to peace but was bent on heeding Cory Aquino's call for national peace and reconciliation. Christopher and Ramon Carreon became instrumental in the back channeling for the peaceful return of Pundato to the Philippines. Early in 1987, Ambassador Pelaez and Ambassador Mauyag Tamano, convinced Pundato in Kuala Lumpur to return to the Philippines without any demands and conditions when he joined the government to support the return of Philippine democracy under the stewardship of then newly installed President Corazon Aquino, then mother of young Noynoy Aquino. As a regular Resource Person to the Peace Commission of Ambassador Pelaez he closely watched the Regional Consultative Commission in drafting the Organic Act of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao. From 1988 to 1998 Pundato was appointed Executive Director of the Office on Muslim Affairs where he had successfully institutionalized a system for running and managing the annual pilgrimage to Mecca Saudi Arabia. Among the innovations he introduced were: getting the lowest rates for the fare and quality accommodations in Saudi Arabia; Pundato was able to forge a strong relationship and raised the credibility of the Filipino Muslims with Muasasa or Hadz Establishment in charge of Southeast Asian Muslims. =Death= Pundato died at his residence in Marawi on August 13, 2020, at the age of 72.

Description Pterygophora californica is a large brown seaweed and may grow to about three metres in height.

Retrieved 2011-09-11. Biology Reproduction in P. californica involves an alternation of generations. Microscopic zoospores are produced in the sporangia. After release, these settle on the sea bed and develop into haploid gametophytes. These produce male and female gametes the fertilisation of which results in zygote formation and the growth of the diploid sporophytes, the stipe and blades.Ecology of Kelp Communities Retrieved 2011-09-12. Ecology Pterygophora californica grows in underwater kelp forests with other brown algae including the annual species, bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) and giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Brown seaweeds are photosynthetic organisms and their growth is mainly restricted by the availability of light. Various algae try to get a head start by attaching themselves to P. californica well above the ocean floor. These include red algae (Rhodophyte spp.), bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) and sea belt (Saccharina latissima). The most common cause of death of P. californica is being torn from the rocks during storms. This is made more likely by the drag caused by the epiphyte burden. P. californica and other Laminariales attempt to reduce their epiphytic load by periodically sloughing off their surface layers and by the production of \\"antifouling\\" substances such as phenols in their tissues.Lobban, Christopher S. and Paul J. Harrison (1994). Seaweed Ecology and Physiology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. At Race Rocks, near Vancouver Island, it was found that during the winter, the only remains of the kelp forest was the bare stipes of P. californica, the annual seaweeds having been broken down and dispersed. By mid summer however, the fast-growing N. luetkeana formed the canopy while P. californica and S. latissima formed a middle storey layer. In a research study in that location, it was found that much of the N. luetkeana was growing epiphytically on P. californica with their holdfasts attached to the blades and upper portions of the stipes. S latissima was also epiphytic but occupied the middle part of the stipe. Neither was present on the lower regions of the stipe and it was thought that this was due to grazing pressure from benthic macrofauna such as sea urchins.The epiphytic community of Pterygophora californica: Race Rocks MPA, British Columbia Retrieved 2011-09-11. Herbivores feed on P. californica and other kelps, the predominant grazers being sea urchins. If the population size of these becomes too great, \\"barren grounds\\", with no large algal species, can develop and may remain in existence for years. A reduction in the number of predators or a diminution in the quantity of drift algae may encourage hungry urchins to overexploit and potentially eradicate the kelp. The sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis graze on P. californica at the northern end of its range.

Biography Ippolito (or Polito) and his brother Piero were the sons, by different mothers, of Francesco d'Antonio di Jacopo, bailiff ('donzello') of the Signoria of Florence, and were both born in that city — Piero in 1451, and Ippolito in 1455. Ippolito was the pupil of Neri di Bicci from 1469 to 1471, and the brothers were companions in the same atelier in Florence up to 1480. In 1481, or soon after, they went to Naples to decorate the palace of Poggio Reale, which was then being built for Alfonso I, from the designs of Giuliano da Majano, and it is not unlikely that Ippolito died in that city, but the death of Ippolito is not registered. Ippolito and Pietro both assisted Antonio Solario, called II Zingaro, in the frescoes in the cloisters of the monastery of San Severino at Naples, and in the National Museum of Capodimonte are two Crucifixions and a 'Virgin and Child with Saints,' and other paintings assigned to them. They also served as architects in Naples.The lives of celebrated architects, ancient and modern, by Francesco Milizia, page 191.

In 1853, he admitted to thirteen murders, but claimed he was not responsible because he was suffering from a curse that caused him to turn into a wolf. Although this defense was rejected at trial, Queen Isabella II commuted his death sentence to allow doctors to investigate the claim as an example of clinical lycanthropy. Romasanta has become part of Spanish folklore as the Werewolf of Allariz and is also known as The Tallow Man, a nickname he earned for rendering his victims' fat to make high-quality soap. Background Manuel Blanco Romasanta was born on 18 November 1809 in Regueiro, Esgos, Ourense province, one of five children born to Miguel Blanco and María Romasanta. Originally thought to be female, he was named Manuela and raised as a girl until the age of six when a doctor reassigned his sex. At the age of eight, the family legally changed his name. Because he could read and write, a skill that was very rare at the time in Galicia, it is believed his family was relatively wealthy. According to various accounts, he was of small stature, between 1.37m (4'6\\") and 1.49m (4'11\\") in height, blonde, and \\"tender looking\\". As an adult, he worked as a dressmaker and was married. He was widowed a year later but was not suspected of having had a hand in her death. Following the death of his wife in 1833, Blanco became a traveling salesman, initially in Esgos, then eventually throughout Galicia and Portugal. Blanco was also known to act as a guide for travelers crossing the mountains to Castile, Asturias, and, Cantabria which gave him further opportunities for trade.David Lorda Gerardo Menéndez el hombre-Lobo de Allariz (Ourense), 1853: Una visión Desde la psiquiatría actual (The wolfman of Allariz (Ourense), 1853: A view of the current psychiatric community) Journal of Galician Psychiatry 2004 Volume 8 (In Spanish)The Sacamantecas Gallery of tourist information and more (in Spanish) In 1844, Blanco was charged with the murder of Vicente Fernández, the alguacil of León. Fernández was found dead after attempting to collect a debt of 600 real that Blanco owed to a supplier in Ponferrada for the purchase of merchandise. When he failed to appear, he was judged guilty by default and sentenced in absentia to 10 years imprisonment.The Wolfman of Allariz Spain Features : Profiles 13 November 2007 Other murders and arrest Fleeing from the threat of imprisonment, Blanco lived in hiding for almost a year in an abandoned shelter in Ermida. He reappeared later in public with a false passport using the name Antonio Gómez, a native of Nogueira, Portugal; and lived in the small village of Rebordechao in the district of Vilar de Barrio for at least a year. Although he helped with the harvest, he also worked as a cook, a coir maker, and as a weaver making yarn on a spinning wheel. He became friendly with the women of the village, which led the men to consider him effeminate. Over the following years, several women and children who had hired Blanco as a guide began to disappear. Their disappearances were not noticed immediately as Blanco delivered letters to their families, advising that they had arrived well at their destinations and were settling in. However, people became suspicious when they noticed that he was selling his victim's clothing locally. Rumors began to spread that he was selling soap made from human fat. In 1852, a complaint was finally lodged in the city of Escalona, alleging that Blanco deceived women and children into traveling with him so that he could kill them and remove their fat, which he then sold. He was arrested in September 1852, in Nombela, in the province of Toledo, and brought to trial in Allariz, in the area of Ourense. In his defense, Blanco claimed that he was afflicted with lycanthropy.The Wolfman of Allariz Spain Features : Profiles 13 November 2007 Trial in Allariz When Blanco was brought to trial, Galicia was in the middle of one of the worst famines of several that had plagued the area throughout the nineteenth century. The famine led to mass migrations and a noticeable increase in insanity. Blanco became the subject of a historical judgment: Cause Nº 1778 The Wolfman volume 36 of the courts of Allariz. The litigation, based on a claim of Lycanthropy, has never been repeated in the history of Spanish law. Blanco admitted to thirteen murders but in his defense he said that he had been cursed and had committed them after transforming into a wolf. > \\"The first time I transformed, was in the mountains of Couso. I came across > two ferocious-looking wolves. I suddenly fell to the ground and began to > feel convulsions, I rolled over three times, and a few seconds later I was a > wolf. I was out marauding with the other two for five days, until I returned > to my own body, the one you see before you today, Your Honour. The other two > wolves came with me, who I thought were also wolves, changed into human > form. They were from Valencia. One was called Antonio and the other Don > Genaro. They too were cursed... we attacked and ate a number of people > because we were hungry.\\" — Manuel Blanco Romasanta The prosecutor, Luciano Bastida Hernáez, asked Blanco to demonstrate the transformation for the court to which he replied that the curse only lasted for thirteen years and that he was now cured as that time had expired the previous week.El fiscal que encerró al hombre-lobo Government of La Rioja 15 January 2012, In October 1852, Allariz doctors presented the court with a report on Blanco. Based heavily on phrenology, the report accused him of inventing his affliction. While noting that lycanthropy can be determined from a \\"visceral examination\\" and craneoscopia, the doctors found no causes or motives for his behavior. > \\"His inclination to vice is voluntary and not forced. The subject is not > insane, dim-witted or monomaniacal, nor were these [conditions] achieved > while incarcerated. On the contrary, he instead turns out to be a pervert, > an accomplished criminal capable of anything, cool and collected and without > goodness but [acts] with free will, freedom and knowledge.\\"See C-8938 AHP > Ourense (Judiciary, File 1852) \\"Cause 1788, the Werewolf,\\" 1852, Historical > Archives of the Kingdom of Galicia. The court acquitted Blanco of four of the murders he had confessed to after forensic evidence indicated that these victims had died in real wolf attacks. He was found guilty of the other nine, the remains of which exhibited signs of butchering. On 6 April 1853, Blanco was sentenced to death by garrote with 1000 Real compensation to be paid for each victim. The court case had lasted seven months and the transcript covered more than two thousand pages which were bound in five volumes titled \\"Licantropia\\". The case was sent for ratification to the Territorial Court in A Coruña which, after considering the case for seven months, reduced the sentence to life imprisonment. The prosecution appealed against the reduction and a new hearing was set for March 1854, which upheld the original verdict from the court in Allariz: death by garrote. =Confirmed victims= List of named victims. *Manuela García, age 47, and her daughter Petra, 15, killed in the Sierra de San Mamede while traveling to Santander. *Benita García Blanco, aged 34, and her son Francisco, 10, killed in Corgo de Boi while traveling to Rua cantabras. *Antonia land, 37 years old, and her daughter Peregrina, killed while traveling to Ourense. *Josefa García and her son José Pazos, 21 years old. *María Dolores, 12 years old. =The prosecutor= Luciano Bastida y Hernáez gained considerable fame and prestige for his prosecution of Blanco and was made a Knight of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III of Spain, the most distinguished civil award that can be granted, and was appointed to the Supreme Court. Bastida died in Ponferrada in 1872 at age 60 and is considered one of the provinces of La Rioja's \\"most illustrious sons\\" for his legal career. The bicentenary of his birth was celebrated in La Rioja on 8 January 2012. Commutation by Royal Decree \\"Mr. Phillips\\", a French hypnotist living in London, had been following the \\"Werewolf of Allariz\\" case through the reporting in French newspapers. Phillips wrote to José de Castro y Orozco, the Spanish Minister of Justice, stating that Blanco was suffering from a monomania known as lycanthropy and was not responsible for his actions. He claimed that he had successfully treated the condition through hypnosis and asked that the execution be delayed so he could study the case. The Minister of Justice wrote to Queen Isabella II who personally commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment by Royal Order of 13 May 1854 and Romasanta was transferred to a prison in Celanova. Although there is no documentary evidence for the identity of Mr. Phillips, it is believed that he was the French physician Joseph-Pierre Durand de Gros who had been exiled to Britain and who later returned to France using the pseudonym Dr. Phillips. Durand de Gros was a significant part of the movement that led to the incorporation and assimilation of \\"Braidism\\" (viz., hypnotism à la James Braid; see ) in France and his works on the influence of the mind were later developed by Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. The \\"Wolfman\\" trial occurred at the beginning of the golden age of hypnotism. Death The Celanova prison and its records no longer exist but it was widely believed that Blanco died within months of arriving. Locals say it was from illness, but there is also a rumor that he died after being shot by a guard who wanted to see him transform. However, a TVG documentary aired on 30 May 2009 investigated the possibility that he had died elsewhere, suggesting he had died in San Antón Castle in A Coruña. In October 2011, a \\"Xornadas Manuel Blanco Romasanta\\" (a symposium and exhibition of Romasanta memorabilia) was held in Allariz where Galician researchers Félix and Cástor Castro Vicente presented evidence that Blanco had died in the prison of Ceuta on 14 December 1863. The evidence consisted of two newspaper articles, La Iberia a Liberal journal of 23 December 1863 that included a short sentence reporting that Blanco had died and La Esperanza newspaper dated 21 December 1863 which reported on its front page:La Leyenda del «hombre lobo» Romasanta resuscitate en Allariz La Voz de Galicia 30 October 2011 > \\"In Ceuta prison, the unfortunately famous Manuel Blanco Romasanta, known in > all Spain as the werewolf as a consequence of his atrocities and misdeeds > and who was sentenced to prison by the Court in La Coruña, died in that > place on 14 of this month being the victim of stomach cancer.\\" Popular culture *El bosque del lobo (The wolf's forest) is a 1968 Spanish drama film produced and directed by Pedro Olea and starring José Luis López Vázquez. The film is based on the novel El bosque de Ancines (Ancines Forest) by Carlos Martínez-Barbeito, which was in turn based on the Werewolf of Allariz court case. *Romasanta (also titled \\"Werewolf Hunter – The Legend of Romasanta\\") is a 2004 Anglo-Spanish horror film produced by Fantastic Factory, directed by Paco Plaza and starring Julian Sands, Elsa Pataky, and John Sharian.

Life  She was the eldest of Elisabeth Busch (née Elverfeldt)'s twelve children with her husband, magistrate Ignatz Anton Busch (a Stadtrichter and Landrichter). She grew up in Dülmen and was educated at Agnetenberg abbey. She spent 1807 to 1809 in Münster, where her literary talent was recognised and encouraged by Anton Matthias Sprickmann and where she also joined the circle of Adelheid Amalie Gallitzin. She returned to Dülmen in 1809. She first published her poetry in 1810, in Friedrich Raßmann's Mimigardia. She had asked for the poems to be published anonymously, but the publisher did not respect her wishes and her name and residence were appended to them. This led to her being scorned and ridiculed but did not do permanent damage to her reputation as a poet – in 1813 she first met Annette von Droste-Hülshoff, becoming a close friend and thinking of her as her \\"poetic idol\\". Droste later dedicated her poem Catharine Schücking to her. Schücking later wrote under the pseudonym \\"Pauline zu Cl.\\" In 1813 she married Paulus Modestus Schücking. The couple had six children: Christoph Bernhard Levin Matthias (1814–1883); Peter August Gerhard (1816–1817); Anton Matthias Franz Alfred (1818–1898); Ida Josephina Theophania Desideria (1821–1883); Modesta Paulina Nicolaia Roswitha (1825–1896); and Prosper Ludwig (1828–1887). In 1815 the Schücking family moved to Sögel, leaving Katharina socially and geographically isolated and bringing her writing to a standstill.

It was established in June 2010 and produced its final report and recommendations in September 2011. Composition It was chaired by John Vickers and included four other commissioners; Bill Winters, Martin Taylor, Clare Spottiswoode and Martin Wolf. The commissioners were supported by a Secretariat of fourteen officials seconded from HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Financial Services Authority, the Bank of England and the Office of Fair Trading. The secretariat was headed by Sam Woods. Recommendations The commission made its recommendations to the UK government on 12 September 2011. Its headline recommendation was that British banks should 'ring-fence' their retail banking divisions from their investment banking arms to safeguard against riskier banking activities, but it also made a number of other recommendations on bank capital requirements and competition in retail banking. The government announced the same day that it would introduce legislation into Parliament aimed at implementing the recommendations. The text of the final report and recommendations is available from the UK National Archives. Influence on banking regulation in France and the European Union Mainland European scholars had recommended the adoption of similar 'ring-fencing' regulations, notably in France where SFAF and World Pensions Council (WPC) banking experts argued that such rules should be adopted in European Union law.. \\\\- and the Liikanen report in October 2012 on Bank Structural Reform had as its key recommendation a “ringfence” separating trading from deposits.

The monastery is located in the village of Morozovitsa of Velikoustyugsky District in the north-east of Vologda Oblast, at the confluence of the Sukhona and the Yug Rivers, close to the town of Veliky Ustyug. The monastery ensemble currently belongs to Velikoustyugsky Museum of History, Art, and Architecture. History The monastery is located at the place where previously a fortress of Gleden was built in the end of the 12th century by Vsevolod the Big Nest, the Grand Prince of Vladimir. Gleden was the predecessor of Veliky Ustyug and was destroyed in the 15th century during wars between Russian princes. The early history of the monastery is not well documented, however, it is assumed that the monastery was founded at the same time as the fortress, but survived the civil war of the 15th century. Troitse- Gledensky monastery was first mentioned in 1492. By 1725, the monastery has 24 monks and 176 priests and deacons. By the same year, it owned 60 villages with the total population of about 1000. In the beginning of the 19th century, the monastery lost any significance, and there were two to four monks living there. The monastery was abolished in 1841, re-established in 1912 as a female monastery and in 1918 transformed into an agricultural commune. The commune was a compromise between the authorities, trying to eradicate any religious movements, and the nuns, who wished to preserve the same way of living they had in the monastery. In 1925, the commune was abolished, since it was judged by the authorities to display too much of the religious fever. The monastery was eventually used as a junior correction establishment, as a center for force resettlement, and as a retirement home. In the 1980s, the former monastery buildings were transferred to the Veliky Ustyug Museum. Architecture The architectural ensemble of the monastery originates from 17th and 18th centuries. This is the time when in and around Veliky Ustyug the stone building, churches in the first instance, started to replace the wooden buildings. Almost all the buildings of the monastery preserve the original exterior and interior. The main church of the monastery is the Trinity Cathedral build as a cube and containing five domes. The Trinity cathedral was the first stone building of the monastery. The construction was initiated by Rostov Metropolitan Iona Sysoyevich, and the cathedral was consecrated in 1707. Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery in Veliky Ustyug was used as a prototype for the cathedral. Inside, the cathedral contains a five-row iconostasis carved between 1776 and 1784 by local artists, brothers Nikolay Bogdanov and Timofey Bogdanov. The icons were also painted locally. Next to the cathedral, there is a tented roof bell-tower, built simultaneously with the cathedral. Another church in the monastery is the Church of the Tikhvin Icon of the Virgin (1729-1740). There is also a wall (1770s) with towers and gates. One of the gates is the Assumption Church.

Because of the reason is that the area was having different kind of magical soil for producing the fruits and also having fantastic tastes by nature of soil. The guava fruits were two types. one is red guava and another one is white guava (Seeni guava), mostly the white guava size will be very big as like a coconuts. =1950s= One of Historical place is Puthiamputhur market.

Tuticorin district peoples as its customers and anything can buy and sale here. It was arranged itself all in one place with cheapest price. Now, the market is only goats trading jaoociccc. =1970s= In the period is a very peak time for puthiamputhur flowers. Particularly samanki, pichi, malli, etc. The samanki flowers converting into flower oil then packed as Tin bottles and exported to foreign countries from the Puthiamputhur. Even though biggest part of the flower production was there, above said the flower's prices determined by the Puthiamputhur traders in Tuticorin District. =Readymade manufacturing= Formerly, Mr. Alagusundaram was introduced the readymade manufacturing in Puthiamputhur. He was started a garments in this year of 1954. The garments manufacturing idea was successes and changed his life style. When he started the garments, he has four tailors only. Then the success indicates him to make a new industry in this area. Frequently, His brothers Mr. Durai raja and Mr.Maharaja joined as one hand with their brother Mr. Alagusundaram's business. They were earned more than sufficient profit in their business. The success was created a lot of new entrepreneur to Puthiamputhur. They were involved in this readymade manufacturing business sub-sequencing Mr.Pichiah, Mr.Thangalingam, etc. Their usual and regular product was in that time like underwear, bodies, trousers, tap trousers, jippa shirts, tap pavadai (lower part of midi), umbrella pavadai, blouse, etc. These kinds of normal and regular dresses only made and traded by them. =After 1967= The readymade garments industry changed in the year of 1967. Particularly, after the coming of Mr.K.Raja Nadar started his own business with his brothers Mr.K.Karuppasamy Nadar, Mr.K.Theppirikani nadar and Mr.K.Selvaraj nadar (now they were doing business separately) at Puthiamputhur and Mr.Jeyaraj nadar started his own business with his brother Mr.Thangaraja nadar in the name of Laksmi dresses at Puthiamputhur. Followed him Mr.Navaneethan Nadar, Mr.Jegathesan Nadar, Mr.Karuppasamy Nadar, P.Dharmaraj Nadar and many number of peoples were started Garments business. They were produced fancy types of dresses as like baba-set, full hand shirts, half hand shirts, slack, ins-cut, frock, midi, Chudi, etc. New type of fabrics also introduced in market as like starchy silks, daubed silks. The innovative thinking change the face of Puthiamputhur and fancy items created dramatic changes and carried to next level the garments industry in Puthiamputhur. =After 1984= 27 garments were at Puthiamputhur in the year of 1984. They purchased their raw material mainly from Surat, Kolkata. They sell their goods all over Tamil Nadu. Puthiyamputhur readymade became famous due to its quality and cheap price. After days jawli stores and all manufacturing products also made in Puthiamputhur. This readymade business take the village to next level of its era.. =2000 to 2010s= 200 small scale industries (SSI) were in the period of 2000 to 2004 Puthiamputhur. These 200 SSI sell their readymades throughout Tamil Nadu. It made an unexpected growth of garments industry in Puthiamputhur. This peak growth attract more people to readymade business in Puthiyamputhur. These Entrepreneurs became major supplier of readymade dresses in Tamil Nadu. =2005 to 2006= It was the restriction time of Puthiamputhur in the industry. 60 companies were consolidated their business. Remaining 140 companies involved problems. Then little better improvement but not a good improvement. =Reason for restriction= The restriction's major problem was trader's joules. Many companies were compotator to same customers. So every trader was making a price difference between them, because to occupied their customer. For example, A trader gives a dress at the price of Rs.220. But B trader is agreeing to give the same product at rs.200. The product manufacturing cost may be rs.200. B trader cannot take profit by the trade. The situation is making a decision for a trader try to make minimum cost production by poor fabrics, lowest price materials, poor stitching and avoiding product improvement activities and finally a trader is giving to agree the dress at the price of rs.180. Now A's manufacturing cast may be rs.160. The B trader could not accept to give the price at rs.180. If he will accept the order, he can't get profit and he may loss rs.20. So B also involves making in lowest price of the same product and he will accept at the price rs.180 with profit. Even though the B trader is again competitive and reduced the price against a trader. Finally the both traders could not take sufficient profit. They are also lost his quality and goodwill, by which their product cannot sale in market that the reason is worst quality. Nobody don't do trade with them. So either or both traders’ felt-up and moves from their business. Above the example is indicates spoil-out of the garments industry. It may be like a joke. But it is real. It happened and is happening. = After 2007 = Restriction was found out by associations and sufficient activities were taken among the company owners. Then they understood themselves. They were adopted into new way to trading without joules. It was possible by over all cost methods. Bulk purchases of fabrics creates lowest price of goods. It was another milestone of the industry. Some numbers of company owners were purchased fabrics and shared it themselves as joined hand. So the fabrics price reduced and cold get lowest price of goods. Followed them many owners joined and purchased from Surat, Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Belwar, Chennai, etc. =Now= They have succeeded with their life journey. Around 10000 people are living by the Puthiamputhur garments industry. The employees are everyone may earn rs.6000 to rs.16000/month.

In 2003, he decided to run for a legislative seat as representative of the Kebbe/Tambuwal Federal Constituency. He was elected into the House of Representatives on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). Few months to the 2007 general elections, he defected to the Democratic People's Party (DPP), alongside the former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa. But when the DPP denied return tickets to former ANPP legislators, Tambuwal swung back to the ANPP, where he eventually succeeded in picking up a ticket for the election. But then again, when the ANPP governorship candidate for Sokoto State in the 2007 election, Alhaji Aliyu Wamakko dumped the party for the PDP, Tambuwal also followed suit. Tambuwal held several offices in the House. In 2005, he became the Minority Leader of the House until he defected to the PDP. Upon his re- election to the House in 2007, he was also elected the Deputy Chief Whip. At various times, Tambuwal was a member of several committees including the House Committees on Rules & Business, Communications, Judiciary, Inter-Parliamentary and Water Resources. He was also a member of the House Ad hoc Committee on Constitution Review. He was chairman of the ad hoc committee that reviewed the report of the controversial power probe committee headed by Ndudi Elumelu; Chairman, House Sub-Committee on the Bill for an Act to Amend the Land Use Act, and acting Chairman, House Committee on Power.

On 28 October 2014, Tambuwal formally defected from the ruling PDP to the opposition APC and few days later his security details were withdrawn by the Inspector General of Police a move that was criticised by Nigerians as being barbaric and undemocratic. The legal luminary, Mr Olisa Agabakogba (SAN) was of the opinion that the police authority goofed in withdrawing Tambuwal's aid as police are not meant to interpret and apply the law. On April 11, 2015, Tambuwal contested and won the Governorship election of Sokoto State. He was inaugurated on 29 May 2015. On July 4, 2018, Tabuawal dissolved the entire State Executive Council. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry poses for a photo with Sultan Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, and Governor of Sokoto Aminu Waziri Tambuwai at the Sultan’s Palace in Sokoto, Nigeria, on August 23, 2016, before the Secretary held meetings with religious leaders and delivered a speech about countering violent extremism. On August 1, 2018, Tambuwal defected from the All progressive's Congress back to the People's Democratic Party. The March 9, 2019, Sokoto State Gubernatorial election and March 22, 2019, Sokoto State supplementary election, Tambuwal was reelected as governor of sokoto state having polled 512,002 votes while his rival Mr. Aliyu of the All Progressive Congress Polled 511,660 votes. In October 2018, Tambuwal declared that he was running for president and said he was forced to seek the highest position to \\"revive the dying economy\\". His declaration came hours after senate president, Bukola Saraki officially joined the race for the nomination of the main opposition's PDP. Tambuwal was one of the long list of 12 candidates including four from his north western region that contested PDP presidential nomination. Tambuwal was popular in the race and was among the top four candidates (Atiku Abubakar, Rabiu Kwankwaso and Bukola Saraki) widely expected to win going by political permutations around his candidacy. A number of factors including his young age among the contestants, political experience, his untainted records from corruption indictment boosted his chances going into the primary. Analysts had predicted that should Tambuwal clinch PDP ticket he would be a formidable challenge to incumbent President Muhammad Buhari a northern Muslim who was running for reelection. Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State was Tambuwal's main backer for the PDP nomination. There were reports that Governor Wike's support for Tambuwal was for his ambition to be vice presidential candidate to Tambuwal should he win PDP nomination. However, there were complaints by other aspirants that Wike was planning to manipulate the results of the primary to favour his candidate Tambuwal. Their fears stem from the fact that Wike had overwhelming influence over the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party having single- handedly installed its Chairman, Uche Secondus. Other factors that heightened the fear of manipulation of the primary was that Wike was the biggest financier of the party and primary would be conducted in his state where he has so much power. Some presidential aspirants asked the National Working Committee of the party to move the convention from Port Harcourt to a neutral location where Wike would not have so much much influence. But Wike fired back threatening to polarize the party should the convention venue be moved out of Rivers State. Tambuwal placed second position with 693 delegate votes behind Atiku Abubakar who won with 1,532 votes in the primary conducted in the city of Port Harcourt on 6 October 2018. Bukola Saraki scored 317 and Rabiu Kwankwaso 158 votes. Professional affiliations Among his professional affiliations, Tambuwal has been a very active member of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), over the years. *Member, The Nigerian Bar Association *Public Relations Officer, The Nigerian Bar Association (1996-1997) *Member, Constitution Review Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association (1997-1998) *Sokoto Branch Secretary, Nigerian Bar Association (1997-1998) *Assistant National Financial Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association (1998-2000) *First Assistant National Secretary of Nigerian Bar Association (2000-2002) *Member, Body of Benchers Nigeria *Member, International Bar Association *Member, American Bar Association See also *List of Governors of Sokoto State *Speaker of the House of Representatives of Nigeria References Category:Sokoto State Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Nigeria) Category:Nigerian lawyers Category:Politicians from Sokoto State Category:Usmanu Danfodiyo University alumni Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:People's Democratic Party members of the House of Representatives (Nigeria) Category:All Nigeria Peoples Party politicians Category:All Progressives Congress politicians ","title":"Aminu Tambuwal"},{"id":"33061544","text":"Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal is a peer-reviewed academic journal established in 2008 by Jackie Kirk and published by Berghahn Books.

Early life  Christopher Raeburn was born the youngest of three boys in Kent. His upbringing focused on the outdoors and inventing. \\"We were encouraged to draw something in the week and then challenged to make it with my dad on the weekend. From the age of 11, I was in air cadets, I learnt to fly. I was doing my Duke of Edinburgh. I was doing walks in Holland. I had this love of being prepared\\".  Career  Raeburn graduated in 2006 from London's Royal College of Art. He freelanced as a pattern cutter before setting up his own studio in 2008, and later his label. Raeburn participated in the 'Camouflage' exhibition at London's Imperial War Museum and featured in Hywel Davies' publication '100 New Designers'. Raeburn ended 2008 with his first collection showcased during London Design Week, a capsule range of reversible garments titled Inverted. In 2009 Raeburn showcased menswear in Paris, received an award from the International Ethical Fashion Forum, and gained support from Esthetica, allowing him to show at London Fashion Week that September. In 2010, Raeburn was the first designer to be awarded Topshop NEWGEN sponsorship for both men's and women's wear in the same season. Raeburn has become known for the ethical integrity of his work, although he admits it was never his intention. American Vogue's August 2010 issue highlighted Raeburn's contribution to all things green with the advice to \\"Remember the four R's – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Raeburn\\", accompanied by a Mario Testino shoot of Blake Lively wearing a Raeburn Duffle Coat. After viewing his Autumn/Winter 2011 London Fashion Week presentation at the disused Aldwych tube station, Style.com stated, \\"it's not unreasonable to assert that Christopher Raeburn is the single most radical designer working today\\". In 2010, Raeburn was approached by Victorinox to collaborate with them on a men's and women's wear capsule collection. Victorinox set up a \\"Remade in Switzerland\\" studio in Ibach, the birthplace of Victorinox founder Karl Elsener. Not only did Raeburn source the fabrics for his collection there, but he also managed to find the original house in which Elsener started the brand, and it was there that Raeburn chose to establish his Swiss LAB to produce the 100 pieces of each style by hand. The collaboration launched on schedule during New York Fashion Week in February 2011. Raeburn jacket remade from parachute In September 2011, Raeburn was nominated and won the 2011 \\"Emerging Designer\\" British Fashion Award for menswear, by the British Fashion Council. In the same year he was also nominated for the 'Observer Ethical Awards: Fashion Category' and 'Condé Nast Traveller award: design and innovation' prizes, and his 'REMADE IN SWITZERLAND' collaboration with Victorinox is shown on schedule at NYFW. In 2012, the brand started to widen its stockists list, counting more than 20 stores worldwide, including the Paris-based boutique Colette. In that year Christopher Raeburn also launched his first accessories collection, as well as the much awaited first collaboration with Moncler. The following year, Christopher Raeburn's visibility continued to increase, with the designer receiving a sponsorship from Woolmark for SS14 season. 2013 was a big year for Christopher Raeburn, who in that year not only won Designer Business of the Year at the UK Fashion and Textiles awards, but also launched two major collaborations, with Rapha and Fred Perry. He ended the year by being announced as artistic director of Victorinox Fashion, as a result of past collaborations. 2014 saw two Woolmark sponsorships for Raeburn, this time towards his AW14 and his SS15 seasons, menswear and womenswear. The designer was once again shortlisted for BFC/GQ Designer Menswear Fund, and also launched his Barbour collaboration. In the same year, Christopher Raeburn won Menswear Brand of the Year at the UK Fashion and Textiles Awards. In 2015, Christopher Raeburn was shortlisted for the second year for BFC/GQ Designer Menswear Fund and he was sponsored again by Woolmark for his AW15 collection. He launched two collaborations: one with Wool and The Gang, to create a joint line of knitted accessories, and one with knitwear specialised brand Unmade, to create an interactive bespoke knitwear. In the same year Raeburn received the award for Best Emerging Designer at the GQ Men of the Year Awards, and later on he launched his first footwear menswear and womenswear joint collections with Clarks.

Background Hasselgren was born in Gävle, Sweden. He was the son of Per Johan Hasselgren and Anna Gustafva Jansson. His sister was Swedish artist Elfrida Gustava Ewerlöf (1886-1984). Career In 1903, Hasselgren immigrated to the United States where he adopted the first name to Albinus. He painted rural scenes of New England and a number of religious works. Hasselgren also painted altar pieces for Lutheran churches in New England. Two are still in the church of which he became a congregation member, the Emanuel Lutheran. Soon after his arrival in New England, he became involved in the discussion about early Norse settlements in North America. Hasselgren became convinced that the Newport Tower in Newport, Rhode Island was a remain from such a settlement, something that he developed in his most famous painting Vinland the year 1127. In the painting, we see Vikings together with Native Americans in front of the tower. The painting was featured in the Sunday Telegram and was published in the magazine Prärieblomman Kalender för 1912 . Later years and death Hasselgren lived his last four years at a sanatorium in Westfield, Massachusetts, after being diagnosed with tuberculosis. Hasselgren died during 1916 at age 36.

Thompson, and Tony Wood, produced by Granada and starring Judy Loe and Paul Shelley. It aired in the Granada, Central and Carlton ITV regions between 1994 and 1996. The series is family drama about the family of the priest Edward Rattigan (Shelley) and his wife Jessica (Loe). It follows and critiques the organisational structure of the Anglican Church at the turn of the millennium. In one episode, a female vicar, Joan (Sue Holderness), comes out as a lesbian in a two-hander with Mary Beckett (Carole Nimmons). It was the first openly gay character written by Davies, who would later go on to create and produce the gay-centric series Queer as Folk, Bob & Rose, Torchwood and Cucumber. Davies attributes the storyline to the \\"pressure-cooker nature\\" of the series leading to larger storylines, and the recent ordination of female vicars in the Church of England; Davies recalls that \\"when they introduced women to the church, I was thinking 'Yes! We can do a lesbian vicar!'\\". He also revealed that a wedding storyline resulted in the groom falling in love with his best man, another landmark moment in TV.

Sir Nicolas Dorigny was a French engraver, the youngest son of Michel Dorigny, and was born in Paris in 1652Benezit or 1658.Grove His education prepared him for the legal field, and he followed that profession until he was thirty years of age, when, as a result of deafness, he turned to the arts. Career Dorigny visited Italy, where he remained for twenty-eight years. His first plates were executed with the point. He is better known, however, for his technique unifying the point and the graver, characteristic of his later productions. He took for his model the admirable works of Gérard Audran. Although he may not have equalled that celebrated artist, either in the style of his drawing, or in the picturesque effect of his light and shade, his prints will always be esteemed both for their merit as engravings and for the importance of the subjects which he chose. In 1711 he was invited to England by Queen Anne to engrave the Cartoons of Raphael at Hampton Court, which he finished in 1719, and in the following year he was knighted by King George I. While he was in England he painted some portraits of the nobility, but with no great success. He returned to France in 1725, and was received into the Academy in the same year. He exhibited some pictures of sacred subjects at the Salon from 1739 to 1743, and died in Paris in 1746.

Scientific career  Burger has pioneered the application of ancient DNA technology to resolve anthropological and archaeological questions, particularly concerning humans and domestic animals in the Holocene period. He received his MA in anthropology in 1997, and his PhD in biology at the Georg-August-University, Göttingen, Germany, in 2000. He was made professor (junior professor) in molecular archaeology in 2005, and professor in anthropology in 2010. He is based at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. The main focus of Burger's research is human population genetics of Europe in the early Holocene, and of Central Asia during Bronze and Iron Age. He applies palaepopulation-genetic methods, i.e. uses ancient DNA data from archaeological skeletons and statistical inference methods to compare these \\"fossil\\" DNA sequences amongst each other and to modern-day populations. He pioneered the field of human palaeo-population genetics. Together with an international team he showed in 2009 that the first European farmers were immigrants to the continent and not descendants of local hunter-gatherers. In 2016, he published the first ancient genome from the Fertile Crescent. The study demonstrates that the first Neolithic farmers had populated Europe from the western/central part of Anatolia but not from Iran.

In the following years Gabriël's advice was of particular importance for Tholen, as they worked together en plein air for many summers near Kampen and Giethoorn, among other places. In Gouda (1878-9) and Kampen (1880–85) he taught draftsmanship in order to support himself but after 1885 concentrated entirely on his own work. In 1885 Willem Witsen invited Tholen to visit his family's country house near Baarn, where their contemporaries, George Hendrik Breitner and Anton Mauve were frequent guests. From 1887 he lived in The Hague, where he became friendly with other painters of The Hague school. He took an active part in the artistic life of The Hague and was a member of the Pulchri Studio. Tholen established his reputation in The Hague with his landscapes of the countryside around Kampen and views of the woods near Baarn. He also frequently painted views of The Hague, the woods of Scheveningen and a series of interiors in which a window typically provides a view outside: a garden, a street illumined by sunlight or the rhythmically grouped roofs of a city. He painted the fishing boats on the beach in Scheveningen, but in contrast to Jacob Maris (whom he greatly admired), Tholen did not employ the desolate sea as a backdrop, but rather, the bustling village. He used the hustle-bustle of the city more often as a theme than was generally the case in the Hague School, depicting such subjects as construction sites, slaughterhouses, stonecutters and the sand excavations and sand barge captains on the canal between The Hague and Scheveningen. His second wife was dollhouse collector Lita de Ranitz; they married in 1919, and he created small artworks for her collection.

Gameplay Set in the fictional city of Redfield during a zombie apocalypse, the gameplay of OMG-Z focuses on causing chain reactions to eliminate the zombies. The player's weapons fire a 'zombie-exploding pathogen' which causes zombies to explode and those nearby to also explode in turn. Through the course of the game's 81 levels, the player is able to upgrade various abilities to improve their performance and achieve higher scores. Zombies There are five different types of zombies. * Normal - Explode when shot, affecting a small area * Fat - Explode when shot, affecting a larger area * Police - Fire one shot through anything in front of them * Acid - Melt into a puddle of acid that deals damage over time to other zombies * Soldiers - Fire three shots at random angles Reception Reviews of OMG-Z have been generally favourable with a Metacritic score of 89 out of 100, making it, as of 12 September 2011, the fourth highest scoring PSP game on the site. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer viewed OMG-Z as \\"a monstrously addictive quick-fire affair that utterly nails what on-the-go handheld gaming should be about.\\" However, it has been noted by reviewers that releasing the game on the PlayStation mini format has limited the scope of the title and prevented the inclusion of features such as online leaderboards.

The theatre was originally named the Teatro de la Santa Cruz in Spanish (or Teatre de la Santa Creu in Catalan). It is located on the famous avenue of La Rambla. The theatre was founded by a donation of land and houses on the Rambla de Barcelona, made by Joan Bosch in favour of the Hospital of the Holy Cross, then the most important hospital in the city, to build a theatre in it. With the benefits of the plays and shows, the hospital could bear part of its expenses. For these benefits to be greater, the theatre would have the exclusive right to host theatrical performances in the city. On 27 October 1787 the theatre underwent a fire that completely destroyed it. Rebuilt thanks to the donations of nobles like the Marquess of Ciutadilla and the Count of El Asalto, the new theatre, more sumptuous, was inaugurated on 4 November 1788. After three more fires and the opening of the Liceu opera house in 1847 the Teatro Principal fell into decadence. A popular campaign prevented it from demolition in 1889. In January 2006 it closed its doors as working theatre.

Born in Detmold Palace, Frederick Adolphus was the eldest of sixteen children of Simon Henry, Count of Lippe-Detmold and Baroness Amalia of Dohna-Vianen, Burgravine of Utrecht and heiress of Vianen and Ameide. Life He broke with the tradition of his predecessors, who had paid a subsidy to the Holy Roman Empire in lieu of their military obligations, by raising his own company of Lippe troops. This was increased to battalion strength as required by the Empire. However, during his rule the troops did not see any operational service. Frederick Adolphus apparently rewarded his followers with generous donations; for example, on 16 June 1699 he enfeoffed Frantz Dietrich Bohsen with the village of Ilendorf between Pömbsen and Nieheim, with the Court of Döringsfelde, and the tithes of Wintrup and Großen Heisten. In 1712, he enfeoffed the sons of his Lieutenant Johann Adolf von Schledorn with the town of Anröchte. In October 1698, Frederick Adolphus took the Hamburg Baroque artist, Hans Hinrich Rundt, into his service. Rundt painted a number of portraits of the Count's family and also decorated the luxurious renovations of the comital palace, with wall and ceiling paintings. The Count was a typical Baroque ruler. His building work overburdened the territory's finances. In 1716, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great commented on the occasion of a hunting visit in Bad Pyrmont: \\"Your Highness is too big for this country\\".Roseland-lip-04 2006, p. 33. [retrieved 21 September 2014]. His most famous project, the Friedrichstal Canal (German: Friedrichstaler Kanal) is still visible today in Detmold and is a popular Sunday walk for the local population. The Dutch hydraulic engineering specialist Hendrick Kock was responsible for the construction of the canal. His \\"Favorite Palace\\" (German: Schloss Favorite) was located on one side of the canal and, since 1954, has been part of the Detmold College of Music (Hochschule für Musik Detmold). The subsequent landscaped parks made in the English style Palace Garden (German: Palaisgarten) were opened to the public only in 1919. From the Garden Friedrichstal only remained the Mausoleum at Büchenberg, the Neuer Krug and the Krummes Haus on the site of today's Detmold Open-air Museum. In order to provide the appropriate framework of this project, the Count ordered the construction near the south gate of a cavalier house, now the Hotel Lippischer Hof and a group of new houses, who formed the today's vicinity of Neustadt. Frederick Adolphus was awarded in 1712 with the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle. Marriages and Issue In Schaumburg on 16 June 1692 Frederick Adolphus married firstly with Countess Johanna Elisabeth of Nassau-Dillenburg (Schaumburg a.d.Lahn, 5 September 1663 - Detmold, 9 February 1700), the daughter of Adolph, Prince of Nassau-Schaumburg.

Commentaries to Tsar Boris. The Works by A.K. Tolstoy in 4 volumes. Moscow. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura. 1964. Vol. II. Pp. 681–687.  History  On 27 August 1868, Aleksey Tolstoy wrote in a letter to the Vestnik Evropys editor Mikhail Stasyulevich: \\"[As for] Tsar Boris, I'm going to start it in the nearest future: all the necessary material is at hand.\\" The work began in the early October and on November 11 of the same year the author informed Nikolay Kostomarov that Act I has been just finished. In a December 2 letter to Stasyulevich he opined that this first piece has \\"turned out well.\\" Then Tolstoy became intrigued by the character of the Danish Prince Johan, princess Ksenya's fiancé and Prince Christian’s brother, and spent some time investigating his background. On 7 February 1869, Tolstoy informed his friend and translator Boleslav Markevich that \\"this giant ship has taken another start and is now breaking waves.\\" While working on the Act 2 Tolstoy was being distracted continuously: numerous ballads (\\"The Song of Harald and Yaroslavna\\", \\"Three Massacres\\", \\"The Song of Vladimir's Korsunh Campaign\\") were written in those days. On February 19, he wrote to Stasyulevich: \\"Two acts are now ready. The third one will be crucial in answering the question, whether the whole thing has been worthwhile.\\" In June 1869 he finished the Act 3 and informed Afanasy Fet on this in a June 23 letter. By November 3 the play has been completed. On November 30 four Acts of the play were sent to Vestnik Evropy, with a promise that the fifth one will follow suit. On the same day Tolstoy sent a copy to Kostomarov, asking him to check the conversations of the two fugitive monks, Misail and Grigory, then made some corrections. While still working on the play, Tolstoy mentioned in a letter to the editor that his wife liked Tsar Boris better than the two other plays of the trilogy and that he tended to agree with her. Later he had to admit Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich objectively was the strongest of the three, even if he liked Tsar Boris a lot. In the spring of 1870, as the third of the three tragedies came out in a separate edition, Tolstoy submitted it to the theater censorship department. On April 28 the play, with minor cuts, received the censors' permission. But the directorial Committee of the Imperial Theatres refused to accept it. Tsar Boris was premiered in Anna Brenko's Moscow Pushkin TheatreNot to be confused with the Moscow Pushkin Drama Theatre founded in 1914 by Tairov. Anna Brenko's, Russia's first private theater, lasted only for two years, 1880-1882. in 1881, six years after Tolstoy's death. = Characters' development = In the course of those seven years Tolstoy spent working on his drama trilogy his attitude towards some of its characters changed. In the second and especially in the third play Boris Godunov comes across as more deep and complicated figure. According to biographer Igor Yampolsky, Tolstoy started to recognize in him a potentially European-type monarch whose idea was to lead Russia out of its historical isolation and patriarchal stagnation into the world political arena. On the other hand, Tolstoy's attitude towards Maria, the wife of Boris, has changed from bad to worse: more and more he was attributing to her Boris' \\"evil\\" features. While in The Death of Ivan the Terrible Maria gets horrified and frightened when learning of her husband's ambitions, in Tsar Boris she helps him with zest and cruelty, motivated by personal interests, not by those of the state. The two Marias – of the first and the third play – were so different that Tolstoy seriously considered re- working parts of The Death of Ivan the Terrible in 1870, before all three were to be published as a single book.  The Danish Prince  Aleksey Tolstoy, who used Nikolay Karamzin's History of the Russian State as the major source, became intrigued by and confused with the character of John, Prince of Schleswig-Holstein, princess Ksenya's fiancé and Christian IV of Denmark's brother. He applied to both Kostomarov and Baron Karl Ungern-Sternberg for help, trying to resolve a mystery of \\"how could Ksenya's bridegroom have fought (according to Karamzin)Жених воевал тогда в Нидерландах под знаменами Испании: спешил возвратиться, сел на Адмиральский корабль и вместе с пятью другими приплыл (10 Августа 1602) к устью Наровы. – The extract from Karamzin's History. in the Netherlands under the Spanish banner.\\" \\"Please, help me to understand how and why he, apparently a Protestant, could have fought on the Spanyards' side. Could he have been a Catholic? Or perhaps he came against the Netherlands for the reason of Sweden having been its ally? All this is essential for my understanding of the Dutch prince's character,\\" the author wrote in a letter. Neither Kostomarov nor Baron Ungern-Sternberg could provide the definitive answers to the dilemma, so Tolstoy chose to support the version contradicting that of Karamzin. According to the play, when the Spanish king \\"rose to war, threatening to chain the free nation down,\\" the Dutch prince \\"came up to help his persecuted brothers\\" and fight against Spain. Meanwhile, Karl Ungern-Sternberg's help proved to be essential in some other way. The Baron sent Tolstoy excerpts from the official Danish chronicles, some of which mentioned Johan's being King Frederick's illegitimate child. This detail provided the author with the possible motive for the assassination of the Danish Prince. On 30 November 1869, he wrote to Stasyulevich: As for the name, in excerpts provided by Baron Ungern-Sternberg and in some of the Russian chronicles, the Danish Prince had been referred to as both Johan (Ioann) and Christian (apparently as a result of confusing him with a better known brother) and Tolstoy decided to choose the latter (\\"so as for him not to be confused with Ioann Grozny\\").  The False Dmitry  Even after completing the Act 1, Tolstoy was still unsure which version of False Dmitriy I's true identity he'd support: it was just the Grigory Otrepyev one that he rejected outright. Then, the Impostor's plotline, initially considered to be significant, was dropped altogether, for this strand of the story would have got in the way of the play's main idea, as the author saw it. \\"The battle that my hero fights and loses is the battle with the ghost of his own crime, haunting him as some sort of mysterious threatening creature which gradually destroys his life… The whole drama which begins with Boris' inauguration is, in effect, nothing but a grandiose fall. It ends with Boris' death which is brought about not by poison but by the general anemia of a guilty man who comes to the realization of what a mistake his crime had been,\\" Tolstoy wrote in a letter to Princess Saine-Witgenstein on 17 October 1869.  Minor characters  There were few fictitious characters in Tsar Boris, all of them minor ones: Dementyevna, Resheto, Nakovalnya, the posadsky, Mitya. The latter's emergence Tolstoy explained in a November 30, 1869, letter to Stasyulevich: \\"The introduction of Mitya the Outlaw was prompted by Schiller's advice he's given through his Marquis of Posa character: \\"Let them treat with respect dreams of their youths.\\" What Tolstoy meant, apparently, was that Mitya appeared in the Prince Serebrenni novel, where Resheto and Nakovalnya were given a mention too. = Sources = The major source for all three plays of Aleksey Tolstoy's historical drama was Nikolay Karamzin's History of the Russian State (1816-1826). The conversation in Tsar Boris between Semyon and Boris Godunov concerning prospects of attaching peasants to land accurately reproduces fragments of History (Vol.X, 209-210, Vol.XI, 22, 86). Maria Godunova's talking of Boris' intention of making Prince Johan the King of Estonia has been borrowed from the same source (Vol.XI, 45). Among other books Tolstoy used as sources the Dutch trader Isaac Massa's memoirs published in 1868 in Brussels, Mikhail Pogodin's book The History in Characters of Boris Godunov and His Times (1868) and Nikolay Kostomarov's Moscow State's Time of Troubles in the Early XVII c. (1868). It was according to Massa's account that Tolstoy, admittedly, recreated Maria Godunova, the way she looked and behaved. From Massa's book the episode of Godunov's meeting the ex-Queen, late Prince Dmitry's mother, has been taken.Massa's book was also used by Kostomarov, so the latter might have been a more direct source for Tolstoy, Yampolsky argued. Tolstoy rejected Karamzin's version of The False Dmitry being Otrepyev, a fugitive monk. \\"We are to know for sure who he is. And we must give him name, even if we are to invent it,\\" Boris insists in the play. That was exactly Kostomarov's idea: \\"The Grishka [Otrepyev]'s name has been chosen as the first one that came to hand. They had to name [the Impostor] urgently, rip him off that awful Dmitry name,\\" he wrote.  Karamzin and Pushkin parallels  Scholars, analyzing Tsar Boris next to Aleksander Pushkin's Boris Godunov, noted several similarities, one obvious reason being that both authors used Karamzin's History of the Russian State as a major source. As a result, the prayer (which in Pushkin's play is pronounced by a young boy in Shuysky's house, and in Tolstoy's Shuysky does himself, at Romanov's) in both dramas looks like the same text. Among Tsar Boris direct borrowings from Karamzin is the scene where the Tsar is receiving ambassadors in Act 1 which is, in effect, the dramatization of the first paragraphs of Karamzin's History, Vol.IX (\\"The External Affairs\\" section). Some fragments of Tolstoy’s tragedy might be seen as references to those of Pushkin's. The Scene 1 of Act IV (with common people talking of The False Dmitry and Grigory Otrepyev dilemma) looks like almost a paste from the Boris Godunovs scene at the \\"Square before the Cathedral in Moscow\\". In fact, the whole way of the Godunov character's evolution, from The Death of Ivan the Terrible to Tsar Boris, might have been the direct consequence of Tolstoy checking himself against Pushkin, according to Yampolsky. What made Tsar Boris different from Pushkin's Boris Godunov was the philosophical aspect of its general idea. Tolstoy's Boris was in many ways cast after that of Karamzin, who pictured the doomed ruler's tragedy in metaphysical terms, as being a price he had to pay for his bloody deed. The masses turned away from Boris (as Karamzin and Tolstoy saw it) because of his rapid moral deterioration. Pushkin, on the other hand, regarded Godunov's downfall as natural in the political and social situation of the time. Heavy consciousness didn't help, but had it been clearer, this wouldn't have prevented the Tsar's demise which was inevitable \\"since what he had to fight after all, was not just the Impostor, but his own people,\\" according to Yampolsky.  Chronology issues  As in the other two dramas of the trilogy, there are several cases of chronological discrepancies in Tsar Boris. Acts II, III and IV should have been dated 1602 (according to the time of the Danish Prince Johan's arrival in Moscow) and 1604-1605 as for the False Dmitry-related events. Kleshnin who died in 1599, emerges as a participant in the events happening several years later. There was some of what scholars termed \\"factual contamination\\", too. Miranda, the papal nuncio, says things that had been actually pronounced by Pope Clement VIII's legate Allessandro di Comolo who visited Moscow in the times of Fyodor Ioannovich (Karamzin, History, Vol.X, 190). Lachin-bek's speech was that of another Persian ambassador in Russia, Azi Khozrev who (according to Karamzin's History, Vol.X, page 192) said those words in 1593.

They were listed among Germanic peoples by the Romans, following Julius Caesar's conquest of the region in 57 BC. The Segni eventually assured Caesar, by means of an embassy in 53 BC, that they would not make common cause with the other Germani on the left bank of the Rhine. Name The etymology of the name Segni is uncertain. It could derive from the Celtic roots *sego- ('strength') or *seg- ('sowing'), but an alternative Germanic origin is also possible since the Germanic -ng- consonantal cluster was often transcribed to -gn- in Latin (Reudigni, Marsigni). An etymology from *sengjōz ('those who live in a dried region'; see MHG singe 'dryness, drought'), itself a derivative of *setig ('burning, drying') can thus be posited. Maurits Gysseling proposed that it derived from a Germanic or Celtic word indicating victory.Gysseling, Het Toponymisch Woordenboek p.906 Such meanings are related to the hypotheses which see the word as deriving from a stem with meanings related to strength. Another etymology which has been proposed is a connection to an Old Irish word for net. Language Several tribes are referred to by Caesar as the \\"Germani Cisrhenani\\", to distinguish them from Germani living on the east of the Rhine, outside of the Gaulish and Roman area. Whether they actually spoke a Germanic language or not, is still uncertain. The region was strongly influenced by Gaul, and many of the personal names and tribal names from these communities appear to be Celtic. But on the other hand it was claimed by Tacitus that these Germani were the original Germani, and that the term Germani as it came to be widely used was not the original meaning. He also said that the descendants of the original Germani in his time were the Tungri.Tacitus, Germania, II 2. ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum, quoniamqui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, nongentis, evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore obmetum, mox et a se ipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur.  Geography  The Segni are presumed to have dwelled in the Luxemburgish and Belgian Ardennes. Their territory was located between that of the Treveri and the Eburones. This indicates that the Segni settled not far from the Condrusi, which themselves lived in the Condroz foothill region northwest of the Ardennes. The general area of the Belgian Germani was between the Dijle (Dyle) and Rhine rivers, and north of Luxemburg and the southern parts of the Eifel. In modern terms this area includes eastern Belgium, the southeastern parts of the Netherlands, and a part of Germany on the west of the Rhine, but north of the Moselle valley. In the 19th century, it was sometimes claimed in English and German works that the name of the Segni is preserved in a modern town supposedly called \\"Sinei or Signei\\", on the Meuse river, in the Belgian province of Namur.For example: . There is a place Ciney in that area.Gysseling, Ciney. However, Ciney, Sègne and Sugny can all be rejected on linguistic grounds.Petrokovits, p.93. Another old proposal is to place them near Sougné, near Aywaille.  History  In Julius Caesar's report of them, the Segni do not appear in the first listing of the Germani, which was a listing of Germani sending men to fight Caesar.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 2.4 But they appear in a later mention, after the defeat of the Eburones: > The Segui and Condrusi, of the nation and number of the Germans [Germani], > and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri, sent ambassadors to Caesar > to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies, nor > consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the Rhine was one > and the same; that they had formed no plans of war, and had sent no > auxiliaries to Ambiorix. Caesar, having ascertained this fact by an > examination of his prisoners, commanded that if any of the Eburones in their > flight had repaired to them, they should be sent back to him; he assures > them that if they did that, he will not injure their territories.Julius > Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 6.32 Speculation about connection to later Sunuci It has also occasionally been claimed that the Segni appear as the \\"Sunuci\\" or \\"Sinuci\\" in later Roman records, such as the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder. If so, then we have more records to refer to. Pliny described them between the Tungri and the Frisiavones. Tacitus, for example, also mentioned the Sunuci, as a people of this region during the Batavian revolt. They probably lived between the Tungri and the Ubii in Roman imperial times. The Sunuci are thought to have lived in what is now the area of Germany where it touches eastern Belgium, and the southern Netherlands. One proposal would place the Sunuci in Kornelimünster in the region of modern Aachen.
