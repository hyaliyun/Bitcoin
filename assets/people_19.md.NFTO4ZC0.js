It took place on the same day as other county council elections in the United Kingdom. These were the first elections to the new county council, which would come into effect on 1 April 1974. Future elections would take place every four years, with the next one scheduled for April 1977. The 1973 election saw the Labour Party win a strong majority on the Council. Background Gwent was created following local government reorganisation enacted by the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of Monmouthshire and Newport County Borough, which would be transferred from England to Wales in 1974. The 1973 elections were the first to the new local authorities, with councillors acting in a shadow capacity until 1 April 1974 when the new councils took full effect. The position of alderman on the local authorities was abolished, with all members of the new councils being elected ward councillors. Overview of the result Seventy-eight Gwent County Council seats in 66 electoral wards were up for election in April 1973. Labour overall increased its presence in comparison with the old councils, though there were some close battles between Labour, the Liberals and Independents in some wards. In Cwmbran Labour did not fare so well, with an Independent and a Ratepayer candidate winning seats, and the Conservatives polling strongly. } Ward results Contests took place in 49 wards, with candidates in seventeen of the wards being elected unopposed. =Aberbeeg and Six Bells (1 seat)= =Abercarn and Cwmcarn (1 seat)= =Abergavenny Cantref and Grofield (1 seat)= =Abergavenny Castle and Priory (1 seat)= =Abersychan Central (1 seat)= =Abersychan North (1 seat)= =Abertillery (1 seat)= =Alexandra (1 seat)= =Allt-yr-yn (1 seat)= =Alway (2 seats)= =Bassaleg and Marshfield (1 seat)= =Bedwellty No. 2 Pengam (1 seat)= =Bedwellty No. 3 Argoed and Cefn Fforest (1 seat)= =Beechwood (2 seats)= =Bettws (1 seat)= =Blackwood (1 seat)= =Blaenavon (1 seat)= =Brynmawr (1 seat)= =Caerleon (1 seat)= =Caerwent (1 seat)= =Caldicot (1 seat)= =Central (1 seat)= =Chepstow (1 seat)= =Crickhowell and Llanelly Parish (1 seat)= =Crucorny Fawr and Llantilio Pertholey (1 seat)= =Crumlin (1 seat)= =Cwmbran Central and Llantarnam (1 seat)= =Cwmtillery (1 seat)= =Ebbw Vale, Badminton, Beaufort and N Central= =Ebbw Vale Central, Cwm and South Central= =Fairwater and Henllys (1 seat)= =Langstone (1 seat)= =Llanfoist and Llanover (1 seat)= =Llanfrechfa Lower (2 seats)= =Llanhilleth (1 seat)= =Liswerry (2 seats)= =Malpas (1 seat)= =Monmouth (1 seat)= =Mynyddislwyn Penmaen (1 seat)= =Nantyglo and Blaina Central and South (1 seat)= =Nantyglo and Blaina North (1 seat)= =Newbridge (1 seat)= =Old Cwmbran (1 seat)= Councillor Rex was a credit company agent and had been a member of Cwmbran Urban Council for 16 years. =Panteg East (1 seat)= This was local newspaper reporter Don Touhig's first ever election, which he won by over 700 votes. =Panteg West (1 seat)= =Pontllanfraith (1 seat)= =Pontnewydd (1 seat)= Councillor Pritchard was General Secretary of the Monmouthshire Federation of Ratepayers. =Pontnewydd North (1 seat)= =Pontnewydd South (1 seat)= =Pontypool (1 seat)= =Ringland (2 seats)= =Risca Central (1 seat)= =Risca North (1 seat)= =Risca South (1 seat)= =Rogerstone (1 seat)= =Shaftesbury (2 seats)= =Shirenewton and Tintern (1 seat)= =St Julians (2 seats)= =St Woolos (2 seats)= =Tredegar Central and West (1 seat)= Bill Harry had been one of four Monmouthshire county councillors in Tredegar for 13 years, but Gwent County Council would only have three Tredegar county councillors, with Harry being the loser against Angus Donaldson who was a sitting Liberal Monmouthshire councillor for Tredegar. =Tredegar Georgetown (1 seat)= =Tredegar Sirhowy (1 seat)= Councillor Thomas won after a recount. =Upper Cwmbran (1 seat)= =Usk and Pontypool Rural (1 seat)= =Victoria (1 seat)= Percy Jones, an alderman and former major of Newport County Borough had been a council member in Newport for 20 years. =Ynysddu (1 seat)= See also * 1972 Newport County Borough Council election Notes References Gwent Category:Council elections in Gwent ","title":"1973 Gwent County Council election"},{"id":"61776353","text":"James 'Jim' H Sheffield (born 1947) is a British former sports shooter.

In 2000, the approximately 31 km long Freiberg-Holzhau railway in Saxony was leased from Deutsche Bahn AG and was completely renovated during a 6-month line closure. While the Deutsche Bahn previously only used one train per direction every two hours and required a travel time of over 60 minutes, the modernization made it possible to reduce the travel time to 40 minutes, so that rail transport is now offered at hourly intervals with the same number of vehicles and without the need for additional personnel. Instead of 54 million Deutsche Mark, as assumed by the DB, the modernisation was achieved with 15 million Deutsche Mark.

The film follows a man known as Wrinkles the Clown who lives in Naples, Florida. For a fee of \\"a few hundred dollars\\", he will attend birthdays, scare misbehaving kids, and prank people. The film was released in the United States on October 4, 2019 by Magnet Releasing.  Premise  In 2015, a video is uploaded to YouTube depicting a clown named Wrinkles emerging from beneath a young girl's bed. It quickly goes viral. In the following months, it emerges that Wrinkles is a professional clown in Florida who offers his services to the parents of misbehaving children, showing up to frighten them unannounced as a deterrent to future bad behavior. Stickers bearing Wrinkles' face and phone number begin appearing all over Florida and thousands of people begin calling it for various reasons, from parents wanting to hire Wrinkles to people making death threats. Over the course of the next four years, Wrinkles becomes an object of folklore both locally in Florida and across the United States, with children routinely calling the number either alone or with friends as a sort of rite of passage. Additionally, further videos appear depicting Wrinkles either frightening people outside their homes or engaging in disturbing behavior, such as waving to motorists from a darkened roadside. In 2019, Wrinkles agrees to allow a documentary crew to follow him in his daily life and explain his philosophy. Wrinkles is revealed as an elderly homeless man who lives in a van in the woods outside of Naples, Florida and spends much of his free time fishing, drinking, and going to strip clubs, occasionally using the money he makes from his appearances as Wrinkles to check into motels. He claims to have no personal ideology and states that he only works as Wrinkles for the money. Discussions with Wrinkles are intercut with interviews with a variety of individuals discussing the phenomenon, including a psychologist who debates whether Wrinkles' behavior is abusive; folklore experts who compare Wrinkles to a contemporary Bloody Mary and other mythic rituals that figure prominently in American adolescence; a historian who explores the history of the evil clown trope, tying it back to Punch and Judy; and a professional clown unhappy with the recent negative attention that Wrinkles and the remake of Stephen King's It have brought to the profession. The documentary crew further discusses Wrinkles with a number of children around America who have been impacted by his videos, from a young girl who wishes to fight him to an aspiring horror filmmaker inspired by Wrinkles' YouTube videos to begin conceptualizing his own movies. The documentary crew also examines the Wrinkles phenomenon in the context of the 2016 Clown Sightings. Midway through the documentary it is revealed that the man the crew has been following is in fact an actor named D.B. Lambert, hired by the \\"real\\" Wrinkles, a Florida performance artist, to portray Wrinkles' secret identity. Wrinkles explains that both characters were created as part of an elaborate art project. With his face blurred out, the real Wrinkles shows the documentary crew behind-the- scenes footage depicting the making of various Wrinkles videos; he further reveals that he has never actually gone to anyone's house, and that all the videos depicting Wrinkles frightening children were in fact made with the participation of actors. Wrinkles expresses satisfaction with the impact the project has had while contemplating its future, and the role it has had in contemporary American pop culture.

Prior to this, Khan was one of the commanders of the Battles of Gour during the Conquest of Sylhet in 1303. Early Persian manuscripts and inscriptions relating to Shah Jalal name Sikandar Khan Ghazi as well, highlighting his role as a commander in the battles. Background Sikandar Khan Ghazi's maternal uncle was the Sultan of Lakhnauti, Shamsuddin Firuz Shah. He was of Turco- Persian tradition, and entered Bengal alongside Firuz. Career Sikandar Khan was appointed as a commander of an army and took part in many expeditions across Bengal. He defeated Raja Matuk of the Sundarbans in South Bengal. He accompanied Firuz in the conquests of Sonargaon and Satgaon, before reaching the Sylhet region. Shaykh Burhanuddin, a Muslim living in Tultikar, Gour, notified Shamsuddin Firuz Shah of the injustice he was facing and Firuz ordered Sikandar to lead the expedition to Gour Kingdom. Sikandar's army, however, were inexperienced in the foreign hilly terrain and had no option but to retreat back to Bengal to avoid casualties. When Shah Jalal arrived in Bengal, Sikandar met him and greeted him with respect. He asked the cleric to join him in the expedition and that it is not the Raja's wealth and property which he wants but rather to propagate Islam in the Sylhet region. With the assistance of Shah Jalal and Syed Nasiruddin, the Conquest of Gour was successful. The King of the Gour Kingdom, Raja Gour Govinda escaped to Harong Hurong cave and was never heard of again. Following the conquest, Sikandar was made the wazir and ruled over Sylhet. He reportedly ruled from modern-day Badarpur in Karimganj towards the east of the Sylhet region. Ghazi's drawing room can be seen in the village of Gorkapon sitting on the banks of the Barak River. Death Khan drowned whilst journeying on a boat to catch fish in at the junction of the Surma, Barak and Kushiyara rivers in Badarpur. His body was never found. Due to this he is considered a shahid (martyr) in Islam. He was succeeded by Haydar Ghazi, who was appointed by Shah Jalal himself. This shows that Khan's death took place before 1346, which was the year of Shah Jalal's death. There is a poem found in the biography of Shah Jalal, Tarikh-e- Jalali, which mentions the incident.

Biography Roitenberg was born to a Jewish family, the son of Sarah and Norman Roitenberg. Roitenberg graduated with a B.A. in Journalism from the University of Minnesota. After school, he worked in the advertising department of Northwestern Auto Parts in Minneapolis. Then he went to work for his father-in-law who owned Minnesota Wholesalers which sold horse supplies. During his tenure, he expanded the company into a catalog showroom business that also sold small appliances, housewares, electronics, and jewelry. Upon his father-in-law's death, Roitenberg was unable to obtain a satisfactory equity interest in the company and ventured out on his own founding Creative Merchandising & Publishing in 1960. As he had little in the way of resources, he could not support his own showroom so he instead developed a new business model which focused on producing catalogs for small businesses who wanted to develop a catalog presence but did not have the expertise, resources, and buying power to secure lower prices from manufacturers. Roitenberg's company allowed them to purchase collectively and secure lower prices. In 1961, he changed the name to Modern Merchandising Inc. Due to its origin as a catalog publisher, Modern Merchandising published its own catalog along with that of competitors Service Merchandise (founded by Harry Zimmerman) and Best Products (founded by Sydney Lewis); the three companies (whose owners were friends) had regional non-compete agreements with each other. In 1982, Modern Merchandising, then the 3rd largest catalog retailer, was acquired by Best Products in a stock transaction worth $109 million. The merger was accretive as Best Products' showrooms were mainly on the East Coast, Texas, and California while Modern Merchandising was mostly in the Midwest and Northwest.

The building, which was the headquarters of West Sussex County Council from 1916 to 1936, is a Grade I listed building. History The building was built for John Edes, a maltster, and his wife, Hannah, and completed in 1696. It was originally thought to have been designed by Sir Christopher Wren but this theory has more recently been discounted as unlikely. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays facing West Street with the last two bays at each end slightly projected forwards; the central bay, which was faced with Portland stone, featured a doorway on the ground floor with broken curved pediment above; there was a casement window on the first floor flanked by narrow Ionic order pilasters and a pediment above. The house passed down the Edes family line to their son, Henry, and grand-daughter, Mary. It was then acquired by Peckham Williams, Sheriff of Sussex in the mid-18th century. It then passed down the Williams family line, being inherited by a senior physician at Chichester Infirmary, Dr Joseph McCarogher, in 1848. It was then acquired by a local man, William Duke, in 1860. During the 19th century it was known as Westgate House, but it was referred to as West Street House from 1905 and as Wren's House from 1911. After being owned by the artist, Walter Ernest Tower, in the early 20th century, it was acquired by West Sussex County Council for use as a meeting place and administrative centre in 1916. After the County Council moved to County Hall in 1936, it became the headquarters of the County Library and also the County Record Office. In 1967 the name of the house was simplified to Wren House and after the County Record Office moved to new facilities in Orchard Street in 1989, it became a venue for weddings and other ceremonies. The name was changed again in 1993, this time to Edes House, after a historical analysis by the county archivist, Francis Steer, discounted the theory that Wren had designed the building, on the basis that he was wholly employed designing St Paul's Cathedral at the time. In October 2018, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited the building where they viewed an original copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, which had been uncovered in the County Archives. Works of art in the building include a series of watercolour paintings by the local artist, George Herbert Catt (1869-1920), who lived at the Depot House in Chichester.Mosley, Charles, editor.

She lectured often, across the United States. She addressed a national YWCA meeting in San Francisco in 1922, on the topic of flappers: \\"Why rail at the flapper? She is as good and as true as any girl of any time. She is but the product of the present and the conditions of the present,\\" she explained.

It is located on the banks of the Kirtankhola river in the city of Barisal. The port operates daily services between Dhaka and Barisal as well as most of the districts in southern part of the country including Chandpur, Narayanganj, Bhola, Laxmipur, Pirojpur and Barguna. It also operates inter- district routes around Barisal. The port of Barisal is an important hub of transportation system connecting different parts of Bangladesh through waterways. It is also considered as a transit point between Mongla and Chittagong marine ports, Khulna and Dhaka and other river ports of Bangladesh as well as between West Bengal and Assam and Tripura of India. History Barisal launch terminal Barisal River Port Launch Terminal, Bangladesh (4) Barisal River Port Area Rocket Steamer Terminal The Barisal river port has a recorded existence since the Mughal Empire. It was then called \\"Gird-e- Bandar\\", a river station which was known for the trade of salt, spices, and woods. It was turned into Barisal Bandar (port) during the British rule after the town committee was established in 1869 and achieved municipal status in 1876. Steamers first began to use the rivers of Barisal shortly before 1880. In 1884 Bengal Central Flotilla Company introduced regular steamer service between Barisal and Khulna. Subsequently, Barisal became an important steamer centre for both inter-district routes and as a station on the main route from other districts of Bangladesh to Calcutta and as a terminus for branch lines from Chittagong, Noakhali and Madaripur. There existed also a number of feeder services in the interior of the district. It later became the regional headquarters of Indian General Navigation, River Steam Navigation, Indian General River Steamer companies in British period to connect North and Eastern part of Bengal with the capital city. After the 1947 Bengal partition, Pakistan River Steamer Services (PRS) was formed and handed over its service it to East Pakistan Inland Water Transport Authority (EPIWTA) in 1958. Formed under East Pakistan Inland Water Transportation Ordinance‚Äô the EPIWTA gave Barisal River Station the status of River Port in 1960. Followed by the independence of Bangladesh, EPIWTA was named as Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), which currently takes care of all related development, maintenance, and operations of inland water transport and of inland waterways in Bangladesh.  Development of the port  In 1964, the East Pakistan Inland Water Transport Authority (EPIWTA) undertook a port development initiative for the five major river ports of the eastern region of the then Pakistan including Dhaka, Barisal, Chandpur, Khulna and Narayanganj. The project included the construction of permanent terminal buildings and other facilities for the transportation of passengers and goods. However, the port of Barisal project was left unimplemented for an unknown reason and only a half-bricked tin-shed structure was built in 1980. After years, the Bangladesh government undertook a project in 2003 for the construction of a modern river terminal and jetties in Barisal river port at a cost of Tk 9.5 crore. It was later revised again and the government finally approved a port development and modernization project in 2009 at a cost of about Tk 17.6 crore for the construction of a modern terminal building on 1,554 square metre land, 1500 square metre parking yard, 1200 metre steel boundary and retaining wall, 714 metre walkway, 1,000 square metre cargo shed, 400 square metre transit cargo shed, 120 feet long six pontoons with modern loading and unloading facilities, four steel gangway, passenger lounge and waiting room with health and sanitation facilities, development and maintenance of navigability by regular dredging and beautification of the terminal and adjacent areas of the port. In March 2010, the Barisal river port development and modernization project started and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011. The new port was inaugurated by the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2013.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1976. The site is also popularly known as the . Overview The site is the largest collection of horizontal cave tombs in Shizuoka Prefecture, and is located on the eastern side of the Tagata Plain in the Kano River basin at the northern end of the Izu Peninsula. The tombs are located on a steep hill with a height of about 20-30 meters and is dug into the tuff layer in four to five layers. Some of the upper level tombs are heavily weathered, and some of the lowest level tombs are buried. The tombs have rectangular, sometimes square, openings with vaulted ceilings averaging 1.5 meters heigh, and are between two and three meters deep. The passages are filled with river stones. The site consisted of between 300 and 500 tombs in a 600 by 250 meter area at an elevation of 20-30 meters on a hillside, and are orientated south, east or west, facing the Tagata Plains, Mount Fuji, or Mount Hakone. Per a study by the Nippon University in 1947, the tombs can be divided into five distinct groups based on location and design, which were labelled \\"A\\" through \\"E\\". The site has been known since at least the Meiji period; however, most of groups \\"A\\", \\"D\\" and \\"E\\" have been destroyed by property development and modern housing. The preserved area consists of groups \\"B\\" and C\\" with approximately 116 tombs. As a result of the Kannami Town Board of Education survey in 1997, and additional 17 unopened tombs were discovered, leading to the possibility that more may exist both within and without the protected area. Grave goods recovered from the tombs include shards of Haji ware and Sue ware earthenware, gold, copper and stone jewelry (including magatama and cylindrical beads), weapons and horse fittings. One of the finds was a tortoise plastron used as an oracle bone for divination purposes. The graves are thought to have been created from the end of the 6th century to the end of the 8th century, and cremated human bones have also been found in the more recent graves, indicating a period of transition between burial and cremation.

SAM most commonly affects the arteries supplying the intestines and abdominal organs.  Signs and Symptoms  Varies depending on the location of the affected blood vessels. Gastrointestinal System: * Acute abdominal pain (most common) * Flank pain * Nausea * Vomiting * Diarrhea * Bloody stools * Back pain Nervous System * Headache * Stroke The most severe signs occur if an aneurysm ruptures potentially resulting in: * Shock * Loss of consciousness * Bleeding into the abdominal cavity * Bleeding into the brain  Epidemiology  Since it was first reported in 1976 there have been 101 documented cases of Segmental Arterial Mediolysis. Although typically seen in older patients with an average age of 57 years old, it can affect patients of any age and does not favor one gender over another.  Mechanism  # The middle layer of an artery, called the media, made of smooth muscle is damaged. # Mediolysis occurs when the smooth muscle cells in the area of damage are destroyed. # Small gaps are formed in the wall of the artery which then fill with blood. # Gaps create weakness in the wall of the artery, allowing increasing pressure from blood to expand the gaps resulting in an aneurysm. # Aneurysms have potential for rupture.  Diagnosis  Often Segmental Arterial Mediolysis is diagnosed after clinical presentation with symptoms as above followed by CT angiogram or MRI demonstrating aneurysm(s). The gold standard method for confirming the diagnosis is surgical resection of the affected area of blood vessel followed by histologic investigation under a microscope. Segmental Arterial Mediolysis must be differentiated from fibromuscular dysplasia, atherosclerosis, and other systemic vasculidites including polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu's arteritis, Behcet's disease, cystic medial necrosis, and cystic adventitial artery disease.  Treatment  Patients presenting with bleeding into the abdominal cavity require possible blood transfusions and emergent intervention with coil embolization via catheter angiography. Patients without active bleeding, but diagnosed aneurysms should have strict blood pressure control with antihypertensive drugs to decrease the risk of aneurysm rupture.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The earliest mention of a building on the site was when a structure referred to as the \\"Market House\\", which contained a supply of arms, was seized during an uprising by a group of some 600 royalists in 1648 during the English Civil War; the revolt was put down by Sir Michael Livesey and his parliamentary troops. A new building of Portland Stone financed by Arthur Ingram, 6th Viscount of Irvine and containing a poultry and butter market was completed in 1712. The building fell into disrepair and was substantially rebuilt with funding from Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk in 1812. Although the facade was retained, it was largely rebuilt again with support from Henry Fitzalan- Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in 1888. It was originally used as a facility for dispensing justice and a meeting place for the local town council but, following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it also became the meeting place of West Sussex County Council. After the County Council moved to Edes House in Chichester in 1916, the Old Town Hall continued to be used as a courthouse and, for a while, was used as a meeting place for Horsham Urban District Council. However Horsham Urban District Council bought Horsham Park House and grounds and began using the house as their council offices from 1928. Important trials in the court house including the initial stages of the trial of John Haigh, commonly known as the Acid Bath Murderer, who murdered six people and disposed of their bodies using sulphuric acid; he was committed for trial at Lewes Assizes in April 1949. The Town Hall ceased to be used as a courthouse after the new law courts opened in Hurst Road in 1974. More recently the upper floor of the Town Hall has housed the Local Registry Office and the ground floor was used as an occasional flea market until it was let as a restaurant.

Schweikert, and lyrics by Frank Reardon. The story, based on Phillips' 1955 play The Funnyman, concerns a comic strip creator and his character, Rumple, who resists the discontinuation of the strip. It was produced on Broadway in 1957. Production After a pre-Broadway tryout at the Shubert Theatre in Philadelphia starting October 21, 1957,\\"New Musical at the Shubert\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, October 22, 1957, p. 27 Rumple premiered on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre on November 6, 1957, and closed on December 14, 1957, after 45 performances.

The cast starred Eddie Foy Jr., Gretchen Wyler, and Stephen Douglass, and included several actors in minor roles who later became famous, including Elliott Gould and Barbara Perry.

He decides to discontinue his newspaper feature called Mr. Rumple, but the Rumple character comes to life and objects to being canceled and condemned to Oblivia (the land of forgotten cartoon characters). Rumple has 48 hours to persuade his creator to continue his existence and uses magical tricks on the humans. Anna is another character in the comic strip, Rumple's dumb-blonde girlfriend, who is trying to avoid Oblivia. The humans other than Nelson cannot see Rumple or Anna (so that when Nelson is talking to them, he appears insane), but the comic strip characters can see and hear the humans. Judy is Nelson's fianc√©; Kate is a man-hunting gag writer who pens the stories for Crandal's strip. Dr. Winslow is an understanding psychiatrist. When Rumple is forced by the police to draw a picture of his girl for the missing-person investigation, the two comic strip characters are saved from Oblivia.

At the time, it was the deadliest collision in the railroad's history until the Kew Gardens train crash later that year. The crash was a head-on collision caused by two trains running along the same gauntlet track due to construction.  Background  At the time of the crash, the Montauk Branch was undergoing a program to eliminate grade crossings, where the roadway and track intersected at the same elevation. A new elevated viaduct was being constructed just north of the original at-grade railroad line's right-of-way. As a result, the original line's right-of-way narrowed to one gauntlet track shared by both westbound and eastbound trains for about , located partly on a curve. At the gauntlet track, the two tracks ran parallel on a single track bed; the pairs of tracks overlapped, so only one pair of rails were able to be used at a time. There was a signal west of Banks Avenue for eastbound trains, and train traffic movements into the gauntlet track were controlled by a dispatcher at Rockville Centre station. In addition, at the time the Rockville Centre station was undergoing reconstruction, and a temporary platform had been set up for trains in both directions east of the old station, at North Park Avenue. Eastbound Babylon-bound train #78, driven by Jacob Kiefer, consisted of 12 cars carrying about 800 passengers. It left Pennsylvania Station at 10:03 p.m. EST and was due to arrive at Rockville Centre at 10:36. It passed through the red signal at Banks Avenue at 10:35 and began to slow down. Westbound Penn Station-bound train #175, driven by J.W. Markin, left Babylon at 9:58 p.m. By the time it approached Rockville Centre it was traveling at . Both trains were traveling along the gauntlet track. Had train #175 been traveling faster, it could have passed through the gauntlet track before train #78 entered the gauntlet track, thus avoiding the collision.  Collision  The collision occurred at 10:43 p.m. EST, along the gauntlet track, between Merrick Road and Banks Avenue. Because the trains ran on the right side of the gauntlet track, the left sides of both trains were more heavily damaged. The force of the crash had split the first car of the westbound train in half. Initial reports stated that 20 people had been killed. The New York Times reported that \\"one of the cars was virtually torn apart\\", and that dead bodies were piled five-deep in the leading cars of each train. In the final victim count, 32 people were killed. Of these, 29 died at the scene and three died later at the hospital. The front cars in both trains, usually reserved for smokers as per LIRR policy, were more crowded than the trailing cars, thus contributing to the high death toll. In addition, at least 76 were injured, though an injury count of up to 158 has been recorded.  Response  First responders came from between away. Every firefighter and police officer in Lynbrook and Rockville Centre was summoned to the site of the crash. Two hours after the collision, only six bodies had been extracted from the wreckage, and many of the injured were still trapped. To prevent rescue workers from being electrocuted, the LIRR cut power to the gauntlet track's third rails after receiving reports of the crash. In total, 250 doctors and 450 firefighters and LIRR emergency workers responded to the crash, along with numerous volunteers. The injured were transported to nearby hospitals such as South Nassau Communities Hospital, which became overcrowded as a result. Five months later, two patients were still in the hospital. Because many movie theaters were playing films at the time of the crash, there were thousands of people in the vicinity. As these films concluded, many of these moviegoers and others went to see the crash. Police officers estimated that by one hour after the crash, there were 30,000 people near the wreck, many of whom attempted to observe from several miles away. A temporary morgue was set up at the Second Baptist Church on Banks Avenue.  Aftermath  The elevated LIRR viaduct that opened five months after the crash After the crash, two inquiries were made into the causes of the collision. Kiefer was placed under arrest at his home, while Markin was questioned and then released by police. Kiefer was arraigned, then released on bail, on February 21. The mayor of Rockville Centre called for automatic train control systems to be installed. At a New York Public Service Commission hearing less than a week later, the LIRR offered to install train stop devices at the entrances to the gauntlet track, which would derail trains if they passed the red signals. Concurrently, a Nassau County grand jury was considering a charge of negligence against Kiefer. The elevated viaduct near the crash site opened on July 17, 1950, exactly five months after the crash. The completion of the segment of elevated viaduct also included the opening of a new elevated Rockville Centre station. 7,000 people attended the opening ceremony, including 2,000 residents of Rockville Centre. Kiefer, who had worked for the LIRR for 27 years, was suspended from the LIRR without pay and faced a criminal trial after the collision. Were he to be convicted, he could have been sentenced to no more than 15 years in prison. At the trial, Markin alleged that Kiefer had passed the red signal west of Banks Avenue, even though Markin's train had the right of way. Kiefer argued that he had lost consciousness in the moments leading up to the crash due to hypertension, and that he had lost alertness soon after passing Lynbrook station. His defense attorneys stated that the gauntlet track was dangerous because it forced two trains to share the same right-of-way. On September 27, 1950, he was declared not guilty of all charges. = Kew Gardens train crash = The Kew Gardens train crash, which occurred only nine months later, killed 78 people and injured 363, surpassing the Rockville Centre crash as the deadliest crash in LIRR and New York state history. This crash was also caused by a motorman overrunning a red signal. The two incidents, combined, killed over 100 riders and resulted in renewed scrutiny of the LIRR's infrastructure. At the time of the two crashes, the LIRR had suffered from years of underinvestment, as most cars were built during the 1910s. The company had been prevented from increasing fares between 1918 and 1947 by the Public Service Commission, despite increased operating costs. In 1950, the LIRR had already filed for bankruptcy reorganization. In an investigative report published in response to the Rockville Centre crash, the Public Service Commission found that fatigue and a lack of proper crew procedures were elements in both the Rockville Centre and Kew Gardens crashes. The commission suggested six improvements that could be made to the LIRR, including signal improvements and automatic train control. After the crash, the LIRR began a $6 million program to install Automatic Speed Control (ASC) on its tracks. The first segment of ASC went into service in May 1951. The Pennsylvania Railroad (the then-owner of the LIRR) terminated the bankruptcy and began a 12-year improvement program at a cost of $58 million. The LIRR was exempted from much of its tax burden and gained freedom to charge realistic fares. Ultimately, the LIRR became reorganized as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which was formed to manage the LIRR and still operates it.

Life He was born on 2 May 1905 the son of Foster Woodward. He studied Chemistry at the University of London. In 1930 he joined the Sutton Oak Chemical Defence Research Establishment on Reginald Road in St Helens, Merseyside. This establishment was Britain's primary poison gas manufacturer, making large quantities of mustard gas. The 20 acre site was impossible to hide, and despite attempts at secrecy the plant was known as the \\"Poison Gas Works\\" or the \\"Magnum\\" (its former name). It had transformed from the Magnum Steelworks to the United Kingdom Chemical Products Company in 1915, and had first begun work on chemical weapons. A loophole in the wording of the Third Geneva Convention in 1925 (relating to chemical weapons) allowed countries to produce such products for research or defence purposes. The company was therefore named to cover this pretence.https://www.suttonbeauty.org.uk/suttonhistory/poisongas/ He created a variant of mustard gas calle \\"HT\\" or \\"Runcol\\". In 1932 he left and was replaced by Prof Robinson. He returned in 1937 as head of research. At the outbreak of war in 1939 they were placed under the control of the Ministry of Supply, under the control of Leslie Hore-Belisha. In 1940 most poison gas production was relocated to Rhydymwyn in North Wales, but Sutton Oak continued as the primary research establishment. A programme of expansion and modernisation began. Prof James B. Conant visited the facility in 1942, to offer American advice. A continuing high accident rate at the facility was blamed on individuals not following safety procedures, but underlying safety protocol was clearly poor in terms of minimising health risk to workers.Memories of Sutton 1, David N Gerrard Research includes creation of the deadly German poisons, sarin (GB) and ethyl sarin (GE), which always required a doctor present whilst handling. Creating around 50kg of these toxins per week, production clearly exceeded the needs of pure research, but it is unclear why such high amounts were created.https://www.suttonbeauty.org.uk/suttonhistory/poisongas/ In 1949 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Hirst, Edmund Percival, William Murdoch Cumming and Sir Patrick Ramsay Laird. In 1949 Woodward saw the relocation of most of the Sutton Oak nerve agent process to Nancekuke airfield near Redruth in Cornwall. In 1956 he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). From 1956 to 1971 he was Director of the Arthur D. Little Research Institute in Inveresk, east of Edinburgh. He was also Chairman of Biotech Consulting Ltd. He died on 3 May 1985, the day after his 80th birthday.

They are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios with different climate policies.. Atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ concentrations by SSP across the 21st century (projected by MAGICC6, a simple/reduced complexity climate model). Each dotted point represents an average of simulated values generated from 6 climate models (AIM/CGE, GCAM4, IMAGE, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM, REMIND-MAGPIE, & WITCH-GLOBIOM).SSP Database (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) - Version 2.0 https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/ Methane emissions projections The scenarios are: *SSP1: Sustainability (Taking the Green Road) *SSP2: Middle of the Road *SSP3: Regional Rivalry (A Rocky Road) *SSP4: Inequality (A Road divided) *SSP5: Fossil-fueled Development (Taking the Highway) . They will be used to help produce the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on global warming, due in 2021. The SSPs provide narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments. These storylines are a qualitative description of logic relating elements of the narratives to each other. In terms of quantitative elements, they provide data accompanying the scenarios on national population, urbanization and GDP (per capita). The SSPs can be combined with various Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), to explore possible future pathways both with regards to socioeconomic and climate pathways.  SSP1: Sustainability (Taking the Green Road)  The world shifts gradually, but pervasively, toward a more sustainable path, emphasizing more inclusive development that respects perceived environmental boundaries. Management of the global commons slowly improves, educational and health investments accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on economic growth shifts toward a broader emphasis on human well-being. Driven by an increasing commitment to achieving development goals, inequality is reduced both across and within countries. Consumption is oriented toward low material growth and lower resource and energy intensity.  SSP2: Middle of the road  The world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns. Development and income growth proceeds unevenly, with some countries making relatively good progress while others fall short of expectations. Global and national institutions work toward but make slow progress in achieving sustainable development goals. Environmental systems experience degradation, although there are some improvements and overall the intensity of resource and energy use declines. Global population growth is moderate and levels off in the second half of the century. Income inequality persists or improves only slowly and challenges to reducing vulnerability to societal and environmental changes remain.  SSP3: Regional rivalry (A Rocky Road)  A resurgent nationalism, concerns about competitiveness and security, and regional conflicts push countries to increasingly focus on domestic or, at most, regional issues. Policies shift over time to become increasingly oriented toward national and regional security issues. Countries focus on achieving energy and food security goals within their own regions at the expense of broader-based development. Investments in education and technological development decline. Economic development is slow, consumption is material-intensive, and inequalities persist or worsen over time. Population growth is low in industrialized and high in developing countries. A low international priority for addressing environmental concerns leads to strong environmental degradation in some regions.  SSP4: Inequality (A Road Divided)  Highly unequal investments in human capital, combined with increasing disparities in economic opportunity and political power, lead to increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. Over time, a gap widens between an internationally-connected society that contributes to knowledge- and capital-intensive sectors of the global economy, and a fragmented collection of lower-income, poorly educated societies that work in a labor intensive, low-tech economy. Social cohesion degrades and conflict and unrest become increasingly common. Technology development is high in the high-tech economy and sectors. The globally connected energy sector diversifies, with investments in both carbon-intensive fuels like coal and unconventional oil, but also low-carbon energy sources. Environmental policies focus on local issues around middle and high income areas.  SSP5: Fossil- Fueled Development (Taking the Highway)  This world places increasing faith in competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies to produce rapid technological progress and development of human capital as the path to sustainable development. Global markets are increasingly integrated. There are also strong investments in health, education, and institutions to enhance human and social capital. At the same time, the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuel resources and the adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world. All these factors lead to rapid growth of the global economy, while global population peaks and declines in the 21st century. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed. There is faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological systems, including by geo- engineering if necessary.  Projected implications of scenarios  A 2020 study projects that regions inhabited by a third of the human population could become as hot as the hottest parts of the Sahara within 50 years without a change in patterns of population growth and without migration, unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.

The event was held at the Stride Bank Center in Enid, Oklahoma on September 14, 2019 and aired live on Impact Plus. It was the eleventh event under the Victory Road chronology. Nine professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Michael Elgin defeated TJP. In other prominent matches on the undercard, Taya Valkyrie successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Rosemary, Moose defeated former mixed martial artist Stephan Bonnar, MVP defeated Chavo Guerrero, Jr. to capture the WCR Heavyweight Championship and Brian Cage and Eddie Edwards defeated Desi Hit Squad members Mahabali Shera and Rohit Raju in a tag team match. Production =Background= In 2004, Impact Wrestling (then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) discontinued weekly pay-per-view events after the introduction of its television show Impact! and held its first monthly pay-per-view, Victory Road, that November. Victory Road continued to be a regular monthly pay-per-view event for TNA until 2012, when the promotion discontinued most of its monthly pay-per-views in 2013 in favor of the new pre-recorded One Night Only events. Victory Road would be revived as a \\"One Night Only\\" event in 2014, and a special edition of Impact's weekly television series in 2017. On August 8, 2019, Impact Wrestling announced on its website that Victory Road would return as a monthly special, exclusively to be streamed on Impact Plus. The event would be held in conjunction with independent promotion World Class Revolution (WCR) and would take place on September 14 at the Stride Bank Center, which was confirmed on the venue's official website. =Storylines= On September 13, Impact Wrestling and World Class Revolution held a special televised event called \\"Operation Override\\", where Chavo Guerrero, Jr. defended the WCR Heavyweight Championship against MVP but retained the title via disqualification. This led to a rematch between Guerrero and MVP for the WCR title at Victory Road. At Slammiversary XVII, Taya Valkyrie successfully defended the Knockouts Championship against Havok, Rosemary and Su Yung in a Monster's Ball match. A title defense for Valkyrie against Rosemary was later announced for Victory Road. In the summer of 2019, Moose began targeting mixed martial artist Ken Shamrock by insulting the latter in his promos, which sparked a rivalry between Moose and Shamrock. A warm-up match for Moose was announced as he was scheduled to take on former mixed martial artist Stephan Bonnar at Victory Road. Moose and Bonnar had previously teamed to take on Bobby Lashley and King Mo in a losing effort at the 2017 Bound for Glory. Event =Preliminary matches= In the opening match, The North (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) were scheduled to take on Rich Swann and Fuego Del Sol in a tag team contest but Swann was replaced by Retro Randy. North executed a double spinebuster in the end for the win. Next, Kiera Hogan took on Desi Derata. Near the end of the match, Derata attempted to hit a spinning slam on Hogan but Hogan blinded her with a powder and left the ring with Derata chasing her outside the ring where Hogan superkicked Derata and went back to the ring while Derata lost by count-out. Next, Sami Callihan took on Hawk. After a back and forth match, Callihan nailed a Cactus Special to Hawk for the win. Next, Chavo Guerrero, Jr. defended the WCR Heavyweight Championship against MVP. Near the end of the match, Guerrero attempted to execute a frog splash but MVP raised his knees to block the move and nailed a running boot on Guerrero to defeat him to win the WCR Heavyweight Championship. Next, Taya Valkyrie defended the Impact Knockouts Championship against Rosemary. Valkyrie tried to goad Rosemary into walking out of the match but Rosemary refused and attacked her to begin the match. Near the end of the match, Valkyrie blinded Rosemary with a hairspray and nailed a Curb Stomp for the win. Next, Moose took on Stephan Bonnar. Near the end of the match, Bonnar applied an armbar on Moose but Moose caught the ropes, forcing Bonnar to break the hold and then Moose rolled him up into an inside cradle and used the ropes for leverage to win the match. The penultimate match of the event was scheduled to be Eddie Edwards against Rohit Raju. Raju was disqualified when Mahabali Shera attacked Edwards and then Brian Cage made the save for Edwards, making it a tag team match pitting Cage and Edwards against Shera and Raju. Cage nailed a F5 on Raju, allowing Edwards to hit a Boston Knee Party on Raju for the win. =Main event match= In the main event, TJP took on Michael Elgin. Near the end of the match, Elgin gained control by taking out TJP with two lariats and then nailed a turnbuckle powerbomb and an Elgin Bomb for the win.

The four apartments already completed and occupied by the people were Jains Coral Cove(Jain Housing and Construction Ltd), H2O Holy Faith (Holy Faith Builders and Developers Pvt Ltd) and Alfa Serene (Alfa Ventures Private Ltd) and Golden Kayaloram (KP Varkey & VS Builders). The fifth builder, Holiday Heritage, had scrapped the project. The order was passed by a bench consisting of justices Arun Mishra and Navin Sinha. The H2O Holy Faith and Alpha Serene buildings were demolished on 11 January 2020 and the Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram were demolished on 12 January 2020 through implosion. Background and timeline * 1986 The Environment Protection Act of 1986 was enacted in the wake of the Bhopal Tragedy. It came into force on 19 November 1986. The purpose of the Act is to implement the decisions of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. They relate to the protection and improvement of the human environment and the prevention of hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants and property. The Act is an \\"umbrella\\" legislation designed to provide a framework for central government coordination of the activities of various central and state authorities established under previous laws, such as the Water Act and the Air Act. * 1991 In February 1991, a notification was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. This was for the regulation of activities in the coastal area. As per the notification, four categories of Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) were defined. CRZ I, CRZ II, CRZ III and CRZ IV. * 1995 No Objection Certificate (NOC) was issued to Golden Kayaloram by the Secretary of Maradu Grama Panchayat. * 1996 In 1996, the Coastal Zone Management Plan was introduced. * 2005 The Local Self Government Department (LSGD) conducted a vigilance probe. During this probe, files were confiscated from the office of the Maradu Panchayat secretary. * 2005-2006 The permission to construct the buildings was granted by the Maradu Panchayat. * 2007 The Kerala Government sent a letter to the Maradu panchayat along with a list of all the cases in which violations/anomalies in the issue of building permits were detected during the inspection of the Senior Town Planner (Vigilance). The panchayat was asked to revoke all the listed building permits as per Rule 16 of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules 1999 (KMBR). On receiving the letter, the panchayat issued show-cause notice to the builders in all the cases. Even though the violations varied from CRZ violation, FAR more than 1.25, violations of open space, copy of final plan not available in the file, access width not shown etc., the allegation was the same and the notice was identical. (Even though there was no CRZ violation in the case of Golden Kayaloram, for example, the same notice was issued.) Alpha Ventures filed a writ petition seeking to quash the notice and to answer their reply seeking details on the basis of which the notice was issued. The High Court of Kerala admitted the writ petition and issued an interim order staying all further proceedings with respect to the notice issued to the builders. But the High Court, in the interim order allowed the Maradu panchayat to issue stop memo in accordance with the law. The Maradu panchayat did not issue any stop memo. Hence, Alpha Ventures continued the construction of the building. In June 2007, as per the instruction of the Kerala government, the Maradu panchayat gave a show-cause notice to the concerned builders. Jain Housing, Holy Faith Builders, and KP Varkey also continued the construction activities. Holiday Heritage discontinued their housing project. In 2007 itself, in an affidavit, a panchayat member stated that Maradu is CRZ II. * 2010 Maradu panchayat became a municipaity in November 2010. The municipality approached the Division Bench of the High Court with an appeal, which was dismissed. In 2016, the division bench of the Kerala High Court ruled that Maradu municipality was solely responsible for the situation. * 2011 CZMP prepared in accordance with the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 2011 marked Maradu in the CRZ-II category. * 2012 A single bench of the High Court of Kerala, set aside the show cause notice issued to Alpha Ventures by the Maradu panchayat. * 2015 The division bench of the high court of Kerala gave its verdict on the matter. The show cause notice which was issued in 2007 by the panchayat was pointed out to be untenable and written in such a manner that it did not satisfy the rules. The Maradu municipality was blamed for the situation and the entire blame was placed on them. The Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) became a party to the case and moved the Supreme Court. * 2018 The Supreme Court observed the builders did not give a reply to the show-cause notice issued by the panchayat and instead, filed writ petitions (WP) with the High Court. An expert committee was formed by the SC on 27 November 2018 to determine if the apartments are located in CRZ II or III. The three member committee reported that (as per the 1991 CRZ notification and the 1996 Kerala Coastal Zone Management Plan (KCZMP)), the area was CRZ III and not CRZ II. Maradu panchayat had issued the building permit without the permission of the KCZMA. The builders contended that the area was determined to be CRZ II as per the draft KCZMP created according to the 2011 CRZ notification. However, the argument of KCZMA was accepted by the Supreme Court. * May 2019 The Supreme Court accepted the contention of the KCZMA and ordered the five apartments to be demolished within a month. The Kerala government has contracted IIT Madras to develop a model for demolition of the buildings. The one-month period lapsed and all the review and writ petitions filed by the residents of the different apartments were denied. * September 2019 The Supreme Court, in an order issued on 6 September 2019 directed the state government to demolish the apartments and report by 20 September. Eviction notices were served to the residents subsequent to this. The residents say that they will resist the eviction. Holy Faith H2O Explosion sequence =Position of Golden Kayaloram residents= A curative petition was filed by the residents of Golden Kayaloram apartment on 10 September 2019. The petition was accepted by the court registry. It listed serious mistakes in 8 May Supreme Court order. The petition pointed out that a three-member technical committee was formed by the three member court appointed committee without the permission of the court. The NOC was issued to Golden Kayaloram in 1995 (NO.A3.3/95) by the Secretary of Maradu Grama Panchayat and a copy of this was submitted as exhibit P1 in WP(C).No. 23293 of 2007 (W). This no objection certificate was issued by the Grama Panchayat before the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) of Kerala was approved in 1996. The three member committee appointed by the Supreme Court of India had issued a notice to the builders of the apartments to respond about their CRZ status. No resident was asked to respond. The builder of Golden Kayaloram had submitted that \\"there are no CRZ violations alleged against M/s. Kayaloram Apartments by CZMA or any other authorities. Hence the proceedings with respect to CRZ violations is not sustainable against M/s. Kayaloram Apartments...\\" Maradu and CRZ II and III CRZ I areas are those \\"areas that are ecologically sensitive and important, such as... wildlife habitats, mangroves,... coral reefs, ...close tobreeding and spawning grounds of fish and other marine life, ...rich in genetic-diversity, ...likely to be inundated due to rise in sea level consequent upon global warming and such other areas as may be declared.....\\" CRZ II areas are those \\"that have already been developed upto or close to the shoreline.\\" \\"Developed area\\" is defined as \\"...area within the municipal limits or in other legally designated urban areas which is already substantially built up and which has been provided with drainage and approach roads and other infrastructural facilities, such as water supply and sewerage mains.\\" CRZ III is described as \\"the areas that are relatively undisturbed and those which do not belong to either Category-I or II. These will include coastal zone in the rural areas (developed and undeveloped) and also areas within Municipal limits or in other legally designated urban areas which are not substantially built up\\". Maradu is currently a municipal area and even before it was converted into a municipality, it was a legally designated urban area since it came under the Greater Cochin Development Authority.GCDA, Official Web site of GCDA, 'About Us' page The DLF property on the same banks of Chilavannoor lake also is in violation of CRZ norms (CRZ-I). It was first ordered to be demolished in 2012 by the single bench of Kerala High Court, but was stayed by the division bench. Instead, the division bench allowed regularization of the building after imposing a fine of 1 crore. An appeal went against this overruling to the Supreme Court of India, but the verdict was upheld. Opinions A Mumbai- based advocate and the president of National Lawyers Campaign for Judicial Transparency and Reforms said that as per notification issued in 2011 by the central government, Maradu was brought under CRZ II and that even if the buildings were demolished, they could be reconstructed at the same location. Rules are procedural laws brought by the executive for enforcing the acts of parliament. The rules which are applicable to the buildings now are the rules in force today. As CRZ II applies to the buildings in question and there is no violation. The procedure adopted by the Supreme Court in bypassing the Kerala Municipality Act and rules under it was without jurisdiction and shocking.

Founded in 1868 by Burchard Villiger, the church was the center of several Jesuit educational institutions, including St. Joseph's Preparatory School, St. Joseph's University, and the Ges√∫ School. The Baroque church was named after and loosely modeled after the Church of the Ges√∫ in Rome. The parish closed in 1993, and the building became the chapel of St. Joseph's Prep. The church is part of the Girard Avenue Historic District.  History  On December 6, 1868, the Jesuit priest Burchard Villiger founded New St. Joseph's Church, being the second Jesuit Catholic church in Philadelphia after Old St. Joseph's Church in Old City. This was soon renamed the Church of the Holy Family, intending it to be the center of a complex of Jesuit institutions, including St. Joseph's Preparatory School, St. Joseph's University, and the Ges√∫ School. A chapel, refectory, and parochial school were built following the relocation of the preparatory school and university from Old St. Joseph's Church in 1868. alt=Front and side view of the Church of the Ges√∫ in Philadelphia The Church of the Holy Family was renamed the Church of the Ges√∫ in 1878, after the Church of the Ges√π in Rome, which is the universal mother church of the Society of Jesus. The cornerstone of a new, grander church was laid on March 10, 1879, and the cruciform edifice was completed in 1888. A dedication ceremony was held on December 12, 1888. The Baroque church was designed by local architect Edwin F. Durang, and was modeled on its Roman counterpart. The interior, including the murals, was decorated by the Italian artist Nicola D'Ascenzo. The dimensions of the new church were: high, a central nave long and wide, and a main altar that is high. The two towers of the facade, on either side of the Doric, Ionic, and Tuscan columns are each tall. The church was also outfitted by Villiger with a number of paintings, which included eighteen portraits by the Mexican painter Miguel Cabrera of the Jesuit Superiors General from Saint Ignatius through Lorenzo Ricci, as well as several saints. However, by 1903, these paintings were no longer in the church. By 1891, the church held over 370 relics for veneration by the faithful. Many of them were around 120 years old at the time they were obtained from Rome. The church served as a parish of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia from its opening until its closure in 1993 and merger with Saint Malachy's Church. The building was repurposed by St. Joseph's Prep as its school chapel. In 1985, the building was named as a contributing property of the Girard Avenue Historic District.

Soundtrack The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Bharani. The soundtrack features 5 tracks. Reception S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu said, \\"Oru Kadhal Seiveer is a film with a message that has not been conveyed very well. The climax is a let down thus diluting the story\\". Malini Mannath wrote, \\"Santhosh reveals more maturity in his second film, and is more comfortable and confident here. Archana suits the role, acquits herself fairly creditably, but needs to work more on her expression\\" and concluded, \\"It's a film with a message, but could have done with more finesse\\". Another reviewer praised Santosh's acting but criticised the heroine's acting, the first half of the film and the double meaning dialogues.

Exapophyses lie on the centrum, the spool-shaped main body of each vertebra, where they are positioned adjacent to the main articulating surfaces between centra. Exapophyses which are next to the cotyle (concave front end of the centrum) are known as preexapophyses while those at the condyle (convex rear end) are called postexapophyses. Exapophyses act as accessory articulations, meaning that they complement the cotyle and condyle, as well as the zygapophyses (plate-like joints which lie on the neural arch above the centrum). The term was coined by Samuel Wendell Williston in 1897 during a description of Pteranodon (which he called \\"Ornithostoma\\" at the time). Exapophyses are a defining trait of the pterosaur subgroup Eupterodactyloidea, although they are also known to occur in some ctenochasmatids. Rhamphorhynchids have paired, knob-like extensions on the condyle which are occasionally also termed exapophyses, but these extensions are not distinctly offset and are not considered homologous to the exapophyses of eupterodactyloids and ctenochasmatids.

During the Count's Feud, in 1534-1536, N√¶sbyholm was plundered by townspeople of Sk√¶lsj√∏r and may have been left uninhabited for a while. In 1557, Otte Holgersen Rosenkrantz died from plague in L√ºbeck. Birgitte Ottesdatter Rosenkrantz In 1575, N√¶sbyholm was acquired by Steen Ottesen Brahe through his marriage with Birgitte Ottesdatter Rosenkrantz. Brahe, a brother of the astronomer Tyge Brahe, was himself a diplomat and advisor both to Frederik II and Christian IV. He had been rewarded with a number of royal fiefs. Steen Brahe constructed a new main building and also increased the size of the estate through the acquisition of more land in the area. Birgitte Rosenkrantz Brahe died in labour shortly after the new main building had been completed and her husband then moved away from the estate. After Steen Brahe's death, N√¶sbyhilm and Bavelse passed to their son Otte Steensen Brahe. He increased the size of the estate even further. He died on the estate in 1761. Neighter of his two daughters survived him and his estates were therefore passed to his only grandson, n Otto Christopher Ulfeldt, but he died just 17 years old a few years later. =1663‚Äì1709: Bielke family= Portrait of Henrik Bjelke by Karel van Mander III In 1763, N√¶sbyholm, Bavelse and Tarsl√∏segaard were all purchased by Admiral of the Realm Henrik Bielke. Also in 1663, Frederick III granted a property north of Copenhagen to Bjelke and it was later named Edelgave after his wife Edel Ulfeldt. Bilke retired from the Navy in 1679. He died in 1683 and was buried in N√¶sby Church. N√¶sbyholm passed to his eldest son, Christian Frederik Bielke, whwho was then only 13 years old. He joined the army a few years later, was promoted through the ranks, and ended up spending much of his time in foreign service abroad. He was severely wounded on 11 September 1708 during the Conquest of Tournai and died from his injuries three days later. =1709-1720: A royal affair= In 1709 and 1710, N√¶sbyholm and nearby Bavelse were acquired by Frederik IV for his mistress, Charlotte Helene von Schindel, who was given the title Countess of Frederiksholm. The relationship ended in 1711; Frederick entered into his relationship with Anne Sophie Reventlow and ordered Charlotte Helene von Schindel to leave court for her estate in Sj√§lland. She initially stopped at Fyn and claimed to be pregnant with Frederick's child, but the pregnancy turned out to be false. Charlotte Helene von Schindel hosted a vivid social life at her estate and entered into a relationship with the noble Ernst G. B√ºlow, with whom she had a child. The couple tried to conceal the birth, but when the monarch was informed, they were given permission to marry, and did so on 9 February 1716. N√¶stbyholm and Bavelse reverted to the crown when the countship was dissolved. =1720-1836: Changing owners= In 1720, N√¶sbyholm and Bavelse were sold to Peder Thott. He was succeeded on the estate by his son Otto Thott. Christian Sigfred von Plessen Christian Sigfred von Plessen, the younger half-brother of Carl Adolph von Plessen and Christian Ludvig von Plessen, purchased N√¶sbyholm and Bevelse from Otto Thott's daughters in 1723. In 1645, N√¶sbyholm and Bavelse were acquired by Johan Ludvig Holstein and incorporated in the countship of Ledreborg. Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Sams√∏e In 1775, Johan Ludvig Holstein sold N√¶sbyholm and Bavelse to Carl Adolph Raben. His son, Frederik Sophus Raben, sold the estates in 1804. The new owner, Christian Conrad, Count of Danneskiold-Sams√∏e, was a very industrious landowner. To facilitate transportation of timber from his forest at N√¶sbyholm, he canalized the Sus√• River from Bavelse to N√¶stved. This \\"Danneskiold Canal\\" was opened on 11 September 1812. He was, however, hit hard tby the agricultural crisis that followed the war with England and the national bankruptcy of 1913. The government took over his estates one year after his death. =1836-present: R√∏nnenkamp family= Christian R√∏nnenkamp In 1836, N√¶sbyholm was sold to Christian R√∏nnenkamp. He was the son of a merchant from Flensburg but had moved to Copenhagen in an early age where he had made a fortune on speculative investments during the war years. He now settled on his estates and managed them himself. R√∏nnenkamp had no children and therefore left his estates to his sister's grandson, P. Christian Howden, who assumed the last Howden- R√∏nnenkamp. He constructed new farm buildings and redesigned the garden. His widow, Jessy Howden-R√∏nnenkamp Holck, kept the estate after his death. In 1932, the main building was severely damaged by fire. Their son, Mogens Preben Christian-Eiler Howden-R√∏nnenkamp Holck, owned the estate from 1948 to 1975.

Life Elizabeth Sutton was born 27 September 1915 in Melbourne, the daughter of A. Leslie Sutton, a Methodist businessman.Vassilieff, Peking Moscow Letter, 1953. While still a teenager, in 1934, she married William Hamill, an engineering student, but divorced him in the early 1940s.

Through the 1940s and 1950s she wrote on art and politics for the literary journal Meanjin, editing its poetry broadsheet and becoming associate editor in 1951. Her critique of Melbourne University Magazine led the poet Vincent Buckley, whose poem 'In Time of Martydom' Vassilieff had used as an example, to complain that she was turning the journal Communist. She also wrote for Voice, Ern Malley's Journal and Overland. In 1952-53 Vassilieff attended the World Peace Council congress in Vienna, as a delegate of the Victorian Peace Council.Meanjin, Vol. 12, 1953, p.96. with Rev. Victor James and Dr. Clive Sandy. She continued to Moscow and China as a delegate for the Writers Federation, coming back as an enthusiast for socialism in the New China. Vassilieff exhibited paintings alongside her husband, and their house in Victoria was a focus for left-wing artists and painters such as Nettie and Vance Palmer. Though the pair separated in 1954, Elizabeth continued to try to control his reputation after his death in 1958, claiming copyright ownership and initiating defamation suits against publishers.Richard Moore, The unknown painter who shaped the Australian arts scene, Australian Financial Review, July 29, 2016.

The brand opened its 50th location in 2012 and its 100th location in 2016 - just months after selling a 70% stake to Atlanta- based private equity group NRD Capital Management. Fuzzy's surpassed 150 locations in early 2019, and now operates restaurants in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. The company has announced plans to surpass 200 locations by 2021.

On 3 January 2018, the EU implemented the \\"Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II\\" (colloquially known as \\"MiFID II\\") which required all European investment firms & traders to trade the shares of a company listed in the EU on a stock exchange within the EU or an equivalent third country exchange. In order to gain equivalence, the trading venues of the concerned country should have a high level of investor protection and sound mechanisms to deal with insider trading. The main purpose of this measure is to protect the interests of investors based in the EU. Analysts have called it a pioneer in financial regulation with the potential to restructure the global financial system. As of 1 July 2019, only three jurisdictions had been granted equivalence: the United States of America, Australia and Hong Kong. Switzerland too was granted equivalence, but only temporarily, and the EU announced in early May 2019 that it would not renew equivalence for Switzerland after 1 July 2019. This was part of the wider Swiss-EU trade dispute.  Background and purpose  As a result of the financial crisis of 2007, the vulnerabilities in the transparency of financial markets around the world were exposed. MifID I, which was implemented in 2007, proved inadequate in ensuring the security of EU's investors. After the financial crisis, the European Commission wanted to hold stock markets, investment firms, banks, brokers and various investment funds around the world to the same standards of transparency and accountability which were set up for the entities operating within the EU. Many analysts believed that the financial crisis was precipitated because of the wide discrepancies that existed in the regulatory frameworks of different jurisdictions. Therefore, governments, central banks and financial regulatory authorities around the world decided to harmonise their rules and regulations in order to prevent unscrupulous organisations and individuals from gaming the financial system, and thus ensure investor protection. MifiD II was drafted with the purpose of eliminating these loopholes, and stock market equivalence has an important role in achieving this goal. The European Commission formally adopted proposals for MiFID II on 20 October 2011. This piece of legislation consisted of a number of measures to update and strengthen the financial regulatory framework of the EU. Article 23 of this directive contains the provision for stock market equivalence.  Overview  MiFID II Article 23 made it mandatory for European investment firms and traders to trade shares of a company listed in any of the EU member countries on a stock market within the EU or an equivalent third country trading venue. This is also known as the 'trading mandate' or 'Share Trading Obligation'. This mandate covers all stocks admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on an exchange within the EU. This obligation also applies to Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs). Similar equivalence decisions have been made by the European Commission on insurance, credit rating and auditing, among other areas.  Procedure for Granting Equivalence  The European Commission assesses a third country's legal and supervisory framework to determine an equivalence decision. It does this with advice from the three European Supervisory Authorities. The Commission bases this assessment process on a proportionality and risk-based approach. It then authenticates the third- country's compliance with the equivalence criteria. These criteria are applied in a proportionate way to the identified risks. Although the risks are the focus of the equivalence decision, other factors are also considered.  Criteria for Granting Equivalence  In order to render an equivalence decision, the EC considers four factors. First, whether the markets have effective authorization, supervision, and enforcement on an ongoing basis. Second, whether the markets have clear and transparent rules for securities so the securities are traded fairly, efficiently, and are freely negotiable. Third, whether security issuers are subject to information requirements to ensure a high level of investor protection. Fourth, whether there is prevention of market abuse from insider dealing and market manipulation.  Concerns and Criticism  The requirement that stocks, bonds, debentures, derivatives etc. only be traded on venues permitted by the EU poses a potential problem for traders and investment firms. For example, if the European and American authorities did not reach an equivalence decision, European investment firms would not be able to participate in American markets even though they are far more liquid than European ones. Without any equivalence decision, fund managers in the EU would be forced to trade shares of companies like Google parent Alphabet and Amazon through their less liquid listing in Frankfurt, rather than their main listing on the Nasdaq in New York. This regulation thus led to greater complexity which had to be resolved by equivalence decisions before MifiD II was implemented. Moreover, in the wake of the formulation of MifiD II, many investment firms decided to stop offering trading in EU based markets due to the low levels of liquidity. This led to reduced trading volumes. The European Commission put an end to most of these concerns by granting equivalence to the stock exchanges in the US, Hong Kong and Australia. These equivalence decisions permitted European investment firms to tap liquidity in dual listed shares outside the EU. A strong opponent of Mifid II was the government of the United Kingdom. This opposition stemmed from political considerations. One problem is that only countries and not individual firms are deemed equivalent by the European Commission. Following Brexit, the UK would become a third country, needing to be granted equivalence in order to continue to trade with the EU. Due to the uncertainty that surrounds Brexit, UK financial services firms would have to wait for the UK to receive a positive assessment from the Commission before they could utilize the equivalence mechanism.  Swiss-EU dispute  In December 2017, while determining equivalence decisions for various countries, the EC decided that Swiss exchanges would be deemed equivalent for only one year, unlike the unlimited equivalence that the US, Hong Kong and Australia received. This was further extended by six months in December 2018. But in May 2019, the EU announced that it would not be renewing equivalence for Switzerland. As the stocks of the largest Swiss companies are traded in Switzerland as well as on European exchanges, the revoking of Switzerland's equivalence status would have effectively banned EU investment firms from trading these shares on Swiss stock markets. This could have caused a collapse in the participation of European investors on the Swiss stock exchange. To prevent this, the Swiss government banned the shares of Swiss companies listed within Switzerland from being traded on any EU exchange. Now that they are not traded on exchanges in the EU, the restriction under Mifid II is no longer applicable to Swiss stocks. This simply means that EU investment firms are no longer required to trade them on EU markets. All this is part of a bigger issue between the two sides. Swiss-EU economic relations are governed by about 120 different bilateral agreements. These make most of the EU's single market accessible to Swiss businesses. But the EU wants to replace this arrangement with a new framework agreement. The purpose is to simplify the relations between Switzerland and the EU. A draft of the new agreement exists but the Swiss side first decided to go for public consultation and have more recently asked for clarification. Frustrated by the delay, the EU allowed the equivalence status for Swiss stock markets to lapse.

An avid opponent of inequality, and holding communitarian beliefs, Gulabchev organized educational associations and activities for the poor in multiple towns as clubs and libraries, through which he actively advocated for revolutionary action. In late 1880s, the siromakhomilstvo split between anarchism and socialism, with Gulabchev advocating for the former. In 1892, he formed an anarchist study group in Ruse.  Early life  Gulabchev's father, a Bulgarian Exarchate priest. Spiro Gulabchev was born on 12 June 1856 in Florina (referred to as Lerin by local Slavic groups), the Ottoman Empire, to Catherine Gulabchev and Konstantin, a priest who was active in the Bulgarian Revival movement and headed a church of the Bulgarian Exarchate in Florina. He was educated at a primary and secondary level in Constantinople, Edirne, and Plovdiv, throughout which his peers included Dimitar Blagoev, whom Gulabchev would later oppose. In 1870 Gulabchev found work as a teacher in the village of Gorno Nevolyani, where he introduced the monitorial system of education. He initially taught in both Greek and Bulgarian but, by his second year, had begun to teach entirely in Bulgarian, providing his students with Bulgarian textbooks and teaching them to read and write. Gulabchev was a favourite of both students and parents, but as news began to spread of his father's schismatic leanings (and as the Bulgarian Schism was reaching its climax), Gulabchev was pushed out of Gorno Nevolyani. In autumn of 1871 he left for Plovdiv to see a relative, Panaret Plovdivski.  University and political radicalisation  In 1877 Gulabchev traveled to the Russian Empire, where he enrolled at the Moscow Theological Academy and studied for two years before transferring to Moscow State University to study law. Before completing the course, however, he once again transferred in 1881, this time to study philology at the Faculty of History and Philology at Kiev University. His study was funded through scholarships and grants provided by Eastern Rumelia (and then by the Principality of Bulgaria following Bulgaria's unification in 1885).262x262pxGulabchev and his father nevertheless experienced financial trouble during this period, which threatened Gulabchev's ability to complete his course. Eventually, Gulabchev wrote a letter to Joseph I of Bulgaria in which he asked for financial assistance for his father, so that he may afford to complete his education. While studying in Kiev, Gulabchev was exposed to the agrarian socialist and populist movements that had begun to emerge within the Russian intelligentsia; in particular, he came under the influence of the ideas of \\"popular enlightenment\\" proposed by the Narodniks and the conspiratorial revolutionary socialist methods of Narodnaya Volya. He was also impressed by the liberal values of the Enlightenment and the federalist beliefs of the Ukrainian academic Mykhailo Drahomanov. Gulabchev came to believe that in order to build a socially just society, populist ideas would have to be spread through a \\"book\\" movement in the Balkans; specifically, he focused his attention on the Bulgarian student diaspora, working to establish a network of \\"readers' friendly societies\\", which he also called \\"readers' fellowships\\" or simply \\"fellowships\\". Gulabchev planned to spread such fellowships internationally, covering all countries with a Bulgarian student population, with these fellowships being subordinate to a central fellowship in Kiev. He hoped that these cohesive student groups would produce propaganda when they returned to Bulgaria. The first of these fellowships, which Gulabchev personally coordinated with students returning to Bulgaria to see family, appeared in Ruse, Silistra, Veliko Tarnovo, Varna, and Anhialo. In practice, these fellowships were generally composed of 5 ‚Äì 10 members who distributed literature, maintained book collections, wrote magazine/newspaper articles, and translated foreign publications into Bulgarian. Their creation was funded by Gulabchev, after which they were maintained by membership fees (a portion of which went to the central fellowship in Kiev) and donations from wealthy patrons. The fellowships became more structured as time passed. In 1882 Gulabchev designed a constitution for the network and began to carefully select the members of future fellowships, acting as a secret society similar to Narodnaya Volya. In 1883 he established a student society at Kiev University called the \\"Friendly Society for the Promotion of Bulgarianness in Macedonia\\".  Return to Bulgaria and the siromakhomilstvo movement  By 1884 Gulabchev had become known to the Special Corps of Gendarmes and was, according to state documents, interrogated as a witness \\"due to a close acquaintance with a person who is extremely unreliable in political terms\\". He nevertheless continued his political activities; on 5 February 1886, while disembarking the Russian ship Azov in Constantinople, Gulabchev was found by Russian Empire customs to be smuggling 37 publications that were considered \\"revolutionary\\" in nature. Officials imprisoned him in Odessa. Throughout interrogations he refused to reveal suppliers or transportation chains, maintaining that he had bought the literature cheaply in Sofia for personal use. He was soon after expelled from Kiev University, but the state prosecutor was hesitant to bring a foreign citizen to trial. The case began to appear in Bulgarian newspapers, with articles stating that the Bulgarian student was under threat of being exiled to Siberia; following intervention by the Bulgarian Exarchate and government it was eventually decided to instead deport Gulabchev to Bulgaria. By mid to late 1886 he had been released. Undeterred, he continued to be active in politics. He began teaching at Gabrovo School in January 1887, where he found himself in a socialist environment. Here, he organized a secret circle which eventually culminated in an 1888 student revolt; Gulabchev planned that the students would distribute a propaganda pamphlet after it was quelled, but this never materialized. He was afterwards transferred to First Boy's Public School in Varna, where he had established the \\"Kapka\\" educational society the year before. By 1889 he was teaching in Veliko Tarnovo. While he taught, Gulabchev continued to develop the political ideas he had been influenced by in Russia. His \\"readers' fellowships\\" continued to appear throughout Bulgarian cities and began attempts to build a more cohesive ideology; Gulabchev grew a movement, the siromakhomilstvo, around the belief that the poorest (siromasi) ought to be protected and shown love and mercy ‚Äì contemporary Bulgarian histiography described the movement as a populist and Russian nihilist movement. The siromakhomilstvo condemned social inequalities and actively advocated for revolutionary action among the poor through events organised in clubs and libraries. Like many similar movements throughout the period, Gulabchev decried luxury, fashion, and other aesthetic focuses on the grounds that they were an affront to the poor. For similar reasons, he criticized government spending on higher education while the majority didn't have access to secondary education, but also emphasised the importance of solidarity between the intelligentsia and the impoverished. He employed populist techniques to demonstrate this solidarity, such as forbidding his immediate followers from wearing ties, which he felt were a symbol of alienation between the intellectual class and the common people. Siromakhomilstvo groups communicated through ciphers after 1891, which had become popular among socialist organisations. Gulabchev's image of an ideal future, which he referred to as 'primitively-communist', struggled to gain significant attention outside of the intelligentsia; by the late 1880s the siromakhomilstvo movement split off into anarchist, state socialist, and Marxist movements, with Gulabchev supporting anarchism. In 1892 he founded the first anarchist group in Ruse, where members studied the works of Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. In response to a 1909 international anarchist congress, Gulabchev was involved in an unsuccessful campaign to organise anarchist groups in Bulgaria on a national level.

It features interviews with Asia Carrera, Nina Hartley, Mary Carey, Randy West, Richard Pacheco, John Leslie, Amber Lynn, Seka (actress), Raylene, Bill Margold, Shelley Lubben, and Tiffany Million.  Background  Documentary filmmaker Bryce Wagoner, a graduate of East Carolina University, interviewed several former porn stars about their lives after leaving industry. Wagoner got the inspiration for the documentary from a part-time job during his film education: During a voice-over and motion capture break for the video game, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, a group watched porn movies and one of them asked what the actors did with their lives after their time in the scene. In a separate blog post, she explained that the scene was about sexual acts with vegetables. The questions in the fast-paced interview scenes revolve around four core questions: How do you find your way into this film business? Why do you stop and possibly start again? How can a secure existence or family be built and thus private life and career be separated? How do porn actors differ from other employees? Asia Carrera, among others, reports that Mensa International would link to all member websites, but in her case made an exception, since it is a pornographic website.  Reception  The film received mostly negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an average rating of 2.9 out of five possible stars, on the Dutch side moviemeter.nl it got 2.2 out of five possible stars.  Sequel  A sequel, After Porn Ends 2, was released in March 2017. The industry actors involved included Janine Lindemulder, Lisa Ann, Chasey Lain, Tabitha Stevens and Herschel Savage.

In the short story, as in Amok, Zweig brings the altruistic concerns of the protagonist into the forefront. Plot The narrator is a young German landed in a French port. He misses the train to Germany, as the ship docks at a late hour. Thus, he has to spend a night in a city that is a stranger to him. Walking in the streets of the small city at night, he hears a woman singing Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz. Hearing his mother tongue in a French city attracts the young man and he follows the voice to find its source. Eventually, he finds what he is looking for: the voice is from a small bar- like brothel. When he attempts to get in, he suddenly sees a strange man peeking inside. As soon as the man sees him, he runs away. The narrator walks in and sits at one of the tables. It is midnight and he is the only guest at the bar. A fleshy, exhausted prostitute comes to him and orders alcohol with her German accent. The young man is uncomfortable with the bar's sultry atmosphere and the lackadaisical, tired prostitute ‚Äì he decides to leave. But suddenly, the prostitute comes to life and bursts into laughter by looking at the door ‚Äì the man who ran away is there again. The prostitute humiliates the man and tries to make him jealous by snuggling the narrator. The narrator feels sorry for the man and can't stand the prostitute's ruthlessness and therefore decides to leave. Walking in the labyrinthine alleys in the moonlight and trying to find his hotel, he suddenly hears a man offering help ‚Äì it is the man at the bar. While walking together to the narrator's hotel, the strange man begins speaking swiftly. He says that the prostitute is his wife and due to his selfishness, she has left him and that he spent all of his wealth by running after her. The man asks the narrator to talk to his wife to make her return to him. The narrator is stumped and does not respond to any of his requests. The strange man continues talking and says that he can not stand seeing her with other men and that he will not leave her there alive ‚Äì he talks about the knife he bought that day. The next day, the narrator tries to find the bar but the alleys look quite unfamiliar to him in the daylight. But when he goes by moonlight from his hotel to the night train, he suddenly notices the alley where the bar in. The man is, again, in front of the bar. When the man sees the narrator, he beckons to him. This makes the narrator worry and since he is about to miss the night train, he leaves the bar and the alley mercurially. At the last moment, the narrator hesitates as the man, with something silvery in his hands, determinedly enters the bar.

Early life  He was born in Sichuan. Wu earned a bachelor's degree(1963) from Taiwan University, a Ph.D.(1969) from University of Washington and a M.D.(1972) from Johns Hopkins University. He completed his post-graduate medical education at the Universities of Chicago, Washington (Seattle) and California Los Angeles.  Career  He settled at the University of California, Irvine, and was promoted to full professor in Radiological Sciences and Medicine in 1990. His research and clinical interest were in thyroid hormone metabolism and the management of thyroid diseases. He authored, edited and contributed to medical books and over a hundred peer- reviewed medical papers. He has had a long-term interest in the research on the development of a novel fetal thyroid function marker (W-compound) that may help to better management of congenital hypothyroidism. His Thyroid Laboratory at Long Beach VA Medical Center, in collaboration with professors Delbert A. Fisher at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Theo Visser at Erasmus Medical Center of Netherlands, has found that sulfo-conjugation is the major pathway for thyroid hormone metabolism in the mammalian fetus. In addition to medical studies, Wu has an interest in modern Chinese history. He was the author and editor of five books (in Chinese) about the facts involving the ‚Äúsecret gold shipments‚Äù from Shanghai to Taiwan in 1948-49 near the end of the Chinese Civil War. These events were of critical importance on the Republic of China retreat to Taiwan.The China White Paper 1949ÔºåDepartment of State Publication 3573, Far Eastern Series 30, Volume I, pp 31-33. According to his studies, about 4 million oz. gold and some one hundred million pieces of silver dollars were transferred from Shanghai's state treasury in multiple shipments by air and sea to Taiwan and Xiamen from December 1, 1948, to May 18, 1949. The major portion of the gold (80% or 6.28 million oz.) had originally been sent from the United States during and after WWII as part of US aid to China to fight inflation. Nearly all the silver dollars and one million oz of gold in Xiamen were used to support the Nationalist army in contending against the rapid advancing People's Liberation Army (PLA) from April to December 1949 when inflation had flooded the area under the Nationalist control and rendered the paper money worthless. The rest of the gold, near 3 million oz., played a pivotal role in stabilizing the economy of the Nationalist regime (Republic of China) in Taiwan from 1949 to 1950 until the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950. Without the gold from the Chinese Mainland, Taiwan would certainly have been destabilized by a precipitate currency devaluation, which would have invited a PLA invasion across the Taiwan Strait, leading to its unification with the People's Republic of China in 1950 -51. Wu married Dr. Yvonne Yan-chiu Yu in 1982. Yu graduated from Guangzhou Medical University in 1978 and received a DNP degree from Brandman University (Irvine) in 2013. She currently serves as an adjunct assistant professor at UCLA and a clinical manager at Alignment Healthcare in Orange. They have two daughters, Elizabeth and Elaine.

He owned N√¶sbyholm, Bavelse and Tersl√∏segaard on Zealand. Early life and education Otto Brahe was born on 12 April 1578 at N√¶sbyholm, the son of privy counsellor Steen Brahe (1547‚Äì1620) and Birgitte Rosenkrantz (1555‚Äì88). He attended Sor√∏ Academy from 1587 and later continued his education in Aarhus. In 1593‚Äì99, Brahe and Kurt Aslaksen went on a grand tour in Europe, studying at the universities in Rostock (1593), Herborn (from spring of 1594), Heidelberg, Basel, Geneve (from 3 December 1597) and Orleans (1599). He also visited England and Scotland. In 1600‚Äì02, he was a courtier at Frederick V of the Palatinate. Military service In the Kalmar War, Brahe served a cornet in the heavy cavalry. He lost an arm in the {{Battle of Kalmar . Property Brahe inherited the estates N√¶sbyholm and Tersl√∏segaard after his parents. His holdings were in 1638 valued at 1,639 t√¶nder hartkorn. He increased the size of the N√¶sbyholm estate significantly through the acquisition of more land. At the time of his death in 1651, it was valued at 930 t√∏nder hartkorn. Through his third marriage he also acquired Ravnholt on Funen. In 1623, he sold the estate to privy counsellor Holger Rosenkrantz. From the 1620s, he engaged in large-scale moneylending to his peers and seems even to have speculated in sanctioning obligations.

The Emilie was built in Saint Louis in 1859, was 225 feet in length with a 32 foot beam and had a draft of six feet.Casler, 1999, pp. 32, 40Riverboat Dave's Larger than the average riverboat at the time, she could carry 500 tons of cargo. During her extended service on the Missouri River she also fell into the hands of both Union and Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. As a result of her numerous exploits, Emilie was among the most famous boats on the river and was widely considered a first rate and an exceptionally beautiful riverboat.Chittenden, 1903, Vol I, pp. 240‚Äì241Chittenden, 1903, vol II, pp. 255‚Äì259Missouri Historical Review, 1969, pp. 458‚Äì459 After some nine years of service the Emilie was caught in and destroyed by a tornado on June 4, 1868. History Captain Joseph LaBarge, designer and owner of the Emilie Having worked many years for the American Fur Company as a riverboat captain and pilot, LaBarge went into business for himself and proceeded to design and build his own riverboat. Pierre Chouteau Jr. of the fur company having learned of LaBarge's prospects sent word to him and offered any assistance he might need in completing the vessel that would soon be widely known as Emilie. The American Fur Company still valued Captain LaBarge's ability and familiarity of the Missouri River and would gladly have taken him, and his exceptional riverboat, back into their employ, but LaBarge declined the offer. Prior to its completion LaBarge contracted with the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad, which had just reached Saint Joseph on the Missouri River. From Saint Joseph it ran to points up and down the river in connection with various roads, making trips as far north as Fort Randall. Upon completion of the vessel, LaBarge named her the Emilie, after one of his daughters. Emilie's maiden voyage occurred on LaBarge's forty-fourth birthday, October 1, 1859.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, p. 458 Emilie's most famous passenger was Abraham Lincoln when he visited points along the Missouri River in August 1859, stopping at council Bluffs to examine some real estate.Missouri Historical Review, 1969, p. 459 In late autumn, river ice prevented the Emilie from leaving Atchison, Kansas, forcing the vessel to remain docked nearby for the duration of the following winter. When spring arrived the citizens of Atchison requested that the Emilie be used as an ice- breaker to open a passage between Atchison and Saint Joseph some twenty miles to the north on the Missouri side of the river. LaBarge carefully maneuvered the bow of boat up on to the ice until it broke under the weight of the huge vessel, and did this repeatedly until he reached Saint Joseph. The next year ice once again caught LaBarge and the Emilie near Liberty, Missouri. While detained there he received news that his former passenger, Abraham Lincoln, had been elected president. =Civil War involvements= In June, 1861 the Emilie, still under the command of its owner, Captain Joseph LaBarge, was cruising down the Missouri River not far from Boonville, just after the Confederates had retreated from that town during the Battle of Boonville. Not aware of the situation, Captain LaBarge received warning shots over head from Confederate forces still present in the surrounding area, and was forced to round to and stop. The Confederate General John S. Marmaduke and a company of troops boarded the Emilie with orders for LaBarge to take the aleing General Price up river to Lexington for treatment. LaBarge explained that he could not comply because he was \\"in the service of the government\\", delivering freight. At that point, though LaBarge happened to know Marmaduke \\"well\\", he was placed under arrest as a matter of routine and his boat was commandeered. LaBarge protested again, that he would have to pay his crew for their extra time, and for additional fuel for the added distance involved, where Marmaduke agreed to compensate him for his time and trouble. General Price was brought aboard and Marmaduke left the boat in the hands of his officers, and the Emilie set off for Lexington. After dropping off Price, LaBarge was allowed to depart with the Emilie, but received no compensation, as promised by Marmaduke, from the Confederate officer left in charge, who figured LaBarge was well off enough to leave with his boat intact, where the Emilie headed back to Boonville. Upon approaching that town, now occupied by Union forces, the Emilie was fired upon again and forced to stop, where LaBarge was brought to and questioned by Union General Nathaniel Lyon. After establishing his well known identity and purpose on the river, LaBarge was permitted to depart with the Emilie, but with all her freight having been confiscated by Union forces.Chittenden, 1903, vol II, pp. 255‚Äì258Harper, Historical Society of Missouri, 2019, essay On October 16, 1862 the Emilie had stopped at Portland to drop off a couple of passengers. While docked an outfit of Confederate soldiers rushed out from behind a woodpile and came aboard the Emilie. Captain LaBarge was forced to unload his cargo and ferry 175 Confederate cavalry men and their horses across the river. No sooner had they departed when a company of Union cavalry arrived on the scene, but not in time to stop the operation. These were the only two occasions that Captain LaBarge experienced trouble on the river because of the war.Chittenden, 1903, vol II, pp. 258‚Äì259 =Race with Spread Eagle= Missouri River In the spring of 1862, Joseph LaBarge, his brother, John, and several other partners formed the firm of LaBarge, Harkness & Co. based in Saint Louis, for purposes of trading on the upper Missouri River. The company's two principle riverboats were the Emilie and the Shreveport. That spring the Emilie was about to make the annual run north, bringing people and supplies to Fort Benton in Montana, the farthest navigable point on the river,O'Neil, 1975, p. 14 2300 miles from Saint Louis, by way of river. The fort served as a trading post and supply center for trappers and mining operations in the region. The American Fur Company was also involved is its annual journey to the fort with its riverboat, the Spread Eagle. The Emilie was commanded by Captain Joseph LaBarge, and the Spread Eagle, by Captain William Bailey. The Emilie, the faster of the two vessels, had departed from Saint Louis four days after the Spread Eagle but eventually caught up to her at Fort Berthold. The venture at this point turned into a heated race between the rival companies and crews when the Emilie attempted to pass the Spread Eagle. Realizing that the Spread Eagle was about to fall behind, Captain Bailey ordered the pilot to ram the starboard bow of the Emilie in an attempt disable her, or at least impede her performance.Eriksmoen, Bismarck Tribune, Sept. 2, 2012 The collision occurred dangerously close to the boilers of the Emilie. In the calamity a gunfight nearly broke out between the two crews, but was averted when the two boats broke free from the other. The attempt to disable Emilie failed, and only resulted in minor damage to the vessel. Emilie, regardless, managed to reach Fort Benton four days before the arrival of the Spread Eagle.Chittenden, 1903, Volume II, pp. 287‚Äì290O'Neil, 1975, p. 30 As a result of the race, the Emilie was the first sidewwheel steamboat to reach Fort Benton.Casler, 1999, pp. 22‚Äì23 Late in the winter of 1862‚Äì1863 Captain LaBarge sold the Emilie for $25,000 to the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad.Chittenden, 1903, vol II, p. 298 See also * Ontario (steamboat), the first steam driven sidewheeler steamboat to see active service on the Great Lakes, at Lake Ontario. * Walk-in-the-water (steamboat) ‚Äî first steamboat to run on the Great Lakes at Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan * American Fur Company ‚Äì Major owners and employers of steamboats on the Missouri River * North American fur trade Notes References Sources   * - (Also in PDF format)  =Further reading= Category:Missouri River Category:Steamboats of the Missouri River ","title":"Emilie (steamboat)"},{"id":"61778972","text":"The lynching of Jay Lynch, age 28, took place in Lamar, Missouri, on May 28, 1919. The year 1919 saw 83 lynchings in the United States. Lynch was one of only four white men lynched in that year. Jay Lynch Jay Lynch had a long arrest record. Crimes he was accused of included burglary and robbery. In Oklahoma City he allegedly stole a car, and in Kansas City he allegedly stole $300 worth of women's silks. For almost a decade he was in and out of jail and escaped from prison several times. In 1918, he was hired on as a private detective of the Wabash Railroad in St. Louis. While working for the railway he was arrested for robbing a train. Lynch skipped bail on that charge and was later arrested near his sister's house near Lamar. Murder On March 3, 1919, while being held in Lamar in connection with the Wabash Railroad boxcar robbery in St. Louis, Lynch asked to use the jailhouse telephone. When Sheriff John Marion Harlow Jr. of Barton County opened his cell, Lynch fatally shot the sheriff with a gun he had earlier smuggled into the county jail. Harlow's son, Dick Harlow, heard the commotion and ran to save his father, but was also mortally wounded by Lynch and died a few days later. After shooting the sheriff and his son, Lynch fled the state and drove across the country. He was denied entry to Mexico and was arrested again in La Junta, Colorado, on May 13, 1919, and sent back to Missouri. Lynch pleaded guilty to murder. As there was no death penalty in Missouri, he was sentenced to life in prison. Lynching Fearing violence from the packed courthouse, presiding judge B. G. Thurman had the prisoner taken into his private office after the verdict to say goodbye to Lynch's family. In his office were the judge; Lynch's wife, baby, mother, and sister; and several deputies assigned to guard the prisoner. While Lynch was holding his child, 24 people burst into the office and overpowered the armed guards. The men put a noose around Lynch's neck and dragged him out of the courthouse. The noose's rope was thrown over a tree branch, but when he was strung up, it broke under the weight. Another, sturdier branch was chosen, and Lynch was hanged in front of a cheering crowd. Aftermath The coroner's report listed the cause of Lynch's death as \\"at the hands of parties unknown\\". Prosecuting attorney H. W. Timmonds and sheriff W. A. Sewell of Barton County started an investigation into the lynching, but no charges were ever filed as no one was willing to identify the perpetrators. The State of Missouri had abolished capital punishment in 1917. In large part due to the events surrounding Lynch's lynching, as well as the representative of Barton County, H. C. Chancellor, giving an impassioned speech calling for the death penalty, the bill was quickly restored for seven crimes: treason, perjury, subornation of perjury, first-degree murder, rape, kidnapping, and train robbery. It was signed into law by Governor Frederick D. Gardner.

He was unraced as a two-year-old in 2018 but in the following year he established himself as a top-class performer as he won his first five races including the Great Voltigeur Stakes and the St Leger Stakes. Background Logician is a roan colt bred in England by his owner Khalid Abullah's Juddmonte Farms. He was sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the third crop of foals sired by Frankel, an undefeated racehorse whose other progeny have included Cracksman, Anapurna, Soul Stirring and Without Parole. Logician's dam Scuffle (from whom he inherited his grey colour) showed some racing ability, winning three minor races in 2008 and later ran third in the Snowdrop Fillies' Stakes. As a broodmare she has also produced the La Prevoyante Handicap winner Suffused. She was a half-sister Cityscape and a descendant of the influential American broodmare Best In Show, the ancestor of numerous major winners including El Gran Senor, Try My Best, Xaar, Jazil, Rags to Riches and Redoute's Choice. Racing career =2019: three-year-old season= On 17 May at Newbury Racecourse Logician made his racecourse debut in a ten furlong maiden race for which he started the 3/1 favourite in a nineteen-runner field. Ridden by Kieran O'Neill he recovered from a slow start to take the lead approaching the final furlong before drawing away in the closing stages to win by two lengths from High Commissioner. Robert Havlin took the ride when the colt started 2/9 favourite for a minor race over the same distance at Newmarket Racecourse on 21 June and won by one and three quarter lengths and a short head from Away He Goes and Persuading. Two weeks later Logician was stepped up in distance for a handicap race over one and a half miles at Newbury and was made the 1/5 favourite despite being assigned top weight of 131 pounds. Partnered by the first time by Frankie Dettori he went to the front two furlongs out and won \\"easily\\" by four and a half lengths. At York Racecourse on 21 August Logician was stepped up in class to contest the Group 2 Great Voltigeur Stakes, a race which is considered a major trial race for the St Leger. With Dettori in the saddle he started the 10/11 favourite against four opponents namely Constantinople (Gallinule Stakes), Nayef Road (Gordon Stakes), Norway (third in the Irish Derby) and Jalmoud (third in the Grand Prix de Paris). After racing in third place behind Norway and Jalmoud, Logician took the lead two furlongs out and \\"kept on strongly\\" to win by one and three quarter lengths from Constantinople with a gap of seven lengths back to Norway in third. Dettori commented \\"There was still a bit of greenness but he hit the line well and galloped out strongly. He's not the finished article but with every race he's improving and he's taken another leap forward\\". On 14 September at Doncaster Racecourse Logician started the 5/6 favourite for the 243rd running of the St Leger Stakes over 1 mile 6 furlongs. His seven opponents were Sir Dragonet (Chester Vase, beaten favourite in the Epsom Derby), Sir Ron Priestley (March Stakes), Il Paradiso (third in the Lonsdale Cup), Dashing Willoughby (Queen's Vase), Technician, Nayef Road and Western Australia. The favourite started well but was restrained by Dettori and settled towards the rear as Western Australia set the pace. Logician was angled to the right in the straight to race up the stands side and produced a sustained run, taking the lead in the last quarter mile and winning by two and a quarter lengths from Sir Ron Priestley, with Nayef Road a head away in third place.

It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine since December 2018. Its individual chapters have been collected into eight tank≈çbon volumes as of August 2020. In North America, Viz Media licensed the manga for English language release. The first volume was published in October 2020. Plot The story is set in a world where Devils cause harm to humans, which makes them a target for extermination. Denji is a young, depressed man who has sold several of his organs and works as a tree cutter and devil hunter to pay back his deceased father's debt to loan sharks (yakuza). Denji owns a dog (that is also a devil) called Pochita, that has the characteristic features of a chainsaw and is used by Denji as such for his work. Humans can make deals (contracts) with devils. After returning home from killing a tomato devil, Denji gets called by the Yakuza to go into a building to kill another devil, However, as it turns out, the Yakuza called Denji to allow a zombie devil to kill Denji, and in return, the zombie devil would give the yakuza more power, which would let them make more money. After Denji is killed and Pochita is severely injured by said devil, Pochita merges with Denji (because of a deal Denji made with Pochita when they first met), and as a result Denji's wounds heal and he gets revived as a half-human, half-devil, acquiring Pochita's chainsaw ability. Denji then uses the ability to kill the zombie devil that initially killed him. After killing the devil, a team of governmental devil hunters arrives on the scene, and after discovering that the devil was already killed by Denji, one of its members persuades Denji to become part of the governmental devil hunting organization the team belongs to. Characters ; :Denji is a young man (self-proclaimed 16 years old) with blond, scruffy hair. He has sharp yellowish-brown eyes with bags underneath and sharp teeth to match. As a young boy, he inherits his father's debts from the Yakuza. After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. After the Yakuza, which were under the control of a Devil, betray him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He can now become the Chainsaw Devil by pulling the cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter. ; :Makima is a woman who appears to be in her twenties. She is a Public Safety Devil Hunter, who took Denji as her human pet. Makima is cunning and manipulative. She controls Denji with promises of a romantic and sexual relationship while threatening him with extermination if he disobeys her. Her goals are unknown and her allegiance to humanity is somewhat ambiguous. She is later revealed to be the Control Devil which embodies the fear of control. ; :Aki Hayakawa is a Public Safety Devil Hunter, working under Makima's special squad. He has a contract with the Curse Devil and Future Devil, and a former contract with the Fox Devil. Aki has been shown many times to be a very stoic person. He acts mature and dependable when he is with his fellow Devil hunters, but the man is very soft whenever he is alone. He actually cares about Denji and Power and see both of them as a dear friend and willing to sacrifice himself for them. He was killed while protecting Makima and possessed by the Gun Devil, thus became the Gun Fiend. Later it is revealed that Makima was the one who planned to have him killed. ; :Power is a Blood Fiend and a Public Safety Devil Hunter who is part of Makima's special squad. Power looks like a young woman with pinkish hair that reaches down to her mid- back. As a fiend, she has light red horns protruding from the top of her head. Power is childish, greedy, and almost entirely self-motivated. Power cares deeply for her cat, Meowy, which at one point she was willing to sacrifice Denji's life to save him from the Bat Devil.She is later killed by Makima infront of Denji revealing that she intends to break Denji by giving him happiness and then taking it away from him. ; :Pochita is the chainsaw Devil who merged with Denji and was originally the Chainsaw Man himself prior to Denji. He had the ability to eat a devil and erase their existence hence why is the Devil that most Devils fear. ; :The grandson of the Yakuza boss who had Denji and Pochita killed, and an agent of the Gun Devil. Like Denji, he is a human-devil hybrid with the heart of the Katana Devil. He can transform into his hybrid form by removing his hand, causing a katana to emerge from the stump. His real name is unknown. ; :A girl with a crush on Denji who works at a cafe. She is later revealed to be a hybrid with the Bomb Devil, and a Soviet spy sent to kill Denji. ; :One of the most powerful and feared Devils in existence. Thirteen years before the story begins, a mass shooting and terrorist attack occurred in America, causing the Gun Devil to be born from the fear of guns. It attacked the world, killing 1.2 million people in under five minutes before vanishing. It is later revealed that the governments of several countries have formed contracts with the Gun Devil, and the president of the United States summons it to kill Makima. Makima defeats it, but it kills Aki and possesses him, turning him into the Gun Fiend later dies at the hand of Denji. Publication Chainsaw Man is written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto.

As of October 2020, the manga had over 4.2 million copies in circulation. In 2019, Chainsaw Man was one of the winners of the 5th Tsugi ni Kuru Manga Award in the Print category. The series ranked #4 on Kono Manga ga Sugoi! list of best manga of 2020 for male readers. The manga was nominated for the 13th Manga Taish≈ç award in 2020. It ranked #2 on the \\"Nationwide Bookstore Employees' Recommended Comics of 2020\\". The series ranked #10 in a 2020 poll conducted by AnimeJapan of \\"Most Wanted Anime Adaptation\\". James Beckett of Anime News Network ranked the first volume as a B+. Beckett described the series as \\"goofy, kinky, dark, and bizarre\\". He praised the series for its compelling world building and character development, calling the story \\"a mishmash of raunchy teen sex comedies, Hellboy, and The Evil Dead\\". Beckett, however, stated that its reveling in crude humor and violence could be off-putting to some readers. Hannah Collins of Comic Book Resources gave a positive review to the series and commended Fujimoto's penmanship, and stated that the gory scenes, instead of be gratuitous, just make the story feel \\"refreshingly unfiltered\\". Collins added: \\"Chainsaw Man bears all the hallmarks of a standard supernatural action series, but its quieter moments are where its dark heart beats fastest\\". Julia Lee of Polygon gave a positive review to the series. Lee pointed out that the series' gory scenes make it different from other sh≈çnen series, adding as well that it has an \\"interestingly goofy contrast between the characters and what‚Äôs going on\\". Lee stated that Denji's simple mind and \\"kind-of-horny instincts\\" can get tiring at times, but it does not make the series bad, and with the introduction of the \\"extremely interesting side characters\\", like Power and Makima, the story \\"takes a turn for the better\\". Adi Tantimedh of Bleeding Cool gave the first volume 7 out of 10. Tantimedh stated that Chainsaw Man distinguishes itself with its slapstick comedy, and a deadly earnest tone might have made the series unreadable. He depicted the characters as \\"sad, broken people who live outside the norms of society and haven't learned basic social skills\\", and added that the series' subtext is about \\"people getting abused, degraded, dehumanized, objectified, literally becoming objects\\". Tantimedh concluded: \\"Society is to blame for degrading people into tools and objects; these mangas seem to be saying, though they never outright blame Capitalism or the alienating repressiveness of Japanese society. The result is one of the more unique manga out there\\". Ian Wolf of Anime UK News gave the first volume 6 out of 10. Wolf wrote that the main feature of the series is the action sequences and that \\"the ridiculousness of the story helps to add comedy to the whole thing\\". Wolf concluded \\"Chainsaw Man has some things going for it and hopefully may well build up from a promising start\\".

Berns, a lesbian radical feminist, came to prominence in the late-2010s as a result of a series of YouTube vlogs focusing on lesbian politics, free speech, and gender identity. Berns's views attracted controversy, leading to her being described as \\"transphobic\\" and a \\"TERF\\". Berns also co-founded the group For Women Scotland (Forwomen.Scot), which opposes proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004.  Education, career, and sporting endeavours  The daughter of Gustavo Berns and the socialist historian Deborah Lavin, Berns originated from Camden, London where she attended Hampstead School. As a teenager, she participated in campaigns against Huntingdon Life Sciences and anti-war marches, attended Socialist Labour Party discussions on Marxism, distributed election leaflets for the SLP, and joined a socialist choir. After leaving Hampstead School, Berns worked as a sound engineer until attending the University of Edinburgh in her thirties. She initially studied engineering, receiving a Doris Gray Scholarship‚Äîan award for underprivileged women studying engineering in Scotland‚Äîfrom the Women's Engineering Society. In her second year she switched to physics, graduating in 2016. She was a self-taught computer programmer, and between 2013 and 2015 participated in the Google Summer of Code project, working on implementing the FFTW3 library for Ruby. As part of the Summer of Code, she interned in the Outreach Program for Women of the GNOME Foundation, where she worked on the Java ATK Wrapper, a module to translate Swing events for the Accessibility Toolkit, and on implementing a caret and focus tracking device in GNOME Shell. Berns was active in Scottish amateur boxing. In 2009, she competed in the Scottish University Boxing Championships in the bantamweight division, losing in the final to Sinead Sheehan. In 2010, she became the first Scottish boxer to win at the Haringey Box Cup, (described by Lee Power of Ham & High as \\"arguably the biggest and most prestigious tournament in amateur boxing in Europe\\"). In 2011, she became the first Scottish boxer to win at the Golden Girl Championship (one of the largest all- female tournaments in the world); won the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Boxing Championship in the novice women's 54 kg class; and competed in the Scottish Amateur Boxing Championships in the 51 kg (flyweight) category, losing in the senior finals to Stephanie Kernachan. Berns created a women-only boxing club while at the University of Edinburgh and was a member of Scotland's first female boxing squad. She was posthumously described by Boxing Scotland as \\"a pioneer for both women's boxing and university boxing in Scotland\\".  Radical feminism  In 2015, Berns expressed opposition to the Edinburgh University Students' Association \\"LGBT Liberation\\" group issuing a statement of support for the decision to exclude drag acts from participating in that year's Pride Glasgow event. In 2016, Berns was banned from the University of Edinburgh's Feminist Society for opposing the decriminalisation of sex work. In April 2016, Berns began her series of \\"irreverent\\" YouTube vlogs where she published her views on gender identity. Her first and subsequent vlogs criticised claims that the unwillingness of cisgender lesbians to have sex with trans women who have penises (coined the \\"cotton ceiling\\") is due to transphobia, bigotry or prejudice rather than sexual orientation. She was also known for arguing against gender self- identification. Speaking on the subject of gender and sexuality, Berns stated: \\"You don't get 'assigned' reproductive organs...males are defined by their biological sex organs. Likewise, homosexuals are people who are attracted to the same biological sex.\\" She described trans women as \\"blackface actors\\" and \\"men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women\\", said that \\"trans women are men\\", that \\"there is no such thing as a lesbian with a penis\\", and that she'd \\"rather be rude than a fucking liar\\". She was critical of the LGBT charity Stonewall. Berns was posthumously described as \\"a great believer in the importance of biological sex [who] didn‚Äôt believe lesbians should be called bigots for not dating trans women with penises.\\" By the autumn of 2019, Berns had produced 64 vlogs and amassed approximately 30,000 followers. In May 2016, Berns was among the signatories of an open letter to the Morning Star newspaper, that lauded it for \\"giving a platform for a sex-class based analysis of women's position, in the face of the convergence of neoliberal individualism and alienation from class consciousness\\". In July 2016, Berns spoke at Thinking Differently: Feminists Questioning Gender Politics, a conference in London focusing on \\"the implications of transgenderism for women's rights\\". The conference was described by one attendee as \\"the first full-day public conference that we know of on the topic of how gender identity politics harm women and girls\\". Berns addressed her experiences with no platforming as a university student. In 2018, Berns co-founded the Scottish campaign group Forwomen.Scot, which grew to become the largest organisation of its kind in Scotland. The group, which opposes reform of the Gender Recognition Act, has been called anti-trans, which the group themselves deny. In June 2019, British author J.K. Rowling followed Berns on Twitter, bringing her more visibility and prompting criticism towards Rowling. In June 2020, Rowling revealed that she had spoken with Berns, describing her as \\"an immensely brave young feminist and lesbian\\", and had begun receiving \\"low- level harassment\\" as a result of her association with Berns. = Criticism and acclaim = Berns' opinions attracted both criticism and acclaim. She was described as \\"one of the most hateful and aggressive anti-trans radical feminists on Twitter\\" by blogger Phaylen Fairchild; as a \\"TERF\\" (trans- exclusionary radical feminist) by Vice writer Lewis Gordon; and as a \\"transphobe\\" in the Trans Advocate Twitter account, as well as \\"whorephobic\\" by members of the Edinburgh University Students' Association. Writing in student newspaper The Wesleyan Argus, Connor Aberle stated that Berns's \\"most popular uploads simply mock videos of transgender people\\", describing her as part of \\"a group of far-left YouTubers who hate transgender people\\". Writing in Femestella, Alysia Stevenson described Berns as \\"a prominent anti-trans Youtuber\\", acccusing her of \\"hateful rhetoric\\". Writing in the New York Post, Melkorka Licea described Berns as \\"outspoken\\". Transgender rights activist and philosophy professor Rachel McKinnon drew criticism, and a protest letter with over 500 signatories, after defending celebrations by Berns's opponents of her impending death. McKinnon said such celebrations are \\"ethically justified when the person dying has engaged in extreme harassment of a marginalised group\\". Writing in the Morning Star, Susan Chynoweth and Deborah Lavin (Berns's mother) praised Berns's \\"determined defence of women's sex-based rights and the rights of lesbians to assert their sexuality in the face of relentless demands to redefine sex as gender\\", and named her \\"one of the best-known feminist speakers of her generation\\". National Review staff writer Madeleine Kearns called her videos a \\"great source of inspiration and clarity for those trying to resist gender extremism\\". Writing in The Velvet Chronicle, Julia Diana Robertson eulogised Berns as a \\"rare force of nature\\", suggesting that \\"While many may never know the impact she made, the ripple effect will be felt for many years to come\\". Journalist Meghan Murphy stated that Berns had contributed to \\"igniting public conversation around sex, gender, and sexuality\\". Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan voiced vocal support for Berns on Twitter and other platforms. Berns's death was noted by two Members of the Scottish Parliament: Joan McAlpine MSP described her as a \\"clever and uncompromising\\" young woman, while Ruth Maguire MSP described her as a \\"courageous young feminist, who inspired others\\". In October 2019, Berns was posthumously shortlisted for the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize, which the organisation awards to women it deems to have \\"raised awareness of violence against women and children\\"; in November 2019, she received a special award from the organisation.  Cancer and death  In April 2017, Berns informed her YouTube subscribers that she had been diagnosed with a brain tumour that was affecting her left frontal lobe, which she later clarified to actually be centered in her left parietal lobe. In July, she announced that she had an astrocytoma that could not be completely removed surgically. She was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2018.

History The district is named after Khlong San, a natural khlong ('canal'). This area was the home of many of the Bunnag nobles. It was a stop for overseas cargo ships in Bangkok, as Bangkok Port was not yet built. Originally, Khlong San District was called Bang Lamphu Lang, until 1916 during the King Vajiravudh's reign, when it was part of Thonburi Province. Its status was changed to king amphoe ('minor district') in 1938 and back to amphoe (district) again in 1957 due to population changes. It became part of Bangkok after the merging of Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces in 1971. The intersection of Charoen Nakhon and Charoen Rat Roads (Chanroen Rat junction), used to be the location of Pak Khlong San railway station, the terminus of the Maeklong railway line since 1904. In 1961, when Bangkok was expanding, the government demolished the station and tracks to create Charoen Rat Road.

He also held land in Menen and Rekkem, a manor in Varsenare, and owned a number of houses within the city of Ypres. When war broke out between the Count of Flanders and Philip IV of France in 1297, he served in the count's forces in the garrison of Ypres, under the command of John of Namur. Most of his land fell under French occupation, and without that revenue he was obliged to raise loans within the city secured by his property there. The French declared his lands elsewhere forfeit, awarding his manor in Varsenare to Dominique Maere in April 1299, and his lands in Menen, Rekkem and Wervik to Raoul de Clermont later the same year. In January 1300 Guy of Dampierre was captured by the French, and Guy de Thourout was among the small group of the count's supporters captured with him.

Turkey has a history of strong anti-Arabism dating back to the Ottoman Empire, which has risen significantly in recent years because of the Syrian refugee crisis.  Anti-Arabism in the Ottoman Empire  The Ottoman Empire was a multi-cultural empire. However, the Arabs were mostly excluded and instead only got appointed in local positions. Most of government's main positions were either held by Turks or non-Arab people, except for the Emirate of Hejaz under Ottoman rule. Future policy of anti-Arab sentiment, including the process of Turkification, led to the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans.  Modern anti-Arabism  Haaretz reported that anti- Arabian racism in Turkey mainly affects two groups; tourists from the Gulf who are characterized as \\"rich and condescending\\" and the Syrian refugees in Turkey. Haaretz also reported that anti-Syrian sentiment in Turkey is metastasizing into a general hostility toward all Arabs including the Palestinians. √úmit √ñzdaƒü, the deputy Chairman of the ƒ∞yi Party, warned that Turkey risked becoming \\"a Middle Eastern country\\" because of the influx of refugees. The current mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu has complained of Arabic signs on shop fronts, and said Syrians refugees were stealing jobs from locals. He also told BBC that ‚ÄúThere are some parts of Turkey where the refugees outnumber the actual residents.‚Äù = Depiction of Arabs in Turkey = Due to long historical anti-Arabism in the Ottoman Empire and subsequent Arab Revolt as a result, there is a strong negative depiction which was dated from Kemalist Turkey in 1930s, associating Arabs with backwardness. This has continued influencing modern Turkish historiography and the crusade of Turkish soft power, with Arabs being frequently stereotyped as evil, uncivilized, terrorists, incompetent, stupid, etc. This depiction is frequently used in contrast to the alleged depiction of Turkic people as \\"noble, generous, fearsome, loyal, brave and spirited warriors\\".https://www.cairn- int.info/abstract-E_HER_160_0319--arabs-and-turks-so-close-yet-so-far.htm Anti-Arab sentiment is also further fueled by ultranationalist groups, including the Grey Wolves and pan-Turkist nationalist parties, who called for invasions on the Arab World's Syria and Iraq, to prevent the ongoing Arab persecution of its Turkic populations in many Arab countries of the Middle East. Subsequently, Turkey has begun a series of persecuting its Arab population, as well as desire to recreate the new Turkish border. In recent years, anti-Arabism has been linked with various attempts by Arab leaders to meddle into Turkish affairs, Turkey's alliance with Israel, which led to the discrimination against Arabs in Turkey grow. Growing influx of Arab refugees in Turkey led to a serious wave of anti-Arabism.

A native of Baghdad who was originally named  ªƒ™s√°, he moved to Syria under the rule of Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid emir of Aleppo, and took a job as secretary to a subordinate emir in Shaizar. He intervened in Church controversies in Antioch and its Christian residents selected him as the new patriarch upon the death of Agapius I. As patriarch, Christopher undertook educational and charitable efforts to help his Christian subjects, including negotiations with Sayf al-Dawla for tax reduction. When a rebellion broke out in Antioch in 965, led by Rashiq al- Nasimi, Christopher took the side of the emir and withdrew to the monastery of Simeon Stylites in order to avoid interaction with the rebels. After the rebellion was finally suppressed, this made the patriarch a favorite at the court of Sayf al-Dawla, but created enemies within Antioch. When Sayf al-Dawla died in early 967, Christopher's enemies took advantage of the momentary power vacuum and plotted against him. Although he was warned of this danger by a Muslim friend named Ibn Abƒ´  ªAmr, Christopher chose to remain in Antioch. Accusing the patriarch of conspiring against Antioch with Sayf al- Dawla's allies and with the Byzantines, the plotters convinced a group of visiting soldiers from Khorasan to kill him on the night of May 23, 967. His head was cut off and his body was thrown into the Orontes River. Shortly thereafter, a group of local Christians found the body in the river and took it in secret to a local monastery, where Christopher began to be venerated as a martyr. In late 969, the armies of Emperor Nikephoros II conquered Antioch, and the new patriarch of Antioch (Theodorus II) brought Christopher's body into the city for public veneration. Legacy For centuries, Christopher was venerated as a saint by the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch on either May 21 or May 22, as shown by liturgical manuscripts in both Syriac and Arabic that include calendars of saints. However, with the growing dominance of the Byzantine Rite in early modern Syria, his veneration fell into disuse. Sources By far the most detailed source for Christopher's life is the Life of Christopher by Ibrahim ibn Yuhanna, a Byzantine bureaucrat who knew Christopher as a child in Antioch. This text was originally written in both Greek and Arabic, but only the Arabic version survives. It was edited and translated into French by Habib Zayat in 1952. Significant portions of his story are also included in the history of Yahya of Antioch, and brief notices‚Äîcentered on Christopher's death‚Äîappear in the Byzantine histories of Leo the Deacon and John Skylitzes.

Shustova is the Peter and Bonnie McCausland Associate Professor of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina. She develops materials for sustainable energy conversion, including metal‚Äìorganic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks and graphite. She holds two doctorate degrees, one in physical chemistry and another in inorganic chemistry.  Research and career  In 2013, Shustova was appointed Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina. In 2019, she was quickly promoted to the Peter and Bonnie McCausland Associate Professor. Work in her research group is multifaceted, utilizing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent-organic frameworks (COFs), and graphitic hybrid structures to design materials for sustainable energy conversion, as stimuli-responsive sensors and switches, and for nuclear waste sequestration. Shustova is interested in achieving greater morphological control in the active layer of bulk heterojunction solar cells through the design of novel donor-acceptor frameworks. Her work has integrated fulleretic accepting molecules, such as œÄ‚Äêbowls or œÄ‚Äêballs, to tune electronic properties, achieving semiconductive behavior in normally insulating materials. Shustova has also attempted to design artificial photosynthetic scaffolds for light harvesting. In one case, Shustova and her group utilized a MOF in a multifunctional system for efficient chromophore coupling, facilitating highly efficient energy transfer mimicking the protein beta-barrel structure. Her research group is also interested in tuning rigidity and linker installation in photochromic scaffolds, specifically in spiropyran-based MOF photoswitches, and the control of cycloreversion kinetics. These photo-responsive materials provide fundamental knowledge to monitor changes in material properties such as material aging and structural deterioration over time. More recently, she has considered MOFs as candidates for nuclear waste administration. These frameworks have the potential to sequester radionuclide waste-form materials, and function as a versatile platform for selective actinide separation, and sensing. She has studied the thermodynamics and electronic structure in actinide containing MOFs, highlighting the solvent- assisted structural dynamism (crystalline-to-amorphous-to-crystalline transformations) unique to these materials. She has further reported the ability to control radionuclide leaching kinetics in MOFs as a function of post-synthetic capping linker installation. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include: * Hans Fischer Fellowship (2020) * Camille Dreyfus Teaching-Scholar Award (2019) * Alfred P.

He was highly regarded by friend and foe alike, and became the hero of \\"The Asgill Affair\\" of 1782, in which a British prisoner of war was selected by lottery for retaliatory execution, but was eventually released on parole. Early life On 1 February 1746 (when James Gordon was 11 years old) his family lived at Linlithgow Palace. Government troops, under the command of Lieutenant General Henry Hawley, were pursuing Jacobites in the area. They left their overnight camp in the palace, and rushed out leaving their campfires burning. The 320-year-old structure was badly damaged. This 1839 engraving shows the Keeper of the Palace, Mrs Glen Gordon chastising the fleeing troops. Mary Ellen Gordon, daughter of James Gordon of Ellon, married 23.7.1771 John Balfour, 5th of Balbirnie, mother of Lt.Gen. Robert Balfour and sister of Lt. Col. James Gordon.

Davies, \\"The Balfours of Balbirnie and Whittingehame\\", The Scottish Genealogist, 60(2013):84-90. \\"The second Laird became his father‚Äôs heir on 25 July 1732; and on 22 November 1732, heir male and of provision special to his brother William. On 4 September 1747, he executed a deed (registered 23 March 1732) empowering his spouse, Elizabeth Glen, conjoined with others, to have full charge of his lands or to dispose of them. It began ‚Äì I, James Gordon of Ellon, considering that I am to reside for some time out of Scotland, and that it may be necessary for the expeeding of my affairs to sell and dispose of my lands - before my return to Scotland or in case of my decease.\\" Why James should have found it necessary to go out of Scotland is not clear, unless he was a Jacobite, the Battle of Culloden having taken place on 16 April 1746. He seems to have been accompanied by his son, James, aged approximately 12 at the time. James Gordon the second Laird died, according to his will, in April 1749. His inventory was given up by his widow, Elizabeth Glen. Gordon, the second Laird, married Elizabeth Glen (1712-1792), daughter of Alexander Glen and sister of James Glen (1701-1777), Governor of South Carolina and keeper of the Palace of Linlithgow. She lived in the Palace of Linlithgow, of which her relations, the Linlithgows, had charge. A staunch Jacobite herself, she was particularly well connected. When Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie Prince Charlie) arrived in Linlithgow in 1745, he was entertained by her. And in 1762, on being presented to King George III, she told him that she had four beautiful daughters (James Gordon's sisters) who were each married in one of his four kingdoms. \\"I have heard of three\\" said King George, \\"but never four.\\" \\"Did your Majesty never hear of the Kingdom of Fife?\\" was Mrs Glen Gordon‚Äôs reply. James Gordon the third Laird \\"did not keep Ellon long, for the lands were offered for sale on 8 April 1752. The articles of roup, in the Ellon Charter Chest, show that the upset price was ¬£16,000 sterling, and in addition there is a stipulation that there shall be a present of 200 guineas for a gown to the said Elizabeth Glen. After a protracted competition, the lands were bought for George Gordon, 3rd Earl of Aberdeen in 1752, at ¬£17,600, plus 200 guineas for the gown. There was an annuity of ¬£120 to Elizabeth Glen reserved from the price\\". That same year, 1752, Gordon petitioned for a writership (administrator) in the Honourable East India Company. \\"On 25 June 1765, Charles Gordon of Auchleuchrie, son of James Gordon of Meikle Mill of Esslemont, got decreet and sentence before the Lords of Council against James Gordon, \\"late of Ellon and sometime captain in H.M. [80th] Regiment of Foot, eldest son of the late deceased James Gordon of Ellon, and grandson of James Gordon of Ellon\\", in the matter of a bond of 1,000 marks which James I of Ellon had borrowed from James at Meikle Mill of Esselmont on 17 June 1730. The sum of ¬£20 figures in Charles‚Äôs will 1777 as the expenses of the plea and for extracting the decreet. On 23 September 1772, Captain James had sasine in life-rent (political) in Auchanachie (Banffshire sasines)\\". Military career Gordon initially served as an officer in the 115th Regiment of Foot (Royal Scotch Lowlanders) which were raised at Paisley in 1701, and disbanded about 1763, when he was placed on half pay. He was appointed major in the 80th Regiment of Foot (Royal Edinburgh Volunteers) on 16 December 1777 and accompanied the regiment on active service during the American Revolutionary War in August 1779. Gordon fought under General Charles Cornwallis, but became an American prisoner of war following capitulation after the siege of Yorktown, Virginia, in October 1781. In 1783, by a curious coincidence, he was a member of the Court Martial in New York in which his Aberdeenshire neighbour, Cosmo Gordon, son of the Earl of Aberdeen, was involved. In Katherine Mayo's book she describes him thus: > James Gordon, First Major of the Eightieth Foot, was, like his regiment, > Scot to the core. Middle-aged, tall, rather heavily built, one glance at the > man revealed his character. Frank as the sun and as friendly, brave to a > fault, and as generous, utterly self-forgetful in the face of others' needs, > neither the activity of his mind nor the dignity and cheerfulness of his > spirit would bow to the worst of days. His soldiership, as displayed in the > two past years of campaigning, had won him Lord Cornwallis' special praise - > coupled once with an aside: 'When I first knew Gordon, twenty years ago, gay > in gay London, who could have guessed how much lay in the man?‚Äô In April 1782, a captain of the Monmouth Militia and privateer named Joshua Huddy was overwhelmed and captured by Loyalist forces. Huddy was accused of complicity in the death of a Loyalist farmer. Huddy was conveyed to New York City, then under British control, where he was summarily sentenced to be executed by William Franklin, the Loyalist son of Benjamin Franklin. Huddy was held in leg irons aboard a prison ship until 12 April 1782, when he was taken ashore and hanged. General George Washington responded to pressure for retribution by declaring that a British captain would be executed in retaliation for the killing of Huddy. On 27 May 1782, lots were drawn at the Black Bear Inn, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with Captain Charles Asgill drawing the paper which put him under threat of execution. Gordon, who was a fellow officer of Asgill, and was in charge of prisoners-of-war, protested in the strongest terms to both General Washington and to Benjamin Lincoln, the Secretary of War that the use of a lottery was illegal by contravening the 14th Article of Capitulation. Death and legacy Morris House which served as the headquarters of both the American and the British Forces during the War and in which Gordon died Gordon's bedroom in the Morris House Gordon was the hero of the Asgill Affair: he remained at Asgill's side throughout his ordeal, never once leaving, unless on a mission to save his life. Not only did he offer to go to the gallows in Asgill's stead, saying: ‚ÄúI wish to God they would take me in your place; for I am an old worn out trunk of a tree, and have neither wife nor mother to weep for me. But even to that they will not consent; so all that I can undertake to do is, to accompany the unfortunate individual, whoever he may be, to the place of his martyrdom, and to give him every consolation and support while life remains, and to obey his wishes after it is taken away.‚Äù Having nobody to mourn his loss, was, of course, a lie - the most honourable of lies, overlooking that he had a mother, a brother and four sisters. But he also laid a detailed plan (with the help of several ladies in Chatham, New Jersey and no doubt beyond) to 'spirit Asgill away' to escape execution (to which proposal, as Katherine Mayo also reports, Asgill made the noblest of statements, not wishing to break his parole, \\"The lot fell to me, I will abide by it\\"). But the whole six month affair was the beginning of the end for him and he became increasingly ill during the course of the following year. It had pained him so greatly so see such a popular young man destined to have his life sacrificed: > During his final moments he was greatly cheered and comforted by the > knowledge that his conduct in the Asgill case had won for him the approval > and commendation of the Prince of Wales. On his deathbed he was visited by Captain Samuel Graham who had served with him throughout the Revolutionary war. Gordon handed Graham a letter he had received from Lady Asgill (Charles Asgill's mother) in which she expresses her deepest gratitude for all that Gordon had done for her son. In Gordons under arms; a biographical muster roll of officers named Gordon in the navies and armies of Britain, Europe, America and the Jacobite risings it is said that this letter did not reach New York before he died. But in Samuel Graham's Memoirs he recalls that Gordon asked him to thank Lady Asgill for her letter and to apologise to her for being unable to respond. This he did once he himself had returned to Britain. Gordon died of dropsy on 17 October 1783 at the Morris House in Kingsbridge, Upper Manhattan.

Plot Fire Punch tells the story of Agni, a man who is both blessed with immortality and cursed with the state of constantly being on fire. The fire is magical and can not burn out, leaving him in a state of painful half-regeneration, which is slowly driving him mad. The periods of lucidity where Agni finds peace are marred by moments where he loses awareness and wakes in the midst of fire to find that everyone he loves is dead. This, combined with the fact that he loses memories every time he dies and revives, means he just can not catch a break. The people close to him keep dying, usually by his own hand, but Agni himself is cursed to live on forever, alone. Publication Fire Punch is written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto.

Coronation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor, 1661. Sketch for the frescoes in the Sala Farnese of the Palazzo d'Accursio in Bologna. Genus Bononiae Collezioni. Charles V was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Clement VII in the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna on the 24th of February 1530. He was the last Holy Roman Emperor to be crowned by a pope.  Context for the coronation  Titian. Portrait of Charles V with a Dog. The portrait now in the Museo del Prado was started in Bologna in 1530, on the occasion of the coronation of Charles V. Pope Clement VII Medici and Charles V agreed to the imperial coronation as a means to heal the political and religious conflicts that had divided the Italian and European world and to reach a \\"universal peace\\" in the Christian West that would ensure a more effective defence against Turkish aggression which had reached the doors of Vienna in 1529. Preparations for the meeting between the two sovereigns encountered difficulties and delays due to the Pope's skepticism of Charles V's proposals. One concern, among others, was the location of this meeting. Pope Clement VII preferred Rome but Charles V chose instead Bologna, given that many Romans blamed Charles for the Sack of Rome (1527), which was carried out by his mutinous troops. This moment of extreme conflict between Papacy and Empire lead to intense diplomatic activity during 1529, a rapprochement of the adversary parties which paved the way to their meeting in Bologna.  Arrival of Clement VII and Charles V in Bologna  Palazzo d'Accursio in Bologna where Charles V and Pope Clement VII lodged in 1529‚Äì30 on the occasion of the coronation. Nobility and laymen prepared during the last months of 1529 to host the Pope and the future Emperor with their very extensive retinues. The city became a sort of stage theatre of the world, where the crafts and artistic skills of the Bolognese were put to the test. It was a prestigious occasion that received positive reviews, although no one had predicted that the guests would stay as long as they did. Clement VII arrived in Bologna on October 20, 1529, crossing the lands of his state: official sources of the time wrote that the Pope was splendidly received, but not without reservations from the populace, due to the taxes he imposed to mount a crusade against the Turks. Charles V travelled by sea from Barcelona to Genoa and continued on to Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Castelfranco Emilia and Borgo Panigale to reach Bologna the following November 5: \\"... upon his arrival the emperor had all the artillery unloaded, and on the square in front of the Palace of the Podest√† a fountain was installed in the shape of a black eagle in the middle of two lions. The eagle poured red wine all day long, one of the lions poured white wine, and the other water. And it was a very gratifying thing to the Landsknechte, who nearby roasted a whole beef full of different animals with golden horns and feet. And from the pacala was thrown bread, cheese and meat...\\".Anonimo, Relazione della coronazione di Carlo V imperatore fatta da Clemente VII in Bologna li 24 febbraio 1530 in Roberto Righi (a cura di), Carlo V a Bologna, 1530.

The choice of place fell on the Basilica of San Petronio, the largest and most spacious religious building, deeply rooted in the tradition of the city of Bologna.  The Iron Crown  On February 22, two days before the imperial coronation, Charles V received the Iron Crown of Lombardy in the Chapel of the Legate, today Farnese Chapel in Palazzo d'Accursio: \\". ..His Majesty rose from his chair, and went to see Our Lord and kissed his foot, and afterwards the sword, the world, the sceptre and the crown were brought before His Holiness, and his Majesty was always on his knees to the feet of Our Lord and His Holiness read certain prayers: first he took the naked sword, blessed it, and put it in the hands of His Majesty who put it back in the sheath, and Our Lord with his hands put his belt around her, and then His Majesty rose to his feet, and took it out of its sheath, and three times he brandished it, then put it back, and having done this, again His Majesty returned to the feet of Our Lord, and his sanctity put the crown of iron on his head, and then he took the world, and the sceptre, and he gave it to His Majesty as he continued to read prayers...

During World War II, from July 1943 to early 1944, he was the head of the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) Liaison Mission to the Chetnik forces of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá in Yugoslavia.:\\"Charles Douglas Armstrong, head of the British Liaison Mission to Mihailoviƒá.\\":\\" The last British presence with the Chetnik commander, an SOE mission under the command of Brigadier Charles Armstrong, ...\\"  Early life  Armstrong was born on 11 June 1897 and was educated at Cheltenham College. After attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he was commissioned into the East Surrey Regiment in April 1915. Seconded to Machine Gun Corps, he served in France from 1916 to 1918, where he was twice wounded and, in March 1918, made a prisoner of war. Repatriated in December 1918, he served in North Russia in 1919 and was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry. He was present in Mesopotamia 1920-21 and on the Indian North West Frontier 1930-31, serving much of his inter-war service with the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment in Egypt, Sudan, Hong Kong and India.  Second World War  In October 1939 Armstrong, now a major, went to France with the 1st Battalion East Surrey Regiment, before taking command of the 1/6th Battalion in April 1940 as a temporary lieutenant colonel. Evacuated from Dunkirk a month later, he remained in command of the 1/6th until April 1942. In October 1940 he received the Distinguished Service Order in recognition of his services in France. In April 1942 he was posted to command the 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion, and later 1st Battalion, the Duke of Wellington's Regiment which, in early 1943 he took to North Africa. = Mission to Chetniks = In July 1943 Armstrong was appointed Brigadier in command of the SOE sponsored Military Mission to the Chetniks, a Serbian nationalist and royalist force led by General Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, and one of the principal resistance movements in Axis occupied Yugoslavia.:\\"By comparison, Brigadier Charles Douglas Armstrong, selected to go to Mihailovich's headquarters, was a professional soldier with the distinguished soldier...\\" According to some sources, he was carefully selected for this mission because of his lack of political contacts or skill.:\\"Charles Armstrong, a real brigadier, sent to Mihailovic, was equally carefully selected for his lack of political skill or contacts.\\" Together with members of his mission, Armstrong parachuted into Yugoslavia at the end of September 1943. Before he was dispatched to Chetnik headquarters, a previous member of British mission with the Chetniks, Colonel Bailey, advised him that the Chetniks were angry and that Mihailoviƒá \\"won't hear of British anymore\\". The United Kingdom had provided substantial supplies to Yugoslav Communist forces who opposed the Chetniks, while the BBC repeatedly gave the Communist forces credit for the anti-Axis actions of Chetniks, especially during September and October 1943. For example, when Chetniks attacked the German garrison in Prijepolje on 11 September, killed 200 German soldiers and captured the town, the BBC credited Tito's Communist Partisans with the victory.  Witness to Chetnik anti-Axis actions, credited to Partisans by BBC  Less than a week after Armstrong arrived at Chetnik headquarters he, Albert Seitz, head of the USA Mission with the Chetniks, and Hudson saw a successful Chetnik attack on Vi≈°egrad and the destruction of the railway bridge across Drina. Armstrong and Seitz took part in the Chetnik action against Axis controlled units protecting the railway bridge over Drina in Vi≈°egrad. At the beginning of October 1943, based on Armstrong's instructions, Mihailoviƒá and his Chetniks organized an attack on Vi≈°egrad and during the battle captured the town and destroyed the railway bridge across the river Drina on the Sarajevo-U≈æice railway. This bridge was the longest bridge in Axis occupied Yugoslavia destroyed by rebel guerillas. In this attack about 2,500 Chetniks killed about 350 Usta≈°e and German soldiers and captured a lot of ammunition and arms. Before the Chetniks stormed into Vi≈°egrad, they first destroyed four smaller bridges in Mokra Gora. The bridge in Vi≈°egrad was destroyed with help of British sappers commanded by British Major Archie Jack. British media, including the BBC, credited Yugoslav Communist Partisans for this successful action by the Chetniks. In spite of protests, including from Kenneth Pickthorn and officials of the Yugoslav government in exile in London, the BBC did not make any corrections. After the capture of Vi≈°egrad, the Chetniks also captured Rogatica on 14 and 15 October and killed more than 200 Axis soldiers. The BBC again credited Communist forces with this success.:\\"Once more, the Partisans were credited with the attack.\\" In November 1943 the Chetniks attacked Axis positions at Nova Varo≈° and Kalna, and both actions were again attributed to Communists by the BBC.:\\"These actions, too, were credited to the Partisans by the BBC.\\" Archival evidence, published in 1980 for the first time, confirms that some actions against Axis carried by Mihailoviƒá and his Chetniks with Armstrong were mistakenly credited to Tito and his Communist forces. Armstrong sent an angry protest to the BBC insisting on the publication of correct information, to no avail. Mihailoviƒá was enraged.:\\"Partisans occupied Visegrad and their Radio Free Yugoslavia announced to the world that the entire operation had been Tito's. The BBC parroted 24 this claim. Mihailovic was enraged at London's niggardly support and resentful of BBC Serbian-language broadcasts which portrayed Tito ....\\" Some authors blame the persistent misreporting of BBC and attribution of successful Chetnik anti-Axis actions to Communists on a supposed strong network of Soviet spies in the BBC and the British Ministry of Information. This misreporting changed British public opinion and even influenced some high-ranking officials. But Churchill's reason was the evidence of Ultra decrypts from the Government Code and Cipher School in Bletchley Park (which he read; they were secret until the 1970s) that Tito's Partisans were a \\"much more effective and reliable ally in the war against Germany\\"; see Yugoslavia and the Allies.  Tensions between American and British mission  Almost as soon as he reached Chetnik headquarters, the relation of British mission toward Mihailovic significantly deteriorated and tensions between American and British mission began to develop, with Armstrong seen as blatantly anti- OSS.:\\"Armstrong was blatantly anti-OSS\\"  Chetniks ignore Armstrong's orders to destroy bridges  Armstrong inherited his predecessor‚Äôs (Colonel Bailey) task to convince Mihailovic to increase his anti-Axis activities without providing him with adequate supplies. Armstrong and Albert Seitz, who headed the American Mission with the Chetniks, took part in the Chetnik action against Axis controlled units protecting the railway bridge over Drina in Vi≈°egrad.:\\"Demolished Railway Bridge near Visegrad in Bosnia. Col. Albert Seitz, the chief of American Mission and General (sic) Charles Armstrong, the chief of British Mission SOE took part in the action.\\" Armstrong confirmed that Colonel Bailey insisted that Chetniks should not disarm Italians in the valley of river Lim and to avoid conflict with Partisans with final consequence that the Chetniks were forced to leave this valley.:\\"–î–∞ —ò–µ –ø—É–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –ë–µ—ò–ª–∏ —Å–ø—Ä–µ—á–∞–≤–∞–æ —á–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–µ –¥–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–æ—Ä—É–∂–∞–≤–∞—ò—É –ò—Ç–∞–ª –∏—ò–∞–Ω–µ, –ø–æ—Ç–≤—Ä–¥–∏–æ —ò–µ –∏ –ë—Ä–∏–≥–∞–¥–∏—Ä –ß–∞—Ä–ª—Å –ê—Ä–º—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–≥: ,,–ú–æ—Ä–∞.–º –∏–∑—ò–∞–≤–∏—Ç–∏ –¥–∞ —ò–µ ...\\" Until December 1943 the British army delivered only 30 tons of arms to Chetniks and 18,000 tons to the Communist Partisans, who used many British arms to attack Chetniks. Armstrong refused to participate in the Ba Congress held between 25 and 28 January 1944 because he was dissatisfied with the refusal of the Chetniks to follow British requests to perform two sabotages against the Germans.: \\" ... —á–µ—Ç–Ω–∏—á–∫–æ—ò –í—Ä—Ö–æ–≤–Ω–æ—ò –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥–∏ –±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –±—Ä–∏–≥–∞–¥–∏—Ä –ê—Ä–º—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–≥ –æ–¥–±–∏–æ –¥–∞ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Å—Ç–≤—É—ò–µ –∫–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å—É –∑–±–æ–≥ –Ω–µ–∏–∑–≤—Ä—à–µ—ö–∞ –∑–∞–¥–∞—Ç–∞–∫–∞ –∫–æ—ò–µ —Å—É ... \\" Armstrong insisted that Chetniks should destroy bridges over river Morava and river Ibar near Ra≈°ka as condition for his participation at the Congress. Leaving Yugoslavia, Armstrong returned to England and, in June 1944, took command of the British Airborne Liaison Unit to the Polish Parachute Brigade. He remained in the UK for the remainder of the war.  1945 and after  In January 1945 Armstrong was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his war services. In August 1945, now a substantive Lieutenant Colonel, he took command of the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment in Austria, returning to England in November 1946 to command a prisoner of war camp for Germans. He retired in December 1948 with the honorary rank of Brigadier. In retirement he lived in Camberley, Surrey and was a member of the Special Forces Club. He died on 11 December 1985, at the age of 88. There is a memorial plaque to Armstrong in the East Surrey Regiment Chapel in All Saints Church, Kingston upon Thames.

Originating from the Akhal region, the young Ovezmurat led armed raids (alaman) into the Persian provinces of Khorasan and Mazendaran. According to some reports, he was captured by the Shah's forces and held captive in Bojnurd prison in northeastern Iran. According to others, he was the commander of an armed detachment of Tekke tribesemen on behalf of the Khan of Kokand. In the 1860s and 1870s, he took an active part in the military- political consolidation of the Tekin clans and the final consolidation of the Tekin hegemony in the Akhal and Merv oases in southern Turkmenistan. After the death of Nurberdy Khan, the chief leader of Akhal, Overzmurat emerged as a key organizer of the armed resistance against the Turkmenistan expeditions of Generals Nikolai Lomakin and Mikhail Skobelev. In 1879, on behalf of the Tekin forces, he entered into negotiations with the advancing Russian troops and offered himself as a voluntary hostage. During his stay at the Russian camp, he studied the military organization, armament and deployment of enemy forces.

Design and development Alexandr Alekseyevich Lazerev, who led the Kharkiv KhAI-3 Avianvito design team, already knew some of the problems posed by tailless aircraft. He was on the team which designed the almost uncontrollable KhAI-4 two years before (the Institute's designs did not always appear in their numerical order). That aircraft made only three flights before being grounded as dangerous. The much larger KhAI-3 was intended to show that low-powered aircraft could carry a useful eleven-passenger load with an engine producing just over . It was a tailless aircraft with a broad-chord wing and with a tractor engine, fin and rudder all on the centreline. Though there were initial thoughts of mounting the KhAI-3's Shvetsov M-11 five cylinder radial engine on a pylon over the wing, it was finally placed ahead of the leading edge on steel tubes from the front wing spar and fed from four tanks in the central wing. There was a long, six seat cabin on either side of the centreline with the pilot in the forward portside seat. The large, triangular fin mounted a broad, round-topped rudder. Its central wing panel was rectangular in plan, with a steel tube structure including four spars and dural skinning. It had a chord of and a chord/thickness ratio of 14%. The outer panels, 82% of the span, were all-wood structures with dihedral and sweep on the leading edge only, giving an overall sweep of 16¬∞ at quarter- chord;. They decreased in thickness outwards from 14% to 7%, with 8¬∞ washout. Each wing carried three control surfaces. Near each tip, close behind and parallel to the leading edge there was a large, rectangular plan interceptor. These were operated differentially by pedals which also controlled the rudder and were used to make flat turns. Inboard of the interceptors, each outer panel trailing edge carried two broad-chord control surfaces that acted as both ailerons and elevators. The Kharkiv KhAI-3 had a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. Its forward-mounted engine and propeller allowed a short tailwheel to provide a ground angle of attack of 15¬∞, avoiding one of the problems encountered with the KhAI-4. Operational history The first flight was made on 14 September 1936. On this occasion the front seats of both cabins were equipped with dual controls; the pilots were V. A. Borodin and E. I. Schwartz. During this and subsequent flights, controlled turns proved difficult however the various control surfaces were combined. A long development programme yielded significant improvements. The 1937 Aviavnito-8 was a proposed but unflown development with the same passenger capacity, dimensions and engine.

It was first described to science by Alcide d'Orbigny in 1846. It seems likely that the species is named for Lovell Augustus Reeve, an eminent conchologist of the day who was mentioned in d'Orbigny's original description of the species.  Description  The shell is white, and in life is covered by a green-brown \\"skin\\" or periostracum. The periostracum is not smooth, but frayed or hairy, thus the genus name Barbatia, or bearded. The shell is generally boat-shaped, as are all the clams in the Ark family, but this species often attaches itself between rocks so that as it grows the shell can be deformed by its surroundings. Cross-hatched ridges resembling a net, or reticulation, cover the surface of the shell. Sometimes this reticulation is worn away by friction with nearby rocks, and the shell can be smooth. There is a large gape between the valves along the bottom, ventral, side of the shell through which the byssus anchors the animal to a rocky substrate. Barbatia reeveana may be 82mm long, 45mm high, and 29mm deep.  Distribution  Barbatia reeveana is found on rocky bottoms from the intertidal zone to 100 meters (330 feet) deep. It may be found from in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California Sur, Mexico to Peru and west to the Galapagos islands, as well as in the Gulf of California.  Life history  Individuals in this species are typically either male or female, with some small portion protandrous hermaphrodites, maturing as males and later in life reproducing as females. They reproduce by broadcast spawning, with individuals releasing eggs and sperm into the water to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs develop into free-swimming larva, These develop into planktonic veligers, which feed on tiny phytoplankton. In the presence of appropriate chemical cues, a veliger will settle to the bottom, attach itself to a rocky substrate and become a juvenile.

Life Wielant was born in Ghent, the son of Jean Wielant, lord of Bavikhove, and Catherine de la Kethulle. His father, who died in Ghent on 1 July 1473, had served Philip the Good as secretary and was in 1463 appointed to the Council of Flanders. Wielant graduated Licentiate of Laws from the University of Leuven on 5 December 1464. In 1473 he too was appointed to the Council of Flanders. On 16 November 1473 he married Joanna van Halewijn, daughter of the president of the Council of Holland. Wielant was one of the first members to be appointed to the Great Council of Mechelen when it was established at the end of 1473. On 19 March 1474 he was entrusted with an enquiry into ducal rights. When the Great Council was suppressed under the Great Privilege on 11 February 1477 Wielant lost his position, but on 26 March Mary of Burgundy appointed him councillor and master of requests of her household. In 1478, he was appointed mayor of the Liberty of Bruges (an area of countryside outside Bruges with city rights), and in 1480 receiver general. He was a supporter of Mary of Burgundy's husband, Maximilian of Austria, until Mary's death in 1482, when he opposed Maximilian's attempt to rule alone on behalf of their infant son Philip the Handsome. On 10 January 1483 Wielant was appointed to the regency council. On 14 September, Maximilian declared the regency council abolished, and on 14 October Wielant was among those arrested by gens d'armes in the service of Lancelot de Berlaimont and imprisoned at his castle near Maubeuge. Maximilian later denied having given orders for their arrest. Berlaymont was murdered on 2 February 1484 by the men of Philip of Cleves, but Wielant remained imprisoned. In May 1484 those who had supported rule by a regency council rather than by the young duke's father were reconciled to Maximilian, and Wielant was released. He represented the Liberty of Bruges at the meeting of the Estates General in Dendermonde in June 1484. On 28 February 1486 Wielant was again imprisoned, this time on the orders of Engelbert of Nassau, whom Maximilian had left in charge of his military forces in the Low Countries when he returned to Germany to seek election as King of the Romans. Wielant was transported to Heusden Castle, in the Duchy of Brabant, and held there until 1 September. In May 1488, the newly re- established regency council appointed Wielant president of the Council of Flanders. On 28 October 1488, Maximilian responded by relieving him of his title as councillor and master of requests of the household, for \\"taking party against us and adhering to our rebel subjects in Flanders\\". Wielant in fact worked to find a compromise between the cities of Flanders and Maximilian, and was involved in the negotiations that led to the Peace of Cadzand on 19 July 1492. On 8 August Maximilian readmitted him to his position at court, and on 6 November reappointed him to the Council of Flanders.

It is the first cannabis restaurant in the United States and opened on October 1, 2019, founded by 11 partners and investors including Houston Hospitality. The cafe has a flower menu and farm-to-table cuisine that is \\"designed to enhance the cannabis experience.\\" Budtenders, also known as \\"flower hosts\\", are available to give suggestions on which strains of cannabis pair best with each meal and will roll a joint for the patrons at the table. Background Although the Adult Use of Marijuana Act legalized cannabis in California, the proposition prohibited the use of cannabis in public places, in addition to hotels, rentals and vehicles. The West Hollywood City Council determined in 2017 that access to \\"safe spaces\\" for consuming cannabis was a social equity issue and also decided to allow places for cannabis tourists. City ordinances restrict public consumption. In May 2018, the West Hollywood City Council opened up applications for 16 onsite cannabis consumption licenses, split into two categories; eight licenses for smoking, vaping, edibles and eight licenses for edibles only. It received more than 300 applicants who were critiqued on categories such as innovation and social equity. During the application process, Lowell Herb Co submitted an idea for \\"Flore Flora\\", a restaurant and lounge hybrid. =Licensing and restrictions= In July 2019, the West Hollywood Business License Commission had approved a cannabis consumption license to \\"Lowell Farms: A Cannabis Cafe,\\" which became the first cannabis caf√© in the United States. The restaurant is 21+ and does not serve alcoholic beverages. It cannot serve cannabis-infused foods until approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but does have pre-packaged edible cannabis available as well as other cannabis products. All items purchased at the cafe must be consumed onsite except for food. The restaurant changed its name to Original Cannabis Cafe in December 2019, also receiving \\"Surprise of the Year\\" from Eater Los Angeles' end of year awards.LA‚Äôs 2019 Eater Award Winners December 10, 2019 Menu and design Andrea Drummer is the restaurant's chef and has stated that the menu is \\"designed to complement the actual cannabis that will be consumed\\". Original Cannabis Cafe has farm-to-table cuisine that budtenders can pair with farm-to-table cannabis to roll joints at the table. The opening menu includes entr√©es such as \\"grilled peaches and burrata, a fried chicken sandwich and white bean hummus with crudit√©s\\" with desserts such as \\"peanut butter cookies, sweet potato beignets and cr√®me br√ªl√©e.\\" The cafe partnered with community activist Renee Nahum to develop a \\"concept that would be a first-class representation of the ethos and social consciousness in the community of West Hollywood.\\" Its tilework was imported from Spain and Morocco.

From 1958, production of this type was relocated to MoAZ as part of the specialization of the Soviet automobile industry and continued there until 1973 under the name MoAZ-529. Background Prior to 1955 American models of heavy uniaxial tractors had been introduced to the Soviet Union. For example, from 1955 on there were tests with these very vehicles in order to examine them for their possible applications. In 1956 the first indigenous prototype of such a tractor was built at MAZ. This too was extensively tested, with the goal of universal applicability. Trailers were built and tested in the form of scrapers, cement mixers, simple flatbeds and even an artificial ice rink. After completing the tests, MAZ quickly started series production of the machines. Even in 1956, the Soviet automobile industry was already so specialized that the complete train was no longer manufactured by MAZ. Only the tractor was made in Minsk, the trailer (in the standard production version a scraper) was already built at MoAZ. Since the tractor is not able to drive on its own without a trailer, a much smaller support wheel was mounted at the front to prevent the vehicle tipping over. Before normal operation, this jockey wheel was removed. These vehicles should not be confused with single axle tractors, even if they also have only one axis and are used as a tractor for attachments. A special feature of the vehicle is that no suspension was installed. Only the big tires are used for damping. In 1965 the improved MAZ-529E was built at MoAZ. It had an increased output of and was also manufactured until 1969, before being replaced by the MoAZ-546P. Production of the MoAZ-529 continued until 1973.

In 1999, Small moved to the University of Chicago as associate professor in the departments of Neurology and Psychology and became the co-founder and co-director of the Brain Imaging Research Center, becoming full professor in 2005. In 2007, he became Senior Fellow of the Computation Institute and in 2008, Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Neurology. Small left the University of Chicago in 2010 and retains professor emeritus status. From 2010 to 2017, he was Professor and Chair of the Department of Neurology at the University of California, Irvine, while directing the university's Neuroscience Imaging Center (2012‚Äì2016). He retained holding appointments in the departments of Cognitive Sciences and Neurobiology and Behavior until 2019. In 2017, Small left his position as Chair of Neurology to found and develop the university's Medical Innovation Institute as its Chief Scientific Officer. In spring 2019, Small was appointed dean of the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. He lives in Dallas, Texas, with his wife Ana Solodkin, who is a full professor in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences at the same university.  Academic work  Small's research specialization encompasses various fields including the neurobiology of language, neurobiology of sports, brain connectivity, computational neuroscience, aphasia, and brain recovery and repair after stroke and traumatic brain injury. Methods that he uses to investigate research questions include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neural networks, machine learning, and human neurophysiology. Small was a pioneer in using magnetic resonance imaging to understand how the brain gives rise to the complex phenomenon of thought, and has consistently been positioned at the forefront of the study of the neurobiology of language. His work emphasizes the importance of the implementation level of neuroscientist David Marr‚Äôs information processing levels of analysis, reflecting his complementary training as a computer scientist and a neurologist. Small‚Äôs work has spanned the basic science of mechanisms of language understanding to the application of the science to new advances in therapy. His basic conceptual framework views language as a higher-level function superimposed across multiple systems over the phylogenetic history of the human species, including motor and attention systems. This work demonstrates that the ‚Äúlanguage network‚Äù is not a static entity, but dynamically assembles necessary brain mechanisms to meet the challenges of language processing. His collaborative research provides evidence for motor system contributions to basic mechanisms of face-to-face communication for the decoding of acoustic-phonetic information and gesture, which correspond to homuncular activation patterns on premotor cortex. While Small's work indicates that the motor system mediates perception and understanding of language, it also finds different functional anatomy for visually observing actions/objects compared to processing sentences describing actions/objects, providing evidence against the strongest version of the simulation theory for processing action-related language. Small's work also indicates that attention to space, time, or action in identical stories modulates activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Related work indicates that differential exogenous processing demands in discourse comprehension affect the nature of endogenous \\"resting state\\" networks dependent on the preceding task. In addition to his contributions to understanding the healthy brain, Small investigates the connection between brain and behavior in post- stroke aphasia, early focal brain injury, and concussion.  Honors  In 2014, he was an invited presenter for the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. In 2018, he received the Society for the Neurobiology of Language's first Distinguished Career Award during the 10th annual meeting. In 2009, along with Pascale Tremblay (Associate Professor of Rehabilitation, Universit√© Laval), he organized the first international meeting on the Neurobiology of Language. The success of the conference led to continuing the conference on an annual basis and the founding of the Society for the Neurobiology of Language as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable corporation in the State of Illinois. Small was Editor in Chief of the international scholarly journal Brain and Language from 2005 to 2019. In 2019, he launched with nd co-editor in chief Kate Watkins (Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience, University of Oxford) the journal, Neurobiology of Language (MIT Press), sponsored by the Society for the Neurobiology of Language. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Neurological Association, and one of the founders of the Society for Neurobiology of Language.

A focal point was Matthew Quay, the local Republican senator. Sullivan alleged that Pennsylvania was \\"politically the most corrupt state in the union\\" and Philadelphia \\"the most evil large city in America\\". The article triggered a widespread debate about honesty in politics and the role of the press.Steven L. Piott, \\"The Right of the Cartoonist; Samuel Pennypacker and Freedom of the Press\\", Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies, 55(2), April 1988, 78‚Äì91. He briefly practiced law in New York City (he said his law career was \\"as brief as it was briefless\\"), then returned to journalism. After writing for the Ladies Home Journal about misleading advertising for patent medicines, he was hired in 1905 by McClure's as a staff writer. In 1906, along with Willa Cather, Georgine Milmine, Will Irwin, and Burton J. Hendrick, he became part of the McClure's team that produced a series of 14 investigative articles on Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science church.\\"Editorial announcement\\", McClure's, December 1906; Georgine Milmine, \\"Mary Baker G.

Wilson, McClure's Magazine and the Muckrakers, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015, 303. The series was published as a book in 1909, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science.Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine, The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993 [1909]. After McClure's, he moved to Collier's Weekly, where he became an associate editor, then editor in 1912. He also wrote a regular column, \\"Comment on Congress\\", from 1908 until 1919. When he joined the New York Evening Post in 1919 as its Washington correspondent, the newspaper's president, Edwin F. Gay, wrote: \\"His ability, his vision, his knowledge of human reactions and twenty years of Political study are coupled with unquestionable sincerity, plus 100 percent of rugged Americanism.\\"Edwin F. Gay, \\"Whose hat will cover a president?\\", New York Herald, January 23, 1920. While living in Washington, on Wyoming Avenue, he and his wife became friends with Herbert Hoover, who lived nearby on S Street; the close relationship continued when Hoover became president in 1929, to the point where Sullivan was viewed as one of Hoover's spokespersons. Describing feelings in the midwest, he wrote in 1928: \\"I don't like Prohibition, but I'm going to vote for Hoover because I'd rather eat than drink.\\"\\"National Affairs: Slogan\\", Time magazine, August 27, 1928. =New York Herald-Tribune= Sullivan's daughter, Narcissa Sullivan (then Narcissa McGee), in 1937 In the early 1920s Sullivan joined the New York Herald (later named the New York Herald-Tribune) and became a syndicated political columnist. Between 1924 and 1952 he wrote nearly 6,000 columns, usually \\"Mark Sullivan Says\\", for the Herald-Tribune and others. During the same period, he wrote his six-volume Our Times: The United States, 1900‚Äì1925 (1926‚Äì1935). Dan Rather, who edited the material to produce one volume, wrote in 1996 that \\"no series of nonfiction books, all on the same general subject by the same author over such a compact space of writing time, ever captured the country so completely, sold so well, was so widely read and acclaimed, and had such a lasting, growing reputation for excellence\\".Dan Rather, \\"Our Times ... And Mine, American Heritage, May/June 1996. Sullivan said in 1935 that he was a liberal (\\"Teddy Roosevelt was my only political god\\") and that consistent with liberalism he sought to \\"take power away from the state\\". Michael Hiltzik described him in 2011 as a progressive who \\"moved steadily rightward\\". By 1935 his view of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal was \\"frankly apocalyptic\\", in Hiltzik's view.Michael Hiltzik, The New Deal: A Modern History, New York: Simon and Schuster, 2011, 340‚Äì341. In 1937, after the Social Security Act was signed into law, he made his secretary of 17 years, Mabel Shea, famous by asking why she should be forced to pay 35 cents social security out of her weekly paycheck of $35 (equivalent to $ in ). This led Time magazine to publish that Sullivan had an annual income of $23,417 (over $408,000 in 2018).\\"Poor Miss Shea Springs a Fast One\\", The Des Moines Register, November 21, 1937, 2, reprinted from Time magazine.

Originally built as a dance hall, the building opened in 1939 as a Works Progress Administration project. Bee architect Vladimir Sobotka designed the twelve-sided building, which incorporates Moderne features. The building is a defining landmark for Bee and is on the National Register of Historic Places. History Work on the ballroom began in 1938 using funds from the Works Progress Administration. By the following year, the building was ready to open, although its interior was not finished. Its grand opening in May 1939 sold 2000 tickets, ten times Bee's population, and earned the village enough money to complete the interior. After construction was officially complete, the village dedicated the building in 1940. Nebraska Governor Robert LeRoy Cochran and other public figures spoke at the dedication ceremony, which also featured a baseball game, concerts, and a dance in the finished ballroom. While it was only meant to be a ballroom at first, the building soon became host to a great variety of public events in Bee. Concerts, plays, weddings, and estate sales have all been held in the building. The local junior high school plays its basketball games in the ballroom; its dome-like appearance has led opposing teams to call it the Bee Astrodome. In keeping with its original purpose, the village also holds an annual barn dance in the ballroom. Due to its unusual shape and local importance for the small village, the ballroom has become a defining landmark for Bee. The ballroom was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 14, 1981. The ballroom is featured in Jon Bois' multimedia fictional work 17776. After randomly picking the region on a globe and discovering the story of the ballroom's construction, Bois added it to prove \\"that you can't go far in this world without running into a story.\\" Design Architect Vladimir Sobotka, a Bee resident, designed and built the ballroom. Sobotka's design for the building was a vernacular plan that incorporated Moderne elements. The building is twelve-sided with concrete walls and a domed roof. As it was originally meant to primarily host ballroom dances, the building's many sides allowed for a wooden dance floor on which dancers could always follow the wood's grain. The ballroom's concrete exterior is inlaid with patterns of horizontal and vertical lines, giving the building its Moderne appearance without extensive formal styling. Upon his retirement in 1981, Sobotka called the building his \\"pride and joy.\\" References External links *Village of Bee - Bee States Ballroom Category:National Register of Historic Places in Seward County, Nebraska Category:Moderne architecture in the United States Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1939 Category:Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in Nebraska ","title":"States Ballroom"},{"id":"61780539","title":"2019‚Äì20 New Hampshire Wildcats men's basketball team"},{"id":"61780544","text":"Vincent Norman \\"Mick\\" Raymer (4 May 1918 ‚Äì 31 October 2006) was a cricketer who played first-class cricket for Queensland from 1940 to 1956.

It stands on the west side of the Lledr Valley, ENE of Dolwyddelan.  History  = Early years = The quarry opened around 1820, and was originally an open pit. The quarry was expanded in the 1840s. The road from Betws-y-Coed to Dolwyddelan was re-routed in 1846 to allow construction of a new quarry mill and Prince Llewelyn Terrace to house quarry workers. The new mill contained four horizontal sandsaws driven by a steam engine, which was later replaced with a waterwheel. An incline led down from the pit to the mill level. = Chwarel Fedw = In 1873, the quarry was owned by John Jones and employed about 40 men. The quarry was worked in conjunction with Chwarel Fedw on the east side of the valley. A tramway was built across the Afon Lledr to connect the two quarries and slate from Chwarel Fedw was taken across to the second mill for processing. = Expansion, decline and recovery = In 1877, 120 men were employed at Prince Llewellyn and the owner, George Raynes was looking to expand, and he purchased the Bwlch Gordduant quarry from Owen Gethin Jones. 1878 saw a collapse in the slate market and nearly all of the workers at Prince Llewwllyn were laid off in December of that year. Chwarel Fedw had closed and the tramway had been lifted by 1887. In 1882, the quarry employed 74 workers and produced 1685 tons of finished slate under the ownership of George de Wolfe and Fisher Jones. In the 1890s, a second mill was added, driven by a water turbine. This larger structure contain six sandsaws, six slate dressing machines and three planers. There was some underground working in later years. In August 1896, there was a serious accident at the quarry. Mill worker Thomas Morris was pulled into one of the slate working machines when his clothes got caught in the drive strap. His legs were crushed. He died of his injuries, and the quarry company was fined ¬£7 16s (equivalent of ¬£ in 2018). = Decline, closure and final attempts = 1898 was the peak of production in the Welsh slate industry. After the turn of the century, the Great Strike at Penrhyn gave smaller quarries a boost, but once the strike ended in late 1903, the rest of the industry suffered. Prince Llewellyn, struggled. In 1907, the company was sued by R.O. Jones & Davies, their solicitors. The company did not appear at Llanrwst County Court and a judgement of ¬£28 0s 4d (equivalent of ¬£ in 2018) was made against them. In 1909, the company was back in court after it failed to pay wages owed to its workers, and in December it was ordered to make good the missing money. It declared bankruptcy less than 11 months later in 1910. Despite this, limited work continued at the quarry, but it closed in 1917 following the outbreak of the First World War. Prince Llewellyn re-opened after the war and operated until 1934, and is thought to be the last mill to have used sandsaws in the Welsh slate industry. = After closure = In 2015, the quarry gained notoriety when David Craig Ellis killed Alec Warburton and dumped his body into the flooded pit of the quarry. Ellis was convicted of murder in 2016 and sentenced to 26 years in prison.  Geology  Extract of the 1899 Ordnance Survey map, showing Prince Llewellyn and Chwarel Fedw quarries The quarry worked slate from the Nod Glas Formation which outcrops along the Conwy Valley. Through most of its length, the Nod Glas is black shale, but in the area around Dolwyddelan a syncline compressed the shales and it developed enough cleavage to be worked as slate.

The vessel made several trips to Europe during the first two years of her career before being laid up in mid-1921 and eventually being broken up for scrap in 1930. Design and construction After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons deadweight designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB. Yaklok was part of the order for ten vessels placed by USSB with Seattle North Pacific Shipbuilding Co. on 5 November 1917 and was laid down on 3 July 1918 and launched on 31 October 1918 (yard number 2), with Miss Grace East, a timekeeper working for the shipbuilder, being the sponsor. Due to the epidemic of influenza, the launching was only attended by the press and shipbuilder employees to prevent the spread of the disease. The ship had two main decks as well as forecastle and poop deck and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The freighter had four main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five large hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. She was also equipped with wireless apparatus, had submarine signal system installed and had electrical lights installed along the decks. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Yaklok was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,516. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single 2,800 shp steam turbine, double-reduction geared to a single screw propeller that moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three Foster Water Tubes fitted for both coal and oil fuel. The sea trials were held on 16/17 July 1919 during which the steamer performed satisfactorily and was handed over to the Shipping Board a few days after their completion. Operational history In June 1919 while the vessel was still under construction she was allocated to the Pacific Steamship Co. to transport a cargo of grain to Europe on behalf of the U.S. Grain Corporation. Following delivery to her operator, Yaklok sailed from Seattle and arrived at Portland on 3 August 1919 to take on board one of the last remaining loads of 1918 wheat crop. She departed Portland a week later bound for New York via Astoria carrying 283,804 bushels of wheat and after uneventful voyage reached Newport News on September 11. Following an established USSB policy the Shipping Board ship could only continue with cargo to Europe if an equivalent amount of cargo space would be allocated by a foreign shipping operator, otherwise the cargo had to be unloaded in one of Atlantic coast ports to be transhipped to Europe by a foreign vessel. After spending two weeks in Newport News Yaklok was given green light to proceed to Europe and left the Virginia port on October 2 bound for Naples. On October 9 Yaklok while approximately east of New York and about south of Cape Sable, became disabled after her boiler tubes had blown, and was forced to send a distress call asking for help. The call was received by a nearby ship SS Anacortes who was about 70 miles away. On hearing the news, the US Coast Guard also dispatched cutter from Portsmouth on the same day. The cutter was able to reach the disabled freighter at about 03:00 on October 10 and took her into tow. After 29 hours both vessels safely reached Boston where Yaklok was put into drydock for repairs. After her engine work was done the freighter left Boston on October 22 continuing her trip to Italy. After reaching her destination and disembarking her cargo, Yaklok departed Naples at the end of November and reached New York on December 17, thus successfully concluding her maiden voyage. Upon her return Yaklok was allocated to J. H. Winchester & Co. and sailed from New York on her second journey on 1 February 1920 bound for Dunkirk and Antwerp with a cargo of rye. On February 5, while roughly off Cape Sable, her high pressure turbine became disabled and she was again forced to send out a distress call requesting aid. She returned to New York on February 10 being towed by two tugs, Whiteash and W.F. Dalzell. Upon finishing her repairs the freighter departed New York ten days later and arrived at Antwerp on March 8. The steamer conducted two more trips during her short career. In May 1920 the ship departed from Baltimore for Genoa carrying 8,000 tons of coal. Upon her return, she sailed again in September of the same year loaded with a cargo of general merchandise and produce bound for Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. On her return trip she transported 7,960 tons of maize from South America to Bremen and Liverpool before finally returning to New York on 21 February 1921. The vessel remained berthed in New York harbor for the next four months before being officially laid up due to overabundance of tonnage and relocated to an anchorage off Prall's Island. The vessel was eventually sold for breaking together with fifty nine other vessels in July 1930 to the Union Shipbuilding Company of Baltimore with her price being set at 15,842. The ship was finally broken up in the 4th quarter of 1930.

This picture was shortly after published in Life magazine and became iconic of the √©puration sauvage (wild purge) enacted after the liberation of France and the severe punishment imposed on the French women accused of collaborationism with the German occupiers. History A week after the liberation of Paris, women deemed as collaborators of the Nazi regime, specially those who had been romantically or sexually involved with German men, were being punished in France with head shaving and were often paraded through the streets as a way of humiliation, before usually being sent to jail. The picture depicts one of these women, Simone Touseau, aged 23 years old, who had been a translator working for the Germans and was in a relation with a German soldier since 1941, and who bore him a daughter, still a baby when the event took place. She was also accused of denouncing neighbours, who ended up being deported, which she denied. The picture depicts her, carrying her daughter on her arms, after the humiliating head shaving had taken place and her forehead had been marked in red with an iron as a sign of collaborationism, while she is being paraded in the streets of Chartres, followed by a number of people, including women, children and policemen. Her father follows ahead, carrying a bag, while her mother, who also suffered the same punishment, is partially covered by him. She is being escorted home, from where she would go to jail.

Early life Sable was born on 13 September 1994 in Mandwa, Beed district, Maharashtra, into a family of farmers. From age six, he would run or walk the distance between home and school as there was no transport facility in his village. After completing 12th grade, he joined the 5 Mahar regiment of Indian Army, being posted at the Siachen Glacier in 2013‚Äì2014, deserts of north- western Rajasthan, followed by Sikkim from 2015. He first took part in inter- army cross country running in 2015 at the insistence of his colleagues, before switching to steeplechase under trainer Amrish Kumar. Sable, who was overweight, managed to lose in three months, before joining the national camp where he was trained by Nikolai Snesarev.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.The area. adjacent to the Beartown Wilderness, is proposed as an addition to the wilderness. The Forest Service classifies about 82 percent of the area as having high scenic integrity. It is easily accessed on a section of the Appalachian Trail, passing along a ridge with excellent views of Burkes Garden.. The area is part of the Garden Mountain Cluster. Location and access The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia east of Va 16, north of Beartown Wilderness and about 7 miles southeast of Tazewell, Virginia. The Appalachian Trail passes through the area for 4.7 miles. From Forest Road 222, it goes in a northerly direction to Chestnut Ridge, then follows the ridge along the northeast side of the area to reach the Chestnut Knob shelter on the northern side The Chestnut Knob shelter was a forest warden cabin before 1994 when the Forest Service and a group of volunteers converted it to a fully enclosed shelter. An intermittent water supply is 0.2 miles away. Vehicle access from the west is gained by taking Va 16 to Forest Road 222. Access from the north and east is gained from VA 42 at Ceres where VA 625 goes north to connect with Forest Road 222. Forest Road 222 passes along the southern boundary. Bear Hollow Road, VA 631, extends from Forest Road 222 for 1.7 miles. At this point the road is gated, but hikers can continue on the Roaring Fork Trail, Forest Trail 6504, for 2.3 miles crossing Beartown Wilderness Addition B into the Beartown Wilderness to reach Roaring Fork. The area has about 10 to 16 miles of abandoned logging roads and informal trails still passable because of illegal ATV use. These routes are busy with foot and ATV traffic, especially during hunting season. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The wildarea is covered by USGS topographic map Hutcheson Rock. Boundaries of the Beartown Wilderness Additions. Beartown Wilderness Addition B, as identified by the Wilderness Society, is on the right. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails in the vicinity are given on National Geographic Maps 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley, Trails Illustrated Hiking Maps, 787). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Natural history The area is part of the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Most of the vegetation is broadleaf. Yellow poplar, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple are found in colluvial drainages, toeslopes and along flood plains of small to medium-sized streams. White oak, northern red oak, and hickory dominate on the north and west, while chestnut oak, scarlet oak and yellow pine are found on the north and west. American TurkeyTurkey and bear are the featured species in the area. Wildlife populations are supported by the presence of two artificial waterholes. With time, the waterholes are gaining a natural appearance. Arthrophycus tracks can be found on gray sandstone along the Appalchain Trail. Looking like long, finger shaped branches, they are the remains of an ancient worm trail. The varied topography of the area includes a wide variety of ecological types with hot, dry, windswept ridges to cool, moist coves. Most of the area is in the Dry Mesic Oak ecological community type. The area contains about 307 acres of potential old growth forest. These acres include the community types Dry and Dry-Mesic Oak-Pine(4 acres), Dry Mesic Oak (266 acres) and Mixed and Western Mesophytic (37 acres). Topography The wildland is part of the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Ecosystem Section. Ridges, composed of sandstone and shale, run northeast/southwest, with parallel valleys created from limestone or shale. The area is on the south-eastern side of Chestnut Ridge. The lowest elevation of 2320 feet is found along the southern boundary, and the high elevation of 4400 feet is found at a point on Chestnut Knob on the Bland and Tazewell County line. The area includes the headwaters of several streams flowing into Lick Creek and Laurel Creek. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Beartown Wilderness Addition B was inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. Four special use permits authorize spring boxes and waterlines from Laurel Branch to private property with cabins near the boundary of the area. There is also a road use authorization for access to a private inholding. The top of Chestnut Ridge has grassy open areas that were excluded from the area so as to allow mowing by Applachian Trail maintaining clubs. With the decline in funding for Forest Service maintenance, the maintaining clubs are providing this service as their resources allow. The area has a history of illegal vehicle use, but much of it has been eliminated by law enforcement. The area, owned by the National Park Service as part of the Appalachian Trail corridor, is managed by the Forest Service under a Memorandum of Understanding. There are 671 acres of privately owned mineral rights in the area. The Forest Service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Much or the area is designated ‚ÄúBackcountry Nonmotorized‚Äù, with an area on the west prescribed as ‚ÄúBlack Bear Habitat‚Äù, and some inclusions of ‚ÄúOld Growth with Disturbance‚Äù. Cultural History The remains of an old homesite can be seen next to the Appalachian Trail on Chestnut Ridge. There is also a prehistoric site within the area.

The series revolves around Francisco, a young math teacher who must deal with the personal problems of his high school students. The series is considered one of the most watched productions of Colombian television, together with Padres e hijos. After its resounding success, in 2004, Pedro Dami√°n of Televisa produces a Mexican version of the series with the title of Clase 406. On 10 November 2016, it was confirmed that the series had been revived in a new sequel. Which consists of 73 episodes and premiered on 13 February 2017, and concluded on 2 June 2017. Due to the low ratings that the sequel had, it was canceled after 73 episodes aired. The main character of Francisco el matem√°tico, was played by 4 actors, initially starting with Luis Mesa as Francisco Restrepo, who was in the series from 1999 to 2000. Following him, Ricardo V√©lez assumed the leading role as Juan Francisco Reyes during the years 2001 and 2003. In 2004, due to the low rating of the series, it was canceled, but during that year the title was changed to Francisco el matem√°tico: Clase 2004, and the main character was played by Alejandro Mart√≠nez as Francisco Santamar√≠a. 13 years later after the series' cancellation, Carlos Torres resumed the character as Francisco Quintana in a new sequel.  Premise  Luis Mesa played Francisco Restrepo during the years 1999 to 2000. The story focuses on a district educational institution located in the south of Bogota, where Francisco Restrepo (Luis Mesa) is hired to be a ninth grade math teacher. His work environment was shared among outstanding students, extroverts and rebels. In addition to delving into the teacher's private situations, the series also focused on some students such as Gabriela (Diana √Ångel), Magdalena (Ver√≥nica Orozco), Elkin (Manuel Jos√© Ch√°vez), Carlos (√ìscar Mauricio Rodr√≠guez), Marcela (Lina Mar√≠a Luna), Fernando (Jorge Monterrosa), Jhonatan (Jacques Toukhmanian), among others. For Francisco, teaching in a district school became complicated due to the rebel attitudes of some students, which in some cases ended in fights. His integral character in his work as a teacher, made him a conciliator of conflicts, so that over time he would become friends with these students. Inside the school, he met his co- worker named Adriana (Alejandra Borrero) with whom they would make a friendship that would last until Francisco Restrepo left the series. The series focused on the personal life of a student named Gabriela, who was characterized by being intelligent, prominent and leading her group. A fact would change his life, at the beginning of the series was violated by a Physical Education teacher named Dago (Mario Duarte). After this fact, he decided to have his son at an age as hard as 14 years. His life as a student and mother was gradually assimilating, until she graduated from high school and continued his studies of social communication. Initially, it began as a miniseries of 10 chapters aired every week on Saturdays, produced in an agreement between RCN Televisi√≥n and the Institute of Education of Bogota; but due to the success, it was decided to increase to 20 chapters, to later become in the year 2000 a series of daily broadcast. Each season of the series was equivalent to one academic school year, that is, between 1999 and 2001 the series was developed whose students were in ninth grade of Secondary Basic Education, tenth and eleventh grade of Vocational Middle Education. When the promotion of students of the 2001 season came out, the 2002 season was divided between: Gabriela's friends who were in eleventh grade, Gabriela's life in the university, the life in the army of Jhon Mario, Carlos and Fercho who lent mandatory military service, and other friends of Gabriela who were undecided with their lives after school. Unknown that the series was going to last several more seasons, its main actor Luis Mesa left the series in 2000 to work in other productions, and was replaced by actor Ricardo V√©lez under the name of Juan Francisco Reyes. The producers decided to maintain the original essence of an integral professor, except that he taught Spanish and literature classes, and this was not an impediment for the series to continue calling himself Francisco el matem√°tico. After the departure of Ricardo V√©lez who ran with the same fate as his predecessor, the last actor to replace him until the end was Alejandro Mart√≠nez with the name of Francisco Santamar√≠a. In addition to unwanted pregnancies, Francisco el matem√°tico touched on issues closely linked to today's youth such as: intrafamily violence, drug addiction, alcoholism, couple conflicts, prostitution and school dropout, issues that today continue to occupy the first plans of The media of the country. The intention of the series was to awaken and raise awareness about the most common problems of Colombian youth, so that new generations understand these situations and can travel the right path in their personal lives. In 2004, the sixth season was aired, although it was not very successful and they decided to cancel the series.

Divisions in the congregation over slavery soon split the congregation, with the Northern faction splitting off at Christmas Eve 1863 to form their own church. Attendance at the chapel slowly declined, with the last resident pastor leaving in 1895. Although services continued sporadically, the building fell into disrepair and, in 1929, the chapel was donated to the County of Solano. With the onset of the Great Depression that year, restoration did not occur for another decade, with the WPA finally accomplishing a full renovation in the Spring of 1940. Declared a State Historical Landmark in October 1962, the chapel continues in use today (2019), serving as the sanctuary for the local Church of Christ congregation and also hosting weddings and funerals. Origins In the early 1850s, the Suisun Valley had become a popular local site for camp meetings, outdoor revival gatherings that lasted up to two weeks, by the Methodist Episcopal Church. Entire families camped out (hence \\"camp meeting\\") for the whole time, often bringing their cow for fresh milk.Legends, myths a part of Rockville Retrieved October 5, 2019A Short History of the Rockville Stone Chapel Retrieved October 5, 2019The Alfords, Barbours and Rockville stone chapel Retrieved October 5, 2019Rockville Stone Chapel a pioneer-day building that‚Äôs still used Retrieved October 5, 2019 At the meeting in 1855, building of a permanent structure was proposed by the county's presiding Elder, the Reverend Bailey, and $5,000 was raised. Land for the chapel and an adjoining cemetery was donated by local resident Landy Alford. He, with his wife their two daughters and a son-in-law, had come West in 1846. They were part of a large group of emigrants which also included the ill-fated Donner Party. Alford's son-in-law Nathan Barbour was one of those who helped rescue the remnants of the Donner Party the following spring. Alford and Barbour also served in the Bear Flag Revolt.Rockville Grew into Crossroads for Early Routes Retrieved October 5, 2019 Early History Construction of the chapel took place in the Fall of 1856. The stone, of volcanic ash and magnesium, was cut in the nearby hills. It has the interesting property of being soft and easy to cut but hardening soon after exposure to air. Most of the workers were volunteers, led by stonemasons Joel Price and George Whitely. The cornerstone was laid on October 3, 1856, with the Reverend Sylvester Woodbridge of Benicia presiding. Construction went quickly enough to allow Christmas services to be held in the chapel, with formal dedication following in February 1857. The first pastor was the Reverend Bailey; on the Sunday following the dedication the Reverend Robert Waterman spoke. Decline and Decay Soon after the chapel's founding, a fissure developed in the congregation, with the members splitting on the issue of slavery. At the Christmas Eve service of 1863, the Northern supporters left, and the remaining, Southern-aligned, parishioners placed a plaque on the chapel, still present today, reading: \\"M.D. Church South - 1858\\". After the Civil War ended, the membership slowly declined, with the last resident minister, Reverend B. J. Waugh, departing in 1895. Services continued sporadically in the years following. Over time the building deteriorated, with broken windows and a leaky roof. The leaks allowed rain to infiltrate the building and the floors rotted. One funeral, that of Charles Campbell, was held outside, as the participants were unable to trust that the chapel wouldn't collapse in aftershocks from the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. Restoration In 1929, the chapel was donated to the County of Solano as a pioneer memorial, with the provisos that it be maintained, that it not be used for secular purposes, and that the plaque place on it in 1863 be preserved. Violation of any one of these provisos would result in reversion of the property to the ME Church. The intervention of the Great Depression meant that no work was done on preservation/renovation until 1940, when action by local residents, such as Rose Lee Baldwin, Dave Weir, and Mr. L. M. Robbins led to Congressman Frank S. Buck convincing the WPA to undertake the project. Using labor from the State Relief Camp in Benicia, a new roof was installed, the original low ceiling was eliminated, walls replastered, stained glass windows replaced, and a new floor was installed. The 22 original pews were restored at the Hale Fruit Shed. The chapel was rededicated on Decoration Day (Memorial Day), 1940, by the last surviving minister who had preached, the Reverend C. C. Black. In 1962, the Solano Historical Society sought state landmark status, with the chapel being listed in October of that year as SHL #779. Today The chapel continues to be actively used. As of 2019, it serves as the sanctuary for the local congregation of the Church of Christ, and also hosts weddings and funerals.Rockville Stone Chapel ‚Äì Fairfield CA Retrieved October 5, 2019 Ca. 2007, a further renovation was carried out by the Suisun Fairfield Rockville Cemetery District, which now owns the chapel.

In the film David is initially believed to be the main antagonist of the film, being the head of a gang of vampires in the fictional town of Santa Carla, but he is later revealed to have simply been an underling of Max. The character and Sutherland's performance were well received upon the films release, and David has gone on to become regarded as an iconic villain in popular culture, having inspired the depiction vampires both in style as well as characterization since. Analysis of his personality and psychology range from focus on his status as an eternal youth, gang leader, murderer and implied homoerotic tendencies.

At some point he was sired by Max (Edward Herrmann) and went on to create his own gang of subordinates (Brooke McCarter, Billy Wirth and Alex Winter). The audience is introduced to David through the eyes of Michael Emerson (Jason Patric), and Michael's fascination with a girl named Star (Jami Gertz), whom David appears to be in a relationship with. The next day Michael meets with Star again, and is provoked by David in participating in a dangerous motorcycle race. Michael is then lured back to David's lair where he undergoes an unsettling initiation before unknowingly drinking blood and becoming a vampire. The gang each hang off the underside of an elevated train and dive off individually. Michael then loses his grip and falls off, waking up in his bed. Michael attempts to confront David about his newly discovered vampirism, who in turn takes David to attack a group of Surf Nazis at a bonfire, hoping to prompt him into killing. Michael however grows uncomfortable and horrified and returns home to his brother, Sam (Corey Haim), who has become friends with a group of self-proclaimed vampire hunters Edgar and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander). Star appears to Michael and reveals that she is a half-vampire as well, and David had intended for Michael to be her first kill, turning her into a full vampire. Michael leads Sam, Edgar and Alan to the vampire lair during the day time while they are hibernating, which results in the death of one of David's underlings - Marko (Alex Winter). The group only barely escape as David's hand comes into brief contact with sunlight, while the group escape with Star and Laddie (Chance Michael Corbitt), another half-vampire child. That evening, Michael and Sam's mother, Lucy (Dianne Wiest) goes on a date with Max, and her father (Barnard Hughes) is out of the house. Leading for the perfect opportunity for Michael, Sam, Edgar and Alan to arm themselves to face the vampires. The vampires attack leading to the deaths of Paul (Brooke McCarter) and Dwayne (Billy Wirth). David and Michael face off, which ends with David being impaled on deer antlers, leaving his final fate unknown. Reception Kiefer Sutherland's suave and mysterious portrayal of David was widely acclaimed as a scene stealer throughout the film. David has been recognized as one of the most iconic film villains from the 1980s and one of the most recognizable vampires in film history. Film critic Colin Houlson stated that Sutherland \\"is moody and seductively scary as David\\".Films and Filming, Issue 400https://www.ihorror.com/david-lost-boys-vampire-good-bad-girls-want/ Analysis Jeffrey Weinstock expressed in his book The Vampire Film: Undead Cinema that David (much like many male vampire characters) is a gender stereotype of a male, always performing and trying to \\"pass\\" as a human, and in David's case almost to the point of parody.Jeffrey Weinstock; The Vampire Film: Undead Cinema - page: 8 =Homoerotic interpretation= David, and particularly his interactions with the character Michael,https://www.thelist.com/94950/things-lost-boys-notice-adult/ has been read as homoerotic, even Sutherland has nodded to these themes, remarking that the \\"whole scene where I catch [Michael] in the fog coming off the bridge ... I mean, it‚Äôs a very sensual moment!\\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/08/the-lost- boys-subtly-radical-vision-of-family/535266/ Harry Benshoff in his book Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film states that with his bleach-blond hair, stuble, earings and leather atire David appears as a gay pin-up model. He interprets the story of the film being that of the \\"normal\\" teen Michael being seduced by David's lifestyle. Psychoanalyst Trevor C. Pederson describes David's attempts at recruiting Michael as \\"obsessive\\", noting that David even requests that Michael join him even after Michael and his friends have killed all of David's fellow vampires. Legacy The image of David showing his fangs for the first time has been picked as the cover for several books, such as John Kenneth Muir's Horror Films of the 1980sJohn Kenneth Muir; Horror Films of the 1980s - page: 4 and The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead by J Gordon Melton.The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead Joss Whedon has expressed that the character Spike on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer was inspired by David.Jennifer Stuller; Fan Phenomena: Buffy the Vampire Slayer - page: 15 Both David and Spike took visual inspiration from British punk rock icon Billy Idol. Sutherland has stated that Billy Idol was a main source of inspiration for the look of David, while Spike was directly referenced the episode Sleeper where the characters state that Idol took the ideas for his look from Spike. The character became the eponymous vampire to people of the generation the film came out. This can be observed in a meme where in he is seen killing the character Edward Cullen from the Twilight series, reflecting the resentment from vampire fans who feels characters like Edward have \\"ruined\\" what was once cool about vampires to audiences, which David stood for.Jess Peacock; Such a Dark Thing: Theology of the Vampire Narrative in Popular Culture - page: 18Jess Peacock; Such a Dark Thing: Theology of the Vampire Narrative in Popular Culture - page: 91 In popular culture David's character was spoofed on the television show Bloopers after the release of the film.Television Horror Movie Hosts: 68 Vampires, Mad Scientists and Other Denizens of the Late-Night Airwaves Examined and Interviewed References Further reading * Encyclopedia of the Vampire: The Living Dead in Myth, Legend, and Popular Culture * The Enduring Lure of the Vampire: Sadomasochistic Subtexts in Postmodern America * Vampire Taxonomy: Identifying and Interacting with the Modern-Day Bloodsucker * The Vampire Gallery: A Who's who of the Undead * Zombies, Vampires, and Philosophy: New Life for the Undead * The Changing Vampire of Film and Television: A Critical Study of the Growth of a Genre * A Field Guide to Monsters * The Undead Among Us - The Figure of the Vampire as the \\"Unknown Other\\" and Its Representation in \\"True Blood\\" * Blood Read: The Vampire as Metaphor in Contemporary Culture * The Lure of the Vampire: Gender, Fiction and Fandom from Bram Stoker to Buffy * The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Interview with the Vampire * Consuming Youth: Technologies of Desire and American Youth Culture External links * David at The Lost Boys (wiki) * David at Villains (wiki) * David at Horror Film (wiki) Category:The Lost Boys (franchise) Category:LGBT themes in horror fiction Category:Male horror film villains Category:Fictional vampires Category:Film characters introduced in 1987 Category:Fictional henchmen Category:Fictional cult leaders ","title":"David (The Lost Boys)"},{"id":"61781279","text":"Diamant Ramazani (born 18 February 1999) is a footballer who plays as a right- back.

It was working before 1810, and continued in sporadic operation until the late 1920s. It is about west of Dolwyddelan, just beneath Dolwyddelan Castle.  History  An extract of the 1888 Ordnance Survey map showing Dolwyddelan Castle and Chwarel Ddu The quarry is believed to have opened between 1800 and 1805. In 1810, the quarry was successful enough that the Gwydir Estate, who owned the land on which the quarry sat, constructed a cart road from the quarry to the Holyhead Road at Conwy. This now forms part of the A470. Despite this early success, the quarry only operated for short periods over the next few decade. For several years in the late 1850s, it produced significant amounts of slate, up to 700 tones per year. At this time a stationary steam engine was used to haul rock up from the open pit. By 1888 it was once more closed. There was an attempt to re-open the quarry during the 1920s, and an oil engine was installed to replace the steam engine. A small number of quarrymen were employed, but the quarry had shut again by the end of the decade. Like several other early slate quarries, Chwarel Ddu had an internal tramway using wooden rails with iron strapping on their surface. Several of the iron running surfaces were discovered in the 1980s when the quarry site was being levelled to make way for road improvements.  Geology  The quarry worked slate from the Nod Glas Formation which outcrops along the Conwy Valley. Through most of its length, the Nod Glas is black shale, but in the area around Dolwyddelan a syncline compressed the shales and it developed enough cleavage to be worked as slate.

Biography  Albert-Paul Granier was the son of an art-loving notary and so he came into contact with music and literature at an early age. The composer Gabriel Faur√© was among others an acquaintance of the family. Albert-Paul Granier first attended the school in Le Croisic, later in Saint-Nazaire, where he made his baccalaur√©at in 1908. Then he attended the notary school in Nantes and graduated successfully in 1910. Albert-Paul Granier fulfilled his three-year military service in Paris where he remained until the outbreak of World War I. From the time of the outbreak of war Albert-Paul Granier was relocated to an artillery unit. This unit fought at the front in Verdun in 1916. In 1917 Albert-Paul Granier was transferred on his own request from artillery to air force where he served as an observer on reconnaissance flights around Verdun. In one of these flights, the plane of Albert-Paul Granier was hit by a shell and completely destroyed. His body was never found.  Work  Albert-Paul Granier wrote lyrical texts and also composed music since his youth. The love song Absente for example dates from his last school year 1908. It is also known that Albert-Paul Granier participated in the Parisian artistic scene before the outbreak of war and attended concerts, wrote poetry and continued to compose. He also wrote poems about the horrors of war while fighting at the front in Verdun. A collection of these poems was published in 1917 under the title Les Coqs et les Vautours. At that time, the publication was given little attention and Albert-Paul Granier and his work fell into oblivion for many decades. In 2008, the French linguist Claude Duneton rediscovered the publication and sought a new edition. This recent publication was highly praised in reviews and the quality of the works of Albert-Paul Granier was compared to that of Guillaume Apollinaire.Les coqs et les vautours Gibert A translation of the collection into English took place in 2014.

The film, starring Taapsee Pannu, was released in theatres on 28 February 2020. Plot Amrita Sabharwal and Vikram have been happily married for several years. Amrita is a sparkling woman and a homemaker, who is shown to spend her days looking after Vikram and the house. They throw a party at home to celebrate Vikram's promotion that would have them relocate to London. At the party however, Vikram gets a call informing him that his promotion contract has been compromised for his junior. Angered, he gets into an argument with his superior whom he accuses of two timing him. When Amrita tries to break up the argument, Vikram slaps her in front of everyone. The incident leaves her shaken; she starts to realize all the little unfair things that she had previously ignored and admits to herself that Vikram slapping her isn't what a husband who respects her would do. Moreover, Vikram refuses to take accountability for his actions, stating that he was upset, she got in the way, and things like that happen sometimes (which is wrong). Unable to \\"forget it and move on\\", as everyone advises her to, Amrita leaves for her parent‚Äôs home and stays there, leading to an argument between her and Vikram, as he thinks she's overreacting. He sends her a legal document to legally force her to return home. When she refuses, her lawyer explains to her that her options are to either reconcile, file for legal separation or get a divorce. She files for divorce, shocking her family and relatives, who also believe she should get over it. Amrita doesn't make any claims for alimony nor does she file a domestic violence charge; her stand is simply that Vikram has no right to hit her, not even once. She explains that she only asks for respect and happiness and the slap opened her eyes to the fact that she wasn't getting either. To make things more complicated, she discovers she is pregnant. Vikram and his lawyer play dirty when he finds out that she is pregnant. They make false claims against her mental stability, honesty and file frivolous charges against Amrita to try and intimidate her and get sole custody of the unborn child. Hurt, Amrita decides to file for the domestic violence charge against Vikram unless he agrees to a mutual consent divorce and joint custody of their expected child. Vikram and his lawyer agree to the terms presented by Amrita and settle for a mutual consent divorce. Meanwhile Vikram's superior informs him that the board changed their mind and Vikram got the promotion. While congratulating him personally, he mentions that he heard about the divorce and calmly tells him that what happened on the night of the party was Vikram's fault. He talks about how even though Vikram was arguing with him, he did not slap him even once but raised a hand on Amrita who was just trying to help him. Later at a family ceremony to bless her pregnancy, Amrita speaks to her mother-in-law in front of all the members of both families, explaining that she was hurt that on the night that he slapped her, nobody in the family came to see her or asked even once if she was okay; they did not even chastise Vikram, tell him he was wrong, or advise him to apologise. They simply told her to tolerate it to keep the peace. She mentions that she had lost her sense of identity over the years while trying hard to keep Vikram and everyone else happy. Her mother-in-law apologises for the family's mistakes, acknowledging their ingrained misogyny (prejudice against women), and tells Amrita that she is doing the right thing by taking a stand for herself. Vikram realises he is in the wrong. Throughout the movie, Amrita's journey is intertwined with that of two other women, her lawyer and her maid, who realize that they have been wronged by their husbands as well. Her actions help them find the strength to confront those problems and find solutions. The movie also shows snippets of the life of Amrita's neighbour who is a single working mother to a young girl who regularly practices dancing with Amrita. In the end when Amrita and Vikram meet to finalize the divorce, he apologises to her properly and tells her that he rejected the promotion and quit his job. He wonders out loud why he ever thought that he had a right to hit her or disrespect her in any way. He explains that he will start again from scratch and will try to be someone who deserves her. They complete the formalities and part ways with a sense of renewed hope.

It was determined to be of biological interest (as opposed to geological interest, the other criteria for SSSIs) under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The site, measuring , was officially designated in August 1982. Location The SSSI is located in the hamlet of Salta, which is in the civil parish of Holme St. Cuthbert, in the Allerdale borough of Cumbria. The site is approximately from the coast, approximately above sea level, and nearby settlements include Dubmill, Edderside, Hailforth, and Mawbray. In addition to its status as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Salta Moss has some further legal protection due to this section of Solway Firth coastline being a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Known as the Solway Coast and headquartered at Silloth, the AONB runs from the estuaries of the rivers Esk and Eden (near Carlisle) to Skinburness, and again from Beckfoot to Crosscanonby along Allonby Bay. Furthermore, the sea at Allonby Bay is a Marine Conservation Zone, granting protection to local aquatic life. Etymology The word Moss in this case refers to a peat bog, not the family of plants. The word comes from the Old English meos or mos, and ultimately from the proto-Germanic musan. The name Salta comes from the Old English sƒìalt-tir, meaning \\"land of salt\\", or simply \\"salt land\\". This is due to the Anglo-Saxon era saltmaking industry known to have been present on this part of the Solway coast. Several local house names include the word Moss, or the names of plant species which grow there. Historical significance In the 1980s, a rapier from the Bronze Age was discovered on Salta Moss, which may have been crafted as early as 1100 BC. The sword was donated to the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle, where it is on display as of 2019. Plant life A gorse flower on Salta Moss. Several species of bog and moor plants are present on Salta Moss. These include Molinia caerulea, commonly known as purple moor grass, which is native to Great Britain and often seen on boggy or marshy ground. There are also several varieties of Ericaceae, commonly known as heather, as well as gorse. The site is known as a raised blanket mire (or blanket bog) due to its climate and the presence of peat. There is also a small area of woodland, and the site sits atop a large deposit of glacial sand. Sand from this same deposit is quarried within a few miles of the SSSI at Overby, near New Cowper. The main species noted by Natural England, and given as reasons for the SSSI designation, are as follows: * Angelica sylvestris (wild angelica) * Carex rostrata (bottle or beaked sedge) * Erica tetralix (cross-leaved heath) * Filipendula ulmaria (meadowsweet or mead wort) * Galium palustre (marsh-bedstraw) * Juncus acutiflorus (sharp-flowered rush) * Juncus effusus (common or soft rush) * Menyanthes trifoliata (bog bean) * Molinia caerulea (purple moor grass) * Phragmites communis (common reed) * Potentilla erecta (tormentil or septfoil) * Salix pentandra (bay willow) * Sphagnum cuspidatum (feathery bog-moss or toothed peat moss) * Sphagnum papillosum (papillose bog-moss) * Sphagnum recurvum * Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry, or bog or swamp cranberry) Animal life Adders (vipera berus) showing normal and melanistic colourings. Both are known to be present on Salta Moss. Vipera berus, commonly known as adders, are present on Salta Moss. This species is Britain's only native venomous snake, and they are known to prey on small rodents, such as voles and field mice. Adders occasionally bite people, and their bite, while painful, is usually not fatal and the species is not considered especially dangerous to humans. Melanistic adders (adders which have dark pigmentation) are also noted to be present. Parts of the site provide shelter for roe deer, and breeding grounds for warblers, and in addition many other species of wild birds are present, both migratory and nonmigratory. Status Natural England, the governing body of all SSSIs in England, regards parts of the site as destroyed and various other parts as under threat. This is primarily due to agricultural activity and draining of groundwater. Maintaining the site's status as an SSSI depends upon the retention of a high water table. Natural England notes that further draining of the site would put it at increased risk.

It stands on the south-east edge of Dolwyddelan.  History  Quarrymen pose with their tools at Ty'n-y-bryn slate quarry Map showing the Ty'n-y-bryn and Penllyn quarries and Dolwyddelan railway station in 1911 The original workings at Ty'n-y-bryn were started in the 1840s. In 1861, the quarry was restarted and a large mill was built just behind the Pentre-bont houses on the edge of Dolwyddelan. The mill had a large waterwheel which was fed from the Llyn Cwm- penamnen reservoir about to the south. In 1875, the Penllyn quarry was taken over by the company. Penllyn had been worked on a small scale since at least 1873, and was immediately to the east of Ty'n-y-bryn. The Ty'n-y-bryn mill processed slate from both quarries. In 1879, an incline was built down from the mill level to exchange sidings at Dolwyddelan railway station. Unusually, the incline was laid as standard gauge allowing wagons from the London and North Western Railway to be taken up to the mill. It was one of only four slate quarries in North Wales that had standard gauge railway laid directly to its mill. Quarrying at the quarry ended in 1914. There was an attempt to restart Penllyn, again using the Ty'n-y-bryn mill, in 1920. This lasted until 1924, when all work ceased.  Geology  The quarry worked slate from the Nod Glas Formation which outcrops along the Lledr Valley. Through most of its length, the Nod Glas is black shale, but in the area around Dolwyddelan a syncline compressed the shales and it developed enough cleavage to be worked as slate.

By this endpoint Buddhism in India had greatly declined, and Hinduism was predominant, and religious and secular building styles had taken on forms, with great regional variation, which they largely retained until and beyond the great changes brought about by the arrival of first Islam, and then Europeans. Much early Indian architecture was in wood, which has almost always decayed or burnt, or brick, which has often been taken away for re-use. The large amount of Indian rock- cut architecture, essentially beginning around 250 BCE, is therefore especially important, as much of it clearly adapts forms from contemporary constructed buildings of which no examples remain. There are also a number of important sites where the floor-plan has survived to be excavated, but the upper parts of structures have vanished. In the Bronze Age the first cities emerged in the Indus Valley Civilization. Archaeology has unearthed urbanization phase from early Harappan in Kalibangan to the late Harappan phase when urbanization declined but was preserved in few pockets. The urbanization in the Gangetic plains began as early as 1200 BC with the emergence of fortified cities and appearance of Northern Black polished ware.\\" The Mahajanapada period was characterized by Indian coins and use of stone in the Indian architecture. The Mauryan period is considered as the beginning of the classical period of Indian architecture. Nagara and Dravidian architectural styles developed in the early medieval period with the rise of Hindu revivalism and predominant role of Hindu temple architecture in the Indian Subcontinent. Bronze age period  =Period (5th millennium BC - 1900 BCE)= Early Harappan phase Although the urban phase of Harappa has been dated back to 2600 BC, excavation at Kalibangan from the early or proto-Harappan period already shows an urban development with fortification, grid layout of the city and drain system. The settlement consisted of a fortified city mostly made of mud-brick architecture but characterized by an appearance of fired bricks around 3000 BC which was used to line the drains of the city. Planned settlements from an early Harappan era with structures parallel to the streets which run perpendicular to each other with public drainage system has been uncovered at the site of Rakhigarhi, one of the biggest urbanized areas of the Indus valley civilization dating back to 4000 BC-3200 BC. Even earlier phase dated 4400-4200 BC has marked the appearance of wedge shaped mud bricks with rectangular houses. Building complex of Bhavnagar Archaeologists discovered a huge building complex dating back to 3600-3300 BC which was probably a storage complex, typical mature harappan brick ratios of 4:2:1 were also noted along with a stone platform and the beginnings of Harrapan silo pit. The complex had rooms with rectangular or squarish plan which were all interconnected by some common wall. English Bond and building material While in contemporary Bronze Age cultures outside India sun-dried mud bricks were the dominant building material, the Indus Valley civilization preferred to use fired \\"terracotta\\" brick instead. A prominent feature of Harappan architecture was also the first use anywhere in the world of English bond in building with bricks. This type of bonding utilized alternate headers and stretchers which is a stronger method of construction. Clay was usually used as cementing material but where better strength was needed, such as for the drains, lime and gypsum mortar was preferred instead. In architecture such as the Great Bath, bitumen was used for waterproofing. The Use of bitumen has been attested as early as the Mehrgarh period, one of the earliest uses in the world as well. The remarkable vertical alignment of the building indicates the use of a Plumb line. The bricks were produced in a standardized ratio of 4:2:1, found throughout the Indus Valley Civilization. Larger buildings Harappan seals show architecture besides horned deities which has been translated as either temples, shrines or houses with an upward curving roof with fish tail endings on four corners. The seals indicate formal places of worship. The excavation at Banawali in present day Haryana has also yielded an Apsidal plan which has been interpreted as a temple. Rectangular stadium-like spaces provided with steps and gateways are known from Dholavira and Juni Kuran. Two stadiums were constructed at Juni Kuran, perhaps one for the commoners and the other for the people with higher status. At Dholavira, possible funerary architecture was found sorounding a dried up lake and consists of tumuli, sometimes resembling hemispherical domes, constructed using mud bricks or stone slabs. The plan of the base of tumulus is in the shape of a spoked wheel with a chamber in the centre. Juni Kuran and Mohenjo Daro have pillared halls. In the case of Mohenjodaro L area, the pillars of the hall were constructed using baked bricks and in the case of Juni Kuran, they were made of sandstone pillars with elaborately designed base.

The houses were single or double storied. The windows wer provided with lattice shutters for airflow and privacy and ledge to stop rainwater from entering the house. The houses were usually provided with bathing platform which were connected to the public drain through in house drain. Latrines were generally simple commodes made by burying an old storage pot into the ground. They would have to be cleaned out periodically, but some had a small drain leading outside to a second sump pot. The latrines and bathing platforms were located in a room attached to the outer wall. Kitchen were open air situated in a courtyard as well as closed rooms, hearths oval, circular and rectangular in shape were also used in the house, keyhole ovens with central pillars were used for roasting meat or baking breads. =Late Harappan period= After the collapse of the mature Harappan urban period, some cities still remained urban and inhabited. Sites like Bet Dwarka in Gujarat, Kudwala (38.1 hectares) in Cholistan and Daimabad (20 Ha) in Maharashtra are considered urban. Daimabad (2000-1000 BC) developed a fortification wall with bastions in its Jorwe culture period (1400-1000 BC) and had public buildings such as an elliptical temple, an apsidal temple and shows evidence of planning in the layout of rectangular houses and streets or lanes and planned streets. The area had rose to 50 hectares in with a population of 10,000 people. A 580-meter long protection wall dated 1500 BC was found at Bet Dwarka which is believed to have been damaged and submerged following a sea storm.U. Singh (2008), pp. 181, 223 A warehouse dated to 1500 BC at Prahbas Patan (Somnath) from late Harappan period is made of rubble stones set in mud mortar, the artifact includes a stealite seal and storage jars. Second Urbanization period (1025 BCE ‚Äì 320 BCE) Archaeological excavations at Kausambi have revealed fortifications from the end of second millennium BC. A stone palace predating the Mauryan period has been discovered from the ruins of Kausambi. The dressed stones of the palace were set in fine lime and coated with a thick layer of plaster, the entire architecture resembled a fortress with its own walls and towers. The palace had few rooms, each room was provided with three shelves and a central hall with steps leading to the tower. The architecture was constructed in three phases and is dated from 8th century BC to 2nd century BC. Discovery of this stone palace discredits the theory of foreign influence behind the rise of Indian stone architecture during Ashokan or mauryan period. A technique of architecture applied here was using dressed stones as facing for a wall made of rubble core, this represents the apogee of Indian architecture in this ancient period.

File:Qutub Minar danibaba4.jpgStone facing of Qutub Minar on its rubble core =Ghositarama monastery= Ghoshitaram monastery in Kosambi dating back to 6th-century BCE Ghoshitaram monastery in Kosambi dating back to 6th-century BCE. Buddhist scripture attributes this very old monastic site to the time of the Buddha which has been backed by archaeology, founded by a banker named Ghosita. The site has been located near Kosambi and identified by inscriptions. Archaeology suggests continuous occupation down to the sixth century when it was likely destroyed in the Hun invasion. Xuanzang found it an unoccupied ruin. =Mahajanapadas= From the time of the Mahajanapadas (600 BCE‚Äì320 BCE), walled and moated cities with large gates and multi-storied buildings which consistently used arched windows and doors and made intense use of wooden architecture, are important features of the architecture during this period.Chandra (2008) The reliefs of Sanchi, dated to the 1st centuries BCE‚ÄìCE, show cities such as Kushinagar or Rajagriha as splendid walled cities during the time of the Buddha (6th century BCE), as in the Royal cortege leaving Rajagriha or War over the Buddha's relics. These views of ancient Indian cities have been relied on for the understanding of ancient Indian urban architecture. Archaeologically, this period corresponds in part to the Northern Black Polished Ware culture.J.M. Kenoyer (2006), \\"Cultures and Societies of the Indus Tradition. In Historical Roots\\" in the Making of ‚Äòthe Aryan‚Äô, R. Thapar (ed.), pp. 21‚Äì49. New Delhi, National Book Trust. Geopolitically, the Achaemenid Empire started to occupy the northwestern part of the subcontinent from c, 518 BCE. Rajgir_-_002_Old_City_Walls_(9242554013).jpgRajgir, old city walls 6th century BCE Jetavana_of_Sravasti_Sanchi_Stupa_1_Northern_Gateway.jpgJetavana of Sravasti, Sanchi Stupa 1, Northern Gateway Various types of individual housing of the time of the Buddha (c. 563/480 or c. 483/400 BCE), resembling huts with chaitya-decorated doors, are also described in the reliefs of Sanchi. Particularly, the Jetavana at Sravasti, shows the three favourite residences of the Buddha: the Gandhakuti, the Kosambakuti, and the Karorikuti, with the throne of the Buddha in the front of each. The Jetavana garden was presented to the Buddha by the rich banker Anathapindika, who purchased it for as many gold pieces as would cover the surface of the ground. Hence, the foreground of the relief is shown covered with ancient Indian coins (karshapanas), just as it is in the similar relief at Bharhut.John Marshall, A Guide to Sanchi, 1918 p. 58ff (Public Domain text) Although the reliefs of Sanchi are dated to the 1st centuries BCE‚ÄìCE, portraying scene taking place during the time of the Buddha, four centuries before, they are considered an important indication of building traditions in these early times. Pataliputra Voussoir Arch A granite stone fragment of an arch, known as Pataliputra Voussoir Arch, discovered by K. P. Jayaswal from Kumhrar, Pataliputra has been analysed as a pre Mauryan Nanda period keystone fragment of a trefoil arch of gateway with mason's marks of three archaic Brahmi letters inscribed on it which probably decorated a Torana. The wedge shaped stone with indentation has mauryan polish on two sides and was suspended vertically. =Religious architecture= Buddhist caves During the time of the Buddha (c. 563/480 or c. 483/400 BCE), Buddhist monks were also in the habit of using natural caves, such as the Saptaparni Cave, southwest from Rajgir, Bihar. Many believe it to be the site in which Buddha spent some time before his death,Digha Nikaya 16, Maha-Parinibbana Sutta, Last Days of the Buddha, Buddhist Publication Society and where the first Buddhist council was held after the Buddha died (paranirvana). The Buddha himself had also used the Indrasala Cave for meditation, starting a tradition of using caves, natural or man-made, as religious retreats, that would last for over a millennium.Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, pp. 97‚Äì99 Monasteries Jivakarama vihara monastery. Oblong communal hall (remains), 6th century BCE The first monasteries, such as the Jivakarama vihara and Ghositarama monastery in Rajgir and Kausambi respectively, were built from the time of the Buddha, in the 6th or 5th centuries BCE.\\"The rubble-built building complex of Jivakamravana at Rajgir probably represents one of the earliest monasteries of India dating from the Buddha's time.\\" in The initial Jivakarama monastery was formed of two long parallel and oblong halls, large dormitories where the monks could eat and sleep, in conformity with the original regulations of the samgha, without any private cells. Other halls were then constructed, mostly long, oblong building as well, which remind of the construction of several of the Barabar caves. The Buddha is said to have been treated once in the monastery, after having been injured by Devadatta. Stupas Stupas at Piprahwa are some of the earliest surviving stupas. Religious buildings in the form of the Buddhist stupa, a dome-shaped monument, started to be used in India as commemorative monuments associated with storing sacred relics of the Buddha.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), Pagoda. The relics of the Buddha were spread between eight stupas, in Rajagriha, Vaishali, Kapilavastu, Allakappa, Ramagrama, Pava, Kushinagar, and Vethapida.Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, pp. 140‚Äì174 The Piprahwa stupa also seems to have been one of the first to be built. Guard rails‚Äîconsisting of posts, crossbars, and a coping‚Äîbecame a feature of safety surrounding a stupa. The Buddha had left instructions about how to pay hommage to the stupas: \\"And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours there with a devout heart, will reap benefits for a long time\\".Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, p. 143 This practice would lead to the decoration of the stupas with stone sculptures of flower garlands in the Classical period. Temples Saurashtra Janapada coins from the stratigraphic phase I dated 600-300 BC provide evidence of elaborate Apsidal Chaitya temples along with domed temples (or stupa), square, cruciform and octagonal temple plans, these coins also provide one of the first representations of Hindu pantheon for instance Gaja Lakshmi etc. Elliptical Hindu temples with mandapa from Nagari, Chittorgarh and Vidisha near Heliodorus pillar have been dated to 4th century BC or 350-300 BC. Classical period (320 BCE ‚Äì 550 CE) =Monumental stone architecture= The Pataliputra capital, discovered at the Bulandi Bagh site of Pataliputra, c. 4th‚Äì3rd BCE The next wave of building, appears with the start of the Classical period (320 BCE‚Äì550 CE) and the rise of the Mauryan Empire. The capital city of Pataliputra was an urban marvel described by the Greek ambassador Megasthenes. Remains of monumental stone architecture can be seen through numerous artifacts recovered from Pataliputra, such as the Pataliputra capital. This cross-fertilization between different art streams converging on the subcontinent produced new forms that, while retaining the essence of the past, succeeded in integrating selected elements of the new influences. Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, 250 BCE The Indian emperor Ashoka (rule: 273‚Äì232 BCE) established the Pillars of Ashoka throughout his realm, generally next to Buddhist stupas. According to Buddhist tradition, Ashoka recovered the relics of the Buddha from the earlier stupas (except from the Ramagrama stupa), and erected 84.000 stupas to distribute the relics across India. In effect, many stupas are thought to date originally from the time of Ashoka, such as Sanchi or Kesariya, where he also erected pillars with his inscriptions, and possibly Bharhut, Amaravati or Dharmarajika in Gandhara. Ashoka also built the initial Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya around the Bodhi tree, including masterpieces such as the Diamond throne (\\"Vajrasana\\"). He is also said to have established a chain of hospitals throughout the Mauryan empire by 230 BCE.Piercey & Scarborough (2008) One of the edicts of Ashoka reads: \\"Everywhere King Piyadasi (Ashoka) erected two kinds of hospitals, hospitals for people and hospitals for animals. Where there were no healing herbs for people and animals, he ordered that they be bought and planted.\\"See Stanley Finger (2001), Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function, Oxford University Press, p. 12, . Indian art and culture has absorbed extraneous impacts by varying degrees and is much richer for this exposure. Fortified cities with st≈´pas, viharas, and temples were constructed during the Maurya empire (c. 321‚Äì185 BCE).Chandra (2008) Architectural creations of the Mauryan period, such as the city of Pataliputra, the Pillars of Ashoka, are outstanding in their achievements, and often compare favourably with the rest of the world at that time. Commenting on Mauryan sculpture, John Marshall once wrote about the \\"extraordinary precision and accuracy which characterizes all Mauryan works, and which has never, we venture to say, been surpassed even by the finest workmanship on Athenian buildings\\".The Early History of India by Vincent A.

These artificial caves exhibit an amazing level of technical proficiency, the extremely hard granite rock being cut in geometrical fashion and polished to a mirror-like finish. Probably owing to the 2nd century BCE fall of the Mauryan Empire and the subsequent persecutions of Buddhism under Pushyamitra Sunga, it is thought that many Buddhists relocated to the Deccan under the protection of the Andhra dynasty, thus shifting the cave-building effort to western India: an enormous effort at creating religious caves (usually Buddhist or Jain) continued there until the 2nd century CE, culminating with the Karla Caves or the Pandavleni Caves. These caves generally followed an apsidal plan with a stupa in the back for the chaityas, and a rectangular plan with surrounding cells for the viharas. As well as royal patronage, numerous donors provided the funds for the building of these caves and left donation inscriptions, including laity, members of the clergy, government officials, and even foreigners.Buddhist architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, pp. 98‚Äì99 The construction of caves would wane after the 2nd century CE, possibly due to the rise of Mahayana Buddhism and the associated intense architectural and artistic production in Gandhara and Amaravati. The building of rock-cut caves would revive briefly in the 5th century CE, with the magnificent achievements of Ajanta and Ellora, before finally subsiding as Hinduism replaced Buddhism in the sub-continent, and stand-alone temples became more prevalent. Rock-cut architecture also developed with the apparition of stepwells in India, dating from 200‚Äì400 CE.Livingston & Beach, xxiii Subsequently, the construction of wells at Dhank (550‚Äì625 CE) and stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850‚Äì950 CE) took place.

Full-fledged sculptural decorations and scenes of the life of the Buddha would soon follow at Bharhut (115 BCE), Bodh Gaya (60 BCE), Mathura (125‚Äì60 BCE), again at Sanchi for the elevation of the toranas (1st century BCE/CE) and then Amaravati (1st‚Äì2nd century CE).Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2009, pp. 149- ‚Äì150 The decorative embellishment of stupas also had a considerable development in the northwest in the area of Gandhara, with decorated stupas such as the Butkara Stupa (\\"monumentalized\\" with Hellenistic decorative elements from the 2nd century BCE)\\"De l'Indus a l'Oxus: archaeologie de l'Asie Centrale\\", Pierfrancesco Callieri, p212: \\"The diffusion, from the second century BCE, of Hellenistic influences in the architecture of Swat is also attested by the archaeological searches at the sanctuary of Butkara I, which saw its stupa \\"monumentalized\\" at that exact time by basal elements and decorative alcoves derived from Hellenistic architecture\\". or the Loriyan Tangai stupas (2nd century CE). Stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it became prominent as a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. The Indian gateway arches, the torana, reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), torii Some scholars hold that torii derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of Sanchi (3rd century BCE ‚Äì 11th century CE).Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System (2001), torii.

It was built during the time of Ashoka, and near it were found two of Ashoka's Minor Rock Edicts. Ashoka also built the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya c. 250 BCE, also a circular structure, in order to protect the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha had found enlightenment. Representations of this early temple structure are found on a 100 BCE relief sculpted on the railing of the stupa at BhƒÅrhut, as well as in Sanchi.\\"Sowing the Seeds of the Lotus: A Journey to the Great Pilgrimage Sites of Buddhism, Part I\\" by John C.

The temple was burnt down sometime in the 2nd century BCE. This type of apsidal structure was also adopted for most of the cave temple (Chaitya-grihas), as in the 3rd century BCE Barabar Caves and most caves thereafter, with side, and then frontal, entrances. A freestanding apsidal temple remains to this day, although in a modified form, in the Trivikrama Temple in Ter, Maharashtra. File:IA Temple 40 Sanchi.jpgIllustration of Temple 40 at Sanchi, dated to the 3rd century BCE File:Trivikram Temple Ter 1.jpgTrivikrama Temple at Ter: an early Buddhist apsidal temple, in front of which was later added an Hindu square mandapa File:Amvar Chejerla Kapoteswara temple in guntur district.jpgChejarla apsidal temple, also later converted to Hinduism Truncated pyramidal temples The Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya is one of the earliest examples of Truncated Pyramidal temples with niches containing Buddha images.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, pp. 238‚Äì248 The structure is crowned by the shape of an hemispherical stupa topped by finials, forming a logical elongation of the temple. Although the current structure of the Mahabdhodi Temple dates to the Gupta period (5th century CE), the \\"Plaque of Mahabodhi Temple\\", discovered in Kumrahar and dated to 150‚Äì200 CE based on its dated Kharoshthi inscriptions and combined finds of Huvishka coins, suggests that the pyramidal structure already existed in the 2nd century CE. This is confirmed by archaeological excavations in Bodh Gaya. This truncated pyramid design also marked the evolution from the aniconic stupa dedicated to the cult of relics, to the iconic temple with multiple images of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas. This design was very influential in the development of later Hindu temples.Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p. 234 Square prostyle temples A Gupta period tetrastyle prostyle Buddhist temple of Classical appearance at Sanchi (Temple 17) (5th century CE)2500 Years of Buddhism by P.V. Bapat, p. 283 The Gupta Empire later also built Buddhist stand-alone temples (following the great cave temples of Indian rock-cut architecture), such as Temple 17 at Sanchi, dating to the early Gupta period (5th century CE). It consists of a flat roofed square sanctum with a portico and four pillars. From an architectural perspective, this is a tetrastyle prostyle temple of Classical appearance . The interior and three sides of the exterior are plain and undecorated but the front and the pillars are elegantly carved, not unlike the 2nd century rock-cut cave temples of the Nasik Caves. Nalanda and Valabhi universities, housing thousands of teachers and students, flourished between the 4th‚Äì8th centuries.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008), education, history of. =Palatial architecture= An Indian palace depiction in Mahabodhi railing, showing vaulted underground chambers called suranga, as described by Kautiliya in Arthashastra; Shunga period, 2nd-1st BCE Archaeological excavation conducted by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) at Kausambi revealed a palace with its foundations going back to 8th century BCE until 2nd century CE; and built-in six phases. The last phase dated to 1st - 2nd century CE, featured an extensive structure which was divided into three blocks and enclosed two galleries. There was a central hall in the central block and presumably used as an audience hall surrounded by rooms which served as a residential place for the ruler. The entire structure was constructed using bricks and stones and two layers of lime were plastered on it. The palace had a vast network of underground chambers also called Suranga by Kautilya in his Arthashastra, and the superstructure and the galleries were made on the principle of true arch. The four-centered pointed arch was used to span narrow passageways and segmental arch for wider areas. The superstructure of the central and eastern block was examined to have formed part of a dome that adorned the building. The entire galleries and superstructure were found collapsed under 5 cm thick layer of ash which indicates destruction of the palace through conflagration. A palace architecture has also been uncovered at Nagarjunakonda. =Shikhara= The early evidence of Shikhara type domical crowing structure has been noted in the palatial architecture of Kausambi dated to 1st-2nd century CE. The central hall was thought to be topped by a dome but analysis of the bricks indicate Shikara type structure was used instead. Evidence also indicates Shikhara was also used in crowing architecture such as Bhitargaon temple. =Theater and stadium= Satavahanas constructed a stadium and a theater at Nagarjunakonda in the 2nd century AD. The theater has a small quadrangular open area enclosed on all four sides by stepped stands which are made of bricks and cladded with limestone. An oblong- shaped stadium dating form the same era consisted of an arena which was enclosed on all four sides by flight of steps with each step measuring two feet wide and a pavilion which was situated on the west end. At the top of the arena there was an eleven feet wide platform. The area of arena was 309 X 259 feet and 15 feet deep. The entire construction was done using burnt brick. =Fortification= Nalrajar fortification wall, 5th century CE Nalrajar Garh fortification wall ruins dating back to 5th-century CE. are probably the only standing fortification ruins from Gupta period which are located in a dense jungle in North Bengal near Indo-Bhutan border. A prominent feature of its fortification walls are two parabolic arches. Many fortified cities like Nalrajar Garh, Bhitagarh had risen in Northeastern India owing to trade activities with southeastern China. Badami or Pulakeshi fort from Chalukya era date back to the 6th century CE. =End of the Classical period= This period ends with the destructive invasions of the Alchon Huns in the 6th century CE. During the rule of the Hunnic king Mihirakula, over a thousand Buddhist monasteries throughout Gandhara are said to have been destroyed. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, writing in 630 CE, explained that Mihirakula ordered the destruction of Buddhism and the expulsion of monks.Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks by Jason Neelis p. 168 He reported that Buddhism had drastically declined, and that most of the monasteries were deserted and left in ruins.The Spread of Buddhism by Ann Heirman, Stephan Peter Bumbacher p. 60 sq Although only spanning a few decades, the invasions had long-term effects on India, and in a sense brought an end to Classical India.The First Spring: The Golden Age of India by Abraham Eraly p. 48 sq Soon after the invasions, the Gupta Empire, already weakened by these invasions and the rise of local rulers, ended as well.Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen p. 221 Following the invasions, northern India was left in disarray, with numerous smaller Indian powers emerging after the crumbling of the Guptas.A Comprehensive History Of Ancient India p. 174 Early Middle Ages (550 CE‚Äì1200 CE) Navghan Kuvo, Gujarat, 11th century CE. Hindu temple architecture in the Indian subcontinent continued to develop in North India and South India. Nagara style developed in North India where a Hindu temple incorporated Shikhara as its predominant architectural element whereas in southern India Vimana was used instead. The Hindu temple architecture was characterized by the use of stone as the dominant building material compared to the earlier period in which the burnt bricks were used instead. Regional styles include Architecture of Karnataka, Kalinga architecture, Dravidian architecture, Western Chalukya architecture, and Badami Chalukya Architecture.

Corbel arches Corbel arches in India date from Indus Valley Civilisation which used corbel arch to construct drains and have been evidenced at Mohenjo daro, Harappa, and Dholavira. The oldest arches surviving in Indian architecture are the gavaksha or \\"chaitya arches\\" found in ancient rock-cut architecture, and agreed to be copied from versions in wood which have all perished. These often terminate a whole ceiling with a semi-circular top; wooden roofs made in this way can be seen in carved depictions of cities and palaces. A number of small early constructed temples have such roofs, using corbelled construction, as well as an apsidal plan; the Trivikrama Temple at Ter, Maharashtra is an example. The arch shape survived into constructed Indian architecture, not as an opening in a wall but as a blind niche projection from a wall, that bears only its own weight. In this form, it became a very common and important decorative motif on Hindu temples.Rowland, 44-45, 64-65, 113, 218-219; Harle, 48, 175 The \\"fundamental architectural principle of the constructed Hindu temple is always formulated in the trabeate order\\", that is to say using post and lintel systems with vertical and horizontal members.Michell, 82 According to George Michell: \\"Never was the principle of the arch with radiating components, such as voussoirs and keystones, employed in Hindu structures, either in India or in other parts of Asia. It was not so much that Hindu architects were ignorant of these techniques, but rather that conformance to tradition and adherence to precedents were firm cultural attitudes\\".Michell, 84 Harle describes the true arch as \\"not unknown, but almost never employed by Hindu builders\\",Harle, 530, note 3 to chapter 30. See also 489, note 10 and its use as \\"rare, but widely dispersed\\".Harle, 493, note 5 Arch The 19th-century archaeologist Alexander Cunningham, head of the Archaeological Survey of India, at first believed that due to the total absence of arches in Hindu temples, they were alien to Indian architecture, but several pre-Islamic examples bear testimony to their existence, as explained by him in the following manner: Archaeological evidences indicate that wedge shaped bricks and construction of wells in the Indus valley civilization and although no true arches have been discovered as of yet, these bricks would have been suitable in the construction of true arches. The earliest arch appeared in South Asia as a barrel vault in the Late Harappan Cemetery H culture dated 1900 BC-1300 BC which formed the roof of the metal working furnance, the discovery was made by Vats in 1940 during excavation at Harappa. True arch in India dates from pre Mauryan Nanda period from 5th century BC. Arch fragment discovered by archaeologist K. P. Jayaswal from an arch with Brahmi inscribed on it, or 1st - 2nd century CE when it first appeared in Kausambi palace architecture from Kushana period. Arches present at Vishnu temples at Deo Baranark, Amb and Kafir Kot temples from Hindu Shahi period and Hindu temple of Bhitargaon bear testimony to the use arches in the Hindu temple architecture. Although Alexander Cunningham has persisted in the notion that the Buddhist Mahabodhi Temple's pointed arch was added later during a Burmese restoration, given its predominant use in Islamic architecture, scholars such as Huu Phuoc Le have contested this assumption based on analysis that relieving arches could not have been added without destroying the entire temple structure, which is dated to 6th-7th century CE. Hence the pointed and relieving arches much have formed part of the original building dating from the pre-Islamic periods in proper.Rowland, 163-164 Moreover, pointed arches vaulted entrances have been noted in Bhitargaon temple and Kausambi Palace architecture as well.

He is a hypochondriac member of \\"The Loser's Club\\" with an overbearing mother. He is portrayed in the 1990 miniseries adaptation by Adam Faraizl as a child and by Dennis Christopher as an adult; and by Sumeet Goradia as a child and Amit Mistry as an adult in the 1998 television series. He was later portrayed in the 2017 remake and its 2019 sequel by Jack Dylan Grazer as a child and James Ransone as an adult. Fictional character biography Edward \\"Eddie\\" Kaspbrak was born on November, 1946, the son of Frank and Sonia Kaspbrak. His father died when he was young, resulting in his mother becoming strict and overbearing with her son, causing him to grow up to become a hypochondriac. Eddie becomes friends with The Loser's Club members Bill Denbrough, Stanley Uris and Richie Tozier ‚Äì the latter of which often teases Eddie due to his hypochondria and overbearing mother. He eventually met and became friends with future Loser's Club members Ben Hanscom, Beverly Marsh and Mike Hanlon. Each member of The Loser's Club have individual encounters with Pennywise the Dancing Clown, including one encounter that resulted in Eddie breaking his arm. The group eventually goes to face Pennywise, which causes Eddie to finally stand up to his mother beforehand. The group seemingly defeats the clown and make an oath that if Pennywise isn't defeated, they will all return to Derry to defeat it once and for all. As an adult, due to the nature of Pennywise and Derry, Eddie forgets his childhood, The Loser's Club, Richie and his mother. He becomes a limousine driver and ends up marrying a woman very similar to his overbearing mother named Myra. After the death of Adrian Mellon, Eddie gets a call from Mike Hanlon asking him to return to Derry. Eddie reunites with Richie and the rest of the Loser's Club and each have individual encounters with Pennywise. The group eventually return to Neibolt Street and face off against Pennywise for one final time. Eddie ends up causing damage to Pennywise, but is instantaneously killed by the monster, dying in Richie's arms asking him not to call him \\"Eds\\". Eddie's death motivates The Loser's Club to defeat Pennywise once and for all. Adaptations Eddie was portrayed in the 1990 miniseries adaptation by Adam Faraizl as a child and Dennis Christopher as an adult. This adaptation remains fairly faithful to the novelisation, including and up to his death; the one exception is that Eddie never married in this version. Eddie was portrayed by Sumeet Goradia as a child and Amit Mistry as an adult (named \\"Ronnie\\") in the 1998 television series. Eddie was again portrayed in the 2017 remake and its 2019 sequel by Jack Dylan Grazer as a child and James Ransone as an adult. In this adaptation, his mother is depicted as being severely obese and even stricter with Eddie than in the novel and miniseries. It is also revealed that the pills that Eddie has to take are placebos, which leads to Eddie standing up to his mother before the final confrontation with Pennywise, and throwing aside his fanny pack full of medicine before retrieving it in the sequel's flashback sequence. In the sequel, Eddie is a risk assessor married to a woman resembling his mother. His story is similar to the novel with the exception that he does not kill Henry Bowers. Relationship with Richie Tozier In King's novel, Eddie's relationship with Richie is seen as being purely platonic, and Richie simply enjoys making fun of Eddie and his hypochondria. Despite Richie's jokes, the two are in fact close friends, this is seen at the end of the novel when Richie is devastated by Eddie's death. In It Chapter Two it is suggested that Richie is secretly in love with Eddie, with it being implied that he is a closeted homosexual. It is unknown if Eddie returned Richie's feeling or not, as judged by Richie having carved his and Eddie's initials into the kissing bridge where Ben Hanscom was attacked by Henry Bowers in the first instalment. Some fans have interpreted Eddie as bisexual, even though as in the book, he is married to a woman named Myra. Other fans have interpreted Eddie as a closeted gay man who used Myra as a beard, as in the book Eddie shows no romantic or sexual interest in Myra and views her as an extension of his mother. Reception The portrayal of Eddie in the 2017 film and 2019 sequel by Grazer and Ransone was widely praised by critics and audiences. The chemistry between Grazer and Finn Wolfhard in Chapter One and between Ransone and Bill Hader in Chapter Two was applauded by fans and critics. Critics called Eddie's death scene heartbreaking.

She belonged to the circle of friends around Ernst Moritz Arndt, and corresponded with him and other notable writers, including Friedrich Schleiermacher. She took care of family members, and supported education for the lower classes of the population.  Life  Born Charlotte Helene Henriette Pritzbuer in (now part of Sundhagen), she was the daughter of Theodor Pritzbuer (1731-1819), the local pastor, and his third wife, Helena Dorothea Margarete von Hellstr√∂m, who died in 1816. In 1787, the family moved to the small town of Garz on the island of R√ºgen, where her father became pastor at the St.-Petri-Kirche. Charlotte Pritzbuer, inspired by her parental home, acquired an extensive education, mainly as an autodidact. On 3 September 1797, she married Johann Philipp Pistorius (1767-1823), the second son of pastor Hermann Andreas Pistorius, who was an administrative assistant to her sick father. After the death of her father-in-law in 1798, her brother-in-law Christian Pistorius (1765-1823) moved in with the young couple. Since 1807 her husband had suffered from a lung disease, from which he died in 1823. The marriage had remained childless. Her brother-in-law died the same year, leaving her alone in the vicarage. From 1825 to 1826 she kept the household of the widowed professor Karl Schildener in Greifswald, but then returned to Garz. She devoted herself to charitable causes, such as further education for the lower classes of the population. In 1833 she took in her brother-in-law Karl Pistorius and cared for him until his death in 1844. Charlotte Pistorius maintained an extensive correspondence. She had known the influential historian Ernst Moritz Arndt since her youth, and they later became friends. Arndt dedicated several poems to her. Correspondence between them has been published in several editions of his letters. As early as 1796 and 1797 she corresponded with Ehrenfried von Willich, who later became a friend of theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher. Schleiermacher met her in 1804 during his visit to R√ºgen on the occasion of Willich's wedding. She corresponded with him for over ten years, discussing subjects such as literature - including the works of the author Novalis - and religion. She was friends with Charlotte von Kathen, who had already been in correspondence with Arndt and Schleiermacher. Through , the mayor of Stralsund, she was inspired to conduct her own studies on the history of R√ºgen. She sent essays and drawings to the , which were partly used in the . In addition she wrote a biography of her father. She left a collection of unpublished poems and poetry drafts. Pistorius died in Garz at age 72.

Administratively it belongs to the NE Greenland National Park area. History The bay was named as \\"Mackenzie‚Äôs Inlet\\" by William Scoresby in 1822, who saw it from a distance and couldn't make out well its shape. Scoresby named it in honour of Scottish geologist and mineralogist Sir George Steuart Mackenzie (1780‚Äì1848). During the 1869‚Äì70 Second German North Polar Expedition this body of water was surveyed by Carl Koldewey, who observed that it was a bay and renamed it \\"Mackenzie Bay\\" () In 1922 a Norwegian hunting, meteorological and radio station was built by a small recess or cove at the head of the bay and was named \\"Myggbukta\\" owing to the many mosquitoes there. The station would become the most important outpost of Norwegian presence in the area, but it was abandoned in 1959. Geography The bay lies in Northeastern Greenland, by the northern shore of Foster Bay, between the eastern end of the Gauss Peninsula and the southern shore of the isthmus area of Hold with Hope. Cape Bennet is the southwesternmost headland. The ice conditions in the bay depend from the prevailing winds and tides.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 121 See also *Erik the Red's Land References External links *UWM Libraries - Greenland, Northeast entrance to Mackenzie Bay Category:Bays of Greenland ","title":"Mackenzie Bay"},{"id":"61782534","text":"Krasny Khutor () is a rural locality (a selo) in Belgorodsky District, Belgorod Oblast, Russia.

After the death of Governor Pieter Hackius's on 30 November 1671, Godske was appointed to succeed him with the title of Governor and Councillor Extraordinary of India. For the time it took him to arrive at the Cape, first the Political Council and from 23 March 1672 to 2 October 1672, the secunde, Albert van Breugel, acted as governor. Early life Godske was the eldest son of Johan Goske of Holstein, an armourer to the Prince of Orange, and his wife Aefgen Ijsbrants of the Hague. His birthday is unknown, but, in a legal document dated 12 September 1671, his age is given as forty-five. Career In November 1654, Godske was holding the rank of merchant in the VOC and a member of a mission to the king of Kandy, in Ceylon. From 1656 to 1661 he commanded the important VOC office at Galle, Ceylon. Godske left the Company's service in 1661, but then decided to take part in the conquest of Cochin under Rijckloff van Goens and only returned to the Netherlands in September 1662. Godske also distinguished himself as a soldier in the sieges of Colombo and Mannar Island. In March 1664 Godske again left for the East Indies and while at the Cape, in 1665, recommended a suitable site for the new fort or castle which was to replace the existing Fort de Goede Hoop. On 11 November 1665, two days after his arrival at Batavia, he became commander of Dutch Malabar and on 1 September 1668 director of the VOC factory at Gamron in Persia, a position he held until 1670. As commander of the return fleet he arrived again at the Cape in 1671. During his three and a half weeks stay at the Cape, he made several decisions concerning the fortification of the settlement and made many recommendations about administration in the instructions which he left for Commander Pieter Hackius. This experience led to his appointment as Governor in October 1672. During his tenure, the Castle was finished and the Hottentots-Holland district was opened on the western edge of settled lands with its own cattle station. He also waged early battles in the Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars with the raiding Khoikhoi chief Gonnema. He served for four years and started off concentrating on social legislation, including establishing the first Orphan Chamber (, a body dedicated to resolving estate issues) in 1674. Godske was sent to preserve the peace at the time of Third Anglo-Dutch War. Needed in the Netherlands after the war's end, he returned there in 1676.
