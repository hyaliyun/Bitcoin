It was produced by Utpal Kumar Das and features ensemble cast, including Victor Banerjee and Bishnu Kharghoria. The film was released at mobile cinema on 13 March 2014.  Plot  In a remote riverside a plaque was accidentally discovered from a burial. It reveals that something had happened to this person at the hands of the British. The people assumed he was a freedom fighter, hence a martyr and proper recognition should be given to him. The government declared to erect a statue in honour of the great martyr as an attempt to gain political advantage. But there was no reference, not even a photograph which can form the basis of the statue. The children of the martyr's family try to figure out their ancestor's face by looking through the hereditary characteristics that are passed onto genetically. They examine the faces of different generations to discover similarity and commonality to create the 'probable' person. But gradually they realized that a real man is found not in his appearance but in his works, so they try to discover and evaluate his deeds. Meanwhile, the older people are busy in digging out orthodox caste matters, the youths are busy more in the celebration aspects and the government is busy in trying to score political issues. At last, the children thought that they have found the real man and give shape to their understanding in the form of a play, through which people get a look into the past of a person, of the village, of the times.

Subsequently, in 1913, they were classified as a Primitive tribe. Then they were omitted from the list of communities listed as tribes in the 1931 census. Again, they were omitted from the Scheduled Tribe list drawn up in 1950. In 2004, the Government of Jharkhand recommended that they should be listed as a Scheduled Tribe rather than Other Backward Class. The Tribal Research Institute recommended against this proposal, claiming they are a sub-caste of the Kunbi and thus different to tribal people. In 2015, the Government of India also refused to approve the recommendation after a careful consideration. Culture The traditional occupation of Kudmi is agriculture. The language of Kudmi is Kurmali. The Kudmis are divided into six divisions. Paribar (family) is the smallest unit.

During this upheaval, Nero overturns a lamp, which leads to the burning of Rome. This he blames on the Christians and orders a general persecution, in which Acte dies.

The three storey house was built in 1742 in red brick to an H-shaped floor plan. A pedimented doorcase is approached by a double flight of steps. The estate had belonged to the Trevor family since medieval times and was at one time the home of Bishop John Trevor, who built the original Llangollen Bridge in 1345. The present house was built for John Lloyd of Glanhavon, Montgomeryshire, who in 1715 had married Mary Trevor, heiress of the Trevor estate. A carved stone on the outside of the house has their initials, the date 1742, and the Latin motto Dum spiro spero (whilst I breathe, I hope). Ownership passed to the Rice Thomas family when the last Lloyd heiress married Rice Thomas of Coed Helen near Caernarvon. They extended the house and occupied in until 1820, after which it was let to various tenants, including the manager of the local ironworks, a shipping broker from Liverpool, and ultimately the Edwards family, owners of the Trefynant Fire Clay Works of Ruabon. James Coster Edwards was High Sheriff of Denbighshire in 1892. The Edwards family carried out various improvements designed by Oswestry architect W.H. Spaull and occupied the hall for three generations, after which, in 1956, the property reverted to the Coed Helen estate. They had no use for the house and it was sold to a local timber merchant, who felled the trees and planned to demolish the house. Saved by a Preservation order in 1961, the hall was acquired by the WRVS, but damaged by fire in 1963. It was then purchased by a local farmer and equipped with a flat roof for use as a cowshed. The property was purchased in 1987 by Michael Tree, then a chartered surveyor of the Crown Estates, who undertook its restoration before selling it in 1998 to Louis and Louise Parker, who further restored the grounds and interior. It now functions as a country hotel. The former GWR Hall class locomotive 5998 was named after the hall.

She developed a lifelong interest in entomology and later developed an interest in genetics and in particular the way that the patterns in zebra skins were inherited. She had a lengthy correspondence with James Cossar Ewart Professor of Zoology at University of Edinburgh who himself had a professional interest in the development of the horse. The correspondence relates to the possibility of cross-breeding zebra with horses to reduce the impact of tsetse fly on horses in Africa.

His works address the themes of the invisible world and spirituality, religions and pagan (notably Celtic) beliefs, fables and legends, and the fantastic.  Investigative Essays  His first investigative essay, published in 1987 by Ramsay, was dedicated to the literary journalist Bernard Pivot. Favourably received, it was qualified by Philippe Schuwer in Communication et Langages as ¬´ a study that approaches hagiography without having the faults ¬ª.√âdouard Brasey, L'effet Pivot in Communication et langages, 1988, vol. 75, n¬∞1, p. 122-123 √âdouard Brasey thereupon interested himself in the esoteric with l‚ÄôEnqu√™te sur l'existence des Anges Rebelles in 1995 and the Enqu√™te sur l'Existence des F√©es et des Esprits de la Nature in 1996, published by Filipacchi and J‚Äôai Lu.  Literature of the Imaginary  √âdouard Brasey at Imaginales 2008. In 1995, the writer specialised in the domain of legends, notably following an apprenticeship with the story-teller Henri Gougaud. Between 2005 and 2012 he wrote a collection of fables, Le Cabinet Fantastique, as well as collections of fantasy, French fiction, esoteric writings, essays and illustrated books at √âditions Le Pr√© aux Clercs. He authored numerous publications in this domain.  Novels  He has also published twelve novels since 1994, in the fields of thriller, crime novel, historical novel or story inspired by legend. = Le Dernier Pape = In Le Dernier Pape (The Last Pope, √âditions T√©l√©maque 2013, Amazon Kindle e-book 2012 and 2014), the pope is dead. While the pretenders to his succession intrigue in the corridors of the Vatican, gruesomely bloody ritual murders profane places of worship, an atrocious homage to the martyrdom of Saint Peter. Two thousand years ago, the apostle cast on Rome, the place of his torture, a curse that seems ready to accomplish its purpose: a cosmic menace is about to eliminate the seat of Christianity. This esoteric thriller is inspired notably by the prophecy of Malachie, and the prophecy of the third secret of F√°tima.Laur√®ne Daycard, Le Pape au c≈ìur d'un thriller, 11 February 2012, Le Figaro √âdouard Brasey published Le Dernier Pape in March 2012 in electronic format at Amazon under the title La Proph√©tie de Pierre, generating 3000 downloads in three months. He subsequently published it with √âditions T√©l√©maque in January 2013, anticipating by a few weeks the abdication of Pope Benoit XVI, which occasioned numerous articles and interviews in the national and international press. In 2014 √âdouard Brasey published an update to his novel in electronic format under the definitive title Le Dernier Pape et la Proph√©tie de Pierre, to integrate the latest developments concerning the Vatican, notably the election of Pope Fran√ßois. The book is regularly classified among the best-sellers in electronic format on the platforms Amazon.com and Amazon.fr.,Les 32 romans de Fant√¥mas seraient aujourd'hui diffus√©s en num√©rique, ActuaLitt√©, July 26 2014 the new edition generated more than 2000 downloads in two months. For Israel Hayom, Edouard Brasey, ‚Äúa science-fiction writer known for penning thrillers‚Äù, this novel is eerily similar to the real-life events unfolding in the Vatican. The book‚Äôs protagonist is a pope who finds himself in the middle of numerous scandals, yet even a sci-fi guru like Brasey couldn‚Äôt stretch his imagination to the point where he envisioned the pontiff resigning from his post [...] I wrote this book in 2011 amidst all of the scandals that were being discussed at the time, and which were vividly manifest this past summer with the Vatileaks affair\\". The newspaper insists of the fact that ‚ÄúBrasey, a former journalist, was the most sought-after pundit in France this week. Everyone wondered how he managed to sniff out such a significant scoop and present his readers with the story of a troubled pope, so similar to real life. (‚Ä¶)‚ÄùThe Vatican's Game of Thrones, Isra√´l Hayom Corine Pirozzi, The Huffington Post, tells that \\"√âdouard Brasey entices us into an adventure totally captivating, fascinating in its occult accents and gives birth to an esoteric thriller of high quality\\".Laur√®ne Daycard, ¬´ Le pape au c≈ìur d‚Äôun thriller ¬ª, Le Figaro, 11 February 2012 \\"√âdouard Brasey has just published a book that presents strange coincidences with actual events at the Vatican. Ex-journalist converted to writing fantastic novels, √âdouard Brasey has not given up getting scoops.\\" Philippe Vallet, on the radio France Info, 3 February 2013, think that \\"The Vatican will always light up the imagination of novelists. Witness Edouard Brasey who has published (‚Ä¶) a thriller which mixes the illness of a Pope, the intrigues for his succession, senseless murders and a cosmic menace. A novel researched and fascinating.\\" For Julie Malaure, ¬´ Quand le pape se meurt ¬ª, Le Point, 31 January 2013 \\"those who (‚Ä¶) thrill with excitement at each revelation made about the Vatican, who twitch at the evocation of secrets that deliberately obscure the Church, will find a great pleasure of reading in this esoteric thriller. Because the prolix Brasey (‚Ä¶) here shows all his generosity.\\" Franck Ferrand of Europe 1 sees this novel as \\"written exactly in the line of Anges et D√©mons by Dan Brown\\". He salutes the action scenes and the numerous references, the \\"Renaissance d√©cor of Saint Peter and the Vatican\\" alternating with \\"ultra-modernity\\", adding only the overall impression and inspiration ¬´ \\"conspirator\\", but only \\"that which is proper to all these big novels. We are squarely in a conspiracy theory\\".Franck Ferrand, ¬´ Au C≈ìur de l‚ÄôHistoire ¬ª, Europe 1, 19 February 2013 = Historic and legendary novels = Les Lavandi√®res de Broc√©liande (Editions Calmann-L√©vy, 2012, Le Livre de Poche, 2014). With Les Lavandi√®res de Broc√©liande, Edouard Brasey inaugurates a new genre, that of historic and legendary novels of the earth, inspired by popular beliefs, in which the action takes place in Brittany: during All-Saints Day, 1943, Gwenn, a young orphan, discovers one of her fellows, a washerwoman, drowned in the washing basin of Concoret, a small village on the edge of the forest of Broc√©liande. Dahud, the oldest inhabitant, and mother of the victim, incriminates the washerwomen of the night, these supernatural creatures that, according to Breton legends, wash the bloody clothes of their still-born infants. The malediction continues to haunt the washerwomen of Broc√©liande. This novel has been favourably received by Le Courrier Ind√©pendant. it's followed with Les Pardons de Locronan and La Sir√®ne d'Ouessant His next novel, due to appear with Calmann-L√©vy in 2015, is a crime novel in which the action takes place in Haute Provence at the beginning of the 1960s, L‚ÄôAffaire de la Cabre d‚ÄôOr. = Fantasy = On 20 June 2009 √âdouard Brasey received the Prix Merlin in the novels category for Les Chants de la Walkyrie, the first volume of the cycle La Mal√©diction de l‚ÄôAnneau (Belfond editions, 2008 - 2010). He received a bursary for creation from the Centre National du Livre for his writing. Valeurs Actuelles writes that \\"√âdouard Brasey makes the ancient Nordic sagas sing, the legend of the powerful Ases and the magnificent Vanes. A remarkable work that holds together a fantastic narrative and lyric poetry\\". For Nicolas L., SciFi-Universe, 24 November 2008, \\"eminent French specialist in the universe of fairies, folklore, myths and legends, √âdouard Brasey offers us, with La Mal√©diction de l'Anneau, the fruit of a colossal work of compilation carried out from diverse sources, such as l'Edda, La Saga des V√∂lsung or l'Anneau du Nibelung.\\" Plume- libre.com insists on the \\"titanic work where we sense the love of √âdouard Brasey for all that touches from near or from far the imaginary and the fantastic, to take on such a monster might seem a little reckless but the author knew how to respond to the challenge with brio and brings us a new insight into a myth that has not finished making us dream.\\"  Encyclop√©dia  L‚ÄôEncyclop√©die du Merveilleux (Editions Le Pr√© aux Clercs, 2005, 2006, 2007 et 2012) collects more than creatures of surnatural world: fairies, elves, imps, mermaids, dwarfs, dragons, unicorns, griffons, gargoyles, werewolves, vampires trolls, Cyclopes, giants, ogres, titans‚Ä¶ with their description, their geographic and mythological origin, their habits and their history. The sources of this work were found in history, legends, Celtic, Greek-Roman, Germanic or Nordic mythology, literary or cinematographic creations. This work is made up of three volumes: Des peuples de la Lumi√®re, Du Bestiaire Fantastique and Des Peuples de l'Ombre (2005 and 2006), re-edited into a single volume entitled La Petite Encyclop√©die du Merveilleux in 2007 and La Grande Encyclop√©die du Merveilleux in 2012.

Life Sheppard was baptised at Whitminster, Gloucestershire, at the end of 1595, and entered the Middle Temple in 1620; he was called to the bar in 1629. He lived in Horsley and enjoyed a large country legal practice. About 1653 Sheppard was invited to London by Cromwell, and made one of the clerks of the upper bench. In 1656 he became a serjeant-at-law, and was nominated with three others to prepare the charters granted to town corporations. In September 1659 he was appointed chief justice in North Wales, by the Rump Parliament. After the Restoration of 1660 Sheppard was deprived of his offices and left public life. He had six children: John (a clergyman), Elizabeth, Sarah, Samuel, Anne, and Dorothy. Works Sheppard wrote legal and religious works: * The office and duties of Constables, or tythingmen ‚Ä¶ and other lay ministers. Whereunto are adjoined the several offices of church ministers and church wardens, London, 1641; 4th ed. 1657. * The Court Keeper's Guide, London, 1641; 7th ed. by William Brown, 1685. * A Catechism, London, 1649. * Four Last Things, 1649.

Collections =Television news= The tape collection consisted of 24/7-coverage of Fox, MSNBC, CNN, C-SPAN, CNBC, and other networks‚Äîrecorded on up to eight separate VCRs stationed throughout her house. She had a husband and children, and family outings were planned around the length of a VHS tape. Every six hours when the tapes would be ending, Stokes and her husband would run around the house to switch them out‚Äîeven cutting short meals at restaurants to make it home to switch out tapes in time. Later in life when she was not as agile, Stokes trained a helper to do the task for her. The archives ultimately grew to 71,716 (originally erroneously reported as 140,000 in the media) VHS and Betamax tapes stacked in her home, and apartments she rented just to store them. She became convinced there was a lot of detail in the news at risk of disappearing forever, and began taping. Her son, Michael Metelits, told WNYC that Stokes \\"channeled her natural hoarding tendencies to [the] task [of creating an archive]\\". Her collection is not the only instance of massive television footage taping, but the care in preserving the collection is very unusual. Known collections of similar scale have not been as well-maintained and lack the timely and local focus. = Macintosh computers = Stokes bought many Macintosh computers since the brand's inception, along with various other Apple peripherals. At her death, 192 of the computers remained in her possession. Stokes kept the unopened items in a climate-controlled storage garage for posterity. The collection, speculated to be one of the last of its nature remaining, sold on eBay to an anonymous buyer. =Others= She received half a dozen daily newspapers and 100-150 monthly periodicals, collected for half a century. She accumulated 30,000-40,000 books. Metelits told WNYC that in the mid-1970s, they would frequent the bookstore to purchase $800 worth of new books. She collected toys and dollhouses. Television producer From 1967 to 1969 Stokes co-produced a Sunday morning television show in Philadelphia called Input, with her husband John. Its focus was on social justice topics.  Legacy  Stokes bequeathed her son Michael Metelits the entire television collection, with no instructions other than to donate it to a charity of his choice. After a stringent process of considering potential recipients, Metelits gave the collection to The Internet Archive one year after Stokes' death. Four shipping containers were required to move the collection cross-country to Internet Archive's headquarters in San Francisco, a move which cost her estate $16,000. It was the largest collection they had ever received. The group agreed to digitize the volumes, a process which was expected to run fully on round-the-clock volunteers, costing $2 million and taking 20 digitizing machines several years to complete. As of November 2014, the project was still active. A documentary about her life, Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project, was directed by Matt Wolf and premiered at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival.

This company leased the facilities to the company Centro de Paracaidismo Costa Brava, the professional skydiving management firm. The business name of the aerodrome, which until then had been Centro de Paracaidismo Costa Brava, changed to Skydive Empuriabrava in 1985. In 1987, Anglo Costa Brava de Inversiones sold the concern to the company F√≥rmula y Propiedades S.L. Centro de Paracaidismo Costa Brava, the company in charge of the skydiving operations and tenant of Anglo Costa Brava de Inversiones, continued with the same lease arrangement for the facilities. It was in this period that the aerodrome won acclaim in Europe for its work. Centro de Paracaidismo Costa Brava, owned by the American partners Mitch Decoteau, Mar√≠a Peterson and the Swiss Roland Hilfiker, brought the method known as AFF (Accelerated freefall) to the aerodrome. This is an innovative method for teaching skydiving that involves a tandem jump with a professional instructor, which places skydiving within everyone's reach and does not require specific training (it is even available for people with physical disabilities). In 1986, Jaime Comas Espigul√© joined the company. In 1985, work at the aerodrome involved five people and the company did not own any light aircraft: a Cesna 207, the first used at Girona airport, was rented. The first Pilatus was not bought until 1987, two years later. The period from 1985 to 1994 saw the first milestones on a European scale. Jumps at Empuriabrava aerodrome rose from 12,000 to 35,000 a year. By 1985 it was now one of the few aviation centres open continuously throughout the year. The Christmas Boogie, an international event for skydivers who meet to take part in unusual competitions and group jumps, attracted 1,000 registered participants in 1987 and had to be moved to Girona Airport so that aircraft such as the DC-3 and the Caribou could be used. Freefall and precision landing jumps were performed and in 1992, with the arrival of the Olympic flame for the Barcelona Olympic Games, a demonstration freefall jump featured a representation of the five Olympic rings. The aerodrome changed hands again: in 1994, Peter Jones, Ivan Coufal and Jaime Comas Espigul√© bought Centro de Paracaidismo Costa Brava and jumps at the aerodrome rose to 134,000 per year, making it the aerodrome with the highest number of jumps in the world. The meetings and exhibitions that had been staged for years became increasingly consolidated benchmarks on the world skydiving calendar. The mild winter temperatures of the Empord√† region turned the Boogie Christmas meeting into Europe's largest event and required a much larger fleet of aircraft to cater for the 12,000 jumps. The Speed Star competition, which involves ten skydivers from the same team forming a star formation as fast as possible in the air, became a characteristic feature of the event. This was also a period of records and the site became home to the Spanish Formation Skydiving team and the French Freefly World Champion team. It also offered the highly spectacular discipline of wingsuit flying. In order to rationalise the business situation after all the aerodrome's changes of ownership over the years, in 2005 Skydive Empuriabrava acquired F√≥rmula y Propiedades SL, which it owned until 2012 when the company was bought by a sovereign wealth fund from Dubai through the company Skydive Dutch BV. From that time onwards, investments were made in the facilities with a view to making it a key centre for skydiving lovers. It has now been the centre with the highest number of jumps in Europe since 1998. = Timeline = * 1985: Opening as a professional skydiving centre with a staff of 5 people. In the first year of operations alone, 25,000 jumps were made, thus making it Europe's leading aerodrome for number of jumps per year. * 2001: the 134,000 jumps per year mark was reached. It became one of the world's top three skydiving centres. * 2003: with 1,000,000 jumps made from the facilities since 1985, it became the world's first skydiving centre to reach this mark. The Generalitat of Catalonia used the occasion of the millionth jump to award Castell√≥ d'Emp√∫ries the status of Sports Tourism Destination (DTE) for skydiving. It now had 40 staff and a number of associated satellite companies. * 2013: 2,000,000 jumps made since it opened, with a yearly average of 100,000 jumps. = Facilities = Beechcraft 99 In addition to the hangars, packing zone, private team rooms and onsite gas station, it has Pilatus Porter aircraft, a De Havilland Twin Otter and a Beechcraft 99 (plane with the fastest take-off in Europe). The facilities also include offices and a bar and restaurant zone. Access is free.  Services  It offers tandem skydiving, beginner's flights and aerial photography work. The school offers formation skydiving courses for beginners and advanced students, freefly canopy, wingsuit flying (or wingsuiting), formation skydiving for top competition, training for top competition, and flight instruction for professionals.  Competitions  Olav Zipser Space Ball and Space Games Skydive Empuriabrava not only holds rallies, seminars and minor competitions, but has also hosted top world sports events. It has organised the eighth World Formation Skydiving Championship (1989), two World Cups (1994 and 2002) and the fourth World Freestyle and Skysurfing Championship (1993). The 1993 Championship was attended by Patrick de Gayardon (inventor of skysurf and modern wingsuit flying), Olav Zipser (considered the father of the freefly discipline), Mike Michigan (freestyle pioneer) and Marco Manna, considered the all-time best freestyler. It also hosted the ninth Formation Skydiving World Cup (1994), the third POPS World Championship (1995), an Extreme Games (1996), the first Spanish Freestyle and Skysurfing Championship (1997), the first European 16-Way Formation Skydiving Championship (1998), the first 16-Way Formation Skydiving World Cup (1998), the twenty-fourth Spanish Skydiving Championship (2002), the thirteenth Skydiving World Cup (2002) and the twenty-fifth Spanish Skydiving Championship (2003). From 2004 to 2006 it also hosted the King of Swoop competitions (initially known as the Beach Swoop Challenge), one of the world's most spectacular skydiving contests that brings together specialists in swooping, which is a landing technique based on speed, distance and precision. This competition has been reinitiated in 2014. Since 1989, and particularly since 1993, it has been the venue for Spanish, European and world competitions in different skydiving disciplines, notably freestyle, POPS, extreme games, swoop, skysurfing, freefly and canopy formation skydiving. = Records set at the facilities = The following records have been set at the facilities: * 2004 Women's European Canopy Formation record * 2005 Spanish Canopy Formation Skydiving record, with 25 skydivers * 2005 European Freefly record, with 28 skydivers * 2007 European Freefly record, with 40 skydivers * 2009 European Freefly record, with 51 skydivers * 2011 European Freefly record, with 80 skydivers * 2012 World Horizontal Freefall Speed record, reaching the 304-km/h mark. * On 5 October 2012, the Swiss Marc Hauser set a first world record in speed tracking, a discipline he founded.Marc Hauser's 'Speed Tracking' website The measured ground speed was 188.9 mph (304 km/h) over the dropzone of Skydive Empuriabrava, Spain. Only a specially adapted skydiving suit was used (no wingsuit, tracking suit, nor additional weights were used).*\\"A specially- developed suit made for this speed flight will support Marc in using his body perfectly and release maximum power.\\" by Tom Naef, Skydiving Professional, Speed Tracking.com, retrieved 25 February 2014 * 2013 European Freefly Record, with 96 skydivers * 2013 World Sequential Formation Skydiving record, with 106 skydivers * 2014 Guinness Record, tandem jumping to get 35 jumps in one hour when the record was in 28. * 2015 European Freefly Head Up, with 21 skydivers = Participation in world records = In order to promote the sport, the aerodrome supports highly ambitious sportspeople involved in official competitions or in setting world records. It has also been the training site for the Spanish National Skydiving Team and for other national teams that trained here prior to becoming world champions. Examples are the Swiss, the English women's team, the Belgian and the Russian teams, and the French team that was World Champion in 2003. This team included the French Babylon Freefly team, still currently considered the world leader as well as an organiser of top events and jumps, the school of which has run training at Empuriabrava since 2003. Skydive Empuriabrava has also been the training site for members of the \\"Wings Project\\" since it began, and later for different challenges such as the 15-km Strait of Gibraltar jump record in 2005. The Empuriabrava Skydive team takes part in skydiving demonstrations worldwide and has achieved the following records: * 1999 largest freefall World Record, Ubon Ratchathani (Thailand), 282 skydivers. * 2003 largest freefall World Record: 13 December 2003, Eloy (Arizona), 300 skydivers * 2004 largest freefall World Record: 6 February 2004, Korat (Thailand), 357 skydivers from around the world established a freefall formation at 280 km/h, which remained intact for exactly 6 seconds at a height of 24,000 feet (7,315 metres). The challenge, held to mark the 72nd birthday of the Queen of Thailand, brought together the world's best jumpers on a historic occasion. Three skydivers from the Empuriabrava-Red Bull team (Santi Corella, F√©lix √Ålvarez and Toni L√≥pez), plus Alain Dony, took part at the event. * 2005 canopy formation World Record: Lake Wales (Florida), 85 skydivers. The head of the canopy formation flying school, Alain Dony, took part. * 2006 freefall formation World Record: February, also in Thailand. This time 400 skydivers from around the world established a freefall formation that stayed intact for 4.25 seconds. = Wings Project = After a project in Norway, in 1999 members of the aerodrome team Santiago Corella and Toni L√≥pez, together with high-risk sportsman √Ålvaro Bult√≥, came up with what was known as the \\"Wings Project\\" (\\"Proyecto Alas\\"), a professional skydiving and BASE jumping team whose objective was to tackle four challenges and overcome natural elements in special conditions such as relief, temperature (extreme heat or cold) or lack of oxygen, and skydive freefall with wingsuits. The initiative and training originated at Skydive Empuriabrava. While rising to these challenges, they twice beat the world record for human freefall flight, which they themselves had set.  Awards  The constant flow of skydivers and accompanying parties and seasonal continuity has established a regularity that has earned Skydive Empuriabrava the \\"Espiga i Tim√≥\\" Award of the Council of Castell√≥ d'Emp√∫ries, the 22nd Tourism Night Award from the Girona School of Tourism, and the Association of Tourist Apartments \\"Sun of the Costa Brava\\" Award. In 2003, the Generalitat of Catalonia used the occasion of the millionth jump to award Castell√≥ d'Emp√∫ries the status of Sports Tourism Destination (DTE) for skydiving, in acknowledgement of the facilities. In 2010, the Generalitat of Catalonia recognised its outstanding contribution to tourism in Catalonia by awarding it the Tourism Diploma of Catalonia.  Exhibitions and collaborative projects  Tandem Skydive * Participation in reception of the Olympic flame at Emp√∫ries for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games with a demonstration freefall jump featuring a representation of the five Olympic rings. * Participation in the opening of the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games at Barcelona's Montju√Øc Olympic Stadium (1992). * January 1997, a jump to show solidarity with ETA kidnap victims, Jos√© Antonio Ortega and Cosme Delclaux. * Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix. * Formation of a black ribbon in freefall to show solidarity with the victims of the terrorist attacks of 11 March in Madrid (11 April 2004). * Collaboration with Dal√≠ Year on 8 October 2004, with a freefall representation of Dal√≠'s painting Christ of Saint John of the Cross. * Collaboration in several editions of Channel TV3's fundraising \\"Marat√≥\\". * Since 2005, it has worked with the Children's Dream Foundation to make the dream of children with cancer and other serious illnesses a reality.  Book of honour  Its reputation as a stage for European and world titles, the quality of the challenges held at the facilities and its location on the Costa Brava attract famous sportspeople and public figures from different fields, and have made it a venue for the celebrations of other companies. World acclaimed sportspeople from different disciplines, such as tennis players Juan Carlos Ferrero and Sergi Bruguera, motorcyclists Adam Raga, √Älex Crivill√© and Sete Gibernau, racing driver Marc Gen√©, world motorcycling champion Valentino Rossi, Formula 1 champion Michael Schumacher, taekwondo expert Joel Gonz√°lez, swimmer Clara Basiana and sports-adventurer √Ålvaro Bult√≥, have jumped here. One famous anecdote is the story of Marta Ferrusola, wife of former President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Jordi Pujol, who made her first parachute jump from the facilities. It has also been used as a set for films and music videos. In the year 2000, Fatboy Slim's music video \\"Bird of Prey\\" was filmed here, as were the exteriors, in March 2004, for the skydiving chase scenes from the French production Secret Agents, featuring Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel. Later, in 2011, it was used to shoot the exteriors for the skydiving scenes from the feature Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (You only live once), one of Bollywood's most successful films.

A piece of Holy Cross in which Lord Christ was crucified and relics of many Saints are preserved in this Monastery. Mary's baptismal basin, and an image of Virgin Mary painted by the apostle St. Luke can also be viewed in the Church. History records that the site was visited by many ancient pilgrims from the West as well as the East, including the Bordeaux Pilgrim in 333 A.D., St. Cyril of Jerusalem in 348 A.D., and Saint Sylvia of Aquitaine in 385 A.D. This is the center of the Syrian Orthodox (Syriac) community, which was established by the apostle St. Peter. In the 6th century the community was persecuted and its leadership was later reestablished by Jacob Baradaeus; for this reason they are also known as ‚ÄúJacobites.‚Äù After the Syriac Orthodox Church lost its other churches and properties in the Holy City, St. Mark's became the seat of the Archbishop of Jerusalem. The first known bishop to have lived there is Ignatius III in the year 1471. The monastery was rebuilt a few times, once by Metropolitan Gregorius Shem\`un in 1718 and again by \`Abdel Ahad Ben Fenah of Mardin in 1719 who also took care of restoring the manuscripts in the monastery's famous library. During the following century the monastery was restored at least five times, the last in 1858 after which it was left intact. St. Mark‚Äôs monastery was rebuilt a few times: in 6th century AD, 1009, 1718, 1791, 1833, 1858, and in 1940.

Freud described as the 'Exceptions' those who because of early narcissistic injury felt that they were subsequently entitled to special privileges in life, in ongoing compensation.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 499 His description has been extended to include an early sadomasochism in the experience of being victimised.E. S. Person ed., On Freud's A Child is Being Beaten (2013) p. 41 Freud explored the paradox whereby people become neurotic or punish themselves through illness, not as a result of failure but of success, illustrating his theme by way of Ibsen's Rosmersholm, among other examples.Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (1994) p. 48 He saw the cause as an intense (if unconscious) sense of guilt, which sought relief in the punishment of suffering from what is felt as an unjustified degree of success.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 457 In the shortest of his three studies, Freud highlighted the way an unconscious guilt feeling could precede, indeed precipitate a criminal act‚Äîproviding a feeling of relief that the guilt-feeling could at least be attached to something concrete.Judith Butler, Undoing Gender (2004) pp. 169‚Äì71 However such rationalisation may backfire, leading to a vicious circle of guilt/crime/increased guilt/further crime.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) pp. 371‚Äì3 and p. 499 Behind such driven guilt, Freud saw the ambivalence and sense of omnipotence underlying the Oedipus complex‚Äîthemes taken up and extended by Melanie Klein.J.

The tradition began in 1956, when the market of Gouda was decorated with a large Christmas tree, lit by candles in front of the old medieval town hall. It is the oldest and largest 'Christmas lights evening‚Äô of the Netherlands. The tree is now bestowed each year by the Norwegian sister town of Kongsberg, the result of a personal initiative of the then Deputy Mayor Hagedorn of Gouda. A few years earlier during a jazz music festival in Gouda, he had met with the musical group Kongsberg byorkester, and they talked about how lovely the dark square would look with a large tree with lights in the market square. The Norwegian Christmas tree is a tall one, between 50 and 60 feet (17‚Äì20 meters). During a ceremony in presence of an official delegation of the two sisters towns, the tree is cut in the woods of Kongsberg and shipped off. After a long journey from Norway via England to Rotterdam Port it gets transferred to a large truck which brings it to Gouda. Here the school children welcome the tree during a short arrival ceremony and they bring it to the Market Square, where people from Cyclus (a Gouda company) decorate the tree and prepare it for the Gouda by Candlelight festival. Two years after the beginning in 1956, the ‚ÄòGouda Kaarsenfabriek‚Äô (candle factory) celebrated its 100th anniversary. This led to a plan to not only illuminate the tree but also all the windows of the medieval town hall and all houses around the market with candles. Until 2012 Candle light evening always took place either the second or third Tuesday in December. Around 7:30 pm the Christmas tree was lit by the Mayor of Gouda, in the presence of the mayor of Kongsberg, the people of Gouda and other national and international guests and visitors. During the evening ceremony the street and shop lights are extinguished and during a community singing spectacle the market square and adjacent streets are lit up by thousands of candles, provided for free by the main sponsor of the event, Gouda Candles (Bolsius). Gouda by Candlelight starts around 2 pm and over the years the programme has been extended and renewed every year. Every year new forms are sought and music groups invited by a group of volunteers who organize the event. Gouda by Candlelight took place on a Friday since 2013. The dates for 2014 was 12 December and the 60th jubilee edition will be on 11 December 2015. Every year about 20,000 people visit Gouda during this weekend. The 50th edition in 2005 attracted thirty thousand visitors from the Netherlands and abroad, including then-Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. Gouda extends its Christmas atmosphere to the weeks after Gouda by Candlelight with a Candlelight Shopping evening on the following Saturday, and an ice skating track starting a few days later. To improve sustainability, since 2008 the Christmas tree has been decorated with 10.000 LEDs instead of the standard 200 bulb lamps. The LED lighting consumes much less power (800 watts) than incandescent bulbs (5300 watts). After the Christmas period the tree is taken down and recycled, and several art works have been made of the tree by artist Jan Mosterd.

Biography =Early life= He was born into a Brazilian family of Lebanese origin. At 14 years old, after an unsuccessful career as a rower, Hatem started learning catch wrestling at the Associa√ß√£o de Crist√£ de Mo√ßos in Rio de Janeiro. From his childhood he received the nickname of \\"Tatu\\" (\\"armadillo\\") for his short, stocky build, which did not impede him from showing skill for the art. His main teacher was the legendary Orlando Americo da Silva or \\"Dud√∫\\", who also taught George and H√©lio Gracie and defeated Geo Omori in a match. =Fighting career= After years of training, Euclydes turned professional and got into the fighting circuit of the time, which fluctuated between catch-as-catch-can and vale tudo. In 1935, after gaining success upon beating names like the Italian Attilio and the Brazilian Bogma, Euclyes took part in the first international wrestling championship held in Brazil, winning after submit the veteran Kutter. Just one month after, Hatem (now known as \\"Mestre Tatu\\" or simply \\"Tatu\\") was pitted against a 300 ib wrestler nicknamed \\"M√°scara Negra\\" (\\"Black Mask\\"). He lost the match after 40 minutes, but the audience left convinced of his talent, moreover for the fact that M√°scara was suspected to be the famous Wladek Zbyszko. Hatem became known for his skill with chokeholds, to the point many opponents only fought him if this kind of move was forbidden. In 1937 Tatu faced Japanese judoka Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda‚Äôs colleague and Brazilian Navy‚Äôs hand-to-hand instructor. Actually, Hatem and Yano had trained together before a match between Takeo and H√©lio Gracie, but both left personal feelings outside the fight. Characteristically, Hatem won the match by choke. Yano requested a rematch and it took place after two months, but with the additional rule that Euclydes would have to wear a judogi. This rule gave the advantage to Yano, who won when his second attempted hip throw made Tatu take a bad fall and get his shoulder injured, turning an easy prey. Euclydes resumed competing after healing, moving to Porto Alegre to find more opponents. In another of his most known matches, he submitted Luiz Stock, who protested and demanded another round only to fall again to Hatem. Three years later, Hatem participated in the Copa Mundial Benito Valladares, where the winner would face French wrestling champion Charles Ulsemer. Not only did Tatu win the qualifier, but he also drew with Ulsemer. They faced again two months after, and this time Euclydes won by armlock in a match refereed by Oswaldo Gracie. Tatu and Ulsemer became close friends after this result. Hatem continued moving through the land, taking part in an elite tournament in S√£o Paulo where he would met opponents like Richard Schikat, Tom Hanley, Henry Piers and Kola Kwariani. Unfortunately for Hatem, the tournament‚Äôs ruleset forbade chokes, and he found himself losing matches by pinfall, but still the Brazilian press praised his effort and performance. In 1942, Mestre Tatu returned to Porto Alegre to answer the challenge written down by George Gracie, a Brazilian jiu-jitsu exponent who had also trained in catch wrestling under Hatem‚Äôs teachers. The match between them was celebrated to a great expectation, with Euclydes winning by rear naked choke at the second round. According to Brazilian historians such as Elton Silva, many people erroneously think he won the match via an Americana lock because of a newspaper picture from the match, but that picture was from the first round and George had managed to escape from that lock. Supposedly, he showed himself so dominant that Brazilian promoters dismissed the chance of a rematch, which Gracie didn‚Äôt ask anyway. After an unbeaten tour through Argentina in 1947, Hatem had a rubber match with his old enemy Takeo Yano, winning again by submission. The same year, Tatu was pitted against Russian superheavyweight Leon Falkenstein, nicknamed \\"Homem Montanha\\" (\\"Mountain Man\\") for his 330 ib and large height. Falkenstein had contacted Hatem to discuss the possibility of a worked match, but Euclydes refused, and negotiations got so heated that newspapers echoed them. However, when the match happened, Hatem defeated him in only 37 seconds. The Russian demanded a rematch after training with several vale tudo exponents, but results were again a victory by submission for Tatu. =Retirement= Tatu ended his career in the 1950s. After his retirement, he founded a gym and started teaching his fighting style of luta livre, though he did not quite stayed away from fighting; in one occasion, Valdemar Santana came to his gym to challenge him, being immediately defeated by Hatem. After this, promoters proposed a fight between Tatu and H√©lio Gracie, but the fight never happened, as Gracie demanded his opponent to wear a gi and Hatem refused. Hatem focused himself on teaching, passing his knowledge to the brothers Carlos and Fausto Brunocilla until his death in 1984.

The Community came to an end in 1989. The concept of the Farncombe Community arose out of visits Sister Carol Graham, a former Anglican missionary and ordained deaconess of the Church of South India, made to the inter-denominational community of in Switzerland, which led her to reflect on the ecumenical lessons the CSI could teach the rest of the Church. A base was found for the Community at 5 Wolseley Road in Farncombe, the home of Anglican spiritual director Fr Reginald Somerset Ward and, after his death in 1962, the house‚Äôs owner, Deaconess Edith Banks, passed the property to the British Council of Churches for the purpose of housing the new venture. The house was dedicated in 1964 and the Community inaugurated under its Rule in January 1965. Revd Eric Abbott, Dean of Westminster Abbey, George Reindorp Bishop of Guildford, and Brother Paul of Taiz√© all took part in the ceremony. The Sisters lived a quasi-monastic life based around silent prayer, the recitation of a morning and night Office and a weekly Eucharist in the house chapel celebrated by a variety of clergy according to different rites, and tasks around the house. Apart from this, the work of the Community centred on welcoming guests who came on retreat or for quiet days, working with the local Christian Churches on ecumenical matters, and outreach; this included the Companions who came to number more than a hundred, and the Fellowship of Prayer for Unity, which was technically the charitable title of the Community but in practice was a wide group of well- wishers from all Church traditions. The Sisters also organised events to popularise the idea of ecumenism in general. At the age of 75 Sisters were to retire and leave the Community. However it was always hard to recruit new members and the Community never numbered more than six Sisters. Most of the Sisters were from an Anglican, Methodist or CSI background; one, Dorothy Bee, was a Roman Catholic. In a sense the culmination of the Community‚Äôs work came in 1987 with the Swanwick Conference of the British Council of Churches at which the organisation was renamed Churches Together in Britain and Ireland with the intention of involving laypeople in ecumenical efforts rather than just Church ministers and officials. Sister Mary Holliday, one of the first women to be ordained as a Methodist minister, had been Chaplain to the conference and organised its worship. By the late 1980s there were only three remaining Sisters, all from a Nonconformist background. The Community finally came to an end in July 1989, a few months after the death of Sister Carol, and the remaining Sisters dispersed. For a while the work was continued by the Ecumenical Spirituality Project led by Gwen Cashmore and Joan Puls, who left 5 Wolseley Road in 1994, then subsequently in a dispersed form by the Fellowship of Prayer, which carried on until 2000, and lastly the Living Spirituality Network, based at Willen in Milton Keynes, which came to an end in 2012.

Always looking for comfort in every aspect of life, Robin soon moves to Hyderabad to recover a plot of land belonging to his family that was grabbed by Settlement Durga (Ashish Vidyarthi). After challenging Durga that he will recover his land, Robin moves into the house of Pandit Ravi Teja (Brahmanandam), an astrologer who was behind Durga‚Äôs action of grabbing the land. Robin begins to make Pandit‚Äôs life miserable. A wannabe writer, Chaitra (Rakul Preet Singh), is also smitten by Robin, and is rejected by her, who however poses the condition that should he fall in love with her anytime before he leaves for Virginia, he would stay back with her. Meanwhile, a group of villagers from Vilaspur, a small town ruled by a ruthless landlord, Solomon Singh Thakur (Ravi Kishen), are sent to follow Robin, who is believed to be the godsend who will save the village from the Thakur. Robin is successful in recovering his land, and minutes before his departure, realizes that he has caught feelings for Chitra. He attempts to meet her but witnesses her get kidnapped by the villagers. A diary of hers reveals that she belonged to Vilaspur, prompting Robin to travel there to meet her. On arrival, the villagers stage a drama to ensure that Robin stays in Vilaspur for as long as possible and gets into a tussle with the Thakur. However, the attempts of the village is often belittled by one of the villagers, Venkataratnam (Tanikella Bharani), himself. Thakur‚Äôs son, Munna (Kabir Duhan Singh) arrives at Vilaspur, and in a state of intoxication, rapes a young girl in plain sight, who was the daughter of one of the villagers. This is all hushed up in front of Robin to keep the drama going. Eventually, a misunderstanding comes up during a festival, leading to a duel between Munna and Robin. The former ends up in a coma, but is recovered by Robin himself, who challenges Thakur to get Munna to fight him a second time. Munna and Robin meet yet again, and Munna ends defeated once more. When he shows fright to face Robin a third time, Thakur kills his own son. The entire village is taken hostage by the Thakur, which has been deserted by Robin, who has found out that the villagers were conning him. However, a change of heart at the railway station because of Venkataratnam causes Robin to come back for the villagers and face Thakur. In a turn of events, Thakur‚Äôs army is revealed to have turned against him for Robin, and in a final duel, Robin injures and subdues the Thakur, leaving his fate to the villagers.

Early life There remains doubt over John March's background. D. A. Orr in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography tentatively identifies him with the John March admitted to the degree of B.C.L. 27 November 1632, as a member of St. Edmund Hall, Oxford; and more confidently with the John March of Barnard's Inn in 1635, of Gray's Inn in 1636, and called to the bar in June 1641. Long Parliament employee An Argument or Debate in Law of the great question concerning the Militia (1642) by March argued the legality of Parliament's moves to raise troops. By early 1644, March was working for the Committee of Both Kingdoms. On 20 August 1649 the Council of State nominated him as one of four commissioners to go to Guernsey; three years later (6 April 1652) he was chosen by the Council of State to Scotland, with three others to administer justice in the courts. In 1656 March seems to have been acting as secretary or treasurer to the trustees for the sale of crown lands at Worcester House. He died early in 1657. Works March's legal works were: * An Argument or Debate in Law of the great question concerning the Militia as it is now settled by Ordinance of Parliament, by which it is endeavoured to prove the Legality of it and to make it warrantable by the Fundamental Laws of the Land, London, 1642.

A second edition, also of 1648, added The Second Part of Actions for Slanders, with a Second Part of Arbitrements, together with Directions and Presidents to them very usefull to all Men. To which is added Libels or a Caveat to all Infamous Libellers whom these distracted times have generated and multiplied to a common pest. A third enlarged edition by W. B. was published in 1674. *Reports, or New Cases with divers Resolutions and Judgments given upon solemn arguments and with great deliberation, and the Reasons and Causes of the said Resolutions and Judgments, London, 1648; contains the reports from Easter term 15 Caroli I to Trinity term 18 Caroli I). * Amicus Reipublicae, the Commonwealth's Friend, or an Exact and Speedie Course to Justice and Right, and for Preventing and Determining of tedious Law Suits, and many other things very considerable for the good of the Public, all which are fully Controverted and Debated in Law, London, 1651. This work was dedicated to John Bradshaw, and discussed 18 questions (such as common recovery, arrest for debt, the burden of the high court of chancery, bastardy, and privilege of clergy.) * Some New Cases of the Years and Time of Hy.

He was born at Clifton, Bristol and died at Datchet, then in Berkshire, now in Buckinghamshire. Kington was the son of Thomas Kington of Charlton House, Wraxall in north Somerset; he was educated at Harrow School and in 1851 he matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, although there is no record that he completed a degree at Cambridge University. He played cricket at Harrow, and appeared in the Eton v Harrow match in 1851, but there is no evidence that he played at all at Cambridge. In January 1855, he was named as one of the founding \\"resident members\\" of the new Melbourne, Australia branch of Miles and Kington, the family firm and a Bristol-based company of \\"General Agents and Commission Merchants\\", alongside William Augustus Mackworth, who had earlier played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and Manchester Cricket Club. Both Mackworth and Kington were elected members of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce in May 1855. Kington was also elected to the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club in October 1855.

It is a vast depression lying in the northeastern section of M'Sila Province and the western end of Batna Province. Geography The Hodna region has a length of about 120 km in an NW - SE direction and a width of about 80 km. It is characterized by the Chott El Hodna, an endorheic salt lake, in its centre with seasonal brackish and saline pools and marshes. A thin film of water collects during wet seasons on the level terrain of the large lake basin, which becomes a salt flat when it dries. The elevation of the lake's surface is slightly below 400 m, while the surrounding steppe-like plain, characterized by wadis and oases, averages between 500 and 600 meters in elevation in the communes near the lake. The Hodna natural region gives its name to the Hodna Mountains located to the north. Its southern limit is marked by the Ouled Nail Range. There are no mountains in its western limit, where the plateau stretches further westwards. The northern part of the Hodna is composed of silt and the southern part is mainly sandy. The lowest area of the basin is covered by the sebkha, the salt lake, with a surface of 76 000 ha of naked salty clay that is seldom covered with water and is completely devoid of vegetation.The Annotated Ramsar List: Algeria The Hodna is a steppe where the climate is harsh, with very dry summers, cold winters and very irregular precipitation. Formerly all the inhabitants of the Hodna were nomads. The soil is poor and local agriculture is limited to the grazing of sheep and goats on grassy high plateau areas and to some cereal cultivation. There are uncultivated areas of djerr, small hillocks, to the north and to the east. The mountains have good reserves of water and there are freshwater springs in the area, but historically they have not been properly exploited.J.

Footsies (footsy, or footsie) is a flirting game where two people touch feet under a table or otherwise concealed place, often as a romantic prelude. It is a game played either as an act of flirtatious body language, or simply for enjoyment. Although footsies is not inherently romantic, the nature of it as playful touching is often done between lovers as a sign of affection, and most often without discussion. The term comes from a 1940s humorous diminutive of foot. Effects In a 1994 study on secret relationships, participants (college students from the US) played a partnered card game in which a subset were instructed to play footsies with their card playing partner. Of these, individuals whose footsies was kept a secret rated the attractiveness of their partner significantly higher than either those who did not play footsies, or those whose footsies was publicly known.  Law  Playing footsies is not sexual molestation according to a decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation in Italy in 2000.

She is an asylum seeker who arrived in Ireland and became suicidal after discovered she was pregnant as a result of a rape in her home country. At the time, Ireland's abortion laws limited abortion in nearly all cases. She was unable to travel to the UK for an abortion, and after a hunger strike the High Court granted an order to hydrate her against her will. After the 1992 X Case judgement, abortion should be legal in cases of suicide, and the then newly introduced Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 allows abortion in those cases. Her baby was delivered via caesarian section, but there is ongoing controversy over whether the government handled the case appropriately. Case details On 28 March 2014 a foreign national, with limited English arrived in Ireland. She claimed to have been raped in her home country. She discovered she was pregnant on 4 April, when she arrived in Ireland, and she sought an abortion. On 1 July 2014, she attempted to travel to the UK via ferry, but was arrested upon arrival for illegally entering the UK. She said that she felt suicidal, and the two psychiatrists on the panel decreed that she indeed was suicidal but that her pregnancy had proceeded to the point of viability, so that she could not access lawful abortion under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.M√°ir√©ad Enright & de Londras, ‚Äú‚ÄòEmpty Without and Empty Within‚Äô: The Unworkability of the Eighth Amendment after Savita Halappanavar and Miss Y‚Äù (2014) 20(2) Medico-Legal Journal of Ireland 85 She then went on hunger strike.

It is particularly used In undergraduate level nursing education, where students are first being socialized into nursing professional practice  Central philosophy  The nursing theory is based upon the philosophy that students need to experience holism and empowerment in the classroom to not only have a positive learning experience, but to integrate holism and empowerment in their own professional practice. Examination of power structures and cultural perspectives is supportive of diverse student populations, and therefore diverse patient populations.  EHNE principles  thumb EHNE principles are the basis of the theory as Love identified. They are described as: Prior knowledge: Knowledge and experience the student brings is the foundation from where learning begins. Meet them where they are: Making teaching responsive to the diverse learning needs of students, and where the teacher learns from the student. Interconnectedness: Experiencing our connection to one another, being present, and growing together. Self-Care: Nurturing ourselves so we may nurture others. Contextual Teaching and Learning: Addressing the environmental factors that influence readiness to learn, such as mind-body-spirit imbalance, values and beliefs, with culturally appropriate education and holism.  Support modalities  Nurse educators are encouraged to integrate 1) complementary and alternative modalities (CAM) into their classrooms and 2) Praxis: Reflection and Action: 1) All CAM can be used to start class, before/after exams, or as a whole class to experience directly. These modalities have been used in nursing classrooms for this purpose: * Guided imagery * Meditation * Progressive muscle relaxation * Tapping * Aromatherapy * Drumming * Belly dancing * Yoga * Breathing 2) Reflection of personal bias, world view, experiences, and values is done as a part of experiential learning experiences. Supporting students from diverse backgrounds such as race, class, religion, and the LGBT community leads to the diversification of the profession and socializes nursing students how to support diverse patient populations.

It spans a portion of the Winnipesaukee River just east of downtown Tilton, providing access to Tilton Island Park, located on an island in the river. Built in 1881, it is a rare surviving example of a bridge with cast iron components, designed by a distinctive patent issued in 1858 to Lucius Truesdell. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Tilton Island Park Bridge is located at the eastern end of downtown Tilton, extending from the northwest shore of the Winnipesaukee River to the wooded Tilton Island Park. It consists of two Truesdell truss spans, which rest on granite abutments and a central granite pier. The bridge is in length, and wide. Its trusses are made of cast iron, using a patented design similar to that of Ithiel Town for wooden lattice bridges. The principal innovation in Lucius Truesdell's 1858 patent was the clamps which fix the lattice members together where they cross, providing additional rigidity, and a series of horizontal and vertical members which are integrated into the diagonal lattice members. The decking of the bridge is wooden planking laid over crossbeams that rest directly on the lowest truss members. The decking is stabilized by diagonal bracing tie rods fastened beneath these elements. The bridge was manufactured by A. D. Briggs & Company and installed in 1881 by J. R. Smith. It, along with the park, was a gift to the town by Charles Tilton. Albert Briggs, the builder, apparently specialized in the construction of Truesdell patent bridges; this is one of the few of the design known to survive. It is also rare for its survival despite the use of cast iron, which later gave way to more weather-safe wrought iron and steel.

This limited- run serial stars G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez as a sweet, simple girl who leaves rural Mexico for Miami in the US to fulfill her destiny in the chocolate business. Elements of this romantic soap opera resemble Ugly Betty, the Tammy films, The Beverly Hillbillies and No Holds Barred. Lionsgate Home Entertainment and Xenon Pictures released a four-disc DVD set of Dame Chocolate in the US on November 27, 2007. The abridged version runs over 13 hours. It includes English subtitles and carries a TV-PG rating.  Plot  An awkward, shy girl named Rosita Amado (G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez) grew up in the village of Xochilcacahuatel with humble, uncultured relatives who worship Ek Chuah, an ancient idol. When her grandfather Juan Amado (H√©ctor Su√°rez), known as \\"The Chocolate King\\", dies, she is the only person left who knows the secret Mayan recipe that built his corporate empire. While Rosita has a curvaceous body, she also has a big nose and buck teeth. She falls madly in love with charming chocolatier Bruce Remington (Carlos Ponce), the handsome heir to a candy factory, Chocolate Supremo. Their lives will interlace when Juan chooses her to take his place and teaches her the secret recipe. Rosita heads to Florida to fulfill her grandfather's last wish, bringing her deaf great-aunt Dulce (Mar√≠a Antonieta de las Nieves), her uncle, Diosdado (Ricardo Chavez), and the rest of her extended family with her. (Telemundo publicity referred to them as an \\"assortment\\" of \\"uncouth relatives.\\") Meanwhile, Bruce's mother Grace Remington (Kristina Lilley), an unscrupulous and overly ambitious woman (and Juan's stepdaughter) is claiming that the factory is near bankruptcy and ruthlessly plots against Rosita, becoming the young girl's most dedicated enemy. Grace wants the inheritance and the secret recipe and enlists the help of her son's lover Samantha Porter (Karla Monroig) to talk Bruce into seducing Rosita. When Bruce realizes that he truly loves Rosita, his mother has already plotted her downfall. Rosita must confront the Remington and fight for her grandfather's legacy. Meanwhile, √Ångel P√©rez (Khotan), a brutal, dangerous man from the past, threatens Rosita's fresh start. Rosita finds romance, deception and betrayal as she searches for true happiness in a new world. She learns about the dangers of hatred, jealousy and vengeance. The heroine finds herself caught between two powerful forces: love and chocolate. To continue the story, Bruce was going to marry Rosita, so of course his mother and Samantha tried to stop it by lying to Rosita and saying that Bruce was actually going to marry Samantha instead of Rosita. Rosita was heartbroken and she left the state with √Ångel, swearing revenge on the Remingtons and Samantha Porter. Somewhere in Texas, she escaped an explosion at a restaurant and survived, but her family, friends, and enemies all assumed her dead. Rosita was then kidnapped by a criminal, and met a man who promised to make her better looking. Rosita went to a show and transformed into a sexy, beautiful lady by way of plastic surgery that fixes her nose and teeth. She met again with Bruce (with her name changed to Violeta) and Bruce was attracted to her and pursued her. Bruce suspected that Violeta is Rosita, but Violeta was clever and didn't let Bruce know who she really was, and avoided showing Bruce her back since Rosita had a birthmark on her back and so did Violeta. All through this, Samantha was jealous that Bruce loved Violeta and ended up dying. Later on Rosita finds out that Bruce really loves Violeta and tries to leave before it gets any worse, but Bruce kept pestering her and they ended up making love a few times. But Rosita was really afraid of hurting Bruce and ruining him once he finds out that she is really Rosita, and it doesn't help either that later on she begins to suspect that he is in fact innocent, and it was all Grace's fault, and he was oblivious to the plans of her downfall. Rosita then continues on with her plans of revenge and takes legal action against the Remingtons because of all the pain they put her through and how they stole her grandfather's factory away from her, and took her inheritance back. Once Bruce finds out that Violeta and Rosita are the same person, he is really angry, but then spills his heart out to her, and she ends up rejecting him. This leads him to hate her. Bruce, in an attempt to move on, falls mildly in love with, and marries Samantha's twin sister, Debora. Bruce later finds out that Lorenzo, the gardener at his home and the man who saw him grow up and knows everything about him, is in fact his biological father instead of the late Mr. Remington, due to a night spent with Grace Remington herself. Rosita continues being good friends with Fabi√°n, and this makes Bruce insanely jealous because of how Fabi√°n once told him that he liked Violeta, and he was always by Rosita's side. But besides that fact, Rosita continued to love Bruce and Bruce loved her even though he was married. Rosita realized that she was pregnant with Bruce's child, and when she went to tell the news to Bruce, she encountered Debora at his apartment in nothing but one of Bruce's shirts, and Rosita immediately assumed the worst. So Bruce doesn't find out about the baby until much, much later. Bruce finds out about the pregnancy one night when he comes to Rosita's house with plans to see Lorenzo, but encounters Rosita in the pool instead. He sees her bare belly and she admits that she is pregnant. Debora and Fabi√°n at least realized that their couples didn't love them, so they vowed to allow Bruce and Rosita space to rekindle their love. Rosita was kidnapped by √Ångel and Grace after a party for months until it was almost time for the baby to be born. Rosita told Grace that her child was Bruce's, and she changed her mind about killing the baby because she hadn't known this, so she attacked √Ångel so Rosita could escape once she began to go into labor. Grace ended up killing √Ångel, in the tussle that ensued and got stabbed herself in the process. Finally when Rosita escaped from √Ångel she found a place to give birth in the basement of a house, Bruce was called by Grace and she told him where Rosita was, and he found Rosita while she was in labor and helped her to give birth to their baby. At the end √Ångel died by getting stabbed by Grace's hand, and Grace died because she went a little crazy at the end and followed the face of Juan Amado into a lake and drowned. Bruce and Rosita ended up together again with their child.

All three performers moved to other Telemundo serials. Ochmann left for Marina, Leon went to La Viuda de Blanco and Elias joined Zorro: La Espada y La Rosa. They were replaced by Carlos Ponce, Karla Monroig, and Khotan Fern√°ndez. In addition, Venezuelan singer Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez, father of star G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez was also announced as part of the cast, but did not appear. Along with cast changes, Telemundo also made a major story shift. Rosita was originally to love √Ångel P√©rez, who was engaged to another woman. The story that aired portrayed √Ångel as a villainous murderer and sexual predator. After leaving Marina, Ochmann eventually rejoined the cast of Dame Chocolate. He took the role of Fabi√°n Duque, a fashion photographer who falls for Rosita. His first air date was on June 13, 2007.  Product placement  Telemundo made product placement deals with The Clorox Company, Ford, IKEA, and other companies to promote their brands during the show. Clorox cleaning products can be seen throughout the Remington home, for example. These product placements are digitally altered to match the products available in each country airing the show. In addition, characters made excursions to Lowe's, Wal-Mart and Universal Studios Florida. Also, IKEA designed two bedroom sets for the show, \\"designed to reflect the culturally distinct style of two of the Latina characters.\\" It displayed the furnishings in selected stores. The promotion also planned \\"program vignettes\\" during the broadcast, featuring actresses Karla Monroig and Kristina Lilley. Wal-Mart received a \\"featured role\\" on Dame Chocolate. Part of an episode was filmed at a supercenter in Hialeah, Florida Wal-Mart also agreed to do promotions in stores and online. The chain previously did a marketing deal for Watch Over Me.  Production notes  As with most of its other soap operas, Telemundo broadcasts English subtitles as closed captions on CC3. Originally, it scheduled 120 installments and extended its run to 130 episodes. This show is also known as Sweet Secret. It is filmed in Miami and some scenes were shot on location on the Rickenbacker Causeway. The name Dame Chocolate is a bilingual pun. It means \\"give me chocolate\\" in Spanish. It also implies that Rosita fills the role of dame of chocolate, referring to the traditional English title of nobility. G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez was made less attractive with a false nose and teeth to play the innocent Rosita. = Ratings = Telemundo touted Dame Chocolate as a ratings success, with May 2007 sweeps ratings up 34 percent among Hispanic adults ages 18‚Äì34. The show also won its time slot among those viewers in New York and Miami. The next month, Dame's time slot (which included one soccer preemption) averaged 591,000 core adult viewers (ages 18 to 49), according to Nielsen Media Research. = Dame Chocolate in other media = Latin Lunch ‚Äò‚ÄôTop Chef 3 Miami‚Äô‚Äô shot the \\"Latin Lunch\\" episode (in English) on the Remington Mansion exterior set featuring Rodriguez and Lilley, along with Natallia Streignard of Las Brujas De South Beach. Contestants were told to create an authentic Latin meal. The episode debuted on Bravo on July 18, 2007.. One contestant mentions \\"Dame Chocolate\\" is \\"huge in Mexico\\", although it was never widely broadcast in that country.

It extends from Central Street in the west to Bridge and School Streets in the east, including all of the buildings on the north side of this section, and a cluster of buildings on the south side near Bridge Street. The area has long been a commercial and industrial center for the town, although most of the buildings now date from the late 19th century onward, and include a fine array of Victorian architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The area that is now Tilton was part of a colonial land grant made in 1748 and first settled in 1764 as part of Sanbornton. The first bridge in the area over the Winnipesaukee River was built near the site of Tilton's Bridge Street bridge in 1763, and the first sawmill and gristmill opened on the river in 1765-66. The area between the bridge and the mills became what is now Tilton's Main Street. A store was opened near the bridge in 1798, and it is home to Tilton's first church, the 1838 Greek and Gothic Revival Northfield-Tilton Congregational Church, which still stands and is the district's oldest building. The village's growing economic independence prompted its eventual separation from Sanbornton in 1869. The district includes a single block of Main Street, which runs roughly east‚Äìwest, parallel to the Winnipesaukee River. Its eastern boundary is the junction with Bridge Street, where there are two memorials to the town's war dead. It extends westward on the north side of Main Street about 2/3 of the way to Prospect Street, and for a shorter distance on the south side. Prominent buildings include Tilton's town hall, built in 1879-80 as a gift by the town's major benefactor, Charles E. Tilton. It was probably designed by Edward Dow, who also designed the 1872-73 Trinity Episcopal Church, a fine example of stone Gothic architecture.

Giuseppe Velasquez, Velasques or Velasco (December 16, 1750 - February 7, 1827) was an Italian painter, active in a Neoclassic style. Biography He was born at Palermo into Spanish family. At the age of 15, he changed his surname to that of the Spanish painter Diego Velazquez. He studied painting under Gaetano Mercurio and Giuseppe Tresca, but was influenced by Gioacchino Martorana. He often collaborated in providing the decoration for the structures built by the architect Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia. He was patronized by the viceroy Caramanico, for whom he painted his portrait. In 1805 he became Director of the Accademia del Nudo in at the University of Palermo, supplanting the painter Mariano Rossi. One of his pupils was Francesco la Farina (1778 - 1837).Effemeridi scientifiche e letterarie per la Sicilia, Editor Ferdinando Malvica, Tipografia di Filippo Soli, Palermo (1839), page 92.

It is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia. Aptara's services include content production, digital publishing, data conversion, editorial services, eLearning and technology development, legal content solutions, and business process outsourcing (BPO). Its customers include publishers, information aggregators, professional societies, universities and corporations worldwide. The company has operations in Noida, Sec-60, Pune, Dehradun and Kerala, India. Aptara is considered one of the leading knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) companies in India.  History  The company was founded in 1988 as TechBooks, Inc. by a sibling entrepreneurial team, including Rakesh Gupta, Neal Gupta and Anita Gupta. In 1999, TechBooks acquired York Graphic Services, which became its print division. After integrating York's content preparation business into its own operations, TechBooks sold the division under its former name in 2001. The sale was part of the company's strategy for focusing on its core businesses at the time: data conversion and production of cross-media content. In 2001, the print group accounted for about $8 million of TechBooks' $54-million revenues. In 2000, TechBooks had 1,100 employees in New Delhi, India, and 500 at operations in Pennsylvania, California, and Virginia. Total revenues approached $60 million in spite of a difficult environment for tech firms. Its rate of growth was sufficient to land it a spot on the Inc. 500 list of up and coming small companies. Around this time TechBooks acquired a couple of content preparers, including The PRD Group of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania and The GTS Companies of Los Angeles.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3480000095.html By August 2005, TechBooks raised a total of $24 million in three rounds of funding from various investors. In August 2005, equity firm American Capital, Ltd. made an investment of $45 million in TechBooks to support the company's recapitalization. In the same month, TechBooks acquired online learning firm Maximize Learning, which was based in Pune, India. At that moment, the number of TechBooks' employees reached around 2,900. The company's total revenues were $60 million in 2005. Later, American Capital and its associates made further investments of $50 million in the company to support its growth. In September 2006, TechBooks acquired Los Angeles-based Whitmont Legal Technologies, which provided litigation support services. At that time, TechBooks employed more than 4,000 workers. In October 2006, the company opened its new main office in Falls Church, Virginia. (Previously it was based in Fairfax, Virginia; both cities are in the Washington metropolitan area). In January 2007, TechBooks changed its name to Aptara, Inc. According to Aptara, the decision to change the name was related to the company's aspiration to reach markets outside of the publishing industry. The company planned to apply its \\"content transformation expertise to other markets, such as legal services and the financial and automotive industries\\". On February 7, 2012, American Capital sold Aptara, Inc. to iEnergizer, a publicly traded UK company, for $144 million. The equity firm has earned 17% compounded annual rate on its investment in Aptara. At the time of the sale, Aptara had roughly 5,000 employees.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Laconia District Court is located south of downtown Laconia, on the east side of Academy Street a short way south of Court Street. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, with load-bearing brick walls with granite trim. It is topped by a tall mansard roof and a square belfry with pyramidal roof. The front facade is seven bays wide, with a stepped appearance. A three-bay section, continuing the mansard roof, projects at the center, and the main entrance pavilion, capped by a gabled roof, projects from that. A stone stringcourse separates the first and second floors of the central section, and its second-floor windows are set in recessed panels. The entrance is in a wide round-arch opening, and the bay above has two sash windows, with a recessed decorative half-round panel above. Laconia's first high school used the old building of the Gilford Academy, and was by the mid-1880s overcrowded. The present building was completed in 1887. It housed the city's high school students as well as the local district elementary school. It was used by the city as a high school until 1922, and then as the Academy Elementary School until 1975. The building received a major rehabilitation in 1977 and was converted for use as a courthouse at that time.

Biography Pyotr Petrovich Pertsov was born in Kazan, a son of Pyotr Petrovich, the youngest of the four Pertsov brothers. His uncles Vladimir, Konstantin and Erast were well-known journalists; the latter, a poet, in 1831-1832 was closely linked to Alexander Pushkin. Pyotr Pertsov studied in the 2nd Kazan Gymnasium. In 1887 he enrolled into the Kazan University to study law. He graduated in 1892. In 1890 Pertsov published his first poems in Saint Petersburg newspapers Nedelya (Week) and Novosti (News) to some favourable reviews, including the one by Afanasy Fet. In 1892 he became friends with Nikolai Mikhaylovsky and joined the staff of Russkoye Bogatstvo, then a liberal narodnik's magazine, as a head of the bibliography department. The infatuation with narodnichestvo, though, was short-lived and a year later Pertsov quit. In 1894, engaged by his new friends, Valery Bryusov, Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Fyodor Sologub, he started to contribute to Severny Vestnik, the Russian Symbolist movement's early tribune. In 1895 Pertsov compiled and published the Young Poetry (–ú–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞—è –ø–æ—ç–∑–∏—è) compilation, featuring the works by Balmont, Bryusov, Minsky and Merezhkovsky. It was followed by another compilation in 1896, Philosophical Trends of Russian Poetry (–§–∏–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ø–æ—ç–∑–∏–∏). It was Pertsov who inspired Merezhkovsky to release his acclaimed book of essays The Eternal Companions. Portraits from the World Literature (1897). He published the early works of Vasily Rozanov and introduced the latter to the Symbolist circle. In 1898 Severny Vestnik closed and in 1902 Gippius and Merezkovsky invited Pertsov, now a popular literary entrepreneur, to join their newly founded magazine Novy Put as an editor/publisher. This entailed a series of disagreements, and in 1904 Dmitry Filosofov succeeded Pertsov as a formal head of this publication. In 1906 Pertsov (whose works were published regularly by Mir Iskusstva, among other magazines) became the editor of newspaper Slovo‚Äôs literary supplement. In the early 1910s he started to actively contribute to Alexey Suvorin-led Novoye Vremya. =1917-1947= After the 1917 Revolution Pertsov resided in the Kostroma region, lectured at Kostroma University, worked in the Narkompros' museums department. In 1927 the collection The Correspondence of V.Y.Bryusov and P.P.Pertsov came out, featuring the first 32 (of 173) Bryusov's letters from Pertsov's archive. He published several museum guidebooks and the Literary Memoirs. 1890-1902 (Academia, 1934), all the while working on his magnum opus The Basics of the Cosmonomy which remained unfinished. Neither occasional publications, nor lecturing brought Pertsov much money; he received no pension and lived in poverty. Only in 1942 friends helped him to become a member of the Soviet Union of Writers. Pyotr Petrovich Pertsov died on May 19, 1947. He was buried at the Alekseyevskoye Cemetery in Moscow. The obituary signed by Shchepkina-Kupernik and Shyusev among others, was sent to Literaturnaya Gazeta, which refused to publish it.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 April 2020 Life Jan Anton van der Baren was likely born in Brussels. He became court chaplain to Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, the Governor of the Spanish Netherlands, who resided in Brussels. He accompanied the Archduke on his return to Vienna in 1656 and remained there until his death. Still life with pumpkins In Vienna he became director of the picture gallery of the Archduke, one of the most extensive art collections in Europe at the time. Van der Baren compiled an inventory of the collection in 1659, although he probably did not himself draft the German language inventory that he signed together with three other members of the Archduke‚Äôs court administration. David Teniers the Younger, who was the director of the Archduke‚Äôs collection while it was still in Brussels, painted the famous Archduke Leopold Willem in his gallery at Brussels. The painting includes a portrait of van der Baren (he is the third man from the right). Karl Sch√ºtz, Die Sammlung Erzherzog Leopold Wilhelms, in: 1648: Krieg und Frieden in Europa, M√ºnster, 1998, Volume 2, p. 181-190 Archduke Leopold Willem in his Gallery at Brussels at the Kunsthistorisches Museum After the Archduke‚Äôs death in 1662, van der Baren continued to hold the offices of court chaplain and director of the picture gallery under Emperor Leopold I. He died on 30 or 31 December 1686 in Vienna. Work =General= Glass with roses Van der Baren is regarded as an amateur painter since he did not paint professionally but was principally a priest and a court official. Not many works by his hand are known. There are 14 paintings accepted as authentic, some of them signed and dated. Most of the works are still lifes. The 1659 inventory of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm's collection shows that it included 12 works by van der Baren. The works of van der Baren in the collection comprised, besides still lifes, some architectural and park landscapes. To date no examples of works other than still lifes have been attributed to van der Baren. Some of his known still lifes include an architectural background (such as the Still Life with Pumpkins in the Kunsthistorisches Museum) or a landscape view (such as A Seascape within a Garland of Fruit in the Powis Castle and Garden, Powys, Wales, National Trust). Van der Baren‚Äôs work shows an exactness of botanical detail and an emphasis on texture and light. While his flower pieces and garland paintings were clearly influenced by the leading flower painter in Flanders Daniel Seghers, his palette is warmer than that of Seghers. =Garland paintings= Most of his still lifes fall into the category of ‚Äògarland paintings‚Äô. Garland paintings are a special type of still life invented in Antwerp and whose earliest practitioner was Jan Brueghel the Elder. These paintings typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image Garland of flowers surrounding a statue of the Madonna and Child Van der Baren collaborated on garland paintings with other painters, such as Erasmus Quellinus II and the Flemish √©migr√© painter Nikolaus van Hoy. These collaborators painted the devotional image while van der Baren painted the flower garland. An example is the Garland of flowers surrounding the Holy Family in the Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest), a collaboration with van Hoy.Garland of Flowers Surrounding the Holy Family at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Another example of this genre is the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium). =Flower pieces= He also painted still lifes of flowers in vases such as the Glass with roses in the Kunsthistorisches Museum. He also painted the Flower still life in a stone niche (Auctioned at Hampel Fine Art Auctions on 5 December 2008, Vienna, lot 263), which follows the early 17th century model of the presentation of a flower vase in a niche.Johannes Anthonius van der Baren, 1615 Br√ºssel - 1686 Wien, Blumenstilleben in einer Steinnische at Hampel Fine Art Auctions on 5 December 2008, Vienna, lot 263 He further painted still lifes of vegetables and an interesting still life showing the Gifts of the Magi with a cityscape in the background (both also in the Kunsthistorisches Museum).

But the story, getting larger and larger, took three months to be completed. The plot had a real basis, judging by Kuprin's October 15 letter to Fyodor Batyushkov. \\"What I do today is polish The Garnet Bracelet.

After his wife receives for her birthday a particularly expensive gift, Prince Vasily Shein visits Zheltkov, accompanied by Nikolai Nikolayevich, Vera‚Äôs brother, and tells him to stop pestering the Princess. Being aware that the last thread connecting him with his beloved one is gone, Zheltkov commits suicide, in the final letter asking Vera to listen to Beethoven's Second Piano Sonata.

The drug candidate was formerly known as Ebola-SNALP. TKM- Ebola is a combination of small interfering RNAs targeting three of the seven proteins in Ebola virus: Zaire Ebola L polymerase, Zaire Ebola membrane- associated protein (VP24), and Zaire Ebola polymerase complex protein (VP35).David Kroll for Forbes. 7 August 2014 FDA Moves On Tekmira's Ebola Drug While Sarepta's Sits Unused By down-regulating these three proteins, TKM-Ebola inhibits virus replication and eliminates the infection. The drug was effective in rhesus monkeys infected with Ebola. After the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, the new variant responsible for it was isolated from several Ebola virus families and the specific genomic sequence was determined. The company re-designed TKM-Ebola and renamed it as \\"TKM-Ebola-Guinea\\". In January 2014, Tekmira started a Phase I clinical trial of TKM-Ebola to assess its safety in healthy people with a dose of 0.24 mg/kg/day for seven day treatments.

The musical genre associated with such bands is known as \\"rock rolinga\\" (also known as \\"Rock Chab√≥n\\") Origins Ratones Paranoicos, with a style similar to that of The Rolling Stones, was the band that started the \\"rock rolinga\\" genre and \\"rolinga\\" urban tribe during the 1980s. The Rolling Stones had not influenced many Argentine rock bands before that point, and during the period there was a boom of pop music and glam rock. Their style soon became a success. The \\"rolinga\\" urban tribe flourished between the mid-1990s after The Rolling Stones first played in Argentina in 1995, during the Voodoo Lounge Tour. The 1990s also saw an increased number of \\"rolinga\\" bands, such as Los Piojos, Viejas Locas, La 25, Los Gardelitos, J√≥venes Pordioseros, Los Guasones and Callejeros. Their lyrics slowly departed from the classic topics of rock and roll music and focused instead on localism and the customs of poor people; but not to the point of talking about idealistic struggles or purported revolutions.Hern√°ndez, p. 278 Decline During the early to mid 2000s, the \\"rolinga\\" urban tribe started to lose popularity at the advent of the cumbia villera genre and the subculture associated with it. The subculture's decline was rather slow until it was accelerated by the Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n nightclub fire, which took place during a concert of Callejeros. Most of the leading bands broke up or changed their style, and new music styles became prominent. The political reactions to the Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n nightclub fire included increased safety controls at nightclubs in Buenos Aires, which made the concerts of small bands very expensive. The subculture remained in the suburban areas of the Gran Buenos Aires urban area, especially the western zone, which are under the administration of the Buenos Aires Province and do not enforce the same controls as the city.

Born into a poor family, he developed a taste for the fine arts early in life, as well as for the French language, which he taught into his forties. Subsequently working for the League of Nations, he turned his attention to art history, becoming a professor in the field at the University of Bucharest in 1931. Also a museum curator and magazine editor, in 1949 he established the Institute of Art History, which he led for two decades until his death. His substantial private collection is now in the hands of various institutions, while his written body of work helped lay the foundation for art history to become a serious discipline in his country.  Biography  = Education and schoolteaching = Born in C√¢mpulung, he was raised in a poor household and was marked by his mother's early death. Receiving support from several individuals and earning top marks during primary school,Andrei, p.277 he went to the national capital Bucharest to attend Matei Basarab High School, living with the family of his classmate Constantin Ionescu-MihƒÉe»ôti. He developed an artistic sensibility in these surroundings, rich with objets d'art, paintings, books and valuable furniture. Additionally, he cultivated a love of the French language, which permitted him to read numerous classic works in the original. His favorite teachers were the journalist and historian Gheorghe Ionescu-Gion, who taught history and French; and the folklorist, literary historian and journalist G. Dem. Teodorescu (Romanian language and literature). In the summer of 1900, together with other scholarship boys, he took a study trip to Greece under the supervision of Grigore Tocilescu. That autumn, following Ionnescu-Gion's proposal, he was named a teacher at Matei Basarab, which allowed him to finance his studies at the Literature and Philosophy Faculty of the University of Bucharest. It was during the following years that he deepened his appreciation for art, guided by Ioan Cantacuzino, a devoted collector of engravings. Upon graduation in 1905, he became a French language and literature teacher in Giurgiu. In 1907, he transferred to Traian High School in Turnu Severin, remaining there until 1920, including a stint as principal. Among his pupils was the future literary critic »òerban Cioculescu, who recalled him as a stern disciplinarian. During summer holidays, alone or with students and teachers, he would travel to art museums in Austria, Germany, Italy and France. He declared his support for the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, and in January 1917, during World War I, after he had condemned the German occupation authorities, he was among sixty intellectuals and bureaucrats who were arrested in Turnu Severin. Afterwards, Oprescu was sent to Bulgaria, where he was interned in a camp before being freed several months later.Andrei, p.278 Subsequently, he became an associate professor at the University of Cluj, which was located in a region that had come under Romanian jurisdiction with the union of Transylvania with Romania. At Cluj, he continued to teach French language and literature, also establishing and leading an art history seminar. While attending specialized courses in France, he became close friends with Henri Focillon, whose biography he later wrote, and whose letters to Oprescu were published posthumously. G. Oprescu: fondatorul at the George Oprescu Institute of Art History site = Professorate and Art History Institute = ICIC From 1923 to 1930, Oprescu served as secretary of the League of Nations' International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC) in Geneva; and then of the Committee on Literature and Art until 1939, when he moved back to Romania. In 1931, Nicolae Iorga invited him to join the University of Bucharest's faculty, and he became chairman of art history there. The appointment marked a turning point in art history's development as a discipline in Romania. His teaching, which reflected his research activities, laid a basis for future work in multiple topics. Aside from his teaching of Western art history, he established a course on modern Romanian art, although he steered somewhat clear of the 1920s avant-garde and modernist theory.TeacƒÉ, p.456 From 1932 to 1942, he headed the Toma Stelian Museum, donating to it many of the artworks he had purchased both at home and abroad; the museum's collection later passed to the National Museum of Art of Romania. Together with Ion D. »òtefƒÉnescu, he established and became co-editor of the review Analecta in 1942. Although only four issues were published from 1943 to 1947, it signaled a new direction toward subjects in European art and art theory in addition to modern and medieval Romanian art, as well as a less nationalist tone than that used by previous art historians.TeacƒÉ, p.455 In 1948, after the establishment of a Communist regime, he became an honorary member of the Romanian Academy. Membrii Academiei Rom√¢ne din 1866 p√¢nƒÉ √Æn prezent, at the Romanian Academy site From 1949 until his death in 1969, he headed the Academy's Institute of Art History, which he founded and which today bears his name. Although a pragmatic collaborator with the regime, he nevertheless hired marginalized or persecuted figures such as Ion Frunzetti, Alexandru Paleologu, Remus Niculescu, Emil LƒÉzƒÉrescu, P. H. Stahl and Pavel Chihaia. In 1961, he became one of a select group of individuals to have received the Communist state's second-highest honor, the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class.Vasile, p.81 During his time at the Institute, he promoted scientific research, archival and field work, and its endowment with books and documents that would later develop into a library. He also founded two journals, Studii »ôi CercetƒÉri de Istoria Artei and Revue Roumaine d'Histoire de l'Art. = Work and legacy = The Oprescu-founded Institute of Art History, located on Bucharest's Calea Victoriei In 1962, he donated a collection of 1400 drawings and 6000 engravings to the Academy. His private collection, held in his home in the Cotroceni neighborhood, was on display there until 1977, when his paintings, drawings, decorative pieces and folk art were given to the Museum of Art Collections, while his books went to the Institute. He also donated his C√¢mpulung residence to the Institute, and the building now serves to house visiting researchers. Although he began research into art history relatively late in life, in the early 1920s, his energy and longevity ensured a considerable output. Interested in a systematic approach to the subject, he also sought recognition for Romanian art abroad, publishing in France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as commissioning translations for many of the works he published in Romanian. At first focused on peasant art and on painters including Gheorghe Petra»ôcu and Ion Andreescu, in 1937 he published Pictura rom√¢neascƒÉ √Æn secolul al XIX-lea (\\"Romanian Painting in the 19th Century\\"), the first integral account of the topic. Later, he wrote on subjects including drawing, painting, modern sculpture and European art history. He published numerous studies and articles in domestic and foreign art history magazines, with the following popular publications also hosting his work: Contemporanul (1951‚Äì1969), FlacƒÉra (1954‚Äì1969), LuceafƒÉrul (1956‚Äì1966), Ramuri (1964‚Äì1969), Revista Funda»õiilor Regale (1944‚Äì1946), La Roumanie d'aujourd'hui (1963‚Äì1966), La Roumanie nouvelle (1954‚Äì1958), Sc√Ænteia (1954‚Äì1969), Sc√Ænteia Tineretului (1963‚Äì1968), Universul (1932‚Äì1947) and Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ (1937‚Äì1940).

The bomb, which lacked the fissile nuclear core, fell over the area, causing damage to buildings below. Six people were injured by the explosion of the bomb's conventional explosive load. The United States Air Force (USAF) was sued by the family of the victims, who received , . Description of incident Historical marker and access sign On March 11, 1958, a U.S. Air Force Boeing B-47E-LM Stratojet from Hunter Air Force Base operated by the 375th Bombardment Squadron of the 308th Bombardment Wing near Savannah, Georgia, took off at approximately 4:34 PM and was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom and then to North Africa as part of Operation Snow Flurry. The aircraft was carrying nuclear weapons on board in the event of war with the Soviet Union breaking out. Air Force Captain Bruce Kulka, who was the navigator and bombardier, was summoned to the bomb bay area after the captain of the aircraft, Captain Earl Koehler, had encountered a fault light in the cockpit indicating that the bomb harness locking pin did not engage. As Kulka reached around the bomb to pull himself up, he mistakenly grabbed the emergency release pin. The Mark 6 nuclear bomb dropped to the bomb bay doors of the B-47 and the weight forced the doors open, sending the bomb down to the ground below. Two sisters, six-year-old Helen and nine-year-old Frances Gregg, along with their nine-year-old cousin Ella Davies, were playing from a playhouse in the woods that had been built for them by their father Walter Gregg, who had served as a paratrooper during World War II. The playhouse was struck by the bomb. Its conventional high explosives detonated, destroying the playhouse, and leaving a crater about wide and deep. Fortunately, the fissile nuclear core was stored elsewhere on the aircraft. All three girls were injured by the explosion, as were Walter, his wife Effie and son Walter, Jr. Seven nearby buildings were damaged. The United States Air Force (USAF) was sued by the family of the victims, who received , . The incident made domestic and international headlines.

The company is located in a landmark protected building, called Synchron Stage Vienna based in the Austrian capital's 23rd district. The Vienna Symphonic Library provides virtual instruments and the digital recreation of the acoustics of famous concert halls such as the Konzerthaus and the Gro√üe Sendesaal at Austrian Public Radio ORF's broadcasting house, both in Vienna, and the Sage Gateshead concert hall in England. The technique used is impulse response resulting in an authentic digital convolution reverb. The virtual instruments are based on digital samples of solo voices and instruments as well as orchestral ensembles. The VSL software acts as an interface for the music composer to play the real instruments on a MIDI keyboard.  History  Herbert Tucmandl, founder of the Vienna Symphonic Library (2004) The company was founded in Vienna in October 2000 by Herbert Tucmandl.Herbert Tucmandl in the IMDB In the 1990s, Tucmandl, a former cellist (as a substitute member with the Vienna Philharmonic, amongst others), later cameraman, director and composer used some of the available first-generation sample libraries for the creation of his own film scores. He was unsatisfied with the sonic results of those products, mainly because they sounded too static and lacked of natural variations of the real instruments. Tucmandl began to develop a concept for a more realistic sounding orchestral sample library. In his research he concluded that single note samples were not sufficient to create a convincing musical performance. He realized that note transitions (e.g., legato) and multiple note repetitions were also needed. Tucmandl tested his concept with his own cello and managed to convince an investor to fund the new enterprise. Vienna Symphonic Library - Silent Stage (2004) As the first step, the company designed and built a custom recording facility, called ‚ÄúSilent Stage‚Äù, for recording orchestral samples. The studio is located in Ebreichsdorf, a village near Vienna. Over several years Tucmandl invited singers, musicians, ensembles, orchestras there. Many of the musicians whose playing is featured in the final VSL products are or were members of Viennese orchestras. The first product was released in December 2002, including modules for strings, brass, woodwinds and classical percussion. In 2005 the company released their own sample player, the ‚ÄúVienna Instruments‚Äù player, which during the music production on a PC (Digital Audio Workstation) runs in the plug-in formats AU, VST, AAX Native and RTAS under Mac OS X and Windows. The reverberation application was released under the brand name ‚ÄúVienna MIR‚Äù. In March 2016, the Vienna Symphonic Library business offices moved into the new recording facility at Synchron Stage Vienna. VSL ushers in a new era in April 2017 with the release of ‚ÄúSynchron Percussion I‚Äù that was recorded at the newly revitalized scoring stage. 16 percussion instruments were captured with a phase-controlled multi-microphone set-up, making it the first sample library that provides several available microphone positions also for Auro-3D mixes.

It was founded in 1861, and served a network of produce and commodities dealers across the United States. In the 1880s, it had the largest membership of any stock exchange in the United States. The exchange's structure was the first building in the world to combine wrought iron and masonry in its structural construction. It was demolished in 1957 to make way for a skyscraper called 2 Broadway. History New York Produce Exchange depicted in 1893 The produce exchange was founded in 1861, and served a network of produce and commodities dealers across the United States. In 1881, the exchange began building a structure that The New York Times later called \\"the most impressive exchange structure ever seen in Manhattan.\\" The bid for the project went to George Browne Post. Christopher Gray wrote for the Times that on the site, \\"Post built an arcaded fortress, as noble as anything in Florence, but in fiery red brick. Post made more than 4,000 drawings for the exchange, which he gave a 144-by-220-foot trading floor 60 feet high, with an off-center tower rising to 224 feet.\\" Finished in 1884, it stood on Bowling Green and was the world's first building to combine wrought iron and masonry in its structural construction. By 1885, the New York Produce Exchange had the largest membership of any exchange in the United States. In 1886, the trading in the building was described as \\"callithumpian discord\\" with \\"fiendish screeches\\" by Harper's New Monthly Magazine. The building at that point had amenities for buyers and sellers, had lounges, a restaurant, meeting halls, offices that could be rented, and a library. In the 1880s, membership was around 2,500. By 1900, the exchange was doing $15 million a day in business. After approval from the Controller of the Currency the day before, on June 21, 1920, Mechanics and Metals National Bank and the Produce Exchange Union were merged. With branches in Manhattan and a main office at 20 Nassau Street, the new consolidated institution was named Mechanics and Metals National Bank. Combined capital, surplus, and profits of the new bank were approximated at $25,000,000, with deposits exceeding $200,000,000. Membership had fallen to 500 by the 1950s. In 1953, the exchange moved to a new office building designed by William Lescaze. The Produce Exchange Building was demolished in 1957 and replaced by a 32-story tower constructed in 1958‚Äì1959, named 2 Broadway.

Biography  J√ºrgensen studied music and theater history at the University of Copenhagen from 1975 and for seven years, but had previously to his studies in musicology studied piano with professor Galina Werschenska and later at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. The combination of research in the fields of music, theater and dance has followed him since. During two periods in the late 1980s and mid-1990s, Knud Arne J√ºrgensen was a research fellow of the Danish Carlsberg Foundation. The work resulted in three English-language monographs on the Danish dancer, choreographer and ballet master August Bournonville, on whom J√ºrgensen has continued to work extensively which his considerable list of publications and several exhibitions testify to. An international theme exhibition at the Royal Danish Library, and a poster exhibition at The Royal Danish Theatre were carried out in the Bournonville jubilee-year 2005 marking the bicentenary of his birth. When Knud Arne J√ºrgensen in 1997 made his doctoral thesis (dr. phil., equivalent to Doctor of Music), it was with a music and theater historical thesis on the composer Giuseppe Verdi and the ballets in his operas, which resulted in Verdi ballet performances at the Berlin State Opera in 1999 (the ballet \\"Verdiana\\") and the Vienna State Opera in 2001 (\\"Verdi Ballet: Ein Maskenball\\"). He has furthermore written in-depth biographies of danish theater critics Herman Bang, Frederik Schyberg and Jens Kistrup and was chief editor and program author when the complete orchestral works by danish composer Hans Christian Lumbye were recorded during the period 1998-2004. In addition, he has reconstructed a number of forgotten choreographies of August Bournonville following the choreographer's original records. Knud Arne J√ºrgensen was also co-editor of the orchetral scores for the Bournonville ballet A Folk Tale (Et folkesagn) and a number of Lumbye works as a gift from the Royal Danish Library to Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II on her 60th birthday in 2000 and 70th birthday in 2010. Recently he has edited the CD- recording of Lumbye-works Fredensborgdage for the Royal Danish Lifeguards as a present on the occasion of Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II's 75th birthday in 2015.  Professional career  J√ºrgensen was from 1998 to 2010 Head of the Drama Collection, research librarian, senior researcher and subject specialist in theater and performing arts at the Royal Danish Library. From 2011 to 2017 he has worked as exhibition curator, senior researcher and subject specialist at the Copenhagen Theatre Museum in the Court Theatre, where he has completed his most recent monographs on the late Danish theater critic Jens Kistrup, (published in 2012), and the first complete and annotated edition of the plays by Danish impressionist writer, Herman Bang (published in 2016). He has also been a Fellow at the Danish Academy in Rome from 2011 to 2012, where he has been working on editing and publishing the score for the Italian baroque opera Il Valdemaro by the Neapolitan composer Domenico Sarro, a work that represents one of the earliest operas based on a Scandinavian theme, and which appeared for the first time on print in a new critical edition in 2013. Knud Arne J√ºrgensen, who has been a member and trustee of several professional boards, has published more than 30 Danish and international monographs in the field of music history and the performing arts and well over hundred scientific papers and essays. He has curated more than 20 Danish and international thematic exhibitions, guest lectured at the University of Copenhagen as well as at a large number of foreign universities, museums and theater institutions in the United States, Russia, Austria, Italy, France and Germany.

Geography  National temple \\"Madonna del Conforto\\" in Cargnacco Cargnacco located in the Venetian-Friulan Plain, about 5 kilometres (3 mi) northeast of the administrative centre of Pozzuolo del Friuli, 10 kilometres (6 mi) south of Udine (capital of the province), 77 kilometres (48 mi) northwest of Trieste (capital of the region Friuli-Venezia Giulia), 120 kilometres (75 mi) northeast of Venice, and 645 kilometres (400 mi) northeast of Rome (capital of Italy). Cargnacco develops through four main roads from Piazza IV Novembre. Towards east, Via Manzoni passes by the old elementary school and the rectory. The latter is located close to the old church (now deconsecrated) and the local playground. Via Manzoni crosses Via Leonardo da Vinci at the main square, where the national temple \\"Madonna del Conforto\\" is located, which is dedicated to the soldiers who died at the Eastern Front (World War II). Via Buttrio also leaves Piazza IV Novembre towards east, passing by the old well, and crossing Via Leonardo da Vinci at the old country residence of the count Della Torre of Villalta, commonly referred to as ‚ÄúPalaƒçat‚Äù (from ‚Äúpalaƒç‚Äù, which stands for \\"palace\\" in Friulian language). Via Buttrio continues towards the Z.I.U. industrial area (also known as Casa Tosolini), whereas Via Leonardo da Vinici continues towards Lumignacco (hamlet in the municipality of Pavia di Udine), passing by the Romanello sport centre and the village's celebrations ground. Two more roads start from Piazza IV Novembre. Via Dante Alighieri leads briefly towards south, and then to the graveyard. Via Galileo Galilei leads towards west and then north, branching into Via San Giorgio, which leads to the flyover over the A23 highway and Terenzano, and Via Giosu√® Carducci, which leads to the Casa Rossa crossroad (located in Terenzano), where Via Giuseppe Verdi, Via Tomba Antica, and county road 94 meet.  Economy  Cargnacco hosts part of the Z.I.U (Zonaa Industriale Udinese) industrial area at the far east end of Via Buttrio. The Z.I.U. is under the authority of the Consorzio per lo sviluppo Industriale del Friuli Centrale (the consortium for the industrial development of central Friuli), and includes the two major industries of the municipality: the Acciaierie Bertoli Safau (ABS), with over a thousand employee and a sales volume of 686 million euros per annum, and the Rizzani de Eccher group, with over a thousand employee and a sales volume over 500 million euros per annum.

Early life and career Born in Limerick, Ireland, on October 8, 1941, Niall McInerney had his first taste of photography as a schoolboy trying to photograph birdlife with a Kodax Box Brownie. At the age of 17 he left Ireland for London and tried his hand at a wide range of jobs, including railway porter at Paddington Station, dish washer, Wimpy chef for J. Lyons, cinema usher and projectionist. It was not until he began a stint as stage manager in a Soho club, The Phoenix in Old Compton Street, where he started photographing the striptease artistes, that he rediscovered his interest in photography. For these photographs he was helped by Lewis Morley who at that time had a studio in Greek Street. Leaving Soho, he started to work with Tony Ross who ran Piccadilly Press. Here he would photograph groups visiting London, with London landmarks as the backdrop. This led to street photography when he was commissioned by Marubeni, a Japanese company, to take photos of stylish Londoners in fashionable locations such as Kensington High Street, The King‚Äôs Road and Camden Town. Shop windows and stores such as Biba and Vivienne Westwood‚Äôs shop Sex were a part of this. He then took up with a bunch of young people in Camden Town, who had started a boutique called Swanky Modes. These were Wallie Walters, Melanie Haberfield, Esme Young and Judy Gregson. It was here Mclnerney‚Äôs penchant for chronicling styling was born. Catwalk photography McInerney made his debut as a catwalk photographer when he photographed a Swanky Modes collection, shown in St Paul‚Äôs churchyard in Covent Garden, in 1976. This led to more shows such as the Individual Clothes Show at Pillar Hall. Some of his earlier catwalk commissions included London-based designers such as Bill Gibb, Zandra Rhodes, John Bates, Jean Muir, Maxfield Parrish, Betty Jackson and Bruce Oldfield. Then Vivienne Westwood, Jasper Conran, Ghost, John Rocha and John Galliano all became regular clients. From there came commissions from magazines such as Newsweek and Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, to cover the shows in Paris, Milan and New York City, womenswear, menswear and couture. McInerney‚Äôs body of work records the time of fashions best loved supermodels such as Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Christy Turlington. Besides the models, he photographed the young designers graduate shows from St Martins, including John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, people behind and in front of the catwalk, designers, stylists, editors, show organisers, makeup artists, flaneurs and flanuses and above all the photographers, who he calls ‚Äúthe foot soldiers of fashion‚Äù. Even while McInerney was photographing the work of fashion‚Äôs most prestigious designers he never abandoned smaller venues and collections. Over the years he has photographed the Saint Martins‚Äô graduation collections, including those of some of most important fashion designers of the twentieth century. Alexander McQueen‚Äôs collection Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims, John Galliano‚Äôs Les Incroyables, and Stella McCartney‚Äôs star-studded graduation show are all features of McInerney‚Äôs Central Saint Martins work. He retired from catwalk photography in 2000. In 2011, Bloomsbury Publishing purchased Niall McInerney‚Äôs complete archive of fashion images (over 500,000). The archive is an unparalleled two-decade-long photographic testimonial which showcases the photographer‚Äôs diverse work during a vibrant period of fashion history. Bloomsbury is digitizing McInerney‚Äôs work to create a fully searchable online archive for students and academics of fashion, history and related fields.

After initially titling the poem ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and then ‚ÄúThe Sentimental Exile,‚Äù the author eventually chose the name of his occasional residence near Cambridge. The poem's references can be overly obscure because of the many specific Cambridgeshire locations and English traditions to which the poem refers. Some have seen it as sentimentally nostalgic, which it is, while others have recognised its satiric and sometimes cruel humour. Using octosyllabics‚Äîa meter often favored by Brooke‚Äîthe author writes of Grantchester and other nearby villages in what has been called a seriocomic style. It is very much a poem of ‚Äúplace‚Äù: the place where Brooke composed the work, Berlin and the Caf√© des Westens, and the contrast of that German world (‚ÄúHere am I, sweating, sick, and hot‚Äù) with his home in England. Yet it is more than just the longing of an exile for his home, nostalgically imagined. The landscape of Cambridgeshire is reproduced in the poem, but Brooke, the academic, populates this English world with allusions and references from history and myth. He compares the countryside to a kind of Greek Arcadia, home to nymphs and fauns, and refers to such famous literary figures as Lord Byron, Geoffrey Chaucer, and Tennyson. Homesick for England, a land ‚ÄúWhere men with Splendid Hearts may go,‚Äù it is Grantchester, in particular, that he desires. Text Source:The Complete Poems of Rupert Brooke (Sidwick & Jackson, Ltd, London, 1934), p. 93\\\\. The Old Vicarage, Grantchester (Cafe des Westens, Berlin, May 1912) Just now the lilac is in bloom, All before my little room; And in my flower-beds, I think, Smile the carnation and the pink; And down the borders, well I know, The poppy and the pansy blow . . . Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through, Beside the river make for you A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep Deeply above; and green and deep The stream mysterious glides beneath, Green as a dream and deep as death. \\\\-- Oh, damn! I know it! and I know How the May fields all golden show, And when the day is young and sweet, Gild gloriously the bare feet That run to bathe . . . Du lieber Gott! Here am I, sweating, sick, and hot, And there the shadowed waters fresh Lean up to embrace the naked flesh. Temperamentvoll German Jews Drink beer around; -- and there the dews Are soft beneath a morn of gold. Here tulips bloom as they are told; Unkempt about those hedges blows An English unofficial rose; And there the unregulated sun Slopes down to rest when day is done, And wakes a vague unpunctual star, A slippered Hesper; and there are Meads towards Haslingfield and Coton Where das Betreten's not verboten. Œµ·º¥Œ∏Œµ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒØŒºŒ∑ŒΩ. . . would I were In Grantchester, in Grantchester! -- Some, it may be, can get in touch With Nature there, or Earth, or such. And clever modern men have seen A Faun a-peeping through the green, And felt the Classics were not dead, To glimpse a Naiad's reedy head, Or hear the Goat-foot piping low: . . . But these are things I do not know. I only know that you may lie Day long and watch the Cambridge sky, And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass, Hear the cool lapse of hours pass, Until the centuries blend and blur In Grantchester, in Grantchester. . . . Still in the dawnlit waters cool His ghostly Lordship swims his pool, And tries the strokes, essays the tricks, Long learnt on Hellespont, or Styx. Dan Chaucer hears his river still Chatter beneath a phantom mill. Tennyson notes, with studious eye, How Cambridge waters hurry by . . . And in that garden, black and white, Creep whispers through the grass all night; And spectral dance, before the dawn, A hundred Vicars down the lawn; Curates, long dust, will come and go On lissom, clerical, printless toe; And oft between the boughs is seen The sly shade of a Rural Dean . . . Till, at a shiver in the skies, Vanishing with Satanic cries, The prim ecclesiastic rout Leaves but a startled sleeper-out, Grey heavens, the first bird's drowsy calls, The falling house that never falls. God! I will pack, and take a train, And get me to England once again! For England's the one land, I know, Where men with Splendid Hearts may go; And Cambridgeshire, of all England, The shire for Men who Understand; And of that district I prefer The lovely hamlet Grantchester. For Cambridge people rarely smile, Being urban, squat, and packed with guile; And Royston men in the far South Are black and fierce and strange of mouth; At Over they fling oaths at one, And worse than oaths at Trumpington, And Ditton girls are mean and dirty, And there's none in Harston under thirty, And folks in Shelford and those parts Have twisted lips and twisted hearts, And Barton men make Cockney rhymes, And Coton's full of nameless crimes, And things are done you'd not believe At Madingley on Christmas Eve. Strong men have run for miles and miles, When one from Cherry Hinton smiles; Strong men have blanched, and shot their wives, Rather than send them to St. Ives; Strong men have cried like babes, bydam, To hear what happened at Babraham. But Grantchester! ah, Grantchester! There's peace and holy quiet there, Great clouds along pacific skies, And men and women with straight eyes, Lithe children lovelier than a dream, A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream, And little kindly winds that creep Round twilight corners, half asleep. In Grantchester their skins are white; They bathe by day, they bathe by night; The women there do all they ought; The men observe the Rules of Thought. They love the Good; they worship Truth; They laugh uproariously in youth; (And when they get to feeling old, They up and shoot themselves, I'm told) . . . Ah God! to see the branches stir Across the moon at Grantchester! To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten Unforgettable, unforgotten River- smell, and hear the breeze Sobbing in the little trees. Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand Still guardians of that holy land? The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream, The yet unacademic stream? Is dawn a secret shy and cold Anadyomene, silver-gold? And sunset still a golden sea From Haslingfield to Madingley? And after, ere the night is born, Do hares come out about the corn? Oh, is the water sweet and cool, Gentle and brown, above the pool? And laughs the immortal river still Under the mill, under the mill? Say, is there Beauty yet to find? And Certainty? and Quiet kind? Deep meadows yet, for to forget The lies, and truths, and pain? . . . oh! yet Stands the Church clock at ten to three? And is there honey still for tea? Culture and legacy John Betjeman reuses Œµ·º¥Œ∏Œµ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒØŒºŒ∑ŒΩ (\\"\\") in his poem \\"The Olympic Girl\\": Eithe genoimen ‚Ä¶ would I were, (Forgive me shade of Rupert Brooke) An object fit to claim her look, Oh! Would I were a racket press'd, With hard excitement to her breast! (John Betjeman, first published in A Few Late Chrysanthemums, 1954) Ian Moncrieffe concludes his epilogue to W. Stanley Moss's Ill Met by MoonlightHarrap 1950, reissued by Cassell/Orion, London, 1999 with extracts from a wartime letter written to him by Patrick Leigh Fermor from a Greek valley, where he was engaged in guerrilla operations against the Nazi invaders. PLF ended his letter with the words Œ≠ŒØŒ∏Œµ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒØŒºŒ∑ŒΩ. He wishes that he and IM could be together, at one or other of their firesides, enjoying one another's company rather than relying on erratic correspondence during a time of hostilities. IM starts his epilogue with another quotation from Brooke's \\"Menelaus and Helen\\", and one might conclude that quoting from Brooke was a vogue pastime for the band of well-educated young officers based in Egypt, whose best-known exploit was the capture of a German general in Crete in the spring of 1944, and successfully taking him off the island to Alexandria (the subject of Moss's book). An episode of the Croft and Perry sitcom Dad's Army is titled Is There Honey Still for Tea? In the 1941 movie \\"Pimpernel\\" Smith, Leslie Howard's titular character recites a piece of this poem (\\"God! I will pack, and take a train, And get me to England once again! For England's the one land, I know, Where men with Splendid Hearts may go\\") and refers to Brooke in the scene. The final two lines of the poem are paraphrased by Doremus Jessop in Sinclair Lewis' novel It Can't Happen Here. The comedy sketch Balham, Gateway to the South, written by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, ends with a verse by \\"C. Quills Smith, Balham's own bard\\". In a few stanzas the \\"bard\\" manages to plagiarise or mangle the work of several real poets, and ends with the last two lines of Rupert Brooke's poem. Iris Murdoch's novel An Unofficial Rose, published in 1962, takes its title from a line of this poem.

Olson is widely credited with spearheading the ongoing redevelopment and rebirth of downtown Des Moines during his tenure as the city's mayor. Downtown Des Moines, the capital and largest city in Iowa, had suffered from neglect and blight by the 1970s. Olson oversaw much of the \\"first wave\\" of the downtown's redevelopment. He was an early proponent of Des Moines' skywalk. Olson also supported the construction and development of numerous city landmarks, including the Greater Des Moines Botanical Garden, Civic Center of Greater Des Moines, the renovation of the riverfront, and Cowles Commons (formerly known as Nollen Plaza). Olson successfully persuaded the city's political and business communities to support his redevelopment efforts, including developer and Iowa Realty founder, Bill Knapp. In 2014, Knapp called Olson \\"the spark plug to get things rolling\\" for downtown Des Moines.  Biography  Olson was born on August 3, 1929, in Aurora, Illinois, to Elmer Olson and Dalla (n√©e Bargholz) Olson. He graduated from West Aurora High School in 1947. He next graduated from Drake University in 1951, where he was a member Drake Bulldogs football team. Olson worked as an agency manager at the Des Moines office of The Bankers Life, an insurance company now Principal Financial Group, for 30 years. He joined Bankers Life in 1960 when he was 29 years old, becoming the youngest manager in the company's history. Olson was inducted into the Iowa Insurance Hall of Fame in 1999. Olson was a member of the Republican Party, but eschewed partisan politics. He served on the Des Moines City Council before becoming mayor. In 1971, Olson was elected Mayor of Des Moines, defeating his opponent, public servant Peter Crivaro. He served for two, consecutive four-year terms. He was once approached by the Democratic Party, who tried to persuade him to switch parties and run for Governor of Iowa as a Democrat. Olson declined the offer. His wife, Cleojean Olson, recalled joking, \\"\\"I told him, 'If you run, you'll run divorced'.\\" Olson served as the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee for eight states in the American Midwest from 1984 until 2002. He also founded the Des Moines chapter of Big Brothers of America.  Death  Richard Olson was killed in a car accident in Dedham, Maine, on the evening of August 5, 2014. He was 85 years old. Olson was returning to his Maine vacation home after running some errands when his Chevrolet Tahoe crossed the center line and struck oncoming GMC pickup truck shortly before 6 p.m. on August 5. Two people in the pickup truck were also killed. Olson had a blood alcohol content of 0.14, nearly twice the legal limit. Olson was survived by his wife, Cleojean, and four children.

Prior to playing professionally, Long played college baseball for Chandler-Gilbert Community College and Ohio State University. His father, Kevin Long, is the current hitting coach of the Washington Nationals and former hitting coach of the New York Yankees and New York Mets. Career Long attended Cactus Shadows High School in Cave Creek, Arizona. He played baseball as a pitcher and an infielder, but did not make his school's varsity team until he was a senior. In 2010, The Arizona Republic named Long as an honorable mention on their All-Class 4A baseball team. No colleges in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I offered him a scholarship. After he graduated, Long enrolled at Chandler‚ÄìGilbert Community College, and played college baseball for the Chandler‚ÄìGilbert Coyotes. As a freshman, Long pitched to a 1.62 earned run average (ERA) in 50 innings, though a broken wrist ended his season prematurely. After he recovered, he participated in collegiate summer baseball, playing for the East Texas Pumpjacks of the Texas Collegiate League. After his freshman year, he transferred to Ohio State University to play for the Ohio State Buckeyes baseball team, a Division I program. Long began his Buckeyes career as a relief pitcher, but was moved into the starting rotation. As a sophomore, Long led the Buckeyes with a 2.66 ERA, the sixth-best ERA among pitchers in the Big Ten Conference, and the fourth most innings pitched. Long was named to the All-Big Ten's first team. That summer, he played for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. In his junior year, Long developed warts on his pitching hand, which prevented him from throwing his changeup. He had a 4.02 ERA, and went undrafted in the 2013 MLB Draft. Pitching again for the Bourne Braves in the summer of 2013, his 0.30 ERA led the league. New York Yankees' amateur scouting director Damon Oppenheimer noticed Long and in August 2013, Long signed with the Yankees as an undrafted free agent. After Long signed with the Yankees, he appeared in six games as a relief pitcher with the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League at the end of the 2013 season. In 2014, he reported to spring training, and was assigned to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 11 appearances, which included four games started, Long had a 1.64 ERA for Charleston. For the week of May 26 ‚Äì June 1, he was named the league's Pitcher of the Week. On June 5, he was promoted to Tampa. After six appearances for Tampa, in which he compiled a 2.77 ERA, he was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. Over the whole season, Long pitched in 28 games (18 starts) and had a 12-5 record, 2.18 ERA, 122 strikeouts, 22 walks, and a shutout in 144.1 innings pitched. Long was released by the Yankees in April 2016. He signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals and spent the 2016 season pitching for the Nationals' AA and AAA clubs. He finished the 2016 season with a 5-6 record and a 3.20 ERA. On November 27, 2017, Long resigned a minor league deal with the Nationals, who invited him to spring training. He elected free agency on November 2, 2018. On December 14, 2018, Long signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was released on March 21, 2019. Personal life Long is the youngest of three children. His father, Kevin Long, was the hitting coach of the Yankees. Kevin, who then was playing and coaching in the minor leagues, insisted that his son not pitch while he was young or throw a breaking ball until he was 16 years old. As a teenager, Long served as a batboy for the Yankees. Long returned to Ohio State to graduate in December 2013.

One of her works, an untitled 1988 screenprint, is in the permanent collection of the Tate Gallery. She designed Corryvrechann tapestry for the opening of the then Museum of Scotland in 1998. It measures and was woven by Dovecot Studios. Since 2003 it has hung in Hawthornden Court in the now National Museum of Scotland. In 2015 the museum's conservation team took down the tapestry and moved it to a freezer where it was kept at -30 degrees for a week to eradicate moths. Corryvreckan, between the islands of Jura and Scarba, is the world's third largest whirlpool. She has made a series of land art works, including her 2001 Shadow of a Necklace in the grounds of Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute. This comprised a drawing of a necklace, dug into a large lawn and filled with silver sand, planted in 2003 with grass seed which left a darker shadow on the lawn, gradually to fade away. It was inspired by a jet necklace found in a Bronze Age burial site at the site.  Exhibitions  In 1990, she represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale as part of Three Scottish Sculptors along with David Mach and Arthur Watson. Whiteford's work has also been included in other group shows, including, * Expressions: Scottish Art 1976‚Äì1989, 2000 * Scottish Artists Prints, 1996, 1995, 1990 * From Art to Archaeology, 1991, 1992 In 2018, the Bront√´ Parsonage commissioned Whiteford to create a work about Emily Bront√´‚Äôs hawk Nero, resulting in a video installation accompanied by a series of works on paper. Recognition Whiteford was appointed OBE in the 2001 Birthday Honours \\"For services to Art\\". The National Portrait Gallery holds a photographic portrait of Whiteford, by Heather Waddell, 1993.

With the first game being played under the Harvard's \\"Boston rules\\", the second one was the first rugby-style football game played in the United States. It used three periods or \\"games\\" and ended in a scoreless tie. A Princeton vs. Rutgers football game had been played five years earlier (in 1869), but under a variation of England's The Football Association rules, closer to contemporary soccer than American football. Overview On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on association football than on rugby football, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games. Harvard, which played the \\"Boston game\\", a version of football that allowed carrying, refused to attend this rules conference and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to a challenge to play McGill University, from Montreal, Canada, in a two-game series. After the two games in Cambridge, Harvard travelled to Montreal to play a third match The McGill team traveled to Cambridge to meet Harvard. On May 14, 1874, the first game, played under \\"Boston\\" rules, was dominated by Harvard, which lead 3‚Äì0 after only 22 minutes when the game was ended. The next day, the two teams played under \\"McGill\\" rugby rules to a scoreless tie. The first game featured a round ball instead of a rugby-style oblong ball. McGill used a bladder covered by leather instead of a rubber ball as did Harvard, which was much more difficult to kick. This series of games represents an important milestone in the development of the modern game of American football. A similar game was played a year later between Harvard and Tufts establishing this as the first game between two American colleges played under rules used in today's version of American football. At this time, the try was not used in American Football. The try would later evolve into the score known as the touchdown. In late 1874, the Harvard team traveled to Montreal to play McGill in rugby, and won by three tries in front of 2,000 spectators.

She moved to London with her parents when she was an infant. She resides in New York City, having left Britain in 1990.  Early life  Ryan studied at St Albans College of Art and Design (1974‚Äì75), Bath Academy of Art (1975‚Äì78), Slade School of Fine Art (1978‚Äì80) and the School for Oriental and African Studies (SOAS, 1981‚Äì83). From the outset, Ryan was keen to break out of the mould of British modernism as it was then taught by drawing on a wider range of female sculptors and artists of colour. Among her earliest influences was the German-born American sculptor Eva Hesse, whose work she saw firsthand in 1979, when the exhibition 'Eva Hesse: Sculpture' went on at the Whitechapel Gallery. Around the same time, Ryan discovered the work of Louise Bourgeois and Alice Aycock at the Hayward Gallery. Finally, another formative influence was Barbara Hepworth. New Beacon Books was where she went to find information about non-Western artists and artists of colour. In 1980 Ryan was awarded a Boise Travelling Scholarship from the Slade. This allowed her to visit Nigeria. There, she became especially interested in the re-adaptation of everyday consumables, including food and ephemeral waste materials, into fetishes used in spiritual offerings and shrines. The trip inspired her to continue her studies with an MPhil degree in art history at SOAS. Ryan completed her studies at the beginning of the 1980s, a time marked by the rise of the British Black Arts Movement. Her participation in 'The Thin Black Line' (ICA, London, 1985) and 'From Two Worlds' (Whitechapel Gallery, London; Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, 1986) meant that she became associated with a broader anti-racist movement. Later, she felt the need to clarify that her work should not be pinned exclusively to race. 'All along I have had various people be very critical of me because I did not fit into their politicized agenda', she said.  Sculpture  Ryan's preferred materials range from heavy ones like cement, bronze, lead and painted plaster, to lighter and more ephemeral ones like paper, dust, flowers and feathers. Her sculptures are abstract and tend towards the biomorphic, appealing to organic forms like pods, shells, husks and seeds. Relics in the Pillow of Dreams (1985) is exemplary of this aesthetic. The organic nature of Ryan's work is accentuated by its direct placement on the floor, without a plinth. Key is also the relationship between the container and the content, and therefore between the interior and exterior dimension. In an article published to coincide with her exhibition at Camden Arts Centre and Angel Row Gallery, Ryan explains how her small studio in New York is also a representation of the container, and as such a sculptural environment in which daily accumulations, dust heaps, deposits become the preoccupations in the work. Conceptually, Ryan draws on a combination of personal experience, ancestral history and the natural environment. A product of the British Caribbean diaspora, she is particularly attentive to questions of origins, memory, and belonging in relation to place and landscape. Domesticity, maternity and the role of women in society are also interrogated in her sculptures.  Exhibitions and residencies  Solo exhibitions include 'Virginia Woolf: Exhibition Inspired By Her Writings' at Tate St Ives and touring (2018); 'The Sculpture Collections Exhibition', Leeds Gallery Henry Moore Institute (2018); The Art House Wakefield (2017/18); 'The Weather Inside' at The Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh PA (2011/12); 'Archaeology of the Black Sun. Musings After Kristeva' at Salena Gallery, Long Island University, New York (2005). Previously, Ryan had solo shows at Camden Arts Centre, London and Angel Row, Nottingham (1995); Kettle's Yard, Cambridge and Riverside Studios, London (1988); ICA, London (1987); Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol (1987). Her first solo show was at Tom Allen Centre (1984). Ryan participated in numerous group exhibitions. In 2017, she was included in 'The Place Is Here' at Nottingham Contemporary, Nottingham. In 2015, she was represented in the Arts Council Collection touring show ‚ÄòMaking It: Sculpture in Britain 1977‚Äî1986'. Ryan was included in the touring show 'Recent British Sculpture', organised by the Arts Council in 1993‚Äì94. In 1990, her work was featured in the 'British Art Show' at Hayward Gallery, London. In 1986, she showed at Stoke City Garden Festival in Stoke-on-Trent; as well as being part of the exhibition 'From Two Worlds' at Whitechapel Gallery in London and Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh. In 1985, her work was included in 'The Thin Black Line', a groundbreaking exhibition curated by Lubaina Himid at the ICA, London. In 1983, Ryan was in 'Five Black Women Artists', also curated by Himid, this time at the Africa Centre, London. The following year, she took part in 'Sculptors and Modellers' at Tate. Ryan was in residence at Tate St Ives in 1998 and 2000‚Äì01, when she worked in the former studio of Barbara Hepworth and used marble gifted by the Hepworth Estate. In June 2017, she had a residency at The Art House, Wakefield, where she re-examined her connection with Barbara Hepworth in relation to themes of ancestral history, domesticity and memory.  Collections  Ryan's work is in the permanent collections of the Arts Council of Great Britain, Tate, and The Henry Moore Collection. Examples of her sculptures are also held with Firstsite, Colchester; Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh; Rochdale Arts Gallery; Contemporary Arts Society; Weltkunst Foundation, London; Salsbury Collection; Irvin Joffe Collection, London; Cleveland County Museum; The Boise Scholarship Collection.  Recognition  In 2019 Ryan was awarded a Pollock Krasner Grant. In 2018, she was the recipient of a Freelands Award from the Freelands Foundation for an exhibition at Spike Island in the Autumn of 2020. Previously, she received the Henry Moore Foundation Award (1987). In 1983, Ryan was the winner of the second prize at the Cleveland International Drawing Biennale.

Life Born in London, he was articled young to Thomas Malton, and concentrated on architectural subjects from the outset of his career. In 1803 he began to exhibit in the Royal Academy. On 15 February 1809 he was elected an associate of the Old Watercolour Society, becoming a full member on 8 June 1812. He soon gave up his membership, but then was re- elected on 12 February 1821; he was treasurer in 1822, and then secretary in 1827 until 1832 when Robert Hills took over. In 1827 Wild's sight began to fail, and in 1832 he became blind. He died on 4 August 1835 at 35 Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, where he had lived since 1820. His children included the architect James William Wild. Works Frogmore House, Garden Front, watercolour by Charles Wild, 1819 Wild's earliest exhibited works from 1803 were two views of Christ Church, Oxford, followed in 1805 by drawings of Westminster Abbey, and in 1808 of York Cathedral. He published six series of works on English cathedrals: Canterbury (1807); York (1809); Chester (1813); Lichfield (1813); Lincoln (1819) and Worcester (1823). The illustrations which Wild supplied for William Henry Pyne's Royal Residences (published 1819) were reproduced, after the style of Rudolph Ackermann's Microcosm of London, as hand-coloured aquatints. Travels on the continent resulted in Wild's Examples of the Ecclesiastical Architecture of the Middle Ages chiefly in France, and a volume published in 1833 of sketches in Belgium, Germany, and France. A miscellaneous collection, entitled Twelve Beautiful Specimens, from the Cathedrals of England, lacked a date. Architectural Grandeur appeared in 1837, consisting of continental sketches that were etched by John Le Keux and others.

He later co-founded a non-profit law firm, Whistleblower Aid, intended to help federal government whistleblowers forward their concerns without incurring legal liability. Biography John Tye was raised in a suburb of Boston. He attended Duke University, where he earned a B.S. in Adaptive and Intelligent Systems, a major of his own creation. Said Tye of his undergraduate career, \\"I thought I was going to be a scientist. But when I was graduating, I decided I wanted to do things that have more of an impact on real people.\\" Tye then attended Lincoln College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. There, he studied philosophy, politics, and economics. After studying at Oxford, he did research on hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center. He then earned a J.D. at Yale Law, where he joined a civil liberties litigation clinic. After graduating Yale in 2006, Tye moved to New Orleans, where he worked on housing issues for low-income families. He co-authored a May 2010 study on reform of the U.S. housing finance system, described as \\"essential reading\\" by real estate blogger Jonathan Miller, and co-authored the introductory chapter of the 2011 book The American Mortgage System: Crisis and Reform. In January 2011, Tye was recruited to the State Department by his former Yale instructor Michael Posner, then Assistant Secretary of State. He served in the State Department until April 2014, as section chief for Internet freedom in the State Department‚Äôs Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, where he was cleared to access Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information. In his official role, Tye sometimes traveled abroad and advocated for an open Internet, free of government surveillance. From 2014 to 2015, Tye was legal director and campaign director of Avaaz, a global civic activist organization. Whistleblowing =Internal channels= In Fall 2013 and February 2014, Tye attended two classified National Security Agency briefings on Executive Order 12333, which was signed by President Ronald Reagan and amended by President George W. Bush. Tye attended these briefings so that he could help prepare the State Department's response to the high-profile leaks disclosed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Following a January 17, 2014 speech by President Barack Obama on NSA surveillance reforms that failed to mention changes to activities under E.O. 12333, Tye began to use internal channels at the State Department to press his concerns over the order. Prior to leaving the State Department in April 2014, Tye filed a complaint with the Department's inspector general, asserting that the intelligence collection and retention policies being carried out under E.O. 12333 violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Tye also met with staffers of the House and Senate Intelligence committees, and communicated his complaint to the inspector general of the NSA. The House Intelligence committee responded in a letter to Tye that it \\"reviewed your allegations and has taken the action it deems appropriate in this matter.\\" =Public disclosure= On July 18, 2014, The Washington Post published an editorial written by Tye highlighting his concerns over U.S. signals intelligence activities performed under E.O. 12333. Comparing this executive order to the much-discussed Section 215 of the Patriot Act, Tye wrote, \\"I believe that Americans should be even more concerned about the collection and storage of their communications under Executive Order 12333 than under Section 215.\\" E.O. 12333, Tye wrote, allows for the collection of both metadata and communication contents of U.S. persons, so long as the collection takes place outside the U.S. However, Tye argued, many communications between U.S. persons may transit or be stored on servers outside the U.S., making them vulnerable to collection under E.O. 12333. Although U.S. persons cannot be directly \\"targeted\\" under the order, their communications can be gathered \\"incidentally\\" in the course of investigating a foreign target. Tye argued that under the government's interpretation of Order 12333, \\"incidental collection\\" could include the data of every person using popular internet services‚Äîincluding Gmail, Yahoo, and Dropbox‚Äîamounting to, in theory, \\"billions of people\\". As an executive order rather than a statute, Tye noted, E.O. 12333 had never been subject to congressional or judicial oversight. Collection under the order does not require a warrant and need not be reported to Congress. The president's Review Group on Intelligence and Communication Technologies had recommended reform to collection policies under Order 12333, yet the White House had indicated it would not enact this recommendation. On July 23, 2014, Tye spoke at a public meeting of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an independent agency within the executive branch tasked with advising the president on matters of privacy and civil liberties. In November 2014, Tye spoke about his experience at the TEDx Charlottesville conference. Tye maintains that he has not, and will not, release any classified information. Prior to publication, he submitted his Post editorial for approval by the State Department and the NSA, which both deemed that no changes were necessary. In addition, Tye has insisted on having a third party present when speaking to reporters to counter any later claim that he revealed classified information. =Reactions= On August 19, Alexander Joel, Civil Liberties Protection Officer of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, responded directly to Tye's Post editorial. Joel emphasized that Americans cannot be directly targeted under Executive Order 12333, and that use and retention of the collected data is limited by policies approved by the U.S. Attorney General. Notably, under these policies, data cannot be retained for more than five years. Tye responded that arguments about targeting and limits on use ignored more important questions of whose data is actually collected, and how that data is retained. In responding to Tye's allegations, NSA spokeswoman Vanee Vines said, \\"Whether NSA's activities are conducted under EO 12333 or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, NSA applies Attorney General-approved processes to protect the privacy of U.S. persons in the collection, retention, and use of foreign intelligence.\\" Ben Wizner, lead attorney for NSA leaker Edward Snowden, called Tye's actions \\"entirely admirable,\\" noting that not every whistleblower could be expected to take on the personal risks that Snowden did by revealing classified information. Tye's own attorney, Mark Zaid, a critic of Snowden, acknowledged that Snowden's disclosures had likely made it easier for Tye to come forward with his own revelation. Legal experts debated the potential impact of Tye's disclosure on the possibility of reform of practices under E.O. 12333, with Indiana University law professor Fred Cate arguing that such a disclosure within the rules of the government's classification system may not have the impact of a leak of classified documents. Mark Jaycox of the Electronic Frontier Foundation argued that Tye's disclosure would help to push forward the reform process. Tye was named one of 2014's \\"National Security Law Heroes\\" by Steve Vladeck of the blog Just Security. Whistleblower Aid In September 2017, Tye and lawyer Mark Zaid cofounded Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit law firm. Initially focused on employees and contractors of the U.S. federal government, Whistleblower Aid emphasizes it is different from WikiLeaks: \\"No one should ever send classified information to Whistleblower Aid,\\" the firm states. \\"Whistleblower Aid will never assist clients or prospective clients with leaking classified information.\\" Instead, would-be whistleblowers with classified information will be directed to investigators with security clearances to help expose wrongdoing without breaking the law or incurring criminal liability. \\"We are trying to hold the U.S. government accountable,\\" Zaid explained, \\"and provide free legal services to whistleblowers so they don't ruin their careers in the process or be prosecuted.\\" Clients will not be charged. To cover expenses, the firm solicits donations from foundations and crowdsourced funding.

Early life and education Li's family is of Hakka descent and originates from Wuping County, moving to Taiwan in 1949. Li Yuan was born in Monga, Taipei, on 31 October 1951. His father was a statistician and his mother taught writing at National Taiwan Normal University, later becoming a journalist. Li's father gave his eldest son the pen name Hsiao Yeh, and both parents encouraged him to write. Li read classics such as War and Peace and The Old Man and the Sea at the age of 11, at the behest of his father and was forced to write reports on them afterward, though Li preferred to draw cartoons and perform plays instead. After studying biology at NTNU, Li earned a graduate degree in microbiology from the State University of New York at Buffalo in the United States. Upon his return to Taiwan, Li became a teaching assistant at National Yang Ming University. Career Hsiao Yeh published his first book in 1974, and was hired by the Central Motion Picture Corporation in 1981. In 1986, Hsiao Yeh won his first Golden Horse Award for Best Original Screenplay. The next year, he and Edward Yang shared the 1987 Asia-Pacific Film Festival Award for best screenplay after co-writing Terrorizers. Hsiao Yeh stated in 2001 that, while he was at CMPC, many of his superiors came from military backgrounds and films were often made according to Kuomintang-led governmental directives. There, Hsiao Yeh also met Wu Nien-jen, who whom he founded May Productions in 1989. Shortly after starting May Productions, Hsiao Yeh won the 1990 Golden Horse Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Later that decade, he became a television writer and presenter. Hsiao Yeh worked for Taiwan Television from 2001 to 2004 and served as general manager of Chinese Television System from 2006 to 2008. He contributed to the book Touring Taiwan, released in 2008. Hsiao Yeh was the artistic director of the musical \\"Hey! Atiku\\", which was based on one of his stories and debuted in 2010, the first such Hakka production geared toward children. Political activism Shortly after Tsai Ing-wen founded Thinking Taiwan in August 2012, Hsiao Yeh was one of the first invited to join. In March 2013, Hsiao Yeh participated in an anti-nuclear demonstration planned by Green Citizens‚Äô Action Alliance and held around the Presidential Office. Alt URL Days later, he and another former CMPC colleague, , among others, started the Five Six Movement, in opposition to nuclear technologies. A wide-ranging group that included Hsiao Yeh, Lee Yuan-tseh, Wei Te-sheng, Giddens Ko, and Kevin Tsai founded the Anti-Nuclear Fathers Front with the same goal, on Father's Day. In November Hsiao Yeh was invited to the Zero-Nuke Festival hosted by the Green Citizens‚Äô Action Alliance. He was largely supportive of the Sunflower Student Movement in 2014. Hsiao Yeh joined the 2018 Taipei mayoral campaign of political independent Ko Wen-je as campaign director. Personal life Hsiao Yeh's son is a writer and film director.

It addresses challenges in the field of mobile security. MSG is typically composed of two components - Client library and Gateway. The client is a library that is linked with the mobile application. It establishes secure connectivity to Gateway using cryptographic protocol typically SSL/TLS. This represents a secured channel used for communication between the mobile application and hosts. Gateway separates internal IT infrastructure from the Internet, allowing only an authorized client requests to reach a specific set of hosts inside restricted network. Client library The Client library is linked with the corresponding mobile application, and that provides secure access via the Gateway to the set of Hosts. The Client library exposes public API to the mobile application, mimicking platform default HTTP client library. The application uses this API to communicate with the desired hosts in a secure way. Gateway Gateway is a server or daemon typically installed onto physical or virtual appliance placed into DMZ. The Gateway's public interface is exposed to the Internet (or other untrusted network) and accepts TCP/IP connections from mobile applications. It operates on IPv4 and/or IPv6 networks. Incoming client connections typically use SSL/TLS to provide security for the network communication and a mutual trust of communicating peers. Communication protocol is typically based on HTTP.

In 2003, he made his professional acting debut in a production of Terrence McNally's The Lisbon Traviata at the Actor's Lab in Hollywood, CA. His performance was called \\"letter-perfect\\" by the Los Angeles Times. The world was introduced to Dottley in 2008 via his most-notable-to-date starring role as Ty Williamson in Sordid Lives: The Series, from IMG Global and Viacom via Logo in the United States, and is now available to view on Hulu. Sordid Lives aired internationally in 17 countries around the world starring icons Rue McClanahan, Caroline Rhea, Olivia Newton-John, Leslie Jordan and Margaret Cho. Dottley also appeared in a national tour of the stage production of Sordid Lives. In 2015, Dottley began his 20+ city tour with his first full length one-man show Life on the gAy-List.

History There is very little information available about Frederick Fiebig. He was probably of German origin and became a lithographer in Calcutta in the 1840s. He should not be confused with his contemporary and German compatriot, the Letton born post impressionist and expressionist painter Fr√©d√©ric Fiebig. He was possibly also a piano teacher for a time. With the advent of photography, Fiebig began producing hand-coloured prints of photographs captured using the calotype process. His photographs of Calcutta are some of the earliest views of the city. He later travelled to Madras, Colombo and Kandy in Sri Lanka, Mauritius, and Cape Town in South Africa, meticulously cataloguing the monuments and people around him.

It was first serialized in the newspaper Equity. Two editions were published in Topeka, Kansas in 1900. The title page lists Jack Adams as the author. Jack Adams is a pseudonym.  Plot  In the body of the work it is revealed that Jack Adams is actually a woman (Cassie) dressing in men‚Äôs clothing, who has spent several years searching for her betrothed on various ocean voyages. She is so successful in her masquerade as a male that she actually works for the ship captains. The voyage described in Nequa is to the Arctic, where the ship becomes trapped in the ice. After several harrowing adventures the ship is freed and then proceeds to sail north. The Captain of the ship, Rafael Ganoa ( Cassie‚Äôs betrothed) is amazed to find that when they reach a certain spot, which should be close to the north pole, the compasses show that the ship is suddenly traveling south. Actually they have sailed into the inside of the earth, where they meet the Altrurians, a society which has developed into a more cooperative society than those on the outside of the earth. Individual members of the Altrurian Society describe how the evolution of Altrurian society took place. These explanations reflect Populist thought of the time with definite feminist proclivities, providing the tone of a political novel. Jack Adams exposes his/her secret and is chastised by her betrothed Captain Ganoe as having broken several conventions that exist among the outer earth society. Jack Adams/Cassie Van Ness now called Nequa (the teacher) takes a manuscript that she has written about this voyage and leaves in one of the new aeroplanes for the outside world to have the manuscript you have been reading, published.  History  Compilations which have include information about Nequa, have resulted in misunderstandings about the authorship of the book. The article \\"New World That Eve Made: Feminist Utopias Written by Nineteenth-Century Women\\" authored by Barbara Quissell which appeared in Kenneth Roemers‚Äô America as UtopiaAmerica as Utopia, Roemer, Kenneth M., Burt Franklin Publisher, 1980, , discusses A. O. Grigsby as a woman writer. \\"In Science-Fiction, the early years: A full description of more than 3000 stories\\",Science-Fiction The Early Years, Bleiler, E. F., Kent State University Press, 1991, , page 3 Everett Franklin Bleiler gives a synopsis and lists the authors as Alcanoan O. Grigsby, a male, and Mary P. Lowe, a female. A. O. Grigsby (Alconoan O. Grigsby) was a Populist and later a Socialist who was editor of several newspapers from the 1890s through 1900. Mary P. Lowe was an editor of The New Woman a women‚Äôs suffrage paper and co-editor with A. O. Grigsby of \\"Equity\\", a Populist newspaper, complete editions of which are available on microfilm from the Kansas State Historical Society. The first edition of NEQUA listed A.O. Grigsby and Mary P. Lowe as the copyright holders. There was also an explanation printed in the first edition which credits Dr. T. A. H. Lowe with the original ideas found in NEQUA. Dr. T. A. H. Lowe studied Eclectic Medicine at the Eclectic Medical Institute in Cincinnati.A Profile in Alternative Medicine: The Eclectic Medical College of Cincinnati, 1835-1942, Haller,John S., Kent State University Press, 1999, NEQUA contains many ideas which are similar to other hollow earth books, particularly one titled Mizora. Mizora first appeared in serialized form in the Cincinnati Commercial, a newspaper, while Dr. Lowe was enrolled at the Eclectic Medical Institute. Two other Eclectic Physicians also wrote subterranean fiction. John Uri Lloyd was a teacher in the Pharmacy Department at the Eclectic Medical Institute in Cincinnati. He wrote Etidorhpa which had elements of secret Masonic rituals and alchemy woven throughout the book. Cyrus Teed was also an Eclectic Institute physician who preached the existence of a world inside of the earth. He became leader of Koreshanity which built a commune in Florida.

The others include the Sutton heritage mosaic, the Sutton twin towns mural and the Messenger statue. The armillary was dedicated to the town in 2000 by the Rotary Club, and is in the form of an historical timepiece. It serves three purposes: firstly, simply to tell the time; secondly, to commemorate time through various inscriptions including the Rotary motto \\"Service Above Self\\" and distances to nearby areas such as Kingston upon Thames; and thirdly, to commemorate the work which the Rotary Club has done. Inscription The inscription on the plinth reads as follows:Waymarking History The brief history of the Sutton armillary is that, in the years leading up to the new millennium, the London Borough of Sutton expressed its wish for time-related millennium projects. The Rotary Club responded to this by conceiving, planning and jointly funding the armillary. It was designed to last for years to come, and was originally positioned as the central feature of a Millennium Garden. It was slightly re- positioned in 2011, following a repaving of the pedestrianised High Street area, since when it has stood on the edge of the new central square in the town, directly in front of the Waterstones bookshop. When deciding on the new position, the Rotary Club and the local council had to take account of the need for an adequate supply of sunlight. The armillary also had to be removed temporarily in November 2012, when it came off its plinth ‚Äì this received coverage in the local press in a column headed \\"Time stops in Sutton High Street after Armillary removed\\". Benefits to town Sutton Green Wall in the background The armillary's installation has provided a focus for the town centre, and it will remain as a permanent memorial, marking both the new millennium and the important role the Rotary has played in the welfare of Sutton since 1923.Sutton Council Modern Gov References Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Sutton Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2000 Category:Sundials Category:Astronomical instruments Category:Sutton, London ","title":"Sutton armillary"},{"id":"43629423","text":"Paviton is a rural village in the Pestel commune of the Corail Arrondissement, in the Grand'Anse department of Haiti.

Biography =Early life= Joan Kent was born 30 April 1925 in Lafayette, Indiana, to Gladys and Richard Kent of Tuxedo Park, New York. She grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, spending summers at the family's summer home in Whalewalk Farm, Orleans, Massachusetts. She attended Wheeler School in Providence, Rhode Island but graduated from Mary Institute in St. Louis in 1943. Dillon earned a Bachelor of Arts from Smith College in 1947. Her husband-to-be, George Chaffee Dillon of Liberty, Missouri, had served in the Navy during the Second World War, rising to the rank of Lt. Commander, then receiving an MBA from Harvard Business School. They met in Cambridge and married on 11 September 1948. That same year the couple moved to Kansas City, Missouri where George went to work first for J. Bruening & Co. then Butler Manufacturing in 1949, eventually becoming president and chairman of the board. The Dillons had two daughters and a son. Joan Dillon went on to complete a master's degree in Medieval History at the University of Missouri in 1969 with a thesis on Medieval architecture. From 1962 to 1971 she taught Ancient and Medieval History at Sunset Hill School (now The Pembroke Hill School). =The Folly Theater= The Folly Theater in 1973 as a burlesque house, 300 W. 12th St., Kansas City, Missouri, as documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey The Folly Theater is a historic theater in Kansas City, Missouri. It originally opened as the Standard Theater on 23 September 1900 and featured on the burlesque and vaudeville circuit. Business started declining in 1928 and the theater was closed between 1932 and 1941. The theater began showing adult movies in 1969 but continued to physically decline. The balcony had been closed by the fire marshall in 1964. The theater again closed in January 1974. The theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York, announced that if a buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot. A group of local historic preservation activists, including Dillon and William N. Deramus III, formed the nonprofit Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. The Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation. Folly Theater was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. But preventing the building from being demolished was just the beginning. The building was in a considerable state of disrepair. Most of the windows were broken. A chandelier had fallen onto the balcony. Pornographic magazines rotted in closets. Nineteen tones of pigeon dung would be removed from the building. Between 1974 and 1987 Dillon and the Performing Arts Foundation raised $5 million for the restoration of the theater, including a $1 million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The theater was reopened in 1981. A plaque was mounted on the stage recognizing Joan Dillon's work in saving the Folly Theater. A pair of plaster pigeons installed above the box office by architect Bob Berkebile are named Joan and George after the Dillons. =A national role= Her work saving and restoring the Folly Theater made Dillon a nationally known historic preservation advocate. She became a board member of the League of Historic American Theaters from 1978-1981 and 1992-1998, the National Trust for Historic Preservation from 1980-1990, President Reagan's Committee on the Arts and Humanities from 1982-1990 and the Smithsonian National Board from 1989-1995. Her board and committee work required frequent travel to Washington, D.C. =American Theaters= For a number of years Dillon had been thinking about a book documenting America's nineteenth century historic theaters. Through her work on historic preservation, Dillon met architectural historian David Naylor. Naylor had already produced two books on movie theaters, American Picture Palaces: The Architecture of Fantasy (1981) and Great American Movie Theaters (1987), and during the years 1994-1996 the two worked together on Dillon's idea. They began by contacting one thousand five hundred theaters by telephone and postcard. They then sent a follow-up questionnaire to more than a thousand from the first list. The two then traveled extensively with one or both Dillon and Naylor eventual visiting two hundred and fifty theaters. Eventually the two arrived upon a list of forty theaters, arranged into seven broad categories, they deemed representative of the breadth of American nineteenth century theaters (see next section for detail on their list and categories). The record of their survey, American Theaters: Performance Halls of the Nineteenth Century, was published in 1997. =Art and Asian Scholar Rock Collector= Joan Dillon had a lifetime interest and passion for art and Asian scholar rocks. In the 1960s, on a visit to Paris, France with her teenage son Kent Dillon, she discovered large Art Nouveau posters in various French art galleries before it was widely popular. In the ensuing years, she purchased over 30 of these large posters. She also had a lifelong passion for rocks of all kinds. She had an eagle-eye walking the beaches of Cape Cod. She kept a rock polisher grinding away in the garage for years. Later she discovered Asian scholar rocks and purchased a variety of rocks from dealers in London, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, China, and Japan. On her death, her entire collection of over 100 scholar rocks was donated to ??. =Later life= Throughout her life Dillon continued to spend summers in Cape Cod. In 1976 she bought a home in North Chatham, Massachusetts. Dillon continued her historic preservation activities in the Cape Cod region. She worked in Acquisitions for the Cape Cod Museum of Art from 2007-2009. In 2007 she published Barns of Cape Cod with her son, Kent C. Dillon and photographer Blandon Belushin. For the last ten years of her life she lived in Cape Cod permanently and it was in her home there that Joan Dillon died at the age of 83 of leukemia and cardiac arrest on 18 January 2009. American Theaters After a brief historical essay, the bulk of the book consists of the section, \\"A Revue of Nineteenth Century American Theaters.\\" From the thousands of initially identified theaters, the forty that Dillon and Naylor selected as exemplary of nineteenth century theaters are the following. =Eastern Town Hall Opera Houses= * Chester Meetinghouse (Chester, Connecticut) * Provincetown Town Hall (Provincetown, Massachusetts) * Claremont Opera House (Wilmington, North Carolina) * Thalian Hall (Wilmington, North Carolina) =Theatrical Venues in the Midwest= * Calumet Theater (Calumet, Michigan) * What Cheer Opera House (What Cheer, Iowa) * Grand Opera House (Oshkosh, Wisconsin) * Pella Opera House (Pella, Iowa) * Pabst Theater (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) =Western Boomtown Opera Houses= * Schieffelin Hall and Bird Cage Theatre (Tombstone, Arizona) * Garcia Opera House (Socorro, New Mexico) * Central City Opera House (Central City, Colorado) * Eureka Opera House (Eureka, Nevada) * Wheeler Opera House (Aspen, Colorado) =Revival Halls and the Chautauqua Circuit= * Ryman Auditorium (Nashville, Tennessee) * The Temple (Ocean Park, Maine) * The Great Auditorium (Ocean Grove, New Jersey) * Chautauqua Auditorium (Boulder, Colorado) =Community Halls and Library Theaters= * St. George Social Hall (St. George, Utah) * Tivoli Turnhalle (Denver, Colorado) * Mechanics Hall (Worcester, Massachusetts) * Library Theater (Warren, Pennsylvania) * Mabel Tainter Memorial Theater (Menomonie, Wisconsin) * Cumston Hall (Monmouth, Maine) * Haskell Opera House (Derby Line, Vermont and Rock Island, Quebec) =Victorian Playhouses= * Symphony Hall (Allentown, Pennsylvania) * Grand Opera House (Meridian, Mississippi) * Fulton Opera House (Lancaster, Pennsylvania) * Goodspeed Opera House (East Haddam, Connecticut) * Academy of Music (Northampton, Massachusetts) * Colonial Theater (Boston, Massachusetts) * Folly Theater (Kansas City, Missouri) =Grand Opera Houses and Concert Halls= * Steinert Hall (Boston, Massachusetts) * Granger Hall (National City, California) * Academy of Music (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) * Grand Opera House (Wilmington, Delaware) * Grand 1894 Opera House (Galveston, Texas) * Cincinnati Music Hall (Cincinnati, Ohio) * Auditorium Theatre (Chicago, Illinois) Joan Dillon papers Joan Dillon donated her papers relating to the production of American Theaters to the University of Maryland, College Park in April 2003.

E. Gnanavel Raja. The film features composer and acting debut G. V. Prakash Kumar, Nikki Galrani in her Tamil debut in the lead roles, with the former also composing the film's music. A remake of the 2013 Telugu film Prema Katha Chitram, the film was released on 15 January 2015. Plot Kathir, Nisha and Kumaran plan to commit suicide together because they feel like failures. However, they want to fulfill their last wishes before doing so. Nisha wants to steal a new car, and Kathir wants to slap the local MLA in his own house. After Nisha and Kathir fulfill their last wishes, the trio escapes from the police and flees to a nearby resort. There, they find Athisaya Raj, who also wishes to commit suicide, and he joins them as they travel to a farmhouse. Once they arrive, Kumaran and Nisha plan to postpone their suicides for three days in order to prevent Kathir's suicide, as Nisha has fallen in love with him. Their plan succeeds, and in those three days, the four get close to each other. Kathir develops feelings for Nisha, but hesitates to tell her in fear of humiliation. At the end of the third day, Kumaran asks Nisha to kiss Kathir to divert him from suicide. He meanwhile requests that Kathir kisses Nisha, telling him that Nisha wants to experience her first kiss before dying. Kathir accepts, with shame and shyness. As Kathir tries to kiss Nisha, a ghost enters her body, forcing Kathir away. Flabbergasted, Kathir runs out of the room. Whenever Nisha reveals her feelings to Kathir and he responds by hugging or touching her, the ghost enters her body and scares Kathir away. Unaware of the ghost, Nisha grows depressed. When Kumaran hears Kathir describing Nisha as a ghost, he rushes to Nisha's room to scold her and tell her to apologize to Kathir, only for the ghost to enter her body and thrash him. That night, Raj too experiences the ghost's fury at its villainous worst. The trio decides to distance themselves from Nisha and to always stay together. The next morning, they try to get the ghost to leave Nisha's body, and call upon Ghost Gopal Varma, an exorcist. However, the ghost thrashes him as well. Afterwards, Kathir brings up the courage to ask the ghost why she is taking vengeance on them, and the ghost narrates her story to the trio. She is Shruthi, and she came to the same farmhouse with her newlywed husband, Shiva. Four men entered the farmhouse and raped her before killing the two of them. Kathir is emotionally touched, but before he could help the ghost, Nisha, deducing the presence of the ghost from the avoidance of the other three, slit her wrist to make Kathir get rid of Shruthi. Kathir, seeing this, brought her out of the house to get her to the hospital, but he is interrupted by the four men who raped Shruthi. Kathir put up a fight, but in vain. Shruthi, unable to use her powers due to the slit wrist, calls for her husband, who possesses Kathir and fights the five men. The film ends with Kathir and Nisha hugging in the kitchen. The glass door shows Shruthi's and Shiva's reflection, showing that their ghosts are still inside the house. Cast * G. V.

He attended the Col√©a primary school until 1952, when he transferred to a school in Kankan. In 1957 he returned to Conakry to finish his primary studies before going back to Kankan where he enrolled in a vocational school and earned his certification as a cabinetmaker. In 1963 he moved to the town of Beyla in southern Guinea to work. Demba Camara joined the band Bembeya Jazz National in 1963. He became its leader, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter. At the height of his popularity, Demba Camara was declared the top African singer by the British Broadcasting Corporation. = Death and burial = In March 1973 Bembeya Jazz National was sent to Senegal by the Guinean government for a performance tour. The band was warmly received at Dakar-Yoff Airport on 31 March, where they departed in a caravan for Dakar proper. At an intersection in front of the Deux Mamelles, the Peugeot 504 car carrying Demba Camara, guitarist S√©kou Diabat√©, and secondary vocalist Salifou Kaba was involved in a collision. Demba Camara was crushed under a door and was taken along with the other two to Dentec Hospital, where doctors determined that he had suffered a fractured skull, compressed rib cage, and several lacerations. In spite of the doctors' efforts, he died from internal bleeding at 01:00 on 5 April.

Characters  = Main = Ang√©lica Vale is La fea m√°s bella. *Leticia \\"Lety\\" Padilla Solis de Mendiola / Aurora Mayer De Salinas (Ang√©lica Vale), She is an intelligent and charming but very ugly young woman. She seizes the chance to prove herself when she gets hired at Conceptos, one of Mexico's most prestigious media enterprises. She immediately falls in love with her boss, Fernando Mendiola despite the fact that he's already engaged to the jealously controlling Marcia. She is also hated by most of Conceptos staff who don't take her seriously and don't think she fits in. She helps her boss, (whom she calls \\"Don Fernando\\") fix his financial mistakes by tampering with the books after much hesitating and debating on the legalities of it. Her boss gets her on board by seducing her and pretending he wants to be her boyfriend. Despite him being engaged, and having not only witnessed but help cover for his many infidelities, she accepts and she helps him with the company financial troubles. After she finds out she was just being used, she runs away to Acapulco where she meets Aldo and learns to open up her heart again. She ends up in a love triangle between the handsome, kind Aldo and the man she still has lingering feelings for, Fernando. She gets two makeovers during the course of the show; the first one transforms her into a classical seductress-type beauty (\\"Aurora\\") which makes her realize her potential but leaves her feeling uncomfortable and unsure of who she really is. The second makeover is at the very end which combines the simplicity and demureness of her old self with the classic beauty of the vampy \\"Aurora\\". Over time, Lety realizes her worth and her influence on others, which helps win over most of the Conceptos staff. Her wedding was also a dramatic, elaborate affair, taking place in the Cathedral of Monterrey and containing everyone from Conceptos, which is much of the cast. The broadcast of the wedding had the cast in a parade with thousands of fans crowding the streets to see Lety marry the man of her dreams. *Fernando Mendiola Sa√©nz (Jaime Camil), Son of Humberto Mendiola, he is elected as the new president of Conceptos when his fianc√©, Marcia, votes for him. He's sarcastic and very much a playboy but he tries to work hard at the company, despite his inexperience. He's initially unhappy at having an ugly assistant but finds her intelligence to be an asset and keeps her around, even coming to her defense on occasion. He convinces his assistant, Lety, to help him doctor some books by taking advantage of her feelings for him. He secretly \\"dates\\" her to keep her on his side, despite being engaged to Marcia. However, he slowly but surely falls in love with Lety but that's when she discovers he was just using her all along. She leaves and when she returns he finds it harder to convince her of his sincerity, especially when he discovers the new man in her life, Aldo. He jealously spies on Lety and Aldo when they start their burgeoning romance, enlisting his friend Omar to help. It takes him a while but he finally breaks up with Marcia, making it clear that he doesn't want her, and the only woman he really loves is Lety. *Marcia Villarroel Drummond Saenz (Elizabeth √Ålvarez, Fernando's fianc√©e. She knows her fiance's reputation as a Casanova so she keeps Fernando under surveillance, or employs her friend Alicia to do so, whenever she can. She initially doesn't like Lety because she thinks Lety is helping Fernando carry on his affairs (which is actually partly true). She never thought Lety and Fernando would be carrying on an affair and when she found out she was devastated, adding a new reason as to why she hated Lety until nearly the end. Lety tries to regard her with respect, knowing that she was in the wrong dating her boss despite knowing he was engaged to Marcia. She and Fernando break up and after realizing he'll never love her back, she decides they really are better off friends. Eventually Marcia meets someone online and they begin dating; she also gets over her negative feelings towards Lety and even attends her lavish wedding. *Alicia Ferreira de Mora (Patricia Navidad), Alicia Ferreira is everything that Lety is not: graceless and tactless but sexy and proud of it. She gets hired at Conceptos, not for her abilities or her resume like Lety, but as Marcia Villarroel's spy on Fernando. She's \\"The Ugly Club's\\" nemesis, they nickname her \\"la oxigenada\\" (\\"the Bleached Blonde\\"). She has serious monetary problems because she likes to buy herself lavish clothes and jewelry despite not having the salary for it. She often likes to brag that she studied \\"six semesters of finance at the Anahuac\\", as proof of her education and abilities. She ends up marrying Tomas, who she calls 'Tommy', after discovering how much money he makes at 'Conceptos'. Though she's shallow, vindictive, and spoiled, shades of her softer side start to appear towards the end of the series culminating in her returning the money she stole from 'Conceptos' after discovering Tomas was taking the blame for it. *Don Erasmo Padilla Garc√≠a, (Jos√© Jos√©), Lety's father. He's extremely strict and still sees his daughter as a little girl who cannot look after herself. He values good morals above all else and he's terrified of big changes. He treats Tomas like a son, and the only boy who's allowed in Lety's room. He later helps out with Lety's company, \\"Filmo Imagen\\". After much prodding from his wife and daughter, he accepts that Lety is a beautiful, grown woman who can take care of herself. He suffers a heart attack and almost dies. He and Julieta renew their vows. *Do√±a Julieta Solis de Padilla (Ang√©lica Mar√≠a), Lety's mother. She is an excellent cook and a caring mother. Even when Lety does not want to tell her all that goes on in her life, she prays for her daughter's well-being and offers to lend an ear if she ever does want to talk. She treats Tomas like the son she's always wanted. feeding him whenever he stops by (which is often as he loves her cooking). She always supports her family and offers Lety and Tomas advice. Though she likes Aldo, she ends up being very supportive of Fernando and helps him win Lety back as she starts planning her wedding with Aldo. *Luigi Lombardi (Sergio Mayer), homosexual fashion director. He's obsessed with beauty and glamor and will not stand anything less. He declares himself Lety's enemy because of those beliefs. He develops a huge crush on Aldo and for a while he and Alicia try to fight for Aldo's attentions (which Aldo doesn't seem to realize). The crush more or less stops when he discovers, along with everyone at Conceptos, that Aldo is in love with Lety. He later on becomes obsessed with the glamorous and mysterious Aurora (secretly Lety) and would go on to do a second makeover on her right near the end of the show (a makeover that is in the middle of the ugly and seductress extremes; leaving Lety with a lovely look befitting her). He does this for her as a thanks for her helping him reunite him with his ailing mother and formerly unaccepting father. = Recurring = Juan Soler is Aldo. *Aldo Domenza√≠n (Juan Soler), A charming, handsome fisherman and chef with aspirations to own his own restaurant. He befriends Lety after saving her from drowning in the ocean He teaches her of the beauties of life and eventually falls in love with her much to the surprise of just about everyone, including Lety. He respects that she's still broken-hearted from her relationship with Fernando but he promises he'll win her heart, going so far as to follow her back to Conceptos and financially help the floundering company because he knows it's very important to Lety. Sometimes when Aldo has a heart to heart with Lety near water, a swan is seen swimming nearby. (a possible reference to the \\"ugly-duckling-to-swan\\"; the swan refers to Lety). He eventually gains ownership of Conceptos where he charms and befriends everyone there, except for Fernando. The two recognize each other as rivals for Lety's heart but try to not to fight too openly for the sake of Lety. Tomas changes his appearance to look more like Aldo and try and win over Alicia. Aldo offers sympathies and advice and the two discover they share a mutual dislike for Fernando (because he broke Lety's heart) thus becoming good friends. In the end of the series, he is revealed to be a guardian angel who was sent to help and save Lety. *Tom√°s Mora Gutierrez (Luis Manuel √Åvila), He is Lety's best (and initially only) friend. Being as ugly as Lety is, they relate to each other well and have always been like siblings, giving each other moral support. He is very intelligent, loyal, and caring but lacks common sense at times. He falls for the buxom but shallow Alicia Ferreira after he finds a picture of her in a magazine. Though she displays hostility towards him due to his appearance, he continues to try to win her over with gifts and money, which she gladly accepts. When he discovers Alicia has a huge crush on Aldo, he tries to change his hairstyle and clothing to match him (though the plan backfires on him when he doesn't pull the look off). He becomes good friends with Aldo and encourages him to pursue Lety, especially since it'll discourage Alicia's crush on Aldo. He eventually ends up marrying Alicia and getting her pregnant at the end of the show. He is somewhat of a show-off and fancies himself as the general manager of Filmo Imagen, the \\"dummy\\" company he and Lety created to help out Conceptos financially. He also tries to transform himself from an ugly duckling to a \\"Prince Charming\\" but doesn't do it nearly as dramatically as his best friend. Food and women, in that order, are his Achilles' heel. *Carolina \\"Caro\\" Angeles de Carvajal (Nora Salinas), formerly Conceptos ' public promoter. She seems to appear when Lety is going through personal conflicts and helps her out. She then becomes Lety's 2nd best friend. She's also friends with Aldo and offers a friendly ear when he wonders how to go about winning Lety's heart. She helps makeover Lety into a seductress type model they nickname \\"Aurora\\". She's the only contact 'Conceptos' has with the mysterious Aurora and she tries to cover for Lety/Aurora when she can. She starts falling for Omar despite helping Lety get back at him for helping Fernando toy with her heart. She tries to convince Lety/Aurora not to toy with Omar anymore after hearing of his pain and heartache from the man himself. In the end, she ends up sleeping with, and then starting a relationship with Omar, who has more or less learned the error of his womanizing ways. *Omar Carvajal (Agust√≠n Arana), He is Fernando's chauvinistic, womanizing best friend and accomplice. He is also Conceptos‚Äô vice president. He believes firmly in bachelorhood and how to make the most of it. He usually supports Fernando's worst ideas and the advice he provides Fernando often turns out to be even worse than Fernando's own judgment. Omar believes that he is the ultimate Casanova and therefore he can woo any women he wants. In fact, he is the one who tells Fernando to seduce Lety in order to keep the company. He nicknames Lety \\"la gargolita\\" (\\"the little gargoyle\\"), which Fernando later comes to despise and angrily (with force) discourages. He meets his match in the mysterious woman, \\"Aurora\\" (secretly Lety) and falls head over heels for the stunning woman only to be rebuffed. He tries to woo the mysterious woman, confused but more determined every time she calls him on his playboy ways and leaves him planted. He seeks help from Carolina but eventually falls for her instead, thus ending his bachelor days. *Ariel Villarroel Drummond (Ra√∫l Maga√±a), Marcia's brother, Ariel is a greedy and selfish man only able to look after himself and his money. He wants to get the presidency of Conceptos no matter what. He's always sneaking behind Fernando's back, looking for flaws in his work. He gets the police on Tomas in the last episode, blaming him of a theft that was actually committed by Alicia, who then rushes to save him. *Sim√≥n Jose \\"Simon Joseph\\" Contreras (Julio Mannino), He has a major crush on Paula Mar√≠a, although his job as the Conceptos messenger is not good enough for her standards. He is cute, sweet, fun, and always on the move. He eventually earns a diploma at Information Technology and wins over Paula Maria. They marry shortly afterwards. He and Celso keep close ties with the Ugly Club, but they aren't technically part of it because they are males, though sometimes others see them as part of the \\"Club\\" nevertheless. *Don Humberto Mendiola (Carlos Bracho), Founder and first president of Conceptos, he is Fernando's proud father. He appreciates honesty and loyalty. He almost sues Lety when he discovered what she did to his company (with Fernando), but he's confronted by her dad, and they end up forming a compromise. *Do√±a Teresa \\"Teresita\\" Sa√©nz de Mendiola (Julissa), Fernando's mother likes to see her family together and is very fond of Marcia, siding with her against Lety, especially after the near bankruptcy of Conceptos (partly because of Lety and Fernando's book tampering) is discovered. Though she was distrustful of Lety at first, she ends up getting used to her. *Celso Duran (Erick Guecha), He is Conceptos 's doorman. He is very humble and honest. He is usually accompanied by his bulldog, Sans√≥n. Though he is the first person to be disgusted at Lety's original appearance on her first to \\"Conceptos\\", he ends up being one of her first work friends, besides Simon and \\"The Ugly Club\\". He often does other people's, especially Alicia's, bidding. *Sara Patino (Raquel Garza), Sara is Omar Carvajal's secretary. Her great height has impeded her from getting a good husband. Sara is very brave and will do anything to protect herself and the rest of \\"The Ugly Club\\". She ends up adopting a kid in the end. *Irma \\"Irmita\\" Ramirez (Luz Mar√≠a Aguilar), She is the oldest member of \\"The Ugly Club\\" and Luigi Lombardi's right hand. As the least gossipy of the group, she is always there to advise her friends or to give her boss his Valerian drops when the \\"mimisky\\" (mee-mees-kee) hits him. Her husband, who abandoned her years ago, makes an unexpected visit shortly after Irmita faints of being overworked in the middle of the program, and dies several episodes later for not taking his prescribed medication. *Efren Rodriguez \\"El Cheque\\" (Carlos Bonavides ), Lola's irresponsible husband, whom she refers to as Se√±or Cheque (Mr. Check). He abandoned her and their children and he never has their monthly support payment on time. As he is not yet divorced from Lola, his relationship with his new sweetheart, Yazm√≠n, can still be considered an affair. *Jaimito Fuentes (Miguel Jim√©nez), Son of Paula Mar√≠a. He is a good kid who is always thinking of his mother. He also likes Simon, like a father, who has said that he wanted to become a messenger just like Simon. Jaimito had the opportunity to meet and live with his real father, instead he really wanted to be with Simon and found out so did his mother. Simon is happy to have him as a step-father when his mother marries. *Juana Valdez (Gloria Izaguirre), Juana is the maid/janitor. She is the only member of \\"The Ugly Club\\" who does not complain about her love life. She is very good at anything esoteric, such as reading crystal balls or tarot cards. She predicts Lety's distant wedding in one of the earliest episodes of the program. *Paula Maria Fuentes de Contreras (Niurka Marcos), Paula Maria is the receptionist and though she belongs to \\"The Ugly Club\\", she is quite pretty. However, because she wants the best for her and her son, Jaimito, she is very picky with the prospects she gets, always waiting for Prince Charming to come rescue her.

Their properties and womenfolk were attacked. More than three thousand non-Muslims died in the massacre.  Background  In 1958, Ayub Khan led military junta came to power in Pakistan. From the very beginning, the policy of the Ayub regime was to cleanse East Pakistan of the Bengali Hindu and other minorities.  Killings  On 22 March 1962, an ethnic riot broke out between the Santhals and the Muslims in the Malda district of West Bengal. The Santhals, armed with bows and arrows, shot dead three Muslims while six were burnt to death. Between 16 and 20 April, the ethnic tension between the two groups led to another ethnic riot. The Pakistani press not only published exaggerated figures of Muslim casualties in Maldah district, even though there was no incident of ethnic violence in the district. Pakistan Radio too broadcast false stories of atrocities on minorities in India. On 22 April, Lieutenant General Muhammad Azam Khan, the Governor of East Pakistan, delivered an inflammatory speech with imaginary stories of torture on minorities in India. On 23 April, the Bengali Hindus and other ethnic minorities were attacked in the Rajshahi Division. The District Magistrate of Rajshahi did not take any steps to stop the attacks. Killings, rape, loot and arson continued for days. They were attacked in the passenger trains at the Rajshahi railway station and in the market adjacent to the Natore railway station. In Sarusa village of Hujuri Para Union under Paba police station, the Hindus were attacked and many were seriously afflicted. In Darsa village under Paba police station 10 people were killed. Thousands non- muslims are taken shelter in a school but brutally it was burnt. An estimated 300 non-Muslims were killed in Rajshahi district alone. The Assistant High Commissioner in Rajshahi came to the rescue of the minorities. The intervention of the Indian Assistant High Commission at resulted in the troops being called and the massacre was stopped. The Pakistan government whipped up a war hysteria and the Indian Deputy High Commission at Dhaka was placed under military guard. It was impossible for the Indian Deputy High Commission to collect information on the attacks on the minorities. Rajeshwar Dayal, the Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan who had come to Dhaka too, was not allowed to visit the districts of Rajshahi and Pabna.  Exodus  Around 11,000 Santhals and Rajbanshis migrated to India.

As of 2014, the school accommodates its full capacity of 400 students. History Tafelberg School was established on 23 July 1983. It was originally a school for white students, and was based in Sea Point from the 1980s until 2010. The school was located at two separate sites in Sea Point and catered for children with special learning needs referred by schools throughout the Cape Peninsula. The junior school was located at 3 Kings Road, on the corner of Tramway Road. The senior school was located in a building at 355 Main Road which had previously housed Ellerslie Girls' High School from 1899. In 1989 Ellerslie Girls' High School vacated the building following a merger with Sea Point High School, formerly Sea Point Boys' High School, which had become co-educational and Tafelberg School subsequently occupied the vacant building.Sea Point High School. Retrieved 7 September 2014 Tafelberg School became racially integrated in a post-apartheid South Africa, and junior and senior sections of the school have merged and moved to a new location in Bothasig in June 2010. The construction of the new school building in Bothasig, \\"the first fully accessible resource centre in the province, both from a physical and curriculum accessibility point of view\\", cost R45 million. The move to a \\"more friendly learning environment\\" reduced the school's capacity in terms of student numbers and necessitated a one-third reduction in the number of classes per grade. The 17,000 square metre site in Sea Point's Main Road previously used by the school and Ellerslie Girls' High School before that was declared a provincial heritage site in a government gazette dated 15 December 1989. The disused site has been proposed for redevelopment by the Western Cape Government, which says that it is suitable for a mixed-use development and has requested expressions of interest from parties interested in buying the property or leasing it for a period of up to 60 years provided that the original 1899 building and an avenue of wild fig trees are preserved. In February 2014 it was reported that the Kings Road site in Sea Point previously used by the school was to be leased by the French School of Cape Town and R18 million worth of upgrades were planned for it. Academics In 2002 Tafelberg School received a Special Superintendent-General Award from the Western Cape Education Department for having students achieve National Senior Certificates with matriculation endorsements. A matriculation endorsement allows students to study for a Bachelor's degree at any South African university. In April 2012, it was reported that Tafelberg School had achieved a 100% matric pass rate since the new school building opened in 2010. International exchange Tafelberg School is twinned with Longcause Community Special School in Plymouth, England, an international exchange partnership facilitated by Afri Twin, which has linked over 250 schools in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Tafelberg students travelled overseas and visited the school and some other nearby schools including Hele's School and Woodcote High SchoolChris Eloff in 2008, and again in 2010 during a tour of the United Kingdom. The visits incorporated cultural exchanges and sporting events. Ritalin use In 1999 it was reported that an estimated one third of all pupils attending Tafelberg School were using Ritalin. School psychiatrist Suzette Swart said the use of the drug at the school was strictly controlled and it was only administered with permission in writing from a pupil's parent. She said they use the drug \\"to help children concentrate better\\", but not all children who have difficulty concentrating need it.

Although the origin of this picture is not known and its existence is not recorded in any written documents, comparative analyses have shown that it dates from the period between 1350 and 1360. The early character of the engraved drawing and the pentiments that have been revealed prove that it isn‚Äôt a later copy.Pavel Krop√°ƒçek, Madona zbraslavsk√°, Voln√© smƒõry XXXV, 1938-40, pp. 8-10 The story that the picture was dedicated to the monastery by its founder Wenceslaus II (1278‚Äì1305) dates from the late 18th century. In the past, there was an excerpt of poetry on the rear side of panel, glorifying the Virgin Mary that was misinterpreted by preceding generations of historians. In 1420 the monastery was burned down by the Hussites and the picture was reputedly found two hundred years later in the rubble, restored and exhibited in a newly built church in 1654. Its current state follows restoration in 1945,Bohuslav Sl√°nsk√Ω, V√Ωstava t≈ô√≠ obraz≈Ø, kat. NG Praha 1946, pp. 15-23 and in the 1990s old areas of retouching and overpainting were removed.  Description and context  The picture is painted in tempera on a chalk base with an engraved drawing outlined in black. It is on a lime-wood panel and measures 89 x 59.5 cm. Compared with older Italian-Byzantine models, the drawing is suppressed and the painter models volume using the technique of thin, glazed paint layers of colour gradation in the incarnates. The Madonna has a gold-embroidered white cloak and a blue cloak with green lining decorated with gold stars. The Madonna‚Äôs cloak and white veil and the transparent shirt of the child are decorated along their hems with gold embroidery. The crown is decorated with curly leaves. The stones and pearls on the crown, halos, hems and clasp were mounted later on, while the background was also subsequently gilded over.Matƒõjƒçek A, Pe≈°ina J, 1950, p. 58 The ring on the Madonna‚Äôs finger refers to the mystic betrothal of Christ and Mary that symbolises the Christian Church. This allegorical identification of Mary with the Church is characteristic of the Cistercian context and stems from the preaching of St Bernard of Clairvaux. Infant Jesus holding a Bohemian waxwing In its composition, the picture has much in common with the Madonna of Veve≈ô√≠ type and the later Madonna of Rome. At the same time, however, it also repeats several motifs from earlier Marian pictures. Its colour palette recalls the painting of Tomasso da Modena. The motif of the Infant Jesus holding a goldfinch or waxwing (here) was widespread through Italy from the early 14th century and appears in the Rajhrad Breviary of Queen Elizabeth Richeza of Poland.Matƒõjƒçek A, Pe≈°ina J, 1950, p. 59 In contrast to the older Italian- Byzantine type of Madonna, the Hodegetria in which the mother presents the child as an object of worship, in this composition there is a tangible shift to a more human and intimate relationship between the mother and child that corresponds more to the ideas of believers around the mid-14th century. The Zbraslav Madonna was one of the most celebrated Marian pictures in Bohemia. It was originally intended for the church of the Cistercian monastery, where Bohemian kings from the P≈ôemyslid dynasty were buried. Some people believe that Charles IV himself commissioned the picture.Matƒõjƒçek A, Pe≈°ina J, 1950, s. 60 The Zbraslav Madonna was greatly revered and there exist many copies of it, dating mainly from the Baroque period. The Zbraslav Madonna was consecrated as the 43rd chapel of the Holy Route from Prague to Mlad√° Boleslav that was established by the Jesuits between 1674 and 1690.

Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) obtained a redacted copy under freedom of information laws and published it on EFA's website. Subsequently, an unredacted copy was found and the redacted parts were added to the EFA copy. Policy review The Walsh Report was an Australian cryptography policy review undertaken at the request of the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department by Gerard Walsh, the former deputy director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The report included a broad analysis of cryptography issues from an Australian context. The report, titled Review of Policy relating to Encryption Technologies, is popularly called the Walsh Report. In his report Walsh found that there was a lack of coordination in the government over the establishment of cryptography policy. Walsh also reported no clarity as to which department and which minister was responsible for cryptographic policy. Consequently, there was a danger that policy would be developed without being coordinated. The main advice given by Walsh in the report was that major legislative action to safeguard law-enforcement or national security was not required at the time. No specific options were recommended in the report for legislation on cryptography, nor did the report recommend mandatory key recovery. Recommendations in the report for minor legislative and other actions included: * establishment of a summary law on intrusive investigative powers * to consider the setting up of an additional and more serious offence when cryptography is used to obstruct a criminal investigation * to consider establishing a power to allow police to demand encryption keys * a key recovery or escrow scheme, as had been advocated by the United States, not be established by Australia. History =Background= Walsh was invited to undertake his review following on from the Barrett Report, which concluded: \\"while Australian agencies all report that encryption has not been a problem to date, it is likely to become one in the future.\\" =Initial issue= The Walsh Report was issued on 10 October 1996. =Deposit copies= After being printed, deposit copies of the report were lodged by the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS) with around 40 university and public libraries under a free deposit scheme. =Embargo= The report was listed for sale in January 1997 by AGPS. Three weeks later Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) enquired why it was not actually available. In February 1997, before the Walsh Report was publicly released, the Australian Attorney-General's Department embargoed it and withheld the report from commercial sale. =FOI request= In March 1997 EFA applied for the release of the Walsh Report under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. Initially the request was denied. Following a review that was requested by EFA, in June 1997 EFA obtained a copy of the Walsh Report that had been redacted on national security, defence, international relations, internal working document, law enforcement and public safety grounds. EFA then published the redacted version of the Walsh Report on its website. =Discovery of deposit copies= In December 1998 an uncensored copy of the Walsh Report was discovered in the State Library of Tasmania by Nick Ellsmore, a university student in Hobart. Ellsmore alerted EFA to the availability of the report. =Publication of unredacted version= By comparing the redacted and unredacted copies it was possible to identify the censored sections of the report. EFA added the redacted parts to its copy on the Internet, and highlighted them in red. Following the discovery of the uncensored copies of the Walsh report, The Australian newspaper revealed the censored recommendations. Release of the complete report was also covered by Hobart's Mercury, Melbourne's Sun-Herald, The Sydney Morning Herald, many Internet news sites and radio stations in Perth and Sydney. =Recall of deposit copies= On 10 February 1999, after The Australian's revelations, the Australian Government Information Service (AusInfo), the government publisher, wrote to the deposit libraries. The AusInfo letter, said that the \\"Attorney- General's Department wants all copies recalled\\" and asked that copies of the report be returned to AusInfo. A spokesperson for Daryl Williams, the Attorney-General, said that the release of the Walsh report had been discussed with AusInfo, but denied that the Government initiated the recall. In February 1999 EFA cryptography committee chairman, Greg Taylor, said: \\"The bumbling attempts to censor the [Walsh] report have only served to focus international attention on it\\". Censored parts Redacted observations included: * Encrypted data is being stored and transmitted beyond the visibility or reach of investigative agencies. The censored recommendations included: * software booby-traps * PC bugging * that Australian law enforcement agencies be given the power to \\"hack\\" corporate computer systems and to alter proprietary software to allow for the monitoring of communications * as strong cryptographic products can be obtained over the Internet, the efficacy of export controls over cryptographic products as a defensive strategy is dubious * the conclusion of the Barrett Report that the time when encryption becomes a problem for law enforcement and national security agencies is not yet here, but will soon be * the surveillance powers of ASIO should be extended.

The series was first broadcast on February 3, 2014 on Nickelodeon and it ended on September 9, 2017. In Canada, it is broadcast on Treehouse TV. Plot The literacy series takes place in a colorful world resembling that of inside a fairytale, in which the central characters reside. The show revolves around young troll Wally Trollman, who uses his magic stick to turn words into physical objects or occurrences, along with his pet dragon Norville and other friends. The duo occasionally runs into trouble, mostly caused by Bobgoblin. Characters =Main= *Wally Trollman (voiced by Thomas Langston) is an adventurous 7-year-old blue troll who uses his magic stick to allow words to come to life. His mother, Linda Trollman, debuted in the season one finale \\"Mission for Mom\\". *Norville Trollman (voiced by Dan Bittner) is a red dragon and Wally's pet. He cannot speak clearly, his barks and yips form words but are sometimes hard to understand. In some cases Wally repeats the words Norville says, allowing the audience to hear it pronounced more clearly. *Bobgoblin (voiced by Aria Capria and Tony Bennett (singing voice in Wally Saves the Trollidays) is a troublesome green goblin who talks in the third person and habitually addresses people by their full names. He has an uncle named Robgoblin who lets him take care of his pet dragon Hortis sometimes. His buddy-pal-friend is Hattie. He is also among Wally's friends and his strength was enhanced by Wally enchanting him with the word \\"Lift.\\" Wally: \\"Mongoblin can now lift.\\" Bobgoblin: \\"Woah, I can lift! Up and down and up and down. So strong. Yay!\\" Bobgoblin enjoys music, and in several episodes is shown to play the drums very proficiently. *Gina Giant (voiced by Taliyah Whitaker) is Wally's neighbor and one of his best friends. She is a 6-year-old purple giant with blonde hair and turquoise eyes who has a collection of dolls. Wally magically enhanced her agility by transforming her into an acrobat, and she is able to do cartwheels, front flips and a double backflip while capturing Wizard Jeff's flying fish Sheila. *Ogre Doug (voiced by Jorge Vega) is one of Wally's good friends. He is a gentle 7-year-old yellow ogre who has red hair and wears suspenders. He is a creature expert who likes studying creatures, playing with creatures, and writing songs about creatures; he plays the guitar (as seen in ‚ÄúWally Saves the Trollidays‚Äù, the ‚ÄúAlphabet Song‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúOde To A Creature‚Äù songs). Also, he likes to hug, saying \\"Doug Hug!\\" as he does so. *Libby Light Sprite (voiced by Jenna Iacono) is an energetic pink sprite with purple hair and the ability to trace words from light. Like Ogre Doug, she is also good friends with Wally. She is later revealed to be the Buddy Pal Friend of Gina. She enjoys singing, dancing, and putting on light shows with her powers. *Stan of the Swamp (voiced by J.R. Horne (2014-2016, his death) and Bob Ari (2016‚Äìpresent) is a stubborn and irritable swamp monster who would rather spend his day sitting in his muddy home than going on an adventure. However, his swamp home and succotash pies bring him happiness that the others do not expect from a grump like him. =Recurring= Humanoids *Mrs. Trollman (later revealed to be named Linda, voiced by Alanna Ubach) is Wally's mom. She is pictured at the end of \\"Wally Saves the Trollidays\\", mentioned in \\"Young Norville\\", \\"The Great Wishing Potato\\", \\"Buddy Pal Friend Day\\", and \\"Power Tie\\", debuts in person in \\"Mission for Mom\\" and returns in \\"Rock and Troll\\" , \\"Snowgoblin\\", \\"Wally's Great Big Birthday Hunt\\", \\"The Chickephant is Getting Married\\", and \\"A Very Villainous Vacation\\". *Mr. Trollman (later revealed to be named Howard voiced by Jim Gaffigan and Aaron Phillips (Power Tie onlyhttp://www.nickjr.com/wallykazam/videos/power-tie-s2-ep225-full-episode/), singing voice by Antonio Marin (in Wally's Great Big Birthday Hunt) and Adam Sietz (in A Very Villainous Vacation)) is Wally's dad. He is mentioned in \\"Totally Swamped\\", \\"Day in the Dark\\", and \\"Buddy Pal Friend Day\\", pictured in \\"Wally Saves the Trollidays\\", debuts in person in \\"Rock and Troll\\" and returns in \\"Snowgoblin\\" , \\"Wally's Great Big Birthday Hunt\\", \\"The Chickephant is Getting Married\\", \\"A Very Villainous Vacation\\", and \\"Power Tie\\". *Skydasher Steve (aka Steve the Skydasher, voiced by Ben Schwartz) is Wally's uncle. He debuts in \\"The Big Goblin Problem\\". He returns in \\"The Chickephant is Getting Married\\". No episode has specified if he is whether the brother of Linda or Howard. *Betty Yeti (voiced by Andie Mechanic) is a snowboarding yeti. She debuts in \\"Snow Place Like Home\\" and returns in many episodes, including the Alphabet Song. She is also called Elizabeth Yeti, and hides one of Wally's birthday clues in his hunt. *Hattie is a witch. *Cappie (voiced by Violet Tinnirello) is the younger sister of Hattie. She is in a photograph in \\"The Explorers Club\\", debuts in person in \\"Keeping Cappie Happy\\" and returns in \\"The Chickephant is Getting Married\\". *Cake Monster (voiced by Chris Phillips) is monster who likes cake. He debuts in \\"The Cake Monster\\" and returns in \\"The Big Cake Mistake\\", the Alphabet Song during the letter C, \\"The Chickephant is Getting Married!\\", and \\"Power Tie\\". *Victor the Villain (voiced by John O'Hurley) is a villain from a comic book who is brought to life from Wally's magic.

Life Born in Phalsbourg, Moselle from a Lorrainian family which preferred to be French than German when the city was annexed by the Kaiser in 1871. He entered St. Cyr in October 1880, and was appointed a sub-lieutenant on the completion of his course in 1882. He was promoted lieutenant in 1886, captain in 1891, major in 1901 and lieutenant-colonel in 1909. Three years later he was made a colonel. At the outbreak of World War I he served as chief-of-staff to VI Corps. In October 1914, he was promoted brigadier, and in January 1915 was transferred as chief-of-staff to the First Army. On 3 August 1915, he took over command of the 53rd Infantry Division, being later (25 March 1916) promoted a temporary General of Division and appointed to command XXXVIII Army Corps. Ten days later he was placed in command of Tenth Army. On 22 June 1916, he was confirmed in his rank as General of Division. He commanded Tenth Army during the Battle of the Somme, and was then promoted to command a new Army Group (known as G.A.R. ‚Äì Army Group \\"Reserve\\" or \\"Rupture\\") formed behind the centre for the exploitation of the victory counted upon in General Nivelle's Aisne scheme. He was thus involved very deeply in the controversies which centred upon that scheme both before and after that offensive. It was principally his criticisms that initiated the internal crisis, and led to the council of war, in which, however, he seems not to have followed up his objections. He also enjoyed strained relations with his subordinate Mangin as well as with Nivelle; Mangin sought afterwards to saddle him with part of the responsibility for the relative failure of the offensive. After his Army Group had been broken up he was demoted back to command of an Army. He briefly commanded First Army, then Fifth Army for a year, until June 1918, before being removed after the near debacle of the Third Battle of the Aisne. He was made a commander of the Legion of Honour on 30 September 1916. He was buried at Saint Roch Cemetery.

Their self-described mission is to harness the power of the theater to develop critical thinking and self-confidence, as well as to engage the imagination. Their plays and programs are designed to encourage and nurture young talent while broadening their awareness of culture, politics, aesthetics and the human condition. The role of parents and the community is a vital element of the SCTG philosophy and program. Described as \\"smart theater for children\\" by the Los Angeles Times,https://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/06/news/wk-cover6 the SCTG continues to present productions which push the boundaries of traditional children's theater in terms of complex ideas, themes, characters and staging. Nearly all plays are original productions co-written by the students through its Writing Mentorship Program. History The Silver Lake Children's Theatre Group http://silverlakechildrenstheatregroup.org/ is the descendant of a theater company based at the Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center (HLFJCC) in Silver Lake, California. The original company began in the mid-1990s and produced one spring play a year, usually a well-known Broadway musical. Productions included Guys And Dolls, Fiddler On The Roof and The Music Man. Loanne Hamrin and Trish Boyer helmed the group in the late 1990s, directly preceding the birth of the SCTG. Hamrin, a distinguished professional actress, brought her love of musicals and theatrical experience to her direction of the plays. Her good friend, Silver Lake architect Boyer, served as Assistant Director and together they choreographed and produced the plays. In the spring of 2000, their final production, Show Crazy was an original vehicle about \\"a-small-theater-company-who-could\\", which allowed Hamrin and Boyer to feature some of their favorite Broadway songs. Mark McCracken https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566850/ and Broderick Miller a local actor/comedian and a screenwriter respectively, co-authored the play. Hamrin announced her retirement from the theatre group following Show Crazy and with no one to direct the plays, the program was in danger of shutting down. Miller, a member of the HLFJCC board, volunteered to helm the theatre group for no fee because his six-year-old daughter, Izzy, had such a great experience performing in Show Crazy. The timing was serendipitous. Just a few weeks earlier, Miller had taken his young daughters to a performance of Babes In Toyland at the Alex Theatre http://www.alextheatre.org/ in Glendale, California and he was appalled at how pandering the show was to its young audience. The thought crossed his mind, \\"if I ever ran a children's theatre group, we would do smart shows.\\" So when the children's theatre opportunity presented itself a few weeks later, he felt the call. Although Miller was the godson of Academy Award-winning actor Broderick Crawford, he found a mentor and second father in British stage and film director Lindsay Anderson. As a result, Miller was schooled in Anderson's primary influences, Anton Chekhov, Bertolt Brecht, Jean Vigo, Humphrey Jennings and U.S. filmmaker John Ford. \\"Sentiment without sentimentality\\" was Anderson's creative mantra which Miller brought to the SCTG along with his own love for the works of John Irving, David Mamet, Tennessee Williams, Tom Stoppard and Edward Albee. Miller's plays were unusual for a children's theatre company because they featured sophisticated adult-like dialogue while tackling humanist and provocative themes. Miller wrote and directed the first play under his stewardship, a comedy-musical titled Stay Awake! in the spring of 2001. The whimsical story centered on Paula, a 12-year-old girl too busy watching TV and playing video games to read books. Events sweep her into a world where each land is represented by a different classic book. Tracy wanders through 14 book \\"lands\\" (Little Women, Moby Dick, Harry Potter, The Grapes of Wrath, Dracula, Eloise, etc.), encountering the colorful characters from each story. While searching for a way home, she also discovers the joys of literature. Each scene also featured a contemporary song which commented on the action. These ranged from Heidi singing \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" to Mary Poppins losing in love and singing \\"Nothing Compares 2U.\\" The show was popular and the success emboldened Miller and his creative partners Brian Davis, Sandi Silbert and Mark Feldman, to create the Silver Lake Children's Theatre Group as an official 501(c) 3 non-profit theatre company. Within two years the SCTG expanded to two productions a year (fall and spring) and continue to this day offering complex and challenging productions for kids. The SCTG believes that children respond to smart material and sees its productions as a means for its young actors and writers to explore the human condition while building community. =Theater Productions= Each year the SCTG presents spring and fall productions generated from original material created within the company. The shows widely vary in their genres and staging, ranging from dramas and comedies to musicals and cabaret. Themes are equally divergent and typically explore how a teenager relates to the world and how the world relates to them. \\"The quintessential SCTG play,\\" says Miller, \\"is a search for wisdom with bittersweet results.\\" In addition to exploring provocative themes, the SCTG pursues unique methods of staging. In their comedy Dumb White Crackers, for example, the cast was required to learn every role in the show. Just before the show went on, the audience randomly selected which actors would play which roles. Not only was this a powerful exercise in trust and commitment, but the experience tightly bonded the cast. Similar experimental shows include Havana (\\"living theatre\\" - where the audience follows the actors from room to room throughout the play.); Love and Hate (the play was first presented as a comedy; then at intermission the audience took seats on stage while the cast performed exactly the same play as a comedy in the seats); Teatro Della Morte http://www.teatrodellamorte.blogspot.com/,(a cabaret-like show performed in a circus tent inspired by the professional Seattle-based troupe Teatro Zinzanni ‚Äì whose performers actually conducted a workshop with SCTG students); and several others.

First introduced in 2014, a revised bill was introduced in February 2015 by Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri with nine bi-partisan cosponsors. 43 co-sponsors eventually signed on. The bill died in committee at the end of the session without reaching a floor vote in either house. Supporters of the bill believe that it will help to reform the sexual assault investigation process to protect victims and achieve prosecution of offenders by increasing transparency and cooperation between higher education institutions and local law enforcement. Estimates from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center places the number of men who survive sexual assault in college at about 1 in every 16 students, and for women, every 1 in 5.https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media- packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf Major provisions =Clery Act Amendments= CASA includes several amendments to the Clery Act, a law requiring colleges and universities to publish statistics relating to crime on their campuses. Under CASA, schools would be required to publish these statistics on their web sites. Additional statistics would be required, including data on the verdicts in sexual assault cases, as well as data on dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. It requires victim advocacy organizations to be included in the development of schools' sexual assault policies. The Department of Education would produce a confidential survey on students' experiences with sexual violence and sexual harassment, which is to be administered at all higher education institutions in the country. An annual report containing the results of the survey would be published on the Department of Education website. Schools that failed to meet the requirements of the Clery Act would be subject to fines of up to $150,000, adjusted for inflation. =Confidential advisors= CASA would require all schools (colleges and universities) to appoint confidential advisors to assist students claiming to be victims of sexual assault. These advisors would be trained to conduct forensic interviews with students for the purpose of gathering facts on the alleged crimes. They would also advise students on their options for next steps, and serve as liaisons with local law enforcement in cases where a student chooses to report the case to the police. They could arrange accommodations for the students, such as changes to living arrangements or class schedules. Confidential advisors would not be obligated to report to other personnel at the school or to law enforcement. =Other provisions= CASA would require schools to establish memoranda of understanding with local law enforcement regarding protocols for handling cases of sexual violence. Schools would forward reports of sexual violence to the police only when the alleged victims wished for them to do so. The bill would allow schools to institute systems for anonymous reporting of sexual assault. Schools would be required to publish information on their websites about community resources for assault victims. Students reporting sexual assault would be given amnesty for other misconduct, such as underage drinking, that may become known as a result of the report. Schools would be required to establish uniform disciplinary procedures for sexual violence with no special treatment for particular classes of students, such as athletes or students majoring in particular fields. Title IX complaints for sexual harassment or assault would be published on the Department of Education web site. The Department of Education and the Department of Justice would be given the authority to issue subpoenas for the purpose of enforcing Title IX. Schools found to be in violation of CASA would be subject to fines of up to 1% of their annual operating budgets. History The issue of widespread sexual assault at college campuses across the country, and the failure of college administrations to protect victims, as well as to provide accurate data on this issue, has been addressed by the media since the late 20th century. In 2013 Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino, who had themselves been assault victims at the University of North Carolina, filed a complaint against UNC with the US Department of Education under Title IX provisions. They said that the university's failure to respond adequately to them as alleged victims had violated the law by enabling a hostile academic environment. As the young women worked to conduct research into the issue and support other assault victims, they developed a model for filing Title IX complaints that they shared with student victims at other universities across the country. , a total of 169 colleges or universities were under investigation by DOE due to such Title IX claims. These issues were covered in The Hunting Ground (2015), a documentary about sexual assault on college campuses and the treatment of alleged victims. The victims have continued to organize to educate the public and politicians as to the scale of the problems and to seek legislative and other improvements. The bill was introduced in Congress in February 2015 by Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, along with nine bipartisan cosponsors. Hearings were held in July. In January 2016, co-sponsor Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said she and McCaskill would work to attach the bill to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Reception The bill has been supported by a variety of organizations seeking to aid sexual assault victims. The issue at college campuses has been reported by national media since the late 20th century. Some groups have had mixed reactions to the bill. While praising it for mandating that college administrations involved local police when accusations are made (who would have less reason to suppress reporting and investigation of incidents), the Independent Women's Forum was critical of issues related to weakness in protecting due process for alleged perpetrators. Criticism The bill has been criticized by a variety of conservative sources. An editorial in the Las Vegas Review-Journal said that the bill failed to protect the due process rights of accused students and gave schools the incentive to expel accused students, even in cases where there is little or no evidence to substantiate the allegation, in order to avoid the risk of being fined. Hans Bader of the Competitive Enterprise Institute has said that the bill creates a conflict of interest by allowing fines to be levied by the same agency that would receive the money, creating an incentive for that agency, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, to accuse schools of violating CASA in order to profit from the resulting fines.

Its area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. North Somerset borders the local government areas of Bristol, Bath and North East Somerset, Mendip and Sedgemoor. North Somerset contains the parliamentary constituencies of Weston-super-Mare and North Somerset. A scheduled monument is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or \\"schedule\\") by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites. The legislation governing this is the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The term \\"monument\\" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity. They range from prehistoric standing stones and burial sites, through Roman remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the Cold War. There are 68 scheduled monuments in North Somerset. The oldest site Aveline's Hole, a cave in which bones from the Mesolithic have been identified making it the earliest scientifically dated cemetery in Britain. There are also multiple Neolithic tumuli. There are also several Iron Age hillforts, such as the one at Worlebury Camp. Dolebury Warren, another Iron Age hillfort, was reused as a medieval rabbit warren. The Romano-British period is represented with sites including villas. Sites from the Middle Ages include motte-and-bailey castles, such as Locking Castle, and church crosses. There are also several deserted medieval settlements. Woodspring Priory is a former Augustinian priory founded in the early 13th century. More recent sites date from the Industrial Revolution and include the Elms colliery and glassworks in Nailsea. The most recent monuments are two Palmerstonian gun batteries, built in the 1860s, on the island of Steep Holm.

They were almost identical to the Soviet variants with only minor differences in weight, length and sights design. The Nagant M1895 was mass-produced in Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union as a standard side- arm of officers and NCOs. After Poland regained independence in 1918, the Polish Army inherited some captured revolvers and pressed them into Polish service as the rewolwer wz. 1895 Nagant - Mark 1895 revolver. After the Polish-Bolshevik War the army decided to focus on the 7.92 mm calibre and the Nagant revolvers were withdrawn from active service. The Nagant revolver remained in service with the State Police, along with a large variety of sidearms of all types and calibres. The Police used also Mod√®le 1892 revolver and Rast & Gasser M1898 revolvers as well as a number of pistol designs: Mauser M1910, Mauser C96, Beretta M1923, various Browning pistols (wz. 1900, wz. 1910 and wz. 1922), Ortgies Semi-Automatic Pistol, Cebra wz. 1916, Frommer wz. 1910, Steyr M1912, Roth‚ÄìSteyr M1907 and Parabellum P08. In September 1927 the Police Headquarters started a poll among police officers to determine which firearm should be used as a standard sidearm throughout the police force, and the Nagant system was chosen for its durability and simplicity. As the number of Russian ex-military weapons was limited, in 1930 the state-owned Fabryka Broni works in Radom developed a slightly modified variant, designated \\"Nagant wz. 30\\". Comparing to the Russian or Belgian models, the new Polish model was slightly lighter, and the barrel was slightly shorter. In 1932 the design was further modified by the relocation of the sight (and giving a new \\"Rewolwer wz. 32\\" designation). Between 1929 and 1935 the Radom works produced 7,166 revolvers of both variants. Both the original M1895 Nagant and its later clones remained the standard police weapon used by the State Police and Postal Guards throughout the 1930s, though with time they were often replaced with more modern designs like the Beretta M1934 and Walther PPK. They were also widely used by mobilised policemen during the German and Soviet invasion of Poland of 1939.

In 1914, he was a member of the Ireland team that won the British Home Championship - the only edition at which (united) Ireland became the unshared winners of the Championship. Irish International Fred McKee (second player on left of back-row) with the Ireland team vs. Wales during the 1914 British Home Championship Fred McKee made his debut for Ireland at the 1906 British Home Championship on 17 March, in a 0‚Äì1 defeat to Scotland at Dalymount Park. His teammates that day included Robert Milne and Jack Kirwan. In spite of holding Wales at a 4‚Äì4 draw in his second international (the last tournament match), Ireland ended last. Much more memorable was his participation at the 1914 British Home Championship. He played all three matches, and with a clean sheet against England and only two goals conceded in his other appearances, McKee contributed to the unique victory at the British Home Championship. While the Irish team in 1903 still shared their victory with England and Scotland, this was the only occasion at which the team of (united) Ireland became sole winners.

Family Meyn's father was a pharmacist and an operations manager at the Carlsberg Brewery. His mother was an officer's daughter from the German family von Kohl. Meyn had a son, Hans Ole Nissen Weller, by Ebba Lili (Mickey) Weller but was never married and never officially listed as Ole's father. He did, however, have contact with his son throughout his life. Literary career Meyn debuted in 1910, the same year he completed his schooling, with a short story in the newspaper Hjemmet. In 1911 he started a degree in natural sciences, never completed,'H√∂fundur hinna √æekktu b√≥ka um Basil fursta kominn √≠ leitirnar Dani sem samdi', Morgunbla√∞i√∞, March 2nd 1994, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/127485/. and in the same year he published his first novel, co-written with August Klingsey, Med luftskib til Mars. His own first solo-written novel was Rejsen til Venus, published in 1915. Before becoming a professional fiction-writer, Meyn worked for a while for the East Asiatic Company, and from 1917-19 for Politikens lejebibliotek. As a journalist he wrote hundreds of articles for various journals, mainly on popular science topics. Meyn had started as a translator for Litteraturselskabet in the first decade of the 1900s, but had not worked there long before he discovered that it was quicker to write stories himself than to translate them. It was, however, his route into the pulp fiction industry that flourished in the early twentieth century, and he contributed to many of the Litteraturselsskabet's series that otherwise mostly consisted of translations. Before his death in the mid-1950s, Meyn wrote more than 300 crime stories, counting the many pulp-fiction stories he published. In addition Meyn wrote under more than 30 different pseudonyms, among them George Griffith, Harold Chester, Rex Nelson, David Gartner, Gustav Hardner and, the best known and most used, Charles Bristol.'H√∂fundur hinna √æekktu b√≥ka um Basil fursta kominn √≠ leitirnar Dani sem samdi', Morgunbla√∞i√∞, March 2nd 1994, http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/127485/. This enabled him to publish his stories at the same furious rate as he produced them. He also wrote anonymously. Sometimes, needing money, Meyn sold the ideas for stories to others for them to finish writing. His output included children's books, science fiction, animal books and nonfiction. Meyn wrote for money, but was not without literary ambitions---but never succeeded in gaining acceptance as a literary author, since in Denmark popular literature was looked down on, at least until the early 1980s. Meyn had a more prominent position in Sweden than in Denmark. Lord Kingsley and Fyrst Basil were among his first contributions to the crime genre. Later he contributed stories to some of the main Danish pulp fiction magazine, inter alia under the pseudonym Peter Anker: Betjent Ole Ny, Kurt Danner and Styrmand Rasmussen. Most central is his own series about 'Mystiske Mr. X.', which came out in several parts. Meyn also wrote longer novels, published under various pseudonyms (including Gustav Hardner, Harold Chester, Richard √òrn). Although Meyn often used motifs associated with adventure stories at a time when the crime novel was generally leaning towards logic and science, or the morality of the hardboiled private detective, his novels often had more substance than the more stereotyped detective stories in magazines. The part of Meyn's writing on which he himself put the highest value was his books about animals---fiction, but based on thorough knowledge of animal behavior---which were published throughout Scandinavia. Some were translated into German and published in Germany or Austria. Most Danish and Swedish children in first half of the 1900s probably read something by Niels Meyn. His main pseudonyms as a children's author were Anne Lykke and Christel Marner, when he wrote for girls, and Charles Bristol, Erik Juul or Kai Lynres when he wrote for boys. He mostly wrote books for boys and many of them contain a mixture of adventure and fantastic. In many ways Meyn had a more prominent position in Sweden, where John Lor√©n published many of his stories, including most of the series with Jack Lester in Alibimagasinet. Meyn's death in 1957 was mentioned in several Swedish newspapers, but hardly at all in Denmark. John Lor√©n's obituary called Meyn \\"a brilliant writer\\", adding that \\"through his Jack Lester novels, which we had the privilege to publish, he has been very much appreciated by our readers.\\" Nazi sympathies Meyn joined the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark in 1940 and became an employee of their daily F√¶drelandet. His literary contribution to the National Socialist Danish literature is however rather modest, although in the DNSAP's Maanedsbreve one can find individual stories that very clearly reflect a National Socialist influence. For example, the short story 'Elfenbensviften' both structurally and thematically is one of the purest examples of the trends in the Danish National Socialist literature. Meyn came into conflict with the party towards the end of the war and withdrew. Nothing indicates that he was an active Nazi. Although his stories are often based on literary stereotypes and populist prejudices, they are no different from what other writers wrote during the interwar period. Meyn's Nazi associations meant that he never regained quite the position he had enjoyed before the War, although a few years after the war he did become a member of the Dansk Forfatterforening.

Previously, he spent 30 years working for HSBC, where his roles included country or regional heads in India, Thailand, the Middle East and North America. He has been described as a \\"clean-up expert\\", having helped HSBC in North America to recover from sub-prime lending losses and from money- laundering issues. Currently he is Chair of Monument Bank, a Non Executive Director of Non Standard Finance plc and Chairman of the Council at Glenalmond College.  Personal background  Booker was born in the Middle East, where his father was working for the British Colonial Service. He grew up in Scotland and went to Glenalmond College in Perthshire. He then studied history and law at Gonville and Caius College at the University of Cambridge.  Professional career  Booker joined HSBC in September 1979 after university and worked for the bank continuously until retiring in 2011. He was promoted through the ranks, becoming chief executive of HSBC India where he grew the Bank's market share. He moved to work in the United States in 2002 before heading up the Dubai-based HSBC Bank Middle East in 2006 where he oversaw record profits. In 2007, he moved to HSBC Finance Corporation, HSBC's US sub- prime lending business, which had been making heavy losses, initially as chief operating officer and then chief executive. After successfully restructuring the sub-prime business he became chief executive of HSBC North America in August 2010 and joined HSBC's Group Management Board. He oversaw the reduction in the bank's US activities including the sale of its 195 Upstate New York branch network to First Niagara Financial Group in August 2011 for about $1 billion. He left HSBC in October 2011 as part of a management reshuffle, when the post was merged with the CEO of HSBC USA. He earned a reported ¬£2m in his final year. Coop Bank head office, with a statue of co-op movement founder Robert Owen In 2013, he came out of retirement when he was appointed chief executive of the Co-operative Bank, Britain's largest mutual bank and ninth largest retail bank. The Co-op had just reported a ¬£600m loss and a six notch downgrade by Moodys. When he was appointed, analysts estimated the bank was facing a capital shortfall of over ¬£1bn. Booker was also appointed the deputy chief executive of The Co-operative Group but stood down three months later when the bank's shareholding was restructured and the Co-op Group lost its majority stake. Six months after he took over, Booker oversaw a ¬£1.5bn recapitalisation of the bank through a bail-in of its subordinated debt and a capital injection from hedge funds which had bought up much of the debt. As a result, the Co-op Group lost majority control of the bank. To safeguard the bank's ethical reputation among customers it introduced an \\"ethical code of conduct\\" In March 2014, he oversaw an additional ¬£400m rights issue to cover additional losses as the bank's capital ratio was close to the regulatory minimum.  Political views  In advance of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, Booker signed a letter from the \\"Better Together\\" campaign urging people to vote against independence from the United Kingdom.  Arts patronage  Booker lists his interests as opera, art and golf. He is a friend of the Hampstead Theatre and the Royal Opera House. He also has a keen interest in cricket having been a member of the MCC for over 40 years.

They recorded 12 songs in Dallas in 1937 for Decca Records including \\"Allons Kooche Kooche\\", a tune based on the Jolly Boys of Lafayette's \\"Abbeville\\". The melody would have a huge impact on his later recording of \\"Grand Texas\\". While in the band, he would meet Horace Andrus \\"Uncle Ambrose\\" Thibodeaux, Leroy \\"Happy Fats\\" Leblanc, Oran Guidry and Harry Choates. Happy Fats noticed he always wore a diamond-shaped gem on his tie and finger. Using the Cajun French word for \\"diamond\\" (\\"karo\\", pronounced \\"cairo\\"), his nickname became \\"Papa Cairo\\". He played the guitar across his knees with a metal finger attachment. By December 1937, Lamperez would be back in Dallas, this time with Leo Soileau's Rhythm Boys and in 1938, he recorded again with Joe in New Orleans. By 1941, Lamperez learned to play a Hawaiian- style lap steel guitar and traveled with Happy Fats to Dallas to record for Bluebird Records. During the session, he wrote the song \\"In The House at the End of the Road\\". However, soon after, he was drafted into the US Army, became a Sergeant, and fought in Europe during World War II. He was captured by the Germans and held prisoner of war in a stalag. He escaped four times but never got very far, however, he made a fiddle while captured and the guards enjoyed his music. After the war, he began playing music again touring with Ernest Tubb. In 1946, he played with Harry Choates and his Melody Boys. He would also fill in from time to time with bands such as the Louisiana Hillbillies In 1948, he travelled with Chuck Guillory & his Rhythm Boys to New Orleans, wrote, and recorded the tune \\"Grand Texas\\" for Modern Records. In 1949, he would form his own band called \\"Papa Cairo And His Boys\\", including fiddler Rufus Thibodeaux. That year, he would record a second version of his hit song in English called \\"Big Texas #2\\" and re-record \\"Kooche Kooche\\" in French. In 1951, he would record his own version of the song entitled \\"Big Texas\\" for J. D. \\"Jay\\" Miller's Feature label. Jealous of Hank Williams' success with \\"Jamabalaya\\" in 1952, he claimed the song was stolen from his \\"Grand Texas\\" melody and refused to record again. He continued to play around Galveston, Texas. Another one of his songs, \\"Just Wait And See\\", would be the basis for Marty Robbins' song \\"Pretty Words\\". At some point, he also recorded \\"Why Not\\" and \\"Smiling Pines\\" for B & C Records.

Founded in 1979, The Whale Museum is dedicated to the interpretation of whales in the wild. Its mission is to promote the stewardship of wild whales in the Salish Sea ecosystem through education and research programs. Exhibits The Whale Museum's exhibits include life-sized whale models, articulated skeletons, information on the family groups (pods) of the endangered Southern Resident killer whales, and current scientific research on local species. Other exhibits feature pinnipeds, porpoises and other marine mammals of the Salish Sea; wildlife videos, and Northwest Native American culture and artifacts relating to marine mammals. The whale museum is actively involved in stewardship efforts, and was involved in the orca Springer's story, as well as the investigation of Sooke (L-112), a 3-year old orca who washed up near Long Beach, Washington in 2012. Education and Research The Whale Museum conducts several research and education programs: * The Whale Sighting Network has recorded whale sightings in the Salish Sea and kept a database of reported sightings since 1976. Sightings are submitted by members of the public via the toll-free Whale Hotline. * The Marine Mammal Stranding Network was started in 1981, and is authorized by NOAA to investigate reports of stranded marine mammals, alive or dead. Some live animals are taken for rehabilitation at Wolf Hollow Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, and some dead specimens are studied at University of Washington Friday Harbor Labs by researchers to help gather information about the health of local populations and the ecosystem. * The Whale Museum is also a partner in the Salish Sea Hydrophone Network, SeaSound. The hydrophones detect whale vocalizations, vessel noise and other underwater sounds in the area. The Whale Museum mainly uses the hydrophone off Lime Kiln Point State Park, where they have maintained a research laboratory since 1983. * The Orca Adoption Program helps members of the public learn more about the Southern Resident Killer Whales, including their individual markings, genealogy, and facts about their lives. * Education programs are conducted for both children and adults. Programs include Southern Resident Killer Whales, Whale Acoustics Lab, The Gray Whale Project, Cetaceans of the Salish Sea, The Orca ID Lab and Puget Pinnipeds. * The Marine Naturalist Training Program is held twice a year, and is an in-depth review of the natural history of the Salish Sea. * Soundwatch is a boater education program that has been conducted since 1993 to teach boaters and kayakers about federal and state laws regarding vessel operations near whales, and to promote the Be Whale Wise boating guidelines. The Whale Museum is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization governed by a board of directors.

He was an amateur, self-taught apart from evening classes at Edinburgh College of Art, but during the period 1939-1952 he produced Surrealist works that are said to be unprecedented in Scottish art of the period. His work attracted little attention from the art world at the time, but it started receiving recognition following its \\"discovery\\" in 2013 by curators of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Early career Snuff Mill, Juniper Green, 1936 Edwin George Lucas was born in Leith in 1911, and grew up in Juniper Green, a village on the outskirts of Edinburgh. He was educated at Juniper Green Primary School and then George Heriot's School. He was interested in a career in art, but his family discouraged this because his uncle, E G Handel Lucas, who is now a well regarded Victorian artist, struggled to make a decent living and lived the latter part of his life in poverty. Instead, Edwin joined the Civil Service in Edinburgh and studied at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with a Bachelor of Law in 1934. Throughout the 1930s he painted conventional, well executed landscapes.Gleadell, Colin. \\"Surrealist discovered by his son\\", The Daily Telegraph, 2014-03-18, p.26. These were mainly watercolours, with a strong emphasis on the countryside close to the family home in Juniper Green. They were often accepted for exhibition by the Society of Scottish ArtistsSociety of Scottish Artists, Annual Exhibition Catalogues, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1945. (SSA) and the Royal Scottish AcademyRoyal Scottish Academy, Catalogue 1941. One of these paintings attracted attention from the French journal La Revue Moderne des Arts et de la Vie.La Revue Moderne des Arts et de la Vie, 38e Ann√©e No 9, 15 Mai 1938, p.25. Its review called him \\"artiste extr√™mement cultiv√©...un artiste plein de claire simplicit√©\\" (a highly educated artist...a painter of great clarity and simplicity). It also commented on his \\"libert√© d'esprit et sa souplesse de style\\" (freedom of spirit and stylistic versatility), attributes that were to become defining characteristics of his later work. Diagnosis 1, 1939, Lucas's first Surrealist work Influence of Surrealism Surrealist works were shown at a number of exhibitions in Edinburgh during the late 1930s. One example was the SSA exhibition in December 1937, which included the first works by Salvador Dal√≠, Max Ernst and Giorgio de Chirico to be shown in Edinburgh.Society of Scottish Artists, An Exhibition of interest and Merit, The Scotsman, 1937-12-11, p.15. Lucas would certainly have attended because one of his watercolours was also included. Another example was an exhibition at Gladstone's Land Galleries in June 1939 by a group of graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, including William Gear.Abstract Art, Edinburgh Group Exhibition, The Scotsman, 1939-06-14, p.14. Gear and Lucas were both close friends of Wilhelmina Barns- Graham, from whom Lucas started renting a studio in 1939. Almost immediately he started painting Surrealist works, the first of which is dated August 1939, probably influenced by shows such as those mentioned above. He would later refer to this period as a brief \\"flirtation with Surrealism\\" but it had a great impact on his future career as he developed his own highly individual take on Surrealism and produced works that are said to be unprecedented in Scottish art of the period. Post-War work Walking the Dog, 1949 Lucas was a committed pacifist and as a conscientious objector he worked in hospitals at Killearn and Raigmore during the war. He returned to Edinburgh in 1944 and the immediate post-war years were a very creative and prolific time for him. He returned to work as a Civil Servant, in the Estate Duty Office, but also attended evening classes at Edinburgh College of Art and saw himself as a serious painter who had a day job. Patrick Elliott, senior curator at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, described the purchase in 2013 of some of Lucas's works of this period as follows: > They are impressive because they are inexplicable, I've not seen anything > quite like them before in my 20 years at the Gallery of Modern Art: there's > a bit of Picasso, but overall he's got nothing in common with anyone > painting in Scotland at the time - or in fact anywhere else. However, at the time they were painted Lucas's innovative works had little appeal to the Edinburgh art world. Unlike his landscapes, they were generally not accepted for exhibition. Lucas proceeded to hold solo shows at the New Gallery in Shandwick Place, Edinburgh, in 1950 and 1951 but these received little attention from the art establishment. Later life Lucas married Marjorie Eileen McCulloch in 1952. They bought a house in Ann Street in Stockbridge, Edinburgh and had two sons, born in 1953 and 1957. He stopped painting after his marriage, except for a period in the 1980s. His painting was ended by deteriorating eyesight and he died of leukaemia in 1990. Posthumous recognition In 2009 his family started renting gallery space in Edinburgh to hold occasional exhibitions, but his work remained almost completely unknown until a letter to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art led to five paintings being acquired. They were hung beside works by Picasso and Mir√≥ in the \\"New Acquisitions\\" exhibition from October 2013 to May 2014.New Acquisitions Exhibition, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, October 2013 to May 2014. A number of newspapers published stories about the discovery of this \\"lost Surrealist\\", including The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Herald (Glasgow) and the Edinburgh Evening News. Since then the City Art Centre in Edinburgh has shown some of Lucas's work in two mixed exhibitions: \\"A Capital View - the Art of Edinburgh\\"A Capital View - the Art of Edinburgh, City Art Centre, Edinburgh, May to July 2014 and \\"Jagged Generation: William Gear‚Äôs Contemporaries and Influences\\".Jagged Generation: William Gear‚Äôs Contemporaries and Influences, City Art Centre, Edinburgh, October 2015 to February 2016 Also, two exhibitions devoted to his work were held at the Fine Art Society, and his work was represented in \\"A New Era: Scottish Modern Art 1900-1950\\" at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Increased recognition continues at the current time with a high-profile solo exhibition \\"Edwin G. Lucas: An Individual Eye\\" at the City Art Centre in Edinburgh from August 2018 to February 2019.

The attack occurred during Jumu'ah (Friday prayers) and at the time of the attack, there were about 150 worshippers at the mosque.Shi'ite militia kill dozens of Iraqi Sunnis in mosque shooting, reuters.com. The attack took place during the Northern Iraq offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) against the Iraqi government. The attack was blamed on Shiite militias fighting alongside the Iraqi army against ISIL. In 2020 an Iraqi court found the militants to be not guilty. The attack An Iraqi army major said \\"the attackers arrived in two pick-up trucks after two bombs had gone off at the house of a local Shi'ite militia leader, Abdul Samad Salar Al-Zarkoshi, killing three of his men.\\" Although an initial report quoted security forces blaming ISIS, local police were later reported as saying that a preliminary investigation had confirmed that al-Zarkoshi's militia was responsible for the attack.

When Iraqi security forces arrived at the scene, supported by Shi'ite militias, they triggered bombs that had been planted by the attackers to cover their escape. Four militiamen were killed by the blasts and 13 wounded. Aftermath As a result of the attack, Sunni politicians Saleh al- Mutlaq and Salim al-Jabouri suspended their participation in talks with the main Shi'ite political alliance to form a new government. Mutlaq said the Shiite militias were \\"even worse than the terrorists [i.e. ISIS] sometimes,\\" because the militias \\"are protected by the government.\\" Another Sunni lawmaker, Talal al-Zuba'ay, said \\"Iraqi security forces did nothing to stop the massacre and had barred rescue teams attempting to reach the mosque;\\" adding, \\"These Shiite militias are massing across the country and killing people based on their identity. What's happening will create a volcano that once it explodes, no one will be able to stop.\\" The attack was widely condemned across Iraq and internationally. The new designated Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, demanded the police to investigate the crime scene as fast as they can and let nothing like this ever happen again. His coalition, the National Iraqi Alliance, \\"condemned the massacre regardless of who is behind it\\" but coalition members criticised the suspension of talks, saying this \\"is not the answer but rather serves the perpetrators of the massacre\\". The newly appointed Sunni Arab speaker of the parliament, Salim al- Jabouri, called for political unity and emphasised that \\"all the political entities condemned the crime\\". Other Shi'ite militias condemned the attack, with the Asaib Ahl al-Haq describing it as \\"barbaric\\" and \\"a crime that we cannot turn a blind eye to.\\" UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack \\"in the strongest terms\\", saying attacks on places of worship are \\"completely unacceptable\\" and prohibited under international law. The United States condemned the \\"absurd and repulsive attack\\" saying all Iraqi leaders should defend Iraq. The European Union described it as a \\"heinous crime\\" but said it should not stand in the way of government formation. On 25 August, Sunni militants claimed to have killed four al-Zarkoshi tribesmen who they claimed had taken part in the massacre, ambushing them in Hamrin. On 26 August, the governor of Diyala Governorate, Amir al-Mujammai, announced that the Iraqi police arrested three brothers from the al-Zarkoshi tribe, suspected of the massacre. Munir Mizhar Sultan, Salim Mizhar Sultan and Saddam Mizhar Sultan were arrested in Hamrin, 55 km north-east of Baqubah. These three are brothers of Abdul Samad Salar Al-Zarkoshi, the militia leader, who, it was reported, may have escaped to Iran. On 2 November, the Human Rights Watch stated that the Shi'ite militia of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq committed the massacre, killing 73 worshipers. Some witnesses stated to the HRW that when they arrived to the mosque, they saw 8 men, some of them were wearing plain clothes and others wore police uniforms. They also stated that they saw an armed man wearing a green head band with \\"Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq\\" written on it. At first, the witnesses saw around 10 killed and 30 injured in the mosque. They dragged the injured people to the garden of the mosque, only to see 20-30 armed men marching up to the mosque while firing their guns, finishing off the rest of the injured people. The witnesses told the HRW that all of the 73 killed worshipers were from the same tribe, Bani Wais tribe. They also told them that the guns that were used in the massacre were PK machine guns and AK-47s.

Kitchen, a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage and binding precedent on Colorado courts. State Attorney General John Suthers filed a motion in the Colorado District Courts in an attempt to stop the Hall's actions. As the attorney general's motion was being heard, the Seventeenth Judicial District struck down Colorado's ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional in Brinkman v. Long. =District court ruling= On July 10, 2014, a day after the ruling in Brinkman, the Twentieth Judicial District denied the state attorney general's motion in Colorado ex rel. Suthers. District Court Judge Andrew Hartman found that while the Boulder clerk violated the law‚Äî‚Äîhe refused to impose a restraining order or injunction upon her, as the state did not meet its high burden for a stay. Viewing the case as a procedural one, Judge Hartman applied the test set out in Rathke v. MacFarlane, 648 P.2d 648 (Colo. 1982). The judge found for the state on two of the Rathke factors: probability of success in finding that the clerk was violating current law, and certainty that an injunction would preserve the status quo. But Judge Hartman found that the other four factors outweighed this, in the clerk's favor: that no irreparable injury would occur by issuing licenses; that if marriage licenses were issued in error, the state had an adequate remedy‚Äîprecedent existed in Lockyer v. San Francisco, 33 Cal. 4th 1055 (Cal. 2004)‚Äîof invalidating the licenses; that stopping the clerk would not serve the public interest as the ban had been found unconstitutional; and that a balance of the equities did not favor stopping the clerk, either, as \\"the law is hanging on by a thread.\\" =Denial of reconsideration and stay pending appeal= In light of the ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court in Brinkman v. Long staying license issuance in Adams and Denver counties, the defendants also asked Judge Hartman to reconsider his ruling and stay it. Judge Hartman denied the state's request on July 23, 2014; he dismissed the assertion that the state supreme court's stay of Brinkman is binding on Boulder County as \\"an improper circular argument\\". Judge Hartman noted that the high court relied on Judge Crabtree's preexisting stay of the Denver and Adams county cases when ruling; however, no such stay exists in the Boulder case. Judge Hartman then finds that issuing a stay is now even more difficult since the last time he performed Rathke analysis, as \\"chances of prevailing are rapidly fading since two subsequent rulings ... have found same sex marriage bans unconstitutional.\\" The rulings he notes are Bishop v. Smith and Huntsman v. Heavilin. Court of Appeals proceedings On July 21, 2014, state Attorney General Suthers appealed Judge Hartman's ruling allowing the Boulder County clerk to issue marriage licenses despite the ban. A three-judge panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals denied the attorney general's motion to stay the Boulder County clerk's issuance of same-sex marriage licenses on appeal, Colorado v. Hall, No. 2014-CA-1368 (Colo. App. July 24, 2014). In a short opinion, the court affirmed Judge Hartman and said that the state did not meet the factors in Romero v. City of Fountain, 307 P.3d 122 (Colo. App. 2011). Colorado Supreme Court proceedings On July 29, 2014, the Colorado Supreme Court, in an en banc order, sua sponte transferred Colorado v. Hall before it pursuant to Colorado Appellate Rule (C.A.R.) 50(b) and ordered the record filed from the Court of Appeals on or before October 20, 2014, Hall, No. 2014-SC-582. Furthermore, the court stayed Clerk Hall from issuing any more same-sex marriage licenses, pursuant to C.A.R. 8, and without other comment.

A group of his hostages nicknamed him \\"John\\" since he was part of a four-person terrorist cell with English accents whom they called \\"The Beatles\\"; the press later began calling him \\"Jihadi John\\". On 12 November 2015, U.S. officials reported that Emwazi had been hit by a drone strike in Raqqa, Syria. His death was confirmed by ISIL in January 2016. Early life Emwazi was born Muhammad Jassim Abdulkarim Olayan al-Dhafiri on 17 August 1988 in Kuwait as the eldest of five children to Jassem and Ghaneyah Emwazi. The family, who were Bidoon of Iraqi origin, lived in the town of Al Jahra, before moving to the United Kingdom in 1994 when he was six. They settled in inner west London, moving between several properties in Maida Vale, later living in St John's Wood and finally in Queen's Park. Emwazi attended St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school, and later Quintin Kynaston School. In 2006, he went to the University of Westminster, studying Information Systems with Business Management. He secured a lower second-class BSc (Hons) on graduation three years later. At age 21, he worked as a salesman at an IT company in Kuwait and was considered by his boss as the best employee the company ever had. Nicknames Emwazi was given the nickname \\"John\\" by a group of his hostages. The hostages said that he guarded Western hostages while handling communications with their families, and was part of a terrorist cell they called 'The Beatles' because the cell members all had British accents. The nickname refers to John Lennon of the Beatles; the three other group members were each given the first name of one of the other Beatles. The nicknames \\"Jihadi John\\", \\"Jailer John\\" and \\"John the Beatle\\" were created by journalists. \\"Jihadi John\\" was used on 20 August 2014 in the conservative British magazine The Spectator in a piece titled \\"Jihadi John ‚Äì a very British export\\" by Douglas Murray, a frequent critic of Islam, and soon after joined by the BBC and other sources. Victims The following are reported victims of Jihadi John: =James Foley= In a video uploaded to YouTube on 19 August 2014, Foley read a prepared statement criticising the United States, the recent airstrikes in Iraq, and his brother who serves in the United States Air Force. Emwazi, wearing a mask, also read a prepared statement in which he criticised America and President Barack Obama and made demands to cease the 2014 American-led intervention in Iraq. The masked man then beheaded Foley off-camera, after which he threatened to behead Steven Sotloff if his demands were not met. The FBI and United States National Security Council confirmed that the video, which included footage of Foley's beheaded corpse, was genuine. =Steven Sotloff= On 2 September 2014, a video was released reportedly showing American journalist Steven Sotloff's beheading by Emwazi. The White House confirmed the video's authenticity. =David Haines= On 13 September 2014, a video, directed at British Prime Minister David Cameron, was released, showing British hostage aid worker David Haines being beheaded by Emwazi. =Alan Henning= On 3 October 2014, a video released by ISIS showed Emwazi beheading British aid worker Alan Henning. Henning, a taxi driver from Salford, Greater Manchester, had volunteered to deliver aid to Syria. He was kidnapped in Al-Dana, an area held by ISIS, on 27 December 2013. =Peter Kassig= On 16 November 2014 a video was posted by ISIS of Emwazi standing over a severed head, which the White House confirmed was that of Peter Kassig. Kassig's actual beheading was not shown, and unlike earlier hostage beheading videos he did not make a statement. There has been speculation that, faced with the prospect of being beheaded, he may have resisted and been shot dead: a senior surgeon performed a detailed examination of the video and saw possible evidence of a gunshot wound. =Syrian soldiers= The video that ended with a shot of Kassig's severed head showed the beheadings of a number of Syrian soldiers in gruesome detail, by a group led by a masked Emwazi. It was said by the BBC that, unlike previous videos, this one shows the faces of many of the militants, indicates the location as being Dabiq in Aleppo Province, and that this video \\"revels in gore.\\" Unlike previous videos that cut away without showing the killing, Emwazi is shown beheading a victim. Initially, the number killed was variously reported as at least 12, or 18. Subsequent analysis by the Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium and UK- based counter-extremism think tank Quilliam concluded that 22 captive soldiers were executed. =Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto= Haruna Yukawa, age 42, was captured sometime before August 2014. Kenji Goto, age 47, was captured sometime in October 2014 while trying to rescue Yukawa. In January 2015, a threat was issued that they would be killed unless the Japanese government paid a ransom of $200 million. Yukawa was beheaded on 24 January, and Goto on 31 January 2015. Analysis of videos Officially the FBI and United States National Security Council confirmed that the James Foley video, which ended with footage of a beheaded corpse, was genuine. David Cameron and the British Foreign Office also confirmed the authenticity of the video showing the death of David Haines. The videos were produced and distributed by Al Hayat Media Center, a media outlet of ISIS that was under the authority of the ISIS's official propaganda arm, the Al-Itisam Establishment for Media Production, that targeted specifically Western and non-Arabic speaking audiences. An unnamed forensics expert commissioned by The Times to look at the James Foley video said, \\"I think it has been staged. My feeling is that the murder may have happened after the camera was stopped.\\" The Times concluded that \\"No one is questioning that the photojournalist James Foley was beheaded, but camera trickery and slick post-production techniques appear to have been used.\\" Two unnamed video specialists in the International Business Times of Australia claimed that portions of the video appeared to be staged and edited. Dr James Alvarez, a British-American hostage negotiator, also claimed the James Foley video was \\"expertly staged\\", with the use of two separate cameras and a clip- on microphone attached to Foley's orange jumpsuit. Jeff Smith, Associate Director of the CU Denver National Center for Media Forensics, said \\"What's most interesting is that the actual beheading that takes place in the videos, both of them are staged.\\" British analyst Eliot Higgins (Brown Moses) published photographic and video forensic evidence suggesting that the James Foley video was taken at a spot in the hills south of the Syrian city of Raqqa. Identification and manhunt =Search for identity and early speculation= \\"Jihadi John\\" became the subject of a manhunt by the FBI, MI5, and Scotland Yard. In his videos, \\"Jihadi John\\" concealed his identity by covering himself from head to toe in black, except for tan desert boots, with a mask that left only his eyes visible. Despite this, several facts about \\"Jihadi John\\" could be ascertained from both videos. He spoke with an apparent London or southern England accent and appeared to have a skin tone consistent with North African or South Asian descent. In both videos, he was seen to sport a pistol in a leather shoulder holster under his left shoulder, typical of right-handed people, but his actions in the videos suggest he is left- handed. Other factors that could have led to his identification were his height, general physique, the pattern of veins on the back of his hands, his voice and clothes. A team of analysts might use the topography of the landscape in the video in an attempt to identify the location. On 24 August 2014, the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Peter Westmacott, said that Britain was very close to identifying \\"Jihadi John\\" using sophisticated voice recognition technology, but when pressed, refused to disclose any other details. On 20 September 2014, the United States Senate approved a $10 million reward for information that led to the capture of anyone involved in the murders of James Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Cawthorne Haines. On 20 November, the bill, extending the potential scope of the reward program to any American kidnapped and murdered by a \\"foreign terrorist organization\\" and limiting the reward to a maximum of $5 million, was referred to the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\\"Bill Summary & Status 113th Congress (2013‚Äì2014) H.R.5752\\", Library of Congress On 14 September British Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that the identity of \\"Jihadi John\\" was known but had yet to be revealed. On 25 September, FBI Director James Comey told reporters that they had identified the suspect, but did not give information regarding the man's identity or nationality. \\"I believe that we have identified him. I'm not going to tell you who I believe it is,\\" Comey stated. Michael Ryan, an author and scholar from the Middle East Institute speculated, \\"maybe 98 percent of 95 percent sure is not sure enough to put a man's name out.\\" In August 2014, The Sunday Times reported that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (\\"L Jinny\\"), 23, a hip-hop musician from West London, had \\"emerged as a key suspect\\" in the investigation.Richard Kerbaj, Marie Woolf and Nicky Harley, London hip-hop artist key suspect in beheading, Sunday Times, 24 August 2014. Other sources also stated that Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s from Portsmouth, were suspects. =Mohammed Emwazi= On 26 February 2015, The Washington Post identified the perpetrator as Mohammed Emwazi, a British man then in his mid-20s who was born in Kuwait and grew up in west London. The Washington Post investigation was undertaken by Souad Mekhennet and Adam Goldman. Emwazi was born to Iraqi parents who moved to neighbouring Kuwait from Iraq. After the Kuwaiti government rejected their application for citizenship in 1994 they moved to Iraq and then on to Britain. According to his student card from the University of Westminster, Emwazi was born on 17 August 1988. The BBC stated that Emwazi is believed to be \\"an associate of a former UK control order suspect ... who travelled to Somalia in 2006 and is allegedly linked to a facilitation and funding network for Somali militant group al-Shabab.\\" He reportedly prayed on occasion at a mosque in Greenwich. He graduated with a degree in Information Systems with Business Management from the University of Westminster in 2009. His final address in the UK before he went abroad was in the Queen's Park area of North West London. The Post reported interviews with Emwazi's friends indicating that Emwazi was radicalised after a planned safari to Tanzania following his graduation. According to the interviews, Emwazi and two friends, a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib, never made the safari. Rather, upon landing in Dar es Salaam in May 2009, the three were detained, held overnight by police, and eventually deported. In May 2010, The Independent reported on the episode, identifying Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam. According to e-mails sent by Emwazi to and that were provided to the Post, after leaving Tanzania, Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an MI5 officer accused him of attempting to go to Somalia, where al-Shabab operates. Emwazi denied attempting to reach Somalia, but a former hostage told the Post that \\"Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia\\" and forced captives to watch videos about al- Shabab. Tanzanian officials have denied that they detained and deported Emwazi at the request of MI5, saying instead that he had been refused entry for being drunk and abusive. Later, Emwazi and his friends were permitted to return to Britain, where Emwazi met with Qureshi in late 2009. The Post quoted Qureshi as saying that Emwazi was \\"incensed\\" at the way he had been treated. Emwazi moved to Kuwait shortly afterward, where (according to emails he wrote to Qureshi), he worked for a computer company. Emwazi returned to London twice, however, and, on the second visit, he made plans to wed a woman in Kuwait. In June 2010, Emwazi was detained by counter-terrorism officials in Britain, who searched and fingerprinted him, and blocked him from returning to Kuwait. In an email four months later to Qureshi, Emwazi expressed sympathy for Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative who had just been sentenced in US federal court for assault and attempted murder. Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi when Emwazi sought advice from him in January 2012. Close friends of Emwazi interviewed by the Post said that he was \\"desperate to leave the country\\" and one friend stated that Emwazi unsuccessfully tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012. Sometime after January 2012, Emwazi travelled to Syria, where he apparently contacted his family and at least one of his friends. In March 2015, the media reported that his mother had recognised Jihadi John's voice as her son's; meanwhile, his father denied that this had happened or that Emwazi was Jihadi John. Reactions United States President Barack Obama condemned the actions of \\"Jihadi John\\" and vowed punishment for all the militants responsible for the videotaped beheadings. Secretary of State John Kerry also called \\"Jihadi John\\" a \\"coward behind a mask\\" and, echoing Obama, stated that all those responsible would be held accountable by the United States. British officials have also reiterated their commitment to capturing \\"Jihadi John\\". Admiral Alan West, a former UK Minister for Security and Counter-terrorism, said that he is a \\"dead man walking\\" who will be \\"hunted down\\" like Osama bin Laden. Prime Minister David Cameron also stated that he was absolutely certain that Jihadi John would \\"one way or another, face justice\\", and he also condemned the actions of \\"Jihadi John\\". UK Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, and Secretary General of Interpol Ronald Noble also stated that Jihadi John should be brought to justice. Reacting to the naming of Emwazi by the media, a spokesman for the family of Steven Sotloff told the BBC that they wanted to see him behind bars. Bethany Haines, daughter of David, said \\"It's a good step but I think all the families will feel closure and relief once there's a bullet between his eyes.\\" Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of UK anti-terror laws, said, \\"Had control orders been in place, in my view there is a realistic prospect that Mohammed Emwazi, and at least two of his associates, would have been the subject of control orders with a compulsory relocation.\\" In reaction to the revelation, Emwazi's father, Jassem, has said that he is ashamed of his son. Previously, when he learned from his son that he was going to Syria \\"for jihad\\", Jassem had told him that he hoped he would be killed. But the day after the naming he issued a statement denying that his son was Jihadi John. An unidentified cousin issued a statement which said, \\"We hate him. We hope he will be killed soon. This will be good news for our family.\\" On 8 March 2015, according to The Sunday Times, Emwazi apologised to his family for \\"problems and trouble the revelation of his identity has caused\\" them. The message was conveyed via an unspecified third party.nypost.com \\"'Jihadi John' apologizes to his family\\", Post Wire Service 2015/03/07 Death On 12 November 2015, two United States drone aircraft along with a British drone conducted an airstrike in Raqqa that targeted Emwazi as he left a building and entered a vehicle. US officials stated he had been killed, and a senior US military official was quoted as saying, \\"we are 99% sure we got him.\\" A US official called it a \\"flawless\\" and \\"clean hit\\" with no collateral damage and that Emwazi was \\"evaporated.\\" On 14 December 2015, US President Barack Obama stated Emwazi had been \\"taken out\\". UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, stated the US and Britain had been working \\"hand in glove, round the clock\\" to track Emwazi's location, and that the drone strike was \\"an act of self-defence.\\" On 19 January 2016, in the ISIL magazine Dabiq, the group confirmed that Emwazi had been killed by a drone strike in Raqqa. The obituary showed him unmasked and referred to him as Abu Muharib al-Muhajir. Further photographs showing him unmasked in Syria were released on 26 January 2016. Later events In July 2017, German-based journalist Souad Mekhennet published I Was Told to Come Alone: My Journey Behind the Lines of Jihad, which details the hunt to identify and kill Jihadi John, in part through the investigations of Souad Mekhennet herself. She was the lead reporter of a story, published in The Washington Post, that first revealed his true identity. In September 2017, The Telegraph released old video footage showing Mohammed Emwazi and other notorious ISIL members relaxing unmasked and talking casually.

Born in Craiova, he attended high school in Pite»ôti. Subsequently, he entered the Faculties of Law and Literature at the University of Bucharest, and received a doctorate in law from the University of Paris in 1922. Admitted to the Ilfov County bar that year, in 1926 he joined the new National Peasants' Party (PN·π¨). Elected to the Assembly of Deputies for Ismail County in 1928, he was a centrist within the party, supporting a focus on agricultural production. In 1932, he spoke out in the Assembly against the majority bonus system, arguing that representation should reflect the votes cast. During the Alexandru Vaida- Voievod government, he was undersecretary of state in the Agriculture Ministry, as well as head of the directorate for national minorities. Under Iuliu Maniu, he was state secretary for agriculture from 1932 to 1933. A founding member in 1938 of the National Renaissance Front, between that year and the following, in the governments of Miron Cristea, Armand CƒÉlinescu, Gheorghe Arge»ôanu and Constantin Argetoianu, he was Minister of Public Works and Communications. From 1939 to 1940, he was Interior Minister. Following World War II, he was named president of the Romanian committee for applying the armistice convention, leading this body from 1945 to 1946. Again elected to the Assembly in 1946, he obtained a seat in the Great National Assembly in 1948, following the establishment of a Communist regime.

Background Nearing the end of World War One in the autumn of 1918, a retreating Ottoman Army column of roughly two thousand entered Tafas. Its commander, Shereef Bey, ordered all the people massacred, including the women and children to demoralize the British and Arab forces in pursuit of the Turkish army.Murphy, 2011, p. 44. The British commander leading the Arab forces, T. E. Lawrence, arrived in the area shortly after the massacre and witnessed bodies mutilated and the majority of the town in ruins. In retaliation for the massacre, Lawrence's troops attacked the withdrawing Turkish columns, and for the first time in the war ordered his men to take no prisoners. Around 250 German and Austrian soldiers that had been captured that day were murdered as they were gunned down by Lawrence's enraged men with machine guns. Lawrence wrote in his diary: \\"We left Abd el Main there and rode on past the other bodies, now seen clearly in the sunlight to be men, women, and four babies, toward the village whose loneliness we knew meant that it was full of death and horror. On the outskirts were the low mud walls of some sheep-folds, and on one lay something red and white. I looked nearer, and saw the body of a woman folded across it, face downward, nailed there by a saw- bayonet whose half stuck hideously into the air from between her naked legs. She had been pregnant, and about her were others, perhaps twenty in all, variously killed, but laid out to accord with an obscene taste. The Zaggi burst out into wild peals of laughter, in which some of those who were not sick joined hysterically. It was a sight near madness, the more desolate for the warm sunshine and the clean air of this upland afternoon. I said: \\"The best of you brings me the most Turkish dead\\"; and we turned and rode as fast as we might in the direction of the fading enemy. On our way we shot down those of them fallen out by the roadside who came imploring our pity.\\" See also *List of massacres in Ottoman Syria References Category:Massacres in the Ottoman Empire Category:World War I crimes by the Ottoman Empire Category:Prisoners of war massacres Category:World War I crimes by the British Empire and Commonwealth Category:World War I massacres Category:Ethnic cleansing in Asia Category:Mass murder in 1918 Category:1918 in Ottoman Syria ","title":"Tafas massacre"},{"id":"43630982","text":"Euchromius micralis is a moth in the family Crambidae.

It was released in 1989 on Toxic Shock. For Beat Until Stiff, TQ had taken over as full-time lead singer for the band (though Sluggo sings on the tune \\"Taskmaster\\" and hidden track \\"Sea of Trash\\"), and his vocals that range from a growl to a scream begin to characterize the band's sound. The band's punk rock sensibilities are still in the forefront with fast, thrashy songs like \\"The Lickyerbutt Song\\" and \\"This is My Rifle\\", and with subjects like \\"Retardo Porn\\" and \\"Suicidal Maniac.\\" But with the songs \\"Beat Until Stiff\\" and \\"Gotta Go\\" some slower tempos and heavier guitars are introduced, giving the album a proto-grunge feel. The trademark trumpet and saxophone solos are still present throughout. Kris Fell, in the Boston Phoenix said that the \\"lyrics on Beat Until Stiff are blunt, almost photographic representation of the grotesque...\\" This album features a guitar solo by Mr. Horribly Charred Infant of the Happy Flowers. Note that Hullabaloo rarely used their real names and instruments on the personnel listing of their records. The names on this record are their \\"British Invasion\\" names. These names are also scrawled upon a picture of the British invasion band The Hullaballoos on the inner sleeve. Beat Until Stiff's new songs were recorded and mixed at the Fort Apache South studio by Paul Q. Kolderie. Kolderie also re-mixed the two previously released songs for this album. The cover art for the album lists the producers as \\"Hugo & Luigi,\\" but this is yet another allusion to The Hullaballoos, who were \\"packaged for U.S. consumption by Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, notorious vice presidents and A&R; directors of Roulette Records.\\".
