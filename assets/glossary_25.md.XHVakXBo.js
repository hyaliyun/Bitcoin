It was founded December 3, 1914, at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, by fifteen student and faculty leaders. The society recognizes achievement in five areas: scholarship; athletics; campus and community service, social or religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech and the mass media; and creative and performing arts. Some circles of ŒüŒîŒö are quasi-secret, in that newly selected members remain undisclosed for some time. Membership in the Omicron Delta Kappa Society is regarded as one of the highest collegiate honors that can be awarded, in the tradition of Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa. To be selected as a member of ŒüŒîŒö, one must stand among the top thirty- five percent of all students at that particular institution and hold a leadership role in one of the society's five areas of recognition. History Omicron Delta Kappa Key Founding On the evening of December 3, 1914, the Omicron Delta Kappa Society was founded by fifteen men who gathered in a small office on the third floor of Reid Hall on the campus of Washington and Lee University. J. Carl Fisher first introduced the idea of creating such a society to a close friend, Rupert Latture. The two soon included mutual friend William Brown in the discussion, and thus these three are referred to as the principal founders of the society. Together with three faculty members, including the president of the University and the dean of Engineering, they gradually selected nine others to join them. The complete list of the fifteen founders is as follows. *James Edwin Bear, ŒíŒòŒ†, editor of the student magazine *William Moseley Brown, ŒîŒöŒï, Œ¶ŒíŒö, debater, a president of the YMCA *Carl Shaffer Davidson, ŒöŒ£, student instructor in civil engineering *Edward Parks Davis, ŒöŒ£, athlete *Edward A. Donahue, Œ¶ŒöŒ£, captain of football and baseball *De la Warr Benjamin Easter, PhD, ŒöŒ£, Œ¶ŒíŒö, professor, and the founding president of ŒüŒîŒö *James Carl Fisher, business manager of the student magazine, founder of the campus radio station *Philip Pendleton Gibson, Œ†ŒöŒë, president of student government, editor of the student newspaper *Thomas McPheeters Glasgow, Œ¶ŒîŒò, orator, athlete *David Carlisle Humphreys, FIJI, professor and dean of the School of Applied Science *Rupert Nelson Latture, ŒîŒ•, Œ¶ŒíŒö, a president of the YMCA *John Eppes Martin, ŒëŒßŒ°, business manager of the year book *William Caulfield Raftery, Œ¶ŒöŒ£, athlete *John Purver Richardson, Jr., Œ£Œß, instructor in biology *Henry Louis Smith, PhD, Œ¶ŒîŒò, Œ¶ŒíŒö, president of Washington and Lee University The fifteen founders of the Omicron Delta Kappa Society All fifteen men were prominent leaders on campus, and they rallied around the idea that all-around leadership in college should be recognized, that representative men in all phases of college life should cooperate in worthwhile endeavor, and that outstanding students and faculty should affiliate in the spirit of mutual interest and understanding. The founders intended that ŒüŒîŒö not be yet another society in which members would simply earn a societal Key and then be done. Members of ŒüŒîŒö would remain active as leaders, in upholding spiritual and moral values, and in rendering service to the campus and community. Reid Hall, the birthplace of The Circle The founders decided that The Circle would be kept a complete secret until keys could be designed and produced. The keys arrived shortly past the winter holiday, and each man first wore his key on the 15th of January in 1915. The student newspaper, the Ring-Tum Phi, broke the news in the issue dated January 12, 1915 of a new society to be known as \\"The Circle,\\" with the secret significance of its three Greek letters known only to its members.\\"Commemorating the Silver Anniversary, Omicron Delta Kappa Fraternity, 1914‚Äì1939\\" Purpose of the Society The Purpose of the Society is threefold: * First, to recognize those who have attained a high standard of efficiency in collegiate activities and to inspire others to strive for conspicuous attainments along similar lines; * Second, to bring together the most representative students in all phases of collegiate life and thus to create an organization which will help to mold the sentiment of the institution on questions of local and intercollegiate interest; * Third, to bring together members of the faculty and student body of the institution, as well as other Omicron Delta Kappa members, in the spirit of mutual interest and understanding. Women in ODK Only men could become members of Omicron Delta Kappa in the first sixty years of its existence. At the 1970 and 1972 National Conventions, the University of Alabama Circle introduced an amendment to the National Constitution to admit women into the Society. In June 1972, Title IX of the \\"Education Amendments Act of 1972\\" prohibited sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs and amended parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Professional and honor fraternities were included in Title IX. The Special Committee on the Possible Role of Women met in January 1973 and recommended changes to the National Constitution that would abolish segregation based on gender within the Society. On March 12, 1974. the National Convention convened in New Orleans and approved the initiation of women into the Society. On that date, the first women members were recognized by the Society. They were the Carolyn Julia Kucinski and Diane Christine Ragosa of the Newark College of Engineering Circle, and Robbie Lynn Cooney, Maria Dolores Delvalle, Roxane R. Dow, Catherine Ann Rohrbacher, Karen Diane Janzer, Linda Ann Touten, Martha Gwyn Van Deman, and Cathy Sue Welch of the University of South Florida Circle. Cheryl Hogle was elected as the first woman National President at the Convention in Knoxville, Tennessee on February 25, 1998. After serving four terms as a Faculty Province Director and two terms as National Vice President for Extension, she was elected by unanimous vote of the Convention.\\"Women in ODK\\" On June 26, 2010, the ODK National Leadership Summit and Convention elected Dr. Betsy Holloway as the 34th National President, the second female to be elected. On March 22, 1992, the National Convention passed a resolution authorizing the incorporation of the Society. On July 1, 1992, the Omicron Delta Kappa Society was merged into the corporation, The Omicron Delta Kappa Society, Inc. Relationship with Mortar Board A similar honorary society, for exceptionally outstanding women leaders, known as Mortar Board, had been established just a few years after ODK, in 1918, with many similar ideals and purposes. With the passage of Title IX in 1972, each of those two societies was then required to accept candidates of either gender into its membership. As a result, the two organizations found themselves competing to tap many of the same distinguished students, and those formerly complementary societies became rivals at many institutions, perhaps fiercely so during membership selection, while more congenially so during the rest of the year, as the two rivaled one another in service, athletics, or other campus activities. Membership selection Unlike the college honor societies that accept all potential members who meet the selection criteria and pay the required fees, O‚àÜK chooses only a highly select group from a pool of potential and qualified students through a process known as tapping. Eligibility for membership in O‚àÜK requires at least sophomore academic standing. Unlike Phi Beta Kappa, which limits membership to the liberal arts and sciences, O‚àÜK contemplates candidates from every field of study who distinguish themselves as outstanding leaders in at least one of the five areas celebrated by O‚àÜK: scholarship; athletics; campus and community service, social or religious activities, and campus government; journalism, speech and the mass media; and creative and performing arts. Members may be chosen either annually or semi-annually depending on the tradition of each individual circle. The number of candidates tapped each year is limited to thirty five percent of the undergraduate population, but most circles limit membership to fewer than the top one quarter of one percent of the students on their respective campuses. Once a circle votes on who will be tapped for membership, it withholds that secret from all but those few chosen for initiation. Once tapped, each candidate must maintain the secret until the circle reveals it to the campus and community in a public ceremony, only after the circle has initiated the new members into the bonds of the society through its private ritual. At some institutions, such as the University of Missouri, with several such elite societies that tap new members, the public revelations are all held in conjunction, in an annual ceremonial Tap Day celebration on campus. Circles Omicron Delta Kappa uses the term circle to indicate chapters. As of December 2, 2019, 421 circles have been chartered. The practice of designating circles with Greek letter names was abandoned in 1949. Members who have died are said to have entered the Eternal Circle.

JG 71 was West Germany's first operational jet fighter unit. On 29 June 2013 the last F-4F Phantom fighter flew for the last time, before the type was taken out of service. The wing is now equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon. Due to restructuring of the German Air Force, JG 71 was temporally transferred into the newly established Tactical Group \\"Richthofen\\" on 1 October 2013. Its parent unit was now Tactical Wing 31 in N√∂rvenich. On 5 July 2016 the restructuring was reverted and the fighter group again upgraded to a fighter wing. History German Air Force JG 71 \\"Richthofen\\" Canadair Sabre at the Luftwaffenmuseum. This one specifically bears the personal markings of The Black Devil (Erich Hartmann). The unit was formed in June 1959, equipped with 50 Canadair Sabre Mk.6s and stationed at the former RAF Ahlhorn. The highest- scoring fighter pilot of all time, Erich Hartmann, flew the Canadair Sabre (reputedly his favorite fighter plane design), and aircraft such as the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, in the newly formed wing in the late 1950s. On 21 April 1961, the 43rd anniversary of the death of ‚ÄúRed Baron‚Äù Rittmeister Manfred von Richthofen, JG 71 was given the honorary title of ‚ÄúRichthofen‚Äù by Federal President Heinrich L√ºbke. In 1963, JG 71 transferred from Ahlhorn to Wittmundhafen Air Base. May 1963 saw the introduction of the first F-104 Starfighters into German Air Force service. In 1974 the Wing obtained its first F-4F Phantom II's and on 19 September 1974 the unit's Starfighters were decommissioned. In 1988 the Wing's secondary role of Fighter Bomber Attack was given up so that JG 71 is now exclusively a Fighter Wing. F-4F Phantom II of JG 71 in 1978 wearing the unit shield marking on its engine intake cover JG 71 is part of NATO's Immediate Reaction Force, meaning that it must be ready to deploy twelve aircraft on five days' notice. However, the likelihood of having to deploy at such short notice is almost nil, so fulfilling Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) interceptions for Northern Germany is shared with JG 74, which completed Eurofighter conversion in late 2008. Depending on the situation, the dividing line between the two units is roughly Frankfurt-Berlin, with JG 71 protecting the northern part of Germany.German Phantoms still going strong, Air Forces Monthly magazine, June 2008 issue, p. 42. Two F-4 Phantom II of JG 71 In 2007, for the second year running, JG 71 was German Air Force's record- breaking fighter wing in terms of flying activity, clocking up over 7,600 flying hours.German Phantoms still going strong, Air Forces Monthly magazine, June 2008 issue, p. 40. The unit is on 24/7 readiness to intercept unidentified aircraft over Germany. Between June and September 2008 the unit took part in NATO's Baltic Air Policing. The unit participated in a Baltic Air Policing deployment from 1 November 2009. In June 2010 six of the unit's F-4s were deployed to Iceland as part of NATOs Icelandic Air Policing mission. In 2010 JG 71 began receiving its first Eurofighters. The wing flew a mixed fleet for three years until June 2013 when the last Phantoms were withdrawn.

Originally the circuit consisted of 5 tournaments; Langholm Sevens being the last added in 1908. As such it is the oldest Sevens circuit in the world; as the first Sevens tournament outside Scotland was held in Percy Park in North Shields in 1921 and there were no other circuits at that time.Bath, Scotland Rugby Miscellany, p82 The main circuit has now grown to 11 tournaments; 10 in Scotland and 1 - the Berwick Sevens - in England. The circuit has now extended into a league known as Kings of the Sevens. Of the extended circuit only the Walkerburn Sevens is not included in this league. The Kings of the Sevens championship is run by the Border League. History The original Borders Sevens Circuit consisted of the Melrose Sevens (founded 1883), Gala Sevens (1884), Hawick Sevens (1886), Jed-Forest Sevens (1894) and Langholm Sevens (1908). This was known as the Spring Circuit. Walkerburn Sevens started in 1911. It is traditionally the last tournament of the Sevens season and is instead treated as a finale. Other Sevens tournaments were added to the calendar after the First World War:- Selkirk Sevens (1919); Kelso Sevens (1920), Peebles Sevens (1923) and Earlston Sevens (1923). These were originally pre-season tournaments. The last tournament added to the Borders Sevens Circuit was the Berwick Sevens in 1983. Schedule Traditional Sevens schedule was changed by the Scottish Rugby Union in order to allow more time for the regular rugby season. Controversially, due to the influence of former national coach Jim Telfer, Melrose RFC did not have to change its date. As of 2011, Sevens will take place on consecutive weekends in April and May. The schedule is due to change again for season 2019-20. Invited sides Each of the Sevens tournaments has a history of invited sides. Melrose Sevens - the World's most prestigious Sevens tournament - as it was the birthplace of the sport - notably has the most; attracting teams globally. The likes of the French Barbarians (1983); Ireland Wolfhounds (1991); Bay of Plenty (1992); Manly (1995); Hamilton RFC, Sea Point (2010) and Saracens (2012, 2013) have all won the event. Outwith the Melrose tournament the likes of London Welsh won Hawick Sevens in 1969; London Scottish won the Kelso Sevens in 1991; Newcastle Falcons won Langholm Sevens between 2005 and 2008; the Barbarians and Harlequins entered the Gala Sevens in 1976; and Northampton Saints have won the Selkirk Sevens in 1991 and 1993. =International 7s sides= International 7s sides often take part amongst the club sides. Fiji 7s beat Canada 7s in the 1991 Gala Sevens final. Scotland 7s won the final of the Kelso Sevens in 1996 beating Kenya 7s; and Scotland 7s won the Selkirk Sevens in 1996 beating the Wales 7s side in the final. Germany 7s reached the final of the Melrose Sevens in 2015, losing out to Glasgow Warriors.https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union-2-14915/melrose-sevens- glasgow-too-strong-for-germany-1-3743171 Main circuit The new circuit has thus been extended from the original 5 tournaments in Spring. The Borders Sevens circuit now contains 11 tournaments:- * Peebles Sevens * Gala Sevens * Melrose Sevens * Hawick Sevens * Berwick Sevens * Langholm Sevens * Kelso Sevens * Earlston Sevens * Selkirk Sevens * Jed-Forest Sevens * Walkerburn Sevens Other Sevens tournaments in the Borders Other Sevens tournaments in the Borders are:- * Hawick Linden Sevenshttps://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/sport/rugby/return-of-hawick- linden-sevens-1-4902596 * South of Scotland District used to run a Sevens tournament.http://www.rugbyrelics.com/images/aaaaa/bu/40.jpg Kings of the Sevens The ten most prestigious of the main circuit tournaments make up a league competition known as the Kings of the Sevens. The league began in 1994 though work is ongoing to calculate previous winners based on the format. The ten tournaments used for the Kings of the Sevens league are:- * Peebles Sevens * Gala Sevens * Melrose Sevens * Hawick Sevens * Berwick Sevens * Langholm Sevens * Kelso Sevens * Earlston Sevens * Selkirk Sevens * Jed-Forest Sevens The Walkerburn Sevens are instead known as the Prince of the Sevens and remain the season finale. Format Teams competing gain points depending on how far they progress in each tournament; the winner gains ten points, the runner up gets seven points, and semi-finalists receive five points.

The song was written by group members Siobh√°n Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan in collaboration with Cameron McVey, Jony Lipsey, Felix Howard and Matt Rowe, and produced by McVey, Lipsey and Paul Simm. \\"New Year\\" is a pop and R&B; ballad with influences of soul and alternative rock. It features acoustic instrumentation, and the lyrics describe the experience of breaking up on Christmas Day. Critics praised the song for its seasonal nature and the group's performance. Upon release, it charted at number twelve in the United Kingdom and number twenty-five in Ireland. To promote the song, a music video was directed by Alex Hamming and filmed in London. On 31 December 2012 the trio performed \\"New Year\\" at a New Year's Eve party in London, under their new group name Mutya Keisha Siobhan. Background and release Mutya Buena (pictured) formed the Sugababes with Siobh√°n Donaghy and Keisha Buchanan in 1998. British girl group the Sugababes were formed in 1998 by Siobh√°n Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan. Donaghy and Buena first met during an a cappella gig, where they heard each other sing and later performed a duet. The duo decided to work together on a new song, and while they were in the studio, Buchanan came to visit her friend Buena. Donaghy's manager, Ron Tom, concluded that the trio were to join together as a band, known as the Sugababes. They later signed to London Records and began writing songs for their debut album One Touch. \\"New Year\\" was written by the group's members in collaboration with Cameron McVey, Jony Lipsey, Matt Rowe and Felix Howard. The song was produced by McVey, Lipsey and Paul Simm. It was recorded and engineered by Goetz Botzenhardt at Bear Studios, and mixed by its producers at Metropolis Studios. London Records released \\"New Year\\" in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2000 as the second single from One Touch. Two B-sides were featured on the first CD single: \\"Forever\\" and \\"Sugababes on the Run\\". On the second CD, a B-side titled \\"Little Lady Love\\" was included. \\"New Year\\" was omitted from the group's greatest hits album Overloaded: The Singles Collection. Composition and lyrics \\"New Year\\" is a midtempo pop and R&B; ballad with influences of soul and alternative rock. It contains acoustic instrumentation in the form of beats, bass, strings, guitar and keys, and features tight production juxtaposed with the group's harmonious vocals. Writers for the BBC characterised the song as having \\"a melodic swagger\\" reminiscent of All Saints' earlier work, and a \\"classy arrangement [...] boosted by an infectiously splashy drumbeat and stabs of acoustic guitar\\". \\"New Year\\" features a seasonal theme, focussing on the holiday of Christmas, which is referenced in the song's lyrics. It is about the experience of a breakup on Christmas Day. According to Betty Clarke of The Guardian, \\"New Year\\" \\"tells [a tale] of festive fumblings to Last Christmas\\", and through lines such as \\"I'm older than my years, drowning in my tears\\" the Sugababes are shown singing with insight. Reception=Critical The song was raved by critics. A journalist from the BBC wrote that the single as \\"lives up to the hype\\" and praised the inclusion of lyrics about Christmas as \\"without sounding remotely contrived\\". According to the Daily Mail, the Sugababes avoid sounding \\"mushy\\" on the album's ballads including \\"New Year\\". The Sunday Heralds Samuel McGuire interpreted \\"New Year\\" as a \\"mellow [and] dewy-eyed\\" song that will \\"undoubtedly cement [the Sugababes'] 'new All Saints' tag early in 2001\\". Eva Simpson of the Daily Mirror gave a positive review, writing: \\"Taken from outstanding debut album One Touch, this soulful track is head and shoulders above other festive releases. A must for Christmas stockings.\\" Yahoo Music's Andy Strickland stated that while \\"New Year\\" is not as \\"wired or skewed\\" as the group's debut single \\"Overload\\", it is a representation of the group members' vocal abilities. Hot Press writer Stephen Robinson praised the song as \\"a shameless attempt at a January hit\\", while Peter Robinson called it the group's best ballad. In December 2012 Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph picked it out as one of the newspaper's favourite Christmas songs: Commercial Because of its release around Christmas time, media outlets considered \\"New Year\\" to be a contender for the 2000 Christmas number one. In the issue dated 30 December 2000 the song debuted and peaked at number twelve on the UK Singles Chart, where it charted for nine weeks. By early 2010, it had sold approximately 85,000 copies in the United Kingdom and was the group's eighteenth highest-selling single there. \\"New Year\\" reached number twenty-five on the Irish Singles Chart, where it appeared for five weeks. Promotion From left to right: Siobh√°n Donaghy, Mutya Buena, Keisha Buchanan. Music video To promote \\"New Year\\", a music video was directed by Alex Hamming and filmed in London, England. It was included on the song's CD release. The video is mainly black-and-white, but also features shades of pink and blue. During the video, the group's members sing in front of a white background, while computer graphics such as snow, letters and butterflies appear throughout. Other features in the video include a bird cage, stars and a calendar. Donaghy, Buena and Buchanan are shown both individually and collectively in the video; in some clips they are seated on chairs and against walls. The Daily Telegraphs Bernadette McNulty described their appearance in the clips, writing: \\"The original trio sulk their way through the video in boot-cut jeans and smudged eyeliner\\". Live performances The Sugababes performed \\"New Year\\" on the 15 December 2000 broadcast of TFI Friday. In October 2011, news outlets began to report that the original members of the Sugababes would reform. In July 2012, it was officially confirmed that they had reformed under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan. The trio played their first gig together in over ten years on 31 December 2012 at a New Year's Eve party held in London. \\"New Year\\" was the second song on the set list, which also included their songs \\"Overload\\" and \\"Freak like Me\\", and a cover version of Rihanna's single \\"Diamonds\\". Cover versions The song was covered by Welsh indie pop band The Darling Buds and released as a digital single on Oddbox Records on 15 December 2018.

It stars Danielle Catanzariti, Keisha Castle-Hughes and Toni Collette. The film follows Jewish 13-year-old Esther (Catanzariti), an outcast at her posh school, where she has no friends. That changes when she meets nonconformist Sunni (Castle-Hughes) from the local public school. With Esther's character based loosely on her own adolescence, Randall was inspired to write the film's script by what she saw as a lack of role models for teenage girls. In 2002, the script earned her a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme, where she developed the project, and it was later picked up by Tama Films. Randall returned to Australia for casting, and Catanzariti was eventually chosen in the lead role after she attended an audition for minor roles and extras. Production spanned from October to December 2006, with filming taking place in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales. The film premiered on 9 February 2008 at the Berlin International Film Festival and was released in Australia on 20 March 2008. It failed to earn back its budget with a total domestic gross of approximately $800,000. The film attracted mixed reviews; some critics praised the originality and the acting, though others found Randall's direction dull and the script poorly written. Catanzariti won the Australian Film Institute's Young Actor Award for her performance, and the film received a further three AFI nominations and a nomination for a Film Critics Circle of Australia Award. Plot Esther Blueburger is a 13-year-old Jewish outcast at her posh private school. Things are no better at home, where her twin brother is beginning to develop into a sociopath and her controlling mother pressures Esther to conform. She finds her only friend in a duck called Normal, and she frequently prays into a toilet asking God to \\"get me out of here\\". After escaping her own Bat Mitzvah, Esther bumps into Sunni, a rebellious girl from the local public school, who she had observed and spoken to on previous occasions. The two girls form a friendship, and Esther begins attending Sunni's school, unbeknownst to her parents, under the guise of a Swedish exchange student. She revels in the easygoing nature of the public school and enjoys spending time with Sunni's friends and Sunni's laid-back single mother, Mary, who works as a stripper. As Esther gains popularity and submits to numerous acts of peer pressure - including attacking a girl from her old school - her friendship with Sunni starts to deteriorate. At her old school, meanwhile, her classmates have been led to believe that she was chosen for an elite social experiment, and when she returns she is treated like royalty. Esther later discovers that Mary has died in a motorcycle accident, and a grieving Sunni is transferred to Esther's private school under her grandmother's care. Ultimately deciding that being true to herself is more important than fitting in, Esther discards her pretenses and renews her friendship with Sunni. Cast * Danielle Catanzariti as Esther Blueburger * Keisha Castle-Hughes as Sunni Kaire * Toni Collette as Mary * Christian Byers as Jacob Blueburger * Essie Davis as Grace Blueburger * Russell Dykstra as Osmond Blueburger * Jonny Pasvolsky as Mr. Hooper * Cassandra Jinman as \\"The Slug\\" * Janay Mosby as Vanessa * Yen Yen Stender as Lissy Production=Development Cathy Randall's script for Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger stemmed from her desire \\"to make a film about a kick-ass chick, a heroine for teenagers and people of all ages\\", wanting to take a female twist on The Catcher in the Ryes Holden Caulfield. She said that she had \\"always been struck by the fact that there are not enough role models for teenage girls\\". Esther's character was drawn loosely from Randall's own adolescence; like Esther, she had a Bat Mitzvah, she had a twin brother and she attended both a private and a public school. She explained, however, that the story was \\"warped and twisted and filtered through my imagination so, in fact, it doesn't feel like Esther resembles me at all\\". Based on her original script, Randall was awarded a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme in 2002. She said that, under the mentorship of the school's faculty, \\"The screenplay evolved by becoming lighter and funnier and also the story and structure got tighter.\\" In 2003, Randall was nominated for an Australian Writers' Guild AWGIE Award for Best Unproduced Screenplay. Randall's script was subsequently picked up by producer Miriam Stein and her production company, Tama Films. Stein said that \\"The script resonated with me from the start\\", particularly because of her similar adolescent experience as a Jewish girl who felt like an outsider. Stein brought the film into production after recruiting Nice Pictures CEO Heather Ogilvie as executive producer, Los Angeles-based Harry Clein as associate producer and Buena Vista International to handle distribution in Australia and New Zealand. Casting To cast the title character, the film's producers worked with a casting agent to find experienced actors but also held open auditions for 12- to 15-year-old girls in search of \\"a new face\\". The producers had spent four months overseeing over 3,000 girls' auditions before Danielle Catanzariti attended a cattle call audition advertised in a local newspaper for minor roles and extras. Randall asked Catanzariti to stay behind and read a scene from the script; she went to a number of callback auditions and was later offered the main role. Having been raised in the Catholic faith, Catanzariti took lessons in Jewish history and Hebrew to prepare for her Bar Mitzvah scenes. Keisha Castle-Hughes was Randall's first choice for the role of Sunni based on her performance in the New Zealand film Whale Rider (2002). Castle- Hughes agreed to star in the film when she first read the script at age 13, but was 16 by the time finance had been raised and filming began. Castle- Hughes' pregnancy was announced shortly before production was scheduled to begin but filming went ahead unaffected. Toni Collette was confirmed to have joined the cast in May 2006; her scenes were filmed over one week. Filming Filming took place from 30 October to 15 December 2006. The film was shot on location in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales, with financial incentives from the South Australian Film Corporation. Specific filming locations included Annesley College, St Peter's College as Esther's school and Marryatville High School as Sunni's school. Soundtrack The film's opening song and recurring theme, \\"The Only One\\" was composed by Paul Mac and recorded by Mac, Bertie Blackman and the Sydney Children's Choir. The Sydney Children's Choir's contributions to the soundtrack were Randall's own idea, inspired by the children's chorus covers from The Langley Schools Music Project. The original score was composed by Guy Gross.

It was later screened at numerous international film festivals, including the Dungog Film Festival, Hamburg Filmfest, Washington Jewish Film Festival, London Australian Film Festival, Toronto Jewish Film Festival, Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival, San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, Boston Jewish Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival. The film earned from 134 locations on its opening week at the box office. Its total gross surpassed $600,000 by the next week, having taken a per-screen average of $1,123 over its second weekend. By the end of 2008, the film had earned a total gross of $800,000 at the Australian box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing Australian film of the year, but it still failed to earn back its initial budget of $6 million. Variety magazine critic Richard Kuipers attributed the film's poor performance in part to its \\"M\\" (mature audiences) classification by the Office of Film and Literature Classification although the film was targeted at preteens and teenagers. Reception=Critical reaction Film industry magazine Screen International critic Peter Brunette noted that in spite of minor faults, the film was \\"an otherwise enjoyable piece of highly competent, commercial filmmaking,\\" which \\"should perform well in all markets, from theatrical through to ancillary.\\" In a review for The Age, Jake Wilson gave the film 3 stars out of 5, describing it as \\"a quirky Australian coming-of-age story that gives the genre a good name\\". He wrote that while it lacked the film \\"craft or pizazz\\" of other teen movies, the film broke the conventions of the genre. The Sydney Morning Heralds Sandra Hall awarded Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger 3 out of 5 stars and thought that it was entertaining but \\"too polished\\". She praised the acting, particularly from Danielle Catanzariti and Russell Dykstra, but felt that the script lacked spontaneity. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton of At the Movies each gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5. Stratton enjoyed the \\"terrific\\" performances, namely from Catanzariti and Keisha Castle-Hughes, while Pomeranz praised the film's \\"eccentricity\\" and the discomfort caused to the audience at times. Other critics were less positive. The Herald Suns head reviewer Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried to match the edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, \\"way, way off the mark\\". He wrote, \\"If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', just wait until you get a load of this lame local production.\\" Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film was an example of \\"just how bad local [Australian] films can get\\". In particular, he criticised the \\"stiff\\" performances, the \\"woeful\\" directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was \\"sporadically amusing\\" and lacked \\"scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics\\". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and \\"uninspired dialogue and direction\\". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that \\"the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart\\". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that \\"her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance\\". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of \\"an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away\\". Awards and nominations Danielle Catanzariti won the Australian Film Institute's Young Actor Award for her performance as Esther. The film received three other AFI Award nominations for Best Screenplay - Original (Cathy Randall), Best Costume Design (Shareen Beringer) and Best Sound (Liam Egan, Tony Murtagh, Phil Judd and Des Keneally). Catanzariti was nominated by the Film Critics Circle of Australia for the FCCA Best Actress Award. Randall won an award for directing at the Hamburg Filmfest Michel Children's and Youth Film Festival.

The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet is a narrative poem, first published in 1562 by Arthur Brooke, which was the key source for William Shakespeare‚Äôs Romeo and Juliet. Brooke is reported to have translated it from an Italian novella by Matteo Bandello; by another theory, it is mainly derived from a French adaptation of Bandello's novella which involves a man by the name of Reomeo Titensus and Juliet Bibleotet by Pierre Boaistuau, published by Richard Tottel. The play of Romeo and Juliet is of 4 days where as the one by Arthur Brooke takes place over many months, meaning that Shakespeare‚Äôs version is more intense than Arthur Brooke‚Äôs. Little is known about Arthur Brooke. He was admitted as a member of Inner Temple on 18 December 1561 under the sponsorship of Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton. He drowned in 1563 by shipwreck while crossing to help Protestant forces in the French Wars of Religion. The poem's ending differs significantly from Shakespeare's play‚Äîin the poem, unlike the play, the nurse is banished and the apothecary hanged for their involvement in the deception, while Friar Lawrence leaves Verona to end his days in a hermitage. London, Chatto and Windus; New York, Duffield and company, 1908. Reprinted in 1978. It was played in 1975 in the city of Chatham in Ontario, Canada.

In addition to the dried corn, the bags typically contain cooking oil with sufficient saturated fat to solidify at room temperature, one or more seasonings (often salt), and natural or artificial flavorings or both. With the many different flavors, there are many different providers.  Design  The bag is typically partially folded when it is placed in a microwave, and inflates as a result of steam pressure from the heated kernels. Microwave popcorn bags are designed to avoid popped-kernel scorching, an undesirable effect that takes place when popped kernels are heated above . A susceptor‚Äîusually a metalized film laminated onto the paper of the bag‚Äîabsorbs microwaves and concentrates heat at the film interface, thus ensuring a heat distribution focused on the hard-to-heat flavor coating so that the unpopped kernels are evenly coated prior to popping, thereby ensuring even flavor throughout the product. Additionally, some popcorn is flawed and will not pop because of possible damage to the shell, which allows the steam to escape. These unpopped kernels are known as \\"old maids\\" or \\"spinsters\\". An early susceptor popcorn bag design was patented by the American company General Mills in 1981 (US Patent #4,267,420).  Safety issues  Care in package design is needed for food safety. A safety issue is that the cooking time given on the packaging does not apply to all microwave ovens. Setting the timer and coming back later, after the timer's alarm has sounded, could result in the popcorn being burnt and smoking badly. Microwave popcorn makers suggest that the person cooking the popcorn stay near the oven to observe the popcorn as it cooks, and take the popcorn out when the time between pops is more than a few seconds. The concern about microwave popcorn bags has increased in the last few years in terms of the waste and their harmful impacts on the environment. A study shows that food packaging accounts for almost two-thirds of the total volume of packaging waste.K. Marsh, B. Bugusu, Food packaging‚Äîroles, materials, and environmental issues, J. Food Sci. 72 (2007) R39‚ÄìR55. In addition, the coating materials used in microwave popcorn bags can have negative effects on the environment. Researchers have detected toxic chemicals in the bags, such as perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and their potential precursors. PFCs are environmentally persistent, bioaccumulative, and potentially harmful. Among PFCs, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) have been reported to be toxic.C. Lau, J.L. Butenhoff, J.M. Rogers, The developmental toxicity of perfluoroalkyl acids and their derivatives, Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 198 (2004) 231‚Äì241.M.E. Andersen, J.L. Butenhoff, S.

Perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) precursors are proved even more toxic than PFCAs themselves.A.A. Rand, J.P. Rooney, C.M. Butt, J.N. Meyer, S.A.

In addition, due to the persistence and mobility properties of PFOA, it has been detected in water, soil, air, and wildlife.J.P. Giesy, K.

Harmful chemicals  Researchers have detected many PFCs in microwave popcorn bags used as coating materials for oil and moisture resistance. The most commonly studied PFCs are PFOA and PFOS. The amount of PFOA in some microwave popcorn bags is determined as high as 300 Œºg kg‚àí1.T. H. BEGLEY, K. WHITE, P. HONIGFORT, M. L. TWAROSKI, R. NECHES, & R. A. WALKER, Perfluorochemicals: Potential sources of and migration from food packaging, Food Additives and Contaminants, October 2005; 22(10): 1023‚Äì1031. Besides PFOA and PFOS, Moral et al. also determined other perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) in popcorn packaging, including perfluoroheptanoic (PFHpA), perfluorononanoic (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic (PFUnA), and perfluorododecanoic (PFDoA) acids.Marƒ±¬¥aPilarMartƒ±¬¥nez-Moral, Marƒ±¬¥a Teresa Tena, Determination of perfluorocompounds in popcorn packaging by pressurised liquid extraction and ultra-performance liquid chromatography‚Äìtandem mass spectrometry, Talanta 101 (2012) 104‚Äì109. PFCs are toxic, non-biodegradable and stay in the environment persistently. Accumulation of PFCs in living organism can exert adverse effects in lab animals, aquatic life and humans.I. Zabaletaa,n , E. Bizkarguenaga a , D. Bilbao a , N. Etxebarriaa,b , A. Prietoa,b , O. Zuloaga, Fast and simple determination of perfluorinated compounds and their potential precursors in different packaging materials,Talanta 152 (2016) 353‚Äì363. A study in rats has found that PFOA can induce liver, testes, and pancreatic tumors.Biegel LB, Hurtt ME, Frame SR, O‚ÄôConnor JC, Cook JC. 2001. Mechanisms of extrahepatic tumor induction by peroxisome proliferators in male CD rats. Toxicol Sci 60(1):44‚Äì55. The exposure of PFOS to rats may also results in abnormal glucose and lipid homeostasis in the gestational and lactational adulthood.Lv, Z., Li, G., Li, Y., Ying, C., Chen, J., Chen, T., Wei, J., Lin, Y., Jiang, Y., Wang, Y., Shu, B., Xu, B., Xu, S., 2013. Glucose and lipid homeostasis in adult rat is impaired by early-life exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate. Environ. Toxicol. 28, 532-542. PFCs have been found to inhibit the communication system and the gene transcription in rats.Walters, M.W., Bjork, J.A., Wallace, K.B., 2009. Perfluorooctanoic acid stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis and gene transcription in rats. Toxicology 264, 10-15. In addition, a study also suggested that PFOA exposure was associated with kidney and testicular cancer in people living near chemical plants.Barry V, Winquist A, Steenland K. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures and incident cancers among adults living near a chemical plant. Environ Health Perspect. 2013;121:1313‚àí1318. PFOA and PFOS can also cause membranous damage associated with apoptosis and DNA damage in aquatic organisms (particularly in fish) and negative effect on population growth rate of rotifer. Due to the toxicity of PFOA, major U.S. manufacturers volunteered to phase out production of PFOA by the end of 2015. In addition, the use of perfluoroalkyl ethyl-containing food- contact substances are no longer allowed by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations in January 2016.Drinking Water Health Advisory for Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA),EPA 822-R-16-005, May 2016. However, although the production of PFOA and PFOS was reduced, the production of fluorotelomer-based chemicals applied to food contact papers is still increasing. Some compounds, such as polyfluoroalkyl phosphate surfactants (PAPs) or fluorotelomers (FTOH), have been used in some brands of microwave popcorn bags. Those compounds are precursors of PFCAs, and evidence shows that they are more toxic than PFCAs themselves. Furthermore, they may also be degraded to PFCAs, and therefore leading to the increase of PFCAs concentrations in the environment and generating adverse effects.  Environmental impacts  Due to the high energy of C-F bond (531.5kJ/mol) in PFCs, PFCs are extremely resistant to natural biodegradation.Deng, S., Nie, Y., Du, Z., Huang, Q., Meng, P., Wang, B., Huang, J., Yu, G., 2015. Enhanced adsorption of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate by bamboo- derived granular activated carbon. J. Hazard. Mater. 282, 150-157. Once PFCs are released into the environment, they become contaminants. Evidence shows that water, air, soil, and wildlife have been contaminated by PFCs. For example, PFOA concentrations was up to 0.9 micrograms per liter (¬µg/L) in some wells in Minnesota between 2004 and 2008,Goeden, H., and J. Kelly. 2006. Targeted Sampling 2004-2005. Perfluorochemicals in Minnesota, MN, Department of Health. and 0.4 ¬µg/L is the provisional Health Advisory for PFOA in drinking water developed by EPA in 2009. Besides, Giesy and Kannan detected PFCs in fish, birds, and marine mammals around the world. People also detected PFOA in the arctic media and biota. Because of the large amount of production of microwave popcorn bags, they have also become a significant contaminant source (PFCs) to the environment. Due to the disposal of coated paper and manufacturing activities, PFOA has also been detected in wastewater and biosolids. Soil near disposal sites are contaminated by PFOA as well.  Remediation methods  To reduce the destructive impacts of PFCs on the environment, people have developed many technologies to remove PFCs from aqueous solutions, including adsorption, ion exchange, membrane separation, photochemical oxidation, ultrasonication, bioremediation, plasma oxidation, and other techniques. These technologies require harsh treatment conditions, cause high energy consumption, and cannot be applied in large scale. Electrochemical oxidation (EO) is a promising technique to remove PFCs from contaminated wastewater. It has many advantages, such as relatively lower energy consumption, milder conditions, and higher removal efficiency.  Electrochemical oxidation mechanism  The EO mechanism and the pathways of both PFCAs and PFSAs are stated below. At the beginning, the carboxyl or sulfonic acid group of PFCs transfer an electron to the anode, and the PFCs radical (CnF2n+1COO¬∑ or CnF2n+1SO3¬∑) are formed. PFCs radicals are unstable, and perfluoroalkyl radicals (CnF2n+1¬∑) are produced. Then, the CnF2n+1¬∑ radicals react with OH, O2, and H2O in four possible routes as shown in Cycle A, Cycle B, Cycle C and Cycle D. The detailed reaction processes are as follows: CnF2n+1COO‚àí‚ÜíCnF2n+1COO‚ãÖ+e‚àí CnF2n+1COO‚ãÖ‚ÜíCnF2n+1‚ãÖ+CO2 CnF2n+1SO3‚àí‚ÜíCnF2n+1SO3‚ãÖ+e‚àí CnF2n+1SO3‚ãÖ+H2O‚ÜíCnF2n+1‚ãÖ+SO42‚àí+2H+ In Cycle A: CnF2n+1¬∑ + ¬∑OH ‚Üí CnF2n+1OH CnF2n+1OH + ¬∑OH ‚Üí CnF2n+1O¬∑ + H2O CnF2n+1O¬∑‚Üí Cn-1F2n-1¬∑ + CF2O In Cycle B: CnF2n+1OH ‚Üí Cn-1F2n-1CFO + HF Cn-1F2n-1CFO + H2O ‚Üí Cn-1F2n-1COO‚àí \\\\+ HF + H+ Cn-1F2n-1CFO +¬∑OH ‚Üí CnF2nO2H¬∑ CnF2nO2H¬∑ ‚Üí Cn-1F2n-1COO¬∑ + HF In Cycle C: CnF2n+1¬∑ + O2 ‚Üí CnF2n+1OO¬∑ CnF2n+1OO¬∑ + RFCOO¬∑ ‚Üí CnF2n+1O¬∑ + RFCO¬∑ + O2 CnF2n+1O¬∑ ‚Üí Cn-1F2n-1¬∑ + CF2O COF2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí CO2 \\\\+ 2HF In cycle D, volatile fluorinated organic contaminants are released. EO technique also has some disadvantages, such as high cost and complexity of setting up and operating an electrochemical cell. Due to these disadvantages, EO has not yet been commercialized. Some microwave ovens have a specific mode designed for cooking popcorn, which either uses factory-calibrated time and power level settings, or which uses humidity or sound sensors to detect when popping has finished.

Erminio Blotta (November 8, 1892 - January 23, 1976) was an Argentine self-taught sculptor of Italian origin. Biography He was born in Morano Calabro (province of Cosenza, Calabria). His birth certificate records his name as Erminio Antonio Blotta Mainieri, but his Argentine identity papers have Carmen Erminio Blotta instead. Blotta's family came to his adoptive country when he was only a child, at the beginning of 1894, during a major wave of Italian immigration to Argentina. They settled in Rosario, Santa Fe Province, about 280 km northwest of Buenos Aires. Two of his father's brothers were already living in Argentina, in the town which would then be called Lucio V. L√≥pez, 40 km north-west of Rosario. Blotta was the eldest of nine siblings. He was an apprentice worker in the Ferrocarril Central Argentino railway company, where he developed his basic sculpting skills by modelling figurines with clay. He then worked in a medal workshop with Marcos Vanzo, and modelled plaques and funeral portraits. In 1909 he studied with sculptor Jos√© Nardi. At only 17 he travelled to Montevideo, Uruguay, where he stayed for one year (1909-1910) and then another year in Buenos Aires (1911-1912). He returned to Rosario, and with the assistance of his friends and the financial support of an amateur art fan he opened an exhibition gallery and presented his first bass-reliefs in bronze. He lived for four years in conventillos (cheap pensions), until in 1915 he managed to get a piece of land and set up a workshop, where several of his friends lived, at the expense of surgeon Artemio Zeno. He came in contact with many other poor intellectuals and artists (poets, painters, sculptors) and with the anarchist movement. Blindness In November 1917, while he was finishing his monument to Juan Bautista Alberdi, a chip of marble (which was being worked by his assistant) broke Blotta's glasses, and glass splinters wounded both his eyes. He spent several months completely deprived of sight, until he was operated by surgeon Dr. Pedro Lagleyze. He only recovered the sight of his left eye. Blotta would later thank the physician with a sculpture. Dr. Lagleyze sent him to recover at a friend's house in Villeta, 30 km south of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. Blotta did not find the person he was looking for, but instead met the father of Paraguayan artist Modesto Delgado Rodas, who took him in as a guest. In Villeta, Blotta also met Carmen de Jes√∫s Prieto Ruiz, a young schoolteacher and a few months later, on September 4, 1918, he married her. During his stay, he collected aboriginal Tupi-Guarani art, and created some works that can be found still in several cities of Paraguay. Years later he was declared Honorary Citizen of Paraguay. In 1970, six years before his death, Blotta confessed in a newspaper that his most fervent wish would be to die a Paraguayan. Family Blotta moved back to Rosario in mid-1920, after learning that his study had been robbed. His first son, Herminio, was born at that time. He moved several times until finally settling in a house on 3160 Marcos Paz St. (in Barrio Echesortu). He had five other children, the last of whom (a daughter) died as a baby. His residence gradually became the home of his Paraguayan in-laws. Artistic work Blotta was the literary commentator of the Buenos Aires newspaper La Naci√≥n, for which he wrote regularly, between the 1910s and the 1930s. His contributions were signed as \\"Herminio Blotta\\". In his youth Blotta worked on marble and stone, besides clay, but in the mid-1920s he started producing less marble busts and tends to produce more works in clay, then cast in bronze. There are records (especially from La Capital newspaper) of more than 200 works of this type. Blotta also worked as a Message Therapist in the Ports Direction of Rosario, and collaborated as a plaster artisan in the scale model of the thalweg of the Paran√° River. Additionally, he earned a living with funeral art, producing (for example) several hundreds of bronze objects for headstones, often with his colleague Pedro Cresta (1912-1970). In his old age the Municipality of Rosario granted him a special pension for his artistic labors. Erminio Blotta died surrounded by his family in Rosario, in 1976, at the age of 83. Legacy Works by Erminio Blotta can be found in the Argentine provinces of Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, Mendoza, C√≥rdoba, Tucum√°n, Entre R√≠os (specifically in Concepci√≥n del Uruguay), and Chaco (in the capital city, Resistencia), as well as in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and in the Mefalsim kibbutz in Israel. In 1978 a minor street in Rosario was renamed Escultor Blotta (Sculptor Blotta). It is a one- block passage formerly known as Pasaje Mercado, located 250 m from Blotta's monument to J. B. Alberdi.

S. The Australian National Dictionary p.652 Oxford University Press 1988 often unsympathetically. Background By late 1929, the economic depression had hit all western countries.  Causes  The prices of wool and wheat‚Äîtwo of the nation‚Äôs biggest exports‚Äîhad been in rapid decline. Overseas investments and loans started to disappear. As money became tight, there was a large decrease on spending on public work, which led to an increase in unemployment. The unemployment was further exacerbated by the falling income from primary producers. At the end of 1929, Australia's unemployment rate sat at around 13%. By 1932, it had peaked at a staggering 29%.  Effects  Though the downturn in the economy had a much greater effect on the lives of the poor, not even the very rich could ignore the situation, as evidence of the Depression could be found everywhere. It was seen in the dole queues, soup kitchens doling out staple, filling foods, such as bread and potatoes, and shanty towns that sprang up across the nation. The Depression was illustrated by the estimated 40,000 homeless who had to create makeshift accommodation in public parks and fields and by the men that went wandering‚Äî\\"on the track\\"‚Äîin search of work during this time, or even food, known as swagmen. These men, estimated to be somewhere around 30,000 in number, had to report to a police station every week, where they could claim very basic rations of food.  The susso  By 1932, more than 60,000 people depended on sustenance payments, known as \\"the susso\\", merely to survive. This was only for the truly destitute, who had been unemployed for a sustained period of time, and had no assets or savings. Relief was State-based; in South Australia, it was in the form of rations and vouchers.A Wife Intervenes The Mail (Adelaide) 7 August 1937 p.7 accessed 25 July 2011 At a time when the basic wage was ¬£2/11/8d, \\"the susso\\" in Queensland was 3s. to 4/6d per child. \\"Many spend more than that on a dog\\", one speaker was quoted as saying.Actual Poverty in Land of Plenty Cairns Post Saturday 7 November 1936 p.6 accessed 25 July 2011 ¬£2/11/8d and 3s. translate to around $800 and $45 in today's money.

It stood next door to the famed Sydney Trocadero dance hall, which was demolished in 1971. The Regent operated as a cinema for most of its life, including the premiere Sydney season of Ken Russell's film version of Tommy in 1975 (presented in \\"Quintaphonic\\" sound), but from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s it was also a popular venue for music concerts and stage shows, and in its final years hosted many large-scale musicals and performances by the Australian Opera and Australian Ballet and other theatrical and musical performances, including Marcel Marceau, Debbie Reynolds, Barry Humphries, the musical Barnum, Liza Minnelli, The Dance Theatre of Harlem, Tangerine Dream, and \\"The Two Ronnies\\" (Ronnie Barker & Ronnie Corbett),Ausstage - Regent Theatre The gala opening was on 9 March 1928 with the film Flesh and the Devil starring John Gilbert and Greta Garbo, and the theatre closed with a screening of the documentary Ski Time on 26 May 1984. The last live performance was by American musician Ellen McIlwaine on 19 May 1984. In 1974, the trade union Actor's Equity asked the Builders Labourers Federation to place a green ban to prevent demolition of the theatre. In the late 1970s many meetings of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Staff Association were held there at very reasonable rates, the owner being sympathetic to the trade union.Molomby, Tom, Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years, William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.96 Demolition commenced in late 1988 after a court decision upheld the lifting of the permanent conservation order by the Minister for Planning and Local Government, David Hay. The slump in the Sydney property market that followed meant that the site remained a vast hole in the ground until 2004, when work finally began on a new high-rise building complex. Many of the theatre's fittings were sold at an auction in 1990, and can be found in a number of locations around Sydney and NSW. A lightweight plastic replica of the Art Deco crystal chandelier from the Regent's foyer now hangs in the foyer of the nearby The Metro Theatre; redeveloped from a cinema, it is now the city's leading rock music venue. The fate of the original chandelier, from which the Metro's copy was made, is unknown. The theatre had been listed on the Register of the National Estate,The Heritage of Australia, p.2/101 but this did not prevent its demolition by property magnate Leon Fink. The remodelled Regent Melbourne which has been converted for live performance still exists, as does the Regent Theatre, Dunedin in New Zealand, which serves as both a live performance venue and a cinema.

History  Rotationplasty was first performed by Borggreve in 1927.Kotz, R. \\"Rotationplasty.\\" Seminars in surgical oncology 13.1 (1997): 34-40. Print. He performed the procedure on a 12-year- old boy who suffered from tuberculosis. However, the procedure was not well known until 1950, when Dutch orthopedist Cornelis Pieter van Nes (1897‚Äì1972) reported the results of rotationplasty procedures.Rotation-plasty for congenital defects of the femur, by C. P. van Nes, in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery; Volume 32-B, Issue 1 / February 1950 He became well known for establishing the procedure. Since then, many surgeons have performed modified versions of rotationplasty and have had great success.  Reasons  Originally, rotationplasty was performed to treat infections and tumors around the knee. It was also a common treatment for osteosarcoma. While it is still being used to treat their complications, rotationplasty is also used to treat growing children who have been diagnosed with tumors around the knee. Rotationplasty is also performed on children with congenital femoral deficiencies. Those deficiencies cause \\"unstable hip joint[s] and a femur that is 50% shorter than the contralateral, normal femur.\\" This procedure gives rotationplasty patients the ability to have the use of both feet and allows them to continue living an active lifestyle.  Procedure  In the actual procedure, the bone affected by the tumor, as well as a small part of the healthy femoral and occasionally tibia bone, is removed. A portion of the leg removed; the ankle joint is then turned 180 degrees and is reattached to the thigh. They are held together by plates and screws until they have healed naturally. The surgery can take anywhere from 6 to 10 hours, with a day or two in intensive care. The leg is kept in a cast for 6 to 12 weeks. After the leg has sufficiently healed, the leg can be fitted for a prosthetic.Kotz, R. \\"Rotationplasty.\\" Seminars in surgical oncology 13.1 (1997): 34-40. Print.  Advantages and disadvantages  In the same scenario, amputation would not leave a knee joint. Rotationplasty allows the use of a knee joint. Furthermore, it provides a better position for a prosthetic limb. As a result, children who have had rotationplasty can play sports, run, climb, etc. Rotationplasty is also durable. Patients do not typically have to undergo additional surgeries throughout their lives. Unfortunately, not every case turns out favorably. Rotationplasty can result in problems with blood supply to the leg, infection, nerve injuries, problems with bone healing, and fracture of the leg. Also, the appearance of the leg after rotationplasty can be considered unusual.  Quality of life  A 2002 study measured life contentment and quality of life in 22 patients who had been recipients of the rotationplasty procedure at least 10 years before. They found that those patients that were younger when the procedure was performed were happier with their lives. It was also found that 8 of the 22 had to have a total of 21 surgical revisions performed in the 10 years. In comparison to the general population, the patients had a higher percentage of quality of life, 83% compared to 75%. Overall, the patients were more content with different aspects of their lives than the general population.  References  External links  * Saving Lives ...

Colin McLean Colin McLean was born in Wellington in August 1978, spending the first five years of his life in Raumati South and then moving with his family to Petone, a suburb of Lower Hutt. He attended Petone College, but dropped out before graduation, and took a job delivering mail at a Wellington law firm, where he worked for two and a half years. During this time, he began to do drag, designing and sewing his own costumes because it was less expensive than buying or renting costumes. McLean is openly gay. As his designs became more complex, he applied to Wellington Polytechnic, where he was accepted into a two-year Fashion Diploma course. Finding its program inconsistent, he dropped out after one year, then enrolled at a government funded private training establishment (PTE) Bowerman School of Design six months later. He completed this program (although private, courses are taxpayer funded, elementary level) and went on to become a retail assistant for a fancy dress shop before leaving to work as a freelance designer and performer. As a freelance designer, McLean has designed costumes for such shows as Hone Koukas‚ÄîHome Fires, Awhi Tapu, and Strata (all produced by Taki Rua Productions), Gravity, The Expert, and others. McLean has appeared in drag on the television shows The Strip and Good Morning and in the films Stickmen and The Irrefutable Truth About Demons. His work as a theatrical costume designer and drag performer has been displayed at the Museum of New Zealand and The Dowse Art Museum.

He was the former director of the Division of Artificial Organs at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Education Dobelle was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on October 24, 1941, to orthopedic surgeon Martin Dobelle and Lillian Mendelsohn Dobelle. His younger brother Evan Dobelle is a politician and educator. With his father, Dobelle designed improvements for the artificial hip when he was 13. He started college at Vanderbilt the following year, though he soon dropped out to pursue other interests. In 1957, he won the South Florida Regional Regional Science fair with an X-ray machine he built the previous year; he then went on to win the National Science Fair with the device. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in biophysics at Johns Hopkins University, where he worked on the development of medical tests. He finished his Ph.D. in neurophysiology at the University of Utah. Career and artificial vision Dobelle was the CEO of the Dobelle Institute, headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal, which concentrates on artificial vision for the blind. He was associate director of the Institute of Biological Engineering at the University of Utah from 1969‚Äì1975, and persuaded General Instrument to donate a microcircuit laboratory to the school. He later served as director of the Division of Artificial Organs at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was a founding fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering. Throughout his career, he worked closely with friend and mentor Willem Johan Kolff, with whom he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003. In 1983, he bought Avery Laboratories (now Avery Biomedical Devices), where he worked on neurostimulation and the artificial eye. Dobelle led one of several teams of scientists around the world seeking to develop technology for artificial vision.A bionic visionary for the blind February 19, 2003 Sydney Morning Herald Dobelle's teams developed a brain implant which films the visual field in front of the patient and transmits it to the brain's visual cortex, allowing the patient to see outlines. He received widespread publicity on January 17, 2000, when it was announced that a patient known as \\"Jerry,\\" blind after a blow to his head 36 years previously, had regained his ability see thanks to the artificial eye Dobelle had spent over 30 years developing. \\"Medical Marvels\\" Jerry \\"sees\\" by wearing spectacles attached to a miniature camera and an ultrasonic rangefinder. They feed signals to a computer worn on the waistband, which processes the video and distance data, which is then sent by another computer to 68 platinum electrodes implanted in Jerry's brain, on the surface of the visual cortex. He sees a simple display of dots that outline an object. Jerry's vision is the same as a severely shortsighted person‚Äîequivalent to 20/400. He is able to read two-inch letters at five feet. The Dobelle Eye has been tested in several people, allowing individuals who were once completely blind to see the outlines of images in the form of white dots on a black background. In 2002, 38-year-old Jens Naumann, a blind man, was able to use the device to drive a car in the parking lot of the Dobelle Institute. His story was documented in the film Blind Hope. Cheri Robertson, a 41-year-old woman who was also implanted with the system, was profiled in the documentary \\"Robochick and the Bionic Boy\\" in 2008. Portable breathing pacemaker Dobelle's Avery Biomedical Devices also created the portable breathing pacemaker, which has been used by patients with quadriplegia, central apnea, and other respiratory ailments.

Family and early life Naidoo was of South African Indian Tamil descent and was born in Asiatic Bazaar Pretoria. She had her primary school education in the Pretoria primary school. She was the only daughter and had 8 brothers. Her parents had a family business. She had to care for the family and home and hence she did not pursue an independent career. In 1934 at the age of 26 she married Naransamy Roy Naidoo. He was the son of one of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs closest friends and a dedicated Satyagrahi, Thambi Naidoo. He sent his children to live and learn under the tutelage of Gandhi at the Tolstoy Farm in Johannesburg. Roy Naidoo was among the children who went to Tolstoy Farm where he received training in simple living and self-sufficiency. In 1914 after Gandhi finally left South Africa, Roy Naidoo together with the Phoenix boys went to Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs Ashram, Shantiniketan where they lived for two years and received some training in arts and crafts as well as Indian culture and language. The party then moved to Sabarmati Ashram. Political activism Naidoo's husband Roy returned home to South Africa in 1928. He began work with the trade union movement and joined the Communist Party of South Africa CPSA. Naidoo worked closely with him. She joined him in the 1946 Passive Resistance campaigns and courted imprisonment which she served bravely. In 1952 she again joined the defiance campaign and was again imprisoned. In 1954 she joined the Federation of South African Women (FEDSAW) and was elected on to its executive committee. She attended the Kliptown People‚Äôs Congress and participated in the adoption of the Freedom Charter. In 1956 she marched to the Union buildings with 20,000 women against the pass laws. She participated in almost all the campaigns and marches held in Johannesburg. There were candlelight processions, night vigils, and in 1963 she marched to the Union Buildings in protest against the formation of the South African Indian Council created by the apartheid government. She was outspoken and ready to participate in political activity. She watched all her children (Shanthie, Indres, Murthie, Ramnie and Prema) being imprisoned, detained, tortured and harassed by the apartheid security police but remained steadfast right to the end. The Naidoo home was always a hive of activity. Leaders such as Moses Kotane, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and many others were constant visitors. Mandela enjoyed her crab curries. Death On 25 December 1993 she died, just under two years prior to South Africa's first multiracial elections held under a universal franchise.

It was located in Ruhleben, a former Vorwerk manor to the west of Berlin, now split between the districts of Spandau and Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The camp was originally a harness racing track laid out north of the Berlin-Hamburg Railway line in 1908. Detainees Detainees queuing for Christmas dinner: painting by Nico Jungman The camp detainees included male citizens of the Allied Powers living, studying, working or on holiday in Germany at the outbreak of World War I. They also included the crews of several civilian ships stranded in German harbours or captured at sea. There were in addition a number of fishermen captured from trawlers which were sunk in the North Sea in the first days of the war: these were mainly men from Hull, Grimsby and Boston. The camp varied between 4,000 and 5,500 prisoners, most of them British. Life in the camp was described in several books and essays subsequently written by detainees. These included To Ruhleben ‚Äì And Back (1916) by Geoffrey Pyke,Pyke, 1916. who had successfully escaped from the camp in 1915, and Life in Ruhleben, 1914‚Äì1918 (1920) by Frederick Keel.Keel, 1920. Quarters were cramped; the stable blocks averaged 27 stalls each housing six men; the stable block lofts each housed about 200 men. The German authorities adhered to the Geneva Convention and allowed the camp detainees to administer their own internal affairs. Gradually, a mini-society evolved in the camp. Letters, books, sports equipment and a printing press were all allowed into the camp and the detainees organised their own police force, magazine, library and postal service. The latter, known as the Ruhleben Express Delivery, was organised by Albert Kamps and began operating in July 1915. Soon it was handling over 6,000 pieces of mail per month and 16 different postage stamps, which have since become collectors items, were issued. In April 1916 however the German postal authorities declared the service illegal and it ceased operating. In addition, a number of independent businesses, including a casino, also developed within the camp. Arts and culture Gala performance of The Mikado: painting by Nico Jungman The detainees arranged their own entertainment. Among them were several musicians, including Ernest MacMillan, later to become a conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Other British musicians included Edgar Bainton,Joseph W Pegg, Newcastle's Musical Heritage: An Introduction Edward Clark and the Australian-born Arthur Benjamin.LindaJo K. McKim, LindaJo H. McKim, The Presbyterian Hymnal CompanionJoseph W. Lewis, What Killed the Great and Not So Great Composers? MacMillan was a prominent member of the Ruhleben Musical Society, formed in 1915, and directed performances of The Mikado (with orchestra and costumes) and a pantomime version of Cinderella. MacMillan transcribed the music for the former from memory with the help of four other musicians, including Benjamin Dale.MacMillan, Sir Ernest (1997). MacMillan on music: essays on music, Carl Morey (ed.) pp. 25‚Äì29, Dundurn Press Among those who attended these performances were James W. Gerard, the United States ambassador. The detainees also presented Trial by Jury, The Pirates of Penzance, The Yeomen of the Guard and The Gondoliers.Photo of the prisoners in The Gondoliers, 1917, accessed 30 May 2012 MacMillan gave lectures on each of Beethoven's symphonies, which were followed by piano duet performances played by him together with Benjamin Dale.Nevins, Maureen (1994).

MacMillan was also a member of the Ruhleben Drama Society and acted in productions of Othello, Twelfth Night, Lady Windermere's Fan and The Importance of Being Earnest. The artist Charles Freegrove Winzer was interned at the camp, and provided illustrations for the camp magazine. His detention was contested, because he worked for the French Red Cross, and had been visiting his sister in Germany with permission of the military authorities there. Some of his lithographs, depicting life in the camp, are now in the Australian War Memorial collection. Sports Boxing match: painting by Nico Jungman Sports also played a major role in the lives of the detainees. Among them were several former professional footballers, including three former England internationals, Fred Pentland, Samuel Wolstenholme and Steve Bloomer; a Scotland international, John Cameron; a German international, Edwin Dutton; and John Brearley, once of Everton and Tottenham Hotspur. The Ruhleben Football Association was formed with Pentland as chairman and Cameron as secretary. Cup and league competitions were organised with teams representing the individual camp barracks. Around 500 prisoners played in the football competitions. Several thousand spectators attended the bigger games. A series of exhibition and \\"international\\" matches were also organised. On 2 May 1915 an \\"England XI\\" featuring Pentland, Wolstenholme, Brearley and Bloomer played a \\"World XI\\" captained by Cameron. Towards the end of the war an international triangular tournament called the Coupe de Allies, featuring a \\"British XI\\", a \\"French XI\\" and a \\"Belgium XI\\", was organised. Other sports such as cricket, rugby, tennis and golf were also popular within the camp. In May 1915 a \\"Ruhleben XI\\", featuring Bloomer and Brearley, played a \\"Varsities XI\\" in the Ruhleben Cricket League.

They also have a new feline wizard on their hands with some hidden talents. Plot synopsis To her owners, apartment-dwellers on the upper East Side of New York's Manhattan Island, Rhiow looks like nothing more than their little black pet cat: a sweet-tempered, good-natured little creature who shakes them down for food at every opportunity, is always ready for a cuddle, and never ventures any further away than the apartment's terrace. But a lot more could be said about Rhiow...for when her humans aren't looking, she has a life of her own that they don't dream of. Rhiow is a wizard, and heads an elite team of other feline wizards whose job is to keep the Grand Central worldgates running. With her teammates Urruah (a dumpster-living, foodie tomcat with a yen for opera) and Saash (the \\"Scotty\\" of their team, cerebral and witty, but always scratching at fleas that aren't there), they help keep the city's wizardly public transport system purring along. ...Until one morning matters get suddenly complicated with the arrival of Arhu, an abrasive feral tom-kitten in the middle of his Ordeal‚Äîthe potentially deadly initiation through which every wizard must pass to come into his or her power. The chain of events triggered by Arhu's adoption into their team leads Rhiow and her companions out of their own New York and into another, more ancient, and far deadlier one‚Äîto a confrontation with the Lone Power that's intent on the destruction of cats and humans alike. There, Rhiow and her team must deal with not only the sudden danger wound together with Arhu's fate, but a terrible secret concealed in the heart of the feline underworld, ready to burst out in annihilating force into the world of men, which as wizards they're sworn to protect. Now the cat- wizards' only hope of success lies in their uneasy bond with a race of creatures who've been their enemies for all time‚Äîand now hold the key not only to their own survival, but that of the human race... Characters Rhiow, the cat featured on the cover of this book, is the leader of the team of cat- wizards. In the beginning of the book, she is on her fourth life (out of nine). She lives with two humans, Sue and Mike. She also appears briefly in one of the regular series. Saash, a tortoiseshell cat, is the technical expert on the gates' hyperstrings. She is in her ninth (and final) life in this book, and she has a problem with a scratchy coat. Urruah has more energy at his disposal than the rest of the team, and is therefore generally the power source for any big workings on the worldgates. He lives in a dumpster and is interested in the Metropolitan Opera. Arhu is a new member of the team, discovered after being chewed up by rats. He ends up being a very important part of their mission. Tom Swale and Carl Romeo are human wizards at the Advisory level in the Manhattan area. They are some of the team's supervisors. Mike and Sue are the humans that keep and feed Rhiow. They are called \\"Iaehh\\" and \\"Hhuha\\" by Rhiow, that being the closest that Ailurin, the feline language, can come to the correct pronunciation. Sehhff'hhihhnei'ithhhssshweihh ‚Äì to the cat-wizards, Ith for short ‚Äì is a saurian wizard who also becomes instrumental in the team's mission. Ehef is the feline Advisory in the area. Yafh isn't a wizard, but still an oft recurring character. He is an apparently long time friend of Rhiow's.

It is, in fact, a Soviet-produced copy of the Telefunken LS-50 power pentode, possibly reverse-engineered from German (Wehrmacht) military radios captured during World War II, or based on documentation, machines and materials captured as a trophy. It is one of the more unusual types of tube because of its non-standard 8-pin base and a metal \\"cap\\" (not connected to any of the tube internal elements) with a plastic \\"handle\\" on top of the envelope - which is meant to ease extracting the tube from its socket (especially when the tube is hot). One stock Russian-produced socket includes a rugged die-cast metal cage-like enclosure for the tube with spring-loaded locking lid. (The cap was made for fixation of the tube in the metal can, since tubes were designed for mobile operations). Another stock Russian-produced socket is stamped of light aluminium sheet metal, without a lid on top. In the past the tube was very popular with Soviet and Eastern European amateur radio operators because it was commonly available (from military and government warehouses) and could produce fairly large amounts of output power using relatively simple designs. Also, it was popular in Soviet- era DIY audio amplifiers for hi-fi and musical instruments. GU-50 tubes were used also in early TV sets as a horizontal sweep output stage, and in medical devices as RF generators. The tube was never used in mass production amplifiers for civil usage because of relatively expensive technology and materials used. During the Soviet years, the tube was produced by one of the major Soviet transmitting-tube manufacturers in the city of Ulianovsk. It was also made in Poland, in the Unitra factory. At this time it is unclear if current production of the tube exists; however, large quantities of New Old Stock (NOS) GU-50s appear to be available in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the type is far more readily found than the original LS-50. GU-50 was not alone. There were other successors of LS-50 designed by Telefunken. Switzerland's BBC produced P50/1 and later modified version P50/2. They had the same base and pinout as the original LS-50. German Democratic Republic made a P50 that had the same bulb as Soviet –ì–£-50. Later RFT made a P50-1 version of their tube. Unlike Soviet TV designers that used stock military GU-50 for their first TV sets, Eastern German manufacturers offered P50-2 especially made for TV horizontal sweep duties. There were also versions with simplified bulbs made for civil usage, but internals were still too expensive to compete with civil tubes like rugged clones of RCA 6L6 and especially designed later sweep tubes like EL500. The Western German version was called FL152 (or, with 6.3-volt heater, EL152); Eastern German version was called SRS552N. The tube, despite its European popularity, was not well known in U.S.A. and Canada until audiophiles rediscovered it after the collapse of Eastern political block and Soviet Union. The Chinese version of this tube is called FU-50 and production still continues, probably by Shuguang, the major Chinese tube builder. The tube was originally designed for mobile operations, so its filament draws only 0.705 amps of current, while anode power dissipation allowed is up to 40 watts, quite big for such low filament power. It determines the need for high anode voltage, 800 V typically. The screen grid is quite dense, so its voltage when working in pentode mode is limited by 300 volts, otherwise power dissipated by the grid when anode voltage goes below screen grid voltage would damage it. That's why the tube cannot be efficiently used in so-called \\"Ultra - Linear\\" regime when anode and screen grid have the same voltage at idle. However, in triode mode anode voltage never goes below screen grid voltage, so 400‚Äì450 volts of B+ is acceptable. The tube can work also in so-called \\"Right-handed triode\\" mode, or \\"High Mu\\" mode, when all 3 grids are connected together and used with positive bias. In such regime, B+ voltage can be up to 1200 V, and anode curves resemble pentode ones, with higher than in the \\"left-handed\\" triode mode impedance. Anode of the tube is made of a special nickel alloy, specially coated, so it can shortly dissipate more than 100W on anode without destruction. However, such regime causes too high temperature to be used continuously, but instead of destroying the tube like it can be expected in case of so-called \\"Audio Tubes\\" like 6L6 and successors, it causes absorption of gases making vacuum cleaner.

Susan lies and assures Ron that he is mistaken and that she is not seeing anyone. He then asks if she is married to Karl Mayer because of Nurse Hisel's run-in with him. Susan tells Ron that the relationship is platonic and that Susan only re-married Karl because he has an excellent insurance plan. Ron feels sad that Susan could not afford medical care but is still upset that she did not tell him. Later, Susan invites Dr. Ron and Karl over for dinner where they actually have a good time in each other's company. The plot thickens when Karl purposely breaks a pipe which proceeds to leak. Karl then asks Ron to go across the street and alert the plumber, whom he refers to only as \\"Delfino\\". Ron then hurries across the street and explains the situation to Mike. As he gathers his tools, Mike tells Ron to call him by his first name. Immediately, Ron runs out of the house where Susan is already on the street chasing after.

Bree manages to lie to Peter stating that she has been sober for a while and that she is only there to please her son who is convinced she has a problem. Peter tries to delve deeper but Bree avoids his questions. Later at a department store, Bree purchases a few clothing items and has a glass of wine. She then spots Justin and Andrew from a distance at the check out corner. Bree asks why Andrew is there, as he is supposed to be grounded.

However, when the other partners learn that Donovan is 5 years old, they find it a little abnormal that she is still breastfeeding. Ed then forces Lynette to confront her and ask her to close the drapes but also to wean him off, as he fears the firm could suffer if a client comes in and sees it. Although Veronica initially defends herself saying that breastfeeding keeps weight off her like exercise can't. And when Lynette confronts her over the age factor, she further defends it with the health advantages of breastfeeding that are proven and she goes on to compare Donovan's behavior in the nursery with the Scavo boys as \\"proof\\" of this. She then firmly warns Lynette of legal action if she persists. Later, when it seemed that all was lost, Lynette spots Donovan asking for his mom and asks him if he would like a chocolate milk instead. Donovan takes a liking to the milk and does not want his mother's milk anymore. This causes Veronica to become upset since without nursing she will become fat again. Lynette tries her best to comfort her but is satisfied that her scheme was a success.

Like the better-known Russia Company, this was an attempt by the English to challenge the Hanseatic League's dominance in the commerce of northern and central Europe. Its charter was dated in 1579. By the first article, the company was erected into a body politic, under the title of the Company of Merchants of the East; to consist of Englishmen, all practicing merchants, who have trafficked through the sound, before the year 1568, into Norway, Sweden, Poland, Livonia, Prussia, Pomerania, etc., and likewise Revel, K√∂nigsberg, Dantzic, Copenhagen, etc., excepting Narva, Muscovy, and its dependencies. Most of the following articles granted them the usual prerogatives of such companies, including a seal, governor, courts, laws, etc. The privileges specific to this company, compared to other English companies of the time, were: *That none shall be admitted a member, who is already a member of another company, nor any retail dealer at all. *That no qualified merchant be admitted without paying 6 pounds 13 shillings 6 pence. *That a member of another company, desiring to renounce the privileges thereof, and to be received into that of the East, shall be admitted gratis, provided that he procures the same favor for a merchant of the East, willing to fill his place. *That the Merchant Adventurers who never dealt in the East, in the places expressed in the charter, may be received as members of the company on paying 40 marks. That notwithstanding this union of the Adventurers of England with the Company of the East, each shall retain its rights and privileges. *That they shall export no cloths but what are dyed and pressed; except 100 pieces every year, which are allowed them gratis. The company's charter was confirmed by Charles II in 1661, with this addition; that no person of what quality soever, living in London, should be admitted a member unless he were free of the city. Many members of the Eastland Company were prominent English merchants in York, among them Thomas Herbert, Charles Micklethwaite, Christopher Topham, Matthew Topham and Percival Levett.The Acts and Ordinances of The Eastland Company, Edited for the Royal Historical Society From the Original Muniments of the Gild of Merchant Adventurers of York, Maud Sellers, 1906 The company performed poorly however, and resulted in most of the Baltic trade being in the hands of Dutch competitors. In 1672 Parliament passed the Trade Act 1672 (25 Cha.II c.7), entitled An Act for the incouragement of the Greeneland and Eastland Trades, and for the better the Plantation Trade. The act was a mortal blow to the Eastland company.Adam Anderson, An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce: from the earliest accounts... Vol.2, p.521 (1762) Under sections 8 and 9 of the act and notwithstanding the company's charter, Parliament opened up free trade to Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and allowed any Englishman to be admitted into the Eastland Company on paying only 40 shillings.Charles II, 1672: An Act for the incouragement of the Greeneland and Eastland Trades, and for the better secureing the Plantation Trade., Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628-80, pp 792-793.

Inside Toronto, Oct 21, 2012 by Andrew Palamarchuk York Guardian The band was originally formed for local parades and events, and later participated in recruiting drives during World War I. The band was forced to temporarily halt operations soon after the start of World War II, and would not parade until 1960. After the sponsoring force's amalgamation with 12 other municipalities, the band renamed itself to the Metropolitan Toronto Police Pipe Band. In the 1970s, the band began competing, sanctioned in grade 2. The band managed to win 1st place in their division at the Cowal Gathering. Sometime after, the band was promoted to the premier grade. Following Metropolitan Toronto's amalgamation, the band adopted its current name. Toronto Police has won the grade 1 North American Championship at the Glengarry Highland Games a total of 3 times in 1996, 2004 and 2006. In 2006, the band won the American, Canadian and North American Championships. In 2008 the band competed with a non-traditional medley titled \\"Variations on a Theme of Good Intentions\\". In contrast from traditional medley compositions commonly fielded, this set was constructed as a suite on a theme rather than separate tunes. The set was composed for pipes by Michael Grey, brought in as pipe sergeant\\"The Gender Divide in Highland Drum Corps\\". Tom Tom Magazine, December, 2012. Teale Failla, under then-pipe major Ian K.

Grey continued to write competition medleys and other music in his position until departing in the 2013 season to play with the Glasgow Police Pipe Band. The band has not competed since the departure of its last drum sergeant Craig Stewart in 2018 and their subsequent failure to recruit a leading-drummer. Consequently, incumbent Pipe Major Sean McKeown and Pipe Sergeant Ian K.

Plot summary Nick Naylor is the chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, a tobacco industry lobbying firm that promotes the benefits of cigarettes. He utilizes high-profile media events and intentionally provocative rhetoric in order to highlight what his clients view as an unfair crusade against tobacco and nicotine products. The political satire is heightened by Naylor's informal association with lobbyists from other industries that are subjected to routine vilification in the media, e.g. Polly Bailey, a lobbyist for the alcohol/spirits industry, and Bobby Jay Bliss, who represents the firearms industry. Collectively, they form what is known as the M.O.D. Squad, a reference to the title of a police drama, although in this case, \\"M.O.D.\\" stands for \\"Merchants Of Death\\". A pivotal point in the plot occurs when Naylor is kidnapped by a clandestine group who attempt to kill him by covering him with nicotine patches. The search for the perpetrators of the crime leads to surprising results. In this respect, the plot mirrors one of Buckley's other satirical novels, Little Green Men. Film adaptation Mel Gibson originally bought the rights to produce a film version of the novel. A movie based on the novel was released in 2005. While the characters are essentially the same, the plot differs in some significant ways. Most noticeably, Naylor's relationship with his son is given a more prominent role, and the kidnapping conspiracy is downplayed. In addition, the ending is different in both events and tone.

The bulk of the surviving German defenders (from the 6th Fallschirmj√§ger Regiment) had withdrawn to the southwest the previous night after a heavy Allied naval and artillery bombardment. Both sides realized the importance of the town: for the Americans, it was a link between Utah Beach and Omaha Beach, and would provide a base for further attacks deeper into German-occupied France. For the Germans, recapturing Carentan would be the first step towards driving a wedge between the two U.S. landing beaches, severely disrupting and possibly even destroying the Allied invasion. The remnants of the 6th Fallschirmj√§ger resupplied and were reinforced by assault guns and panzergrenadiers of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division on the night of June 12‚Äì13. The combined force counterattacked northeast towards Carentan at dawn on June 13, just as the 506th and 501st PIR were attacking southwest to enlarge the American defensive perimeter around the town. The 506th took the brunt of the attack, and by 10:30 a.m., the outnumbered and outgunned paratroopers were pushed almost back to the outskirts of the town. Under intense German fire, F Company of the 506th's left flank broke and fell back. This exposed D Company's right flank, who also fell back, leaving E Company all alone. Cpt. Thomas P. Mulvey, the commanding officer of F Company, was relieved on the spot by the battalion commander. When a German tank attempted to penetrate the left flank, two soldiers of E Company successfully destroyed it with a bazooka. Meanwhile, battalion headquarters stopped the retreat of D and F companies, pushing them forward 150 meters to cover the left flank. The 2nd Battalion of the 502nd PIR took up positions to the right of the 506th, but by 1:00 p.m. they too had suffered many casualties, and the German attack was on the verge of breaking through their defenses. At this critical point, sixty tanks from Combat Command A of the 2nd Armored Division and accompanied by infantry of the 29th Division, counterattacked southwest from Carentan at 4:30 p.m., inflicting severe casualties on the Germans and forcing them to withdraw at the loss of 4 tanks. The American victory led to the linkup of forces from Utah and Omaha beaches, creating a secure lodgement area for further American operations. The actions of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment during the Graignes incident (better known as the Battle of Graignes) south-east of Carentan, played a part in the successful capture of Carentan and the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Had the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped the advance of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, it is possible that the German division could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. Furthermore, the 507th caused the Germans significant losses in the few days that they were holding Graignes and this likely influenced the battle at the Bloody Gulch.  In popular culture  Band of Brothers, an HBO series, in its third episode \\"Carentan\\" portrays the 506th PIR's part in the battle. The battle were also featured in the first two Brothers in Arms video game.

It is located between the districts of Bitterne, Thornhill and Woolston. Various explanations from where the name derives but the most popular is that \\"Sholing\\" derives from the Anglo-Saxon phrase for \\"hill on the shore.\\" The parish church for Sholing, St Mary's, was opened in 1866. The first Vicar, the Rev. Francis Davidson, (the father of the \\"Rector of Stiffkey\\" Harold Davidson) remained in place for the first 48 years. In 1920, the village became part of the Borough of Southampton. Sholing has a railway station, opened in 1866, which connects the area to Southampton and Portsmouth. History=Toponymy There are various explanations for the origin of the name 'Sholing', spelt 'Scholing' on many old maps. One version is that it means, in Old English, 'the hill above the shore' or 'the hill sloping down to the shore' and it is true that Sholing is indeed on high ground and slopes down towards Southampton Water. However, others think that the ending 'ing' indicates an area where the sons of a man named \\"Schol\\" lived. The Old English 'Scƒìolingas' means 'people associated with somebody called 'Scƒìolh', a nickname for somebody who was crooked or squint-eyed. Another local Romany explanation is that it comes from the presence of the heather 'ling' when it was mentioned that the area had a 'nice show o' ling\\"'. The name of the area could also possibly come from the ancient Sceolingas tribe who lived somewhere in this part of Hampshire. The area has been named locally by some as 'Spike Island'. The explanations include that it originates from the heathland's characteristic spiky gorse that still springs up whenever open land is left unattended. Another is that it stems from the spikes that secured the chains of convicts held in the area prior to being transported to Australia. Another explanation is linked to Spike Island, County Cork ‚Äì a small island off Cork Harbour, Ireland; this was used in the time of Cromwell to hold Irish rebels and in the 19th century deportees were dispatched to Botany Bay in Australia. This detail is than conflated by some with the name 'Botany Bay' and the implied lawlessness of the Traveller and Gypsy inhabitants of Sholing to arrive at Spike Island. There is no 19th century contemporary sources for this Spike Island. 'Botany Bay' is simply a name to imply a remote and inaccessible region, as its Australian namesake, and apart from Hampshire there are examples of Botany Bay in various other counties. Early history Bronze tools have been found east of the River Itchen and there are many burial mounds, or tumuli, in the area. An 1810 map depicts one on Sholing Common. The earliest mention of Sholing, however, is in 1251, when Henry III granted it to the Abbot of Netley Abbey. Another reference to it is contained in the Register of the nearby Priory Church of St Andrew, Hamble, where, in 1679, it refers to 'Sholin'. A further entry, in 1795, states 'There are two hundred and forty souls in this parish, in Sholing 43, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.' The area was then rather desolate, mainly gorse land and heather, and was part of the Parish of Hound, which also included nearby Hamble and Bursledon. The undeveloped Sholing Common was used as a holding area for troops awaiting embarkation in the late 18th and early 19th century wars with France. It was home to a Volunteer Rifle Range in the 1880s, recalled in the local road names of Butts Road, Dragoon Close, Shooters Hill Close and the local public house, 'The Target'. Several factors contributed to changing the character of the small country villages east of the Itchen, the first being the inauguration of the Floating Bridges across the River Itchen in 1836, coupled with the construction of Southampton Docks in 1840. The resultant creation of the road to Portsmouth made the entire district more accessible, adjoining, as it did, the Woolston and Itchen areas. The latter had become fashionable for the gentry, who wanted to get away from the rapidly developing industrial area of Southampton and live in the nearby countryside. Sholing never existed as a village but a small hamlet of brick bungalow type cottages were built in the 1790s in the Botany Bay Road area. The first inhabitants were poor and of Romany background. Many of them retained their caravans and they formed their own tight-knit community, one that continues to this day. These gypsy families would spend the winter in houses, with their caravans in the garden, and travel away in summer hop picking or fruit picking. The men would also race their horses on the local roads during their regular horse sales, to the great pleasure of the villagers and extreme frustration of the local police, who rarely managed to outwit the frantic riders. The opening of Netley Hospital in 1863 also created a need for housing for the hospital staff, and many came to live in Sholing, together with the servants and tradesmen who served the gentry. Buildings and new roads spread throughout the area and the new residents' spiritual needs were soon served by a Primitive Methodist Chapel, erected in 1856 at a cost of ¬£106 and capable of seating 120 persons. Sholing was ideal territory for the predominantly working-class dissenting Primitive Methodists at this time, with its high proportion of labourers. The main local industries were brick making, well digging (with everybody either owning or sharing a well), and strawberry growing. There were six brickyards scattered about the area, their presence revealed at night by the fires glowing in the kilns and clamps. Many inhabitants were in service, went to sea as stokers or stewards, or laboured in the docks, and their wives frequently took in laundry, often working together. Donkeys were a common form of transport for the numerous laundries and for the pedlars who carried out a thriving trade in the district. This gave rise to yet another nickname for the area, 'Donkey Common'! The established church soon followed and the Parish Church of St Mary was consecrated in 1866. It is noteworthy that their first Vicar, the Rev. Francis Davidson, remained in place for the next 48 years. Not to be outdone, the Primitive Methodists' growing popularity was demonstrated by the building of an impressive new Chapel in nearby South-East Road in 1876. It soon became known as 'Green's Chapel', George Green being the most dynamic and forceful leading member of their congregation. The only known education in the area at that time was in a National School, Sholing Common, on the site of what is now the Salvation Army Hall, North-East Road, with children of all ages crowded into one classroom. However, this improved when the National School for Girls and Infants was built in 1871, Sholing having increased to 1,444 inhabitants. It was directly opposite Sholing Church, in what was then Church Road, now St Monica Road. New buildings for 219 boys were also constructed in 1885 in Middle Road, and Sholing Infants School was built nearby in 1911. The following year the girls and infants of St Monica Road School exchanged premises with the boys of Middle Road and St Monica became a Boys School. Following a number of temporary changes during the Second World War, a new Junior School was built in St Monica Road in 1977 and the original building reverted to an Infants School. Twentieth Century Around the start of the 20th century Sholing was surrounded by five toll gates, the Floating Bridge; Northam Bridge; Lances Hill, Hedge End and Bursledon Bridge. The only toll free exit meant a journey through Bitterne via Mousehole to the free Cobden Bridge and this tended to make Sholing a rather isolated community. However, in 1898 the Parishes of St Mary Extra, Sholing and Hound were formed into Itchen Urban District, and this in turn was absorbed into the County Borough of Southampton in 1920, together with Bitterne and other areas east of the Itchen. The combined population of Bitterne and Sholing was then just under 10,000. This meant profound changes to the nature of all these areas, transforming their deeply entrenched rural attitudes. A small railway station had been provided at the junction of Station Road and Cranbury Road in August 1866, with a single line, doubled in 1910 and with longer platforms. This proved to be of great value to the many local strawberry growers, market gardeners and brick makers and helped the area to prosper. Further business opportunities were created, such as Mr Darley's basket works in Spring Road, opposite Cranbury Road. This employed as many as fifty young women making baskets for the local fruit growers. The railway line ran from Southampton to Fareham and on to Portsmouth, and this greatly improved their trading opportunities. Sholing Station has been unstaffed since 1965 and in 1990 the old vandalised buildings were demolished and replaced by a waiting shelter. Sholing did not suffer extensive damage during World War Two, although a number of houses were struck and a train standing between Sholing and Woolston received a direct hit, causing nine casualties. It was also the recipient of Southampton's first flying bomb, above the top of North East Road on 12 July 1944, although there were no fatal casualties. Extensive post war council development was carried out, arising out of the urgent need to house the hundreds made homeless when large areas of the town were devastated during the many heavy 'blitzes'. Council estates were developed between North East and Kathleen Roads and between Butts Road and Botley Road, transforming the former gravel pits, brickyards and market gardens into widespread residential areas. Building a new Sholing Girls School in Middle Road started in 1938, but because of wartime problems in obtaining building materials, and the evacuation of pupils, it was not taken into use until July 1945. During the war the girls were temporarily based in the nearby Merry Oak Boys School, built in 1935, as well as in St Monica Road Boys School. Sholing Girls School completed its transition to a specialist College of Technology with an official ceremony in May 2003. This school is in the vanguard of advanced information technology, with sophisticated computer networking, wireless computers, laptops, video conferencing and interactive whiteboards. Middle Road is also home to Itchen College, which started life in 1906 as a Pupil Teacher's Centre in Woolston. It later became Itchen Co-educational Secondary School and the transfer of the main body of the school to temporary huts on this Middle Road site took place in 1921, with the remainder using Station Road Elementary School. The foundation stone for the present building was laid in December 1925 but many factors, including a major fire, meant that it was not fully completed until 1938. During the Second World War many pupils were evacuated to combine with Andover Grammar School and the school buildings were used as an ARP Post, and Casualty Station with Medical Services. In June 1940 French troops who escaped from Dunkirk were given tea and sandwiches by the WVS from the window of the Domestic Science room, but a British Restaurant was later established in the school dining hall. The school became Itchen Grammar School in September 1946 and it is now known simply as Itchen College. In 1961 the scenic area of Miller's Pond, in the southwest corner of Sholing, was scheduled for largescale development. The plans incorporated seven hundred houses, a new school, library and a shopping centre, but although the pond was culverted in 1965 the plans never came to fruition. It is now home to the Sholing Valley Study Centre, a voluntary environmental group with an interest in the local wildlife. The area was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in 2011 and now actively managed by the Study Centre. There are various convenience stores and retail outlets in Sholing including Tesco Express, a Co-operative Food and the video library/gaming store Sholing Video, as well as various take-away restaurants. Sport and leisure Sholing F.C. have been the local football team since 1894. Formerly known as Thornycrofts (Woolston) FC and from 1960 as Vosper Thornycroft FC (VTFC), the side changed their name to Sholing FC in 2010. Their nickname is The Boatmen. In popular culture Below is an excerpt from James Brown's book The Illustrated History of Southampton's Suburbs :Traces of its original rural nature have been retained through the network of Greenways established by the City Council since 1983. The three and a half-mile long Shoreburs Greenway, from Weston Shore to Bursledon Road, runs through Sholing, with two routes linking at Miller's Pond, now a local nature reserve and managed by a local community group. One runs between Middle Road and North-east Road, and the other between Kathleen Road and Butts Road. They are 'ribbons of open space which follow stream valleys' and preserve wildlife habitats. Sholing is fortunate to have these reminders of its rural past and long may they be retained. Historic Dates c. 6000 BC: Ice Age ends.

ABC-CLIO Hola Mohalla is a big festive event for Sikhs around the world. The fair held during Holi and Hola at Anandpur Sahib is traditionally a three-day event but participants attend Anandpur Sahib for a week, camping out and enjoying various displays of fighting prowess and bravery, and listening to kirtan, music and poetry.

The event concludes on the day of Hola Mohalla with a long, \\"military-style\\" procession near Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib, one of the five seats of temporal authority of the Sikhs.  Etymology  A young practitioner with chakari Bhai Kahan Singh, who compiled the Mahan Kosh (the first Sikh encyclopedia) at the turn of the 20th century, explained, \\"Hola is derived from the word halla (a military charge) and the term mohalla stands for an organized procession or an army column. The words 'Hola Mohalla' would thus mean 'the charge of an army.' \\" Dr. M.S. Ahluwalia notes that the related Punjabi term mahalia (which was derived from the root hal, meaning to alight or descend) refers to \\"an organized procession in the form of an army column accompanied by war drums and standard-bearers, and proceeding to a given location or moving in state from one to another.\\" Hola is a Sanskrit word meant to be distinguished from Holi, the Hindu spring festival of colors (Holi) which takes place the day before Hola Mohalla.  History  Hola Mohalla festival and sports, Anandpur Sahib Punjab India Hola Mohalla builds upon the Spring festival of Holi. The Guru Granth Sahib contains passages prescribing the celebration of Holi by serving God.Talib, Gurbachan Singh (1991) Sri Guru Granth Sahib in English Translation, Volume 4. Punjabi University The colours of Holi manifest in the Lord's love. As Holi starts with Holika Dahan on the full moon night of Phagan or Phalgan, the festival of Holi is referred to as the festival of Phalgun even though the actual day of Holi falls on the first day of the lunar month of Chett. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji built upon this method of celebrating Holi by adding a martial element and creating Hola Mohalla to be celebrated a day after Holi. The festival also has roots in the story of the child bhagat, Prahlad who would not accept his father, Harnakash, as god. According to Gandhi (2007), \\"in order to please her brother, Holka planned to burn Prahlad. She took him in her lap, sat in the midst of a heap of easily combustible straw\\".Gandhi, Surjit Singh (2007) History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1606-1708 C.E.

However, Guru Gobind Singh (1666‚Äì1708) held the first march at Anandpur on Chet vadi 1, 1757 Bk (22 February 1701) and therefore festivities start before the second of Chet. In Anandpur Sahib, the festival lasts for three days. The Guru made Hola Mahalla an occasion for the Sikhs to demonstrate their martial skills in simulated battles. This was probably done to forestall a grimmer struggle against the imperial power and channeling people's energy into a more useful activity. Hola Mahalla became an annual event held in an open ground near Holgarh, a fort across the rivulet Charan Ganga, northwest of Anandpur sahib. The popularity of this festival may be judged from the fact that out of five Sikh public holidays requested by the Khalsa Diwan, of Lahore in 1889, the Government approved only two - Hola Mahalla and the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. Hola Mahalla is presently the biggest festival at Anandpur.  Anandpur Sahib  Anandpur Sahib (lit. City of Bliss) is situated on one of the lower spurs of the Shiwalik Hills in Ropar District of Punjab and is well connected with the rest of the country both by road and rail. It lies 31 km north of Rupnagar (Ropar) and 29 km south of Nangal Township. Being one of the supremely important historical centers of the Sikhs it has been reverently called Anandpur Sahib. It was here at Anandpur that on Baisakhi of 1699, Guru Gobind Singh inaugurated the Khalsa and the Panj Piare (the five beloved ones); hence inaugurating the order of Saint-Soldiers who pledged their dedication to defend the needy, poor and oppressed and their respective social, economic and political rights. This was a tradition of one of the world's greatest martyrs Guru Tegh Bahadur (the 9th Guru) who laid down his life in the defense of the Hindus on behalf of the Pandits of Kashmir. The order of the Khalsa, at the wish of Guru Gobind Singh's would henceforth be distinguished by five symbols (a uniform of 5Ks), viz.

Chapin's father, Roy D. Chapin Sr., was one of the co-founders of the Hudson Motor Car Company; Hudson later merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in 1954 to form American Motors. Roy D. Chapin Jr. was instrumental in introducing many successful lines of cars by American Motors that included the Gremlin, Hornet, and Javelin, as well as the purchase of Kaiser Jeep by the automaker. Early life Roy D. Chapin Jr. graduated from the Los Alamos Ranch School in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut in 1933, and received his degree in Business Administration with honors from Yale University in 1937. At Yale, he was advertising manager of campus humor magazine The Yale Record (Walter J. Cummings Jr. and James S. Copley served with him on the business staff). He began his automotive career as salesman, test driver, and experimental engineer for Hudson in 1938. Career Chapin joined American Motors in 1954 when the corporation was formed with the merger of Nash and Hudson. Later, he served as an assistant treasurer and a director at AMC. By 1964, he held the post of executive vice president in charge of international operations of AMC. Robert B. Evans, chairman of AMC, recognized the talents of Chapin and promoted him from an executive vice president to take his place as chairman of the board. The move was to increase the firm's operational efficiency at the start of a difficult time. The \\"dynamic and intelligent\\" Chapin was appointed to fill the CEO position at AMC following the departure of Roy Abernethy in 1967, along with William Luneburg as president. Chapin realized he was taking over at a crucial time; The Wall Street Journal described it as \\"a dying company.\\" At the time, Chapin said, \\"We're going to have to show ingenuity.\\" He reflected later that the most difficult period was \\"... when our president, Bill Luneburg, and I took over. We were out of money and we had to do something to overcome the immediate problems. We had no time to think about long-range problems. Obviously, we managed to solve immediate considerations...\\" At the time Chapin took control of the company, AMC's share of U.S. auto sales slipped, from 6.4% in 1960 to a mere 3.2 percent. On top of the loss of US$12.6 million in fiscal 1966, Chapin and new president William V. Luneburg had more bad news for the annual meeting of shareholders by reporting a 10% sales drop from a year earlier (to $257 million) and the company lost another $8,459,917 (US$ in dollars) in the first quarter of its 1967 fiscal year. The company skipped paying a dividend for the sixth straight quarter, and to control the inventory of unsold cars, AMC closed its factories for ten working days‚Äîthe second such shutdown in two months. For the entire year AMC \\"lost an astounding $75.8 million\\". During an era when relationships were vital to securing corporate financing, Chapin \\"was a well-known industrialist who inspired great confidence among the leading financiers of his day\\" to help keep the automaker going. In just a few weeks in his new post at AMC, Chapin decided to focus on the smallest (and at that time, the least popular) AMC model‚Äîthe compact Rambler American. His objective was to double Rambler sales to 140,000 cars in 1967 and recapture at least 10% of the compact market that AMC once dominated. He saw a gap between U.S. cars and the inexpensive imports (primarily the Volkswagen Beetle) and positioned the Rambler right into the center of this gap with a new, low price tag to make its total value superior to the imports, as well as superior in both price and range of choice to U.S. compacts. He instituted many changes that lowered production costs and provided the car buyers with more value. Chapin cut the suggested retail price of the basic two-door Rambler American sedan to $1,839 (US$ in dollars), which was $278 less than its closest U.S. competitor, the $2,117 Plymouth Valiant. This move made the considerably larger and more powerful American only $200 more than the rudimentary Volkswagen. By forgoing the annual styling changeovers that were expected among the domestic firms, AMC could save retooling costs and keep the car's price so low. Helping AMC was the strategic decisions by the competing automakers not to match the price drop. Within a month of taking their positions, Chapin and Luneburg reversed the automaker's upholding ban on racing that was instituted by the Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) in 1957. American Motors began race car sponsorship and focused on developing new muscle cars models for consumers looking for performance. In addition to slashing prices and sponsoring Ramblers in racing to help build a performance image, Chapin was optimistic because the company had cut costs by $27 million a year, hired new executives, and had significant products in the pipeline, including new youth-oriented models. Chapin appeared in print advertisements where he was interviewed by John Bond, publisher of Road & Track and Car Life about product and corporate strategy to assure the success of AMC. Chapin continued making changes for the 1968 model year, and took the bold step to make air conditioning standard on all the Ambassador models at a time when this comfort feature was still an option on the expensive Cadillac and Lincoln brand luxury vehicles. After the disastrous 1967 results, the company's retail sales increased 13% during fiscal-year 1968. Other changes during included new marketing campaigns with Guy Hadsall Jr. reporting directly to Chapin. These included dropping the road shows for introduction of new models in favor of closed circuit TV, as well as \\"dynamic meetings\\" by holding the first automobile sales events in the sky using chartered flights to \\"mystery\\" destinations.Hadsall Jr., pp. 29-33. The automaker's new advertising agency Wells, Rich, and Greene that was headed by Mary Wells Lawrence was also \\"innovative and daring in its approach.\\" Print and TV advertisements broke with the traditional convention of not attacking the competition, with AMC cars appearing side by side with competing makes. The launch of the two-seat AMC AMX sports car was through a marketing agreement with Playboy.Hadsall Jr., pp.33‚Äì34. The 1970 AMC Hornet was launched under Chapin's leadership as a value compact to compete against the \\"import tide\\". Chapin worked with Ivan Vassall Sr., who in 1969 established the first black-owned auto dealership in Philadelphia. Chapin was a promoter of innovation at AMC. In 1967, he announced a joint venture with Gulton Industries for development of an electric automobile. A three-passenger commuter, the Amitron was an experimental design shown to the public. While at the head of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the acquisition of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: \\"Perhaps the easiest decision I ever made was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and the first thing I did when I became chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million...\\" American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG. Chapin was also interested in the Wankel engine and stated \\"that the rotary engine will play an important role as a powerplant for cars and trucks of the future.\\" An agreement was signed with Curtiss-Wright in February 1973, for AMC to build Wankels for both passenger cars and Jeeps, as well as the right to sell any rotary engines it produces to other companies. American Motors designed the unique AMC Pacer around the engine, but the production cars used AMC's conventional piston engines. Chapin established a \\"philosophy of difference\\" although vaguely defined, \\"it has meant that AMC sought niches in the auto market where the Big Three were unwilling or unable to move quickly.\\" In 1977, on the 75th anniversary of the \\"birth\\" of two organizations, American Motors and Popular Mechanics, Chapin described AMC's \\"corporate philosophy of difference, under which we strive to offer the American motoring public a wider choice\\" and stated that \\"the most significant change we can look to will be the development of alternate sources of power to replace our dependence on fossil fuels.\\" Chapin was also instrumental in developing collaboration between American Motors and Renault. He was also in favor of Renault investing in AMC, but was distressed by the company's sale to Chrysler. Retirement Chapin gave up the CEO title in late 1977, but stayed as chairman until he retired, in October 1978, to his ranch in California. He summed up his career in an interview given upon his retirement: \\"I love the business and never really considered doing anything else.\\" He remained on AMC's board of directors until 1987, when Chrysler acquired the company. Chapin served on the board of directors of other companies, including Whirlpool Corporation, American Natural Resources (an energy company engaged in natural gas transmission and storage), Coastal Corporation, and Gould Corporation. He was an avid outdoor enthusiast and his hobbies included hunting, fishing, and ranching, as well as book collecting. He was also involved in the area of conservation and served on the boards of organizations that included the Atlantic Salmon Federation, Ducks Unlimited, and Trout Unlimited. Roy Chapin died of heart failure on Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts, at the age of 85. His son, William R. Chapin, was named president of the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2010.  Legacy  Chapin was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1984. Although much smaller than the domestic \\"Big Three\\" automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler), AMC prospered during the early years when Chapin was in charge, as sales of its compact cars benefited from rising energy prices and the company's international expanded. Chapin was also known for his persuasion powers with the automaker's investment banks and his Wall Street contacts; winning concessions on many occasions that helped AMC remain afloat. His efforts to integrate Jeep into AMC contributed to the popularity, from the early 1970s onward, of the sports utility vehicle (SUV) market. The ownership of the Jeep brand was crucial to the company's survival until 1987 and Chapin's \\"legacy was what kept American Motors together instead of being sold off as factories and other pieces\\" according to Robert Casey, transportation curator at the Henry Ford Museum. To summarize his life, Chapin was considered a true 'gentleman' who grew up in the auto industry and was knowledgeable, warm, and accessible; in short, a patrician with a common touch.

The frog is normally found on the ground of tropical rain forests, among fallen limbs or leaf litter. Description The harlequin poison frog has a variety of color morphs, which differ from one valley to the next in its native range.http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Dendrobates_histrionicus.html The base color is a bright orange, with a webbing of black over the entire body. Of the color morphs, the base color may be of clear to dull orange, yellow, red, white, or blue. The web pattern varies from small lines to big lines or speckled, incomplete lines, or a completely black frog with just a few spots. The various color morphs can be found in surprisingly close proximity, with different populations on adjacent hillsides. Life history The harlequin poison frog lives on the forest floor. The male calls from a low perch to advertise his presence and the female lays eggs among the leaf litter. When the eggs hatch, a parent transports the newly hatched tadpoles to a tiny water reservoir (often in the axil of a bromeliad). The mother returns periodically and lays unfertilized eggs, on which the tadpoles feed until ready to metamorphose and exit the water. The larva is an obligate egg-feeder and will starve without this form of nutrition.Feeding from ants and mites on the ground is popular after sunrise and not later than 16:00, when people are either on the ground or elevated on fallen logs finding refugee under leaf litter.Posso, Terranova, Andr√©s, and Jose Andr√©s. ‚ÄúMultivariate Species Boundaries and Conservation of Harlequin Poison Frogs.‚Äù Molecular Ecology, vol. 27, no. 17, Sept. 2018, pp. 3432‚Äì3451.

EBSCOhost, doi:10.1111/mec.14803. This rearing behavior makes harlequins among the most difficult poison dart frogs to raise in captivity. As a result, they are not widely found on the domestic pet market, and those available may be illegally smuggled imports rather than legally bred domestic animals. Wild-caught dart frogs are often stressed, require more care, have a much higher fatality rate, and may also be toxic and dangerous to handle. A few domestically bred animals are nevertheless available and are highly sought-after in the pet trade.  Poison  O. histrionica, along with O. speciosa, produces cardiotoxins known as histrionicotoxins. These moderate to highly toxic compounds act as potent noncompetitive antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, binding to a regulatory site on the delta subunit of the ion channel complex. They also have some affinity for sodium and potassium channels, although they are much less potent for these targets. The synthesis of histrionicotoxins and various homologues is synthetically challenging and has been the subject of many different attempts. Status The IUCN has listed this species as being \\"Critically Endangered\\". There is ongoing destruction of its rainforest habitat and its numbers seem to be declining.

Straus in 1979, is the \\"most widely used instrument in research on family violence.\\" There are two versions of the CTS; the CTS2 (an expanded and modified version of the original CTS) and the CTSPC (CTS Parent-Child). As of 2005, the CTS has been used in about 600 peer reviewed scientific or scholarly papers, including longitudinal birth-cohort studies. National surveys conducted in the USA include two National Family Violence Surveys (1975 and 1985), the National Violence Against Women Survey (1998), which, according to Straus, used a \\"feminist version\\" of the CTS in order to minimize data on female perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), and the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. A major international survey to use the CTS was the 2006 International Dating Violence Study, which investigated IPV amongst 13,601 college students across thirty-two different countries. In a 2005 article in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, Jennifer Langhinrichsen- Rohling listed the CTS amongst the most important advances in the field of IPV research, stating it \\"was revolutionary because it allowed researchers to quantitatively study events that had often been ignored culturally and typically took place in private.\\" However, the CTS is one of the most widely criticized domestic violence measurement instruments due to its exclusion of context variables and motivational factors in understanding acts of violence. The National Institute of Justice cautions that the CTS may not be appropriate for IPV research \\"because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict tactics.\\" Structure The scales are based on the premise that conflict is an inevitable aspect of all human association, but that the use of coercion (including force and violence) as a conflict- resolution tactic is harmful. The CTS focuses on \\"conflict tactics\\" ‚Äì the method used to advance one's own interest within a conflict ‚Äì as a behavior, and measures the conflict tactic behaviors of both the respondent and their partner/primary caregiver. However, the CTS \\"deliberately excludes attitudes, emotions, and cognitive appraisal of the behaviors\\" measured. This is because many victims of IPV do not see themselves as suffering abuse, and as such, their cognitive appraisal of their situation can affect the measurements of the CTS. Straus explains that the \\"discrepancy between the behavior and the cognitive appraisal of the behavior is important for understanding family violence and for designing programs of prevention and treatment. However, it is possible to identify the discrepancy only if there is an instrument such as the CTS which obtains the behavioral data.\\" A CTS-based study would ideally include data from respondents and their partners/primary caregivers in order to investigate the degree of symmetry or asymmetry between their responses. The CTS can be administered through an in-person interview, telephone interview, self-administered questionnaire, and/or computer-administered questionnaire. Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2) The revised CTS2 measures a total of 39 behaviors. Each of these behaviors, or \\"items\\", is divided into five categories: \\"Negotiation\\", \\"Psychological Aggression\\", \\"Physical Assault\\", \\"Sexual Coercion\\" and \\"Injury.\\" Each of the five categories is then further subdivided into two subscales: \\"Negotiation\\" is subdivided into \\"Cognitive\\" and \\"Emotional\\", while the other four categories are subdivided into \\"Minor\\" and \\"Severe.\\" There are six items in \\"Negotiation\\", eight in \\"Psychological Aggression,\\" twelve in \\"Physical Assault,\\" seven in \\"Sexual Coercion,\\" and six in \\"Injury.\\" Examples from each category include: * Negotiation: \\"I showed I cared about my partner even though we disagreed\\" (emotional); \\"Suggested a compromise to a disagreement\\" (cognitive). * Psychological Aggression: \\"Shouted or yelled at my partner\\" (minor); \\"Threatened to hit or throw something at my partner\\" (severe). * Physical Assault: \\"Slapped my partner\\" (minor); \\"Kicked my partner\\" (severe) * Sexual Coercion: \\"Insisted on sex when my partner did not want to (but did not use physical force)\\" (minor); \\"Used force (like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon) to make my partner have sex\\" (severe) * Injury: \\"Had a sprain, bruise, or small cut because of a fight with my partner\\" (minor); \\"Needed to see a doctor because of a fight with my partner, but I didn't\\" (severe). CTS2 questions are presented in pairs. The first question in the pair asks respondents to indicate how often they carried out each item, in a range from \\"never\\" to \\"more than 20 times,\\" in the referent period. The second asks how often the partner carried out each item within the same referent period. Default referent periods are usually 12 months, but other spans of time can be used. Subscales measuring the degree of severity of \\"less severe\\" and \\"more severe\\" behaviors are included for all CTS scales, \\"based on the presumed greater harm resulting from acts in the severe subscale.\\" The severity of behaviors can also be measured by analyzing the frequency of the acts and by whether an injury was reported by the respondent. CTSPC The CTSPC (parent-child relationships) has scales to measure: * physical assault (with subscales for corporal punishment and physical abuse), * psychological aggression, * non-violent discipline techniques. The CTSPC also includes supplementary questions on instances of neglect, sexual abuse, and discipline in the past week. Scoring There are many ways to score the CTS. Common scoring methods include: * Prevalence: Results in the percentage of respondents who reported being a victim of or perpetrating an item (or items) one or more times. * Frequency: Results in the number of times an item occurred in the past year. A limitation of this score is that, for general population samples, \\"the distribution is so skewed that the mean is not an appropriate measure of central tendency.\\" However, a sample of known offenders or victims will have a much higher frequency score \\"that can be very useful for measuring the chronicity of maltreatment.\\" * Severity level and mutuality types: The severity level classifies each case into three categories: \\"none\\", \\"minor only\\", or \\"severe\\". The mutuality types classify each case as \\"respondent only\\", \\"partner only\\", or \\"both\\". Straus writes \\"the mutuality types may be particularly useful in couples therapy because over a hundred studies have found that when there is violence, 50 percent or more of the time it is by both partners.\\" Criticism Critics of the CTS argue it is an ineffective tool with which to measure IPV rate because, although it counts the number of acts of violence, it does not provide information about the context in which such acts occur (including the initiation, intention, history, or pattern of violence). Critics say such contexts cannot be divorced from the act itself, and therefore the CTS misrepresents the characteristics of violence between partners. Straus responds to this criticism by stating \\"the idea that the CTS physical assault scale is defective because it does not take into account the context, meaning, causes, and consequences of the violent acts is analogous to declaring a reading ability test invalid because it does not provide data on why a child reads poorly (such as limited exposure to books at home or test anxiety), or for not measuring the harmful effects of reading difficulty (such as low self-esteem or dropping out of school).\\" Michael Kimmel says of this argument, \\"such an analogy is utterly inadequate. It is more akin to a teacher who doesn't look at how far off the spelling mistakes are or whether there is a pattern in the mistakes that might point to a physiological problem like dyslexia or some other learning disability, as compared to academic laziness, and thus leaving the learning problems untouched and misdirecting funds away from towards punitive after-school programs for lazy students.\\" Pdf. Another common criticism is that the CTS carries ideological assumptions about domestic violence, such as the notion that partner violence is the result of an \\"argument\\" rather than an attempt to control one's partner. Furthermore, the CTS asks about frequency only in the past twelve months and fails to detect ongoing systematic patterns of abuse. It also excludes incidents of violence that occur after separation and divorce. Pdf. The CTS also does not measure economic abuse, manipulation involving children, isolation, or intimidation ‚Äì all common measures of violence from a victim-advocacy perspective. Another methodological problem is that interobserver reliability (the likelihood that the two members of the measured dyad respond similarly) is near zero for tested husband and wife couples. That is, the chances of a given couple reporting similar answers about events they both experienced is no greater than chance. On the most severe CTS items, husband-wife agreement is actually below chance: \\"On the item \\"beat up,\\" concordance was nil: although there were respondents of both sexes who claimed to have administered beatings and respondents of both sexes who claimed to have been on the receiving end, there was not a single couple in which one party claimed to have administered and the other to have received such a beating.\\" See also * Child abuse * Domestic violence against men * Feminism and Women's rights * Masculism and Men's rights ReferencesExternal links *Murray A.

The film focuses on themes of romantic despair and shallowness in the decadent upper class during the 1970s, illustrated through a La Ronde-like circle of sexual adventures and failed affairs revolving around a womanizing songwriter, his businessman father, and their associates. Plot Celebrity musician Eric Wood (Richard Baskin) plans to record an album of songs written by Carroll Barber (Carradine), who has been living in England. Carroll's aging manager Susan Moore (Viveca Lindfors) brings Carroll to Los Angeles for the recording sessions, and rents him a house from real estate agent Ann Goode (Sally Kellerman). Ann is unhappily married to furniture store owner Jack Goode (John Considine), who is pursuing their young housemaid, Linda Murray (Sissy Spacek). Linda in turn wants a relationship with her friend Kenneth \\"Ken\\" Hood (Harvey Keitel), a married young executive. Susan expects Carroll to resume a past affair they had, but he rejects her and instead has sex with Ann when she shows him his house. Ann tries unsuccessfully to continue the affair by dropping in on Carroll at home and bringing Linda over to clean. However, Carroll shows himself to be a womanizer, seemingly incapable of connecting with anyone. He visits his wealthy father Carl, whom he has not seen in three years. Carl, with the help of Ken Hood, has built the small Barber family dairy into a major business. Carroll ends up having affairs with receptionist Jeannette (Diahnne Abbott) and his father's photographer mistress Nona (Lauren Hutton). Ken works long hours at the Barber business and neglects his wife, Karen (Geraldine Chaplin), a housewife and mother who is obsessed with taxi rides and the Greta Garbo film Camille. While Carroll is drinking and driving through the city, he randomly meets Karen and is drawn to her. He takes her to his home but when he tries to romance her, she reveals she is married (though not to whom) and departs. She later leaves him her telephone number, but refuses to take his repeated calls. Linda, who has moved into Carroll's spare room, invites Ken to visit her there, where he meets Ann. Just before Christmas, Ken is thrilled to learn that Carl has made him partner in the business, but Karen is not happy that he will be spending even more time at work. On Christmas Eve, Ken gets drunk and calls Ann, but their date ends badly as Ken can't stop thinking of his wife. Meanwhile, Jack and Linda spend the evening together, which also ends badly when Linda asks Jack for money. Jack and Ann, both disappointed, return home and have sex with each other. An angry Susan reveals to Carroll that Eric doesn't like his songs, and that she and Carroll's father bribed Eric to record the album in order to get Carroll to come to Los Angeles. Susan and Carl each hoped to build their separate relationships with Carroll, only to be thwarted by his lack of response. Karen, the only person who seems to have truly piqued Carroll's interest, finally appears at his home, but just as they are about to have sex, Ken telephones, upset and looking for his wife. Upon realizing that Karen is Ken's wife and seems primarily interested in her husband, Carroll leaves while Karen and Ken are reconciling on the phone, just as Linda arrives home. Linda, eavesdropping, hears the voice of Ken, her own crush, on the phone, saying the same things to Karen about relationships that he earlier said to Linda. Linda furtively disconnects the phone, then tries to bond with Karen, who imitates Garbo in Camille. Carroll goes to the recording studio and discovers that Eric Wood has decided not to finish the album.

Until 2018, it was an agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, then during restructuring that merged FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it became a district. According to the 2017 census, the population of the district is 1,093,684. It borders Afghanistan's Kunar Province with a 52 km border. The headquarters of the agency administration is located in the town of Khaar. Geography Bajaur is about long by broad. It lies at a high elevation to the east of the Kunar Valley of Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which it is separated by a continuous line of rugged frontier hills, forming a barrier that is easily passable at one or two points. The old road from Kabul to Pakistan ran through the barrier before the Khyber Pass was adopted as the main route. Nawagai is the chief town of Bajour; the Khan of Nawagai was previously under British protection for the purpose of safeguarding of the Chitral road. To the south of Bajaur District is the wild mountain district of the Mohmand District. To the east, beyond the Panjkora River, are the hills of Swat District, dominated by another Pashtun group. To the north is an intervening watershed between Bajaur and the small tehsil of Dir. It is over this watershed and through the valley of Dir, that the new road from Malakand and the Punjab runs to Chitral. An interesting feature in the topography is a mountain spur from the Kunar range. The drainage of Bajaur flows eastwards, starting from the eastern slopes of the dividing ridge, which overlooks the Kunar and terminating in the Panjkora river, so that the district lies on a slope tilting gradually downwards from the Kunar ridge to the Panjkora. Jandol, one of the northern valleys of Bajour, has ceased to be of political importance since the 19th century, when a previous chief, Umra Khan, failed to appropriate himself Bajour, Dir and a great part of the Kunar valley. It was the active hostility between the amir of Kabul (who claimed sovereignty of the same districts) and Umra Khan that led, firstly to the demarcation agreement of 1893 which fixed the boundary of Afghanistan in Kunar; and, secondly, to the invasion of Chitral by Umra Khan (who was no party to the boundary settlement), and the siege of the Chitral fort in 1895. Subdivision Bajaur district is currently subdivided into seven Tehsils or Sub-divisions # Bar Chamer kand 2\\\\. Barang 3 . Khar 4\\\\. Mamund 5\\\\. Nawagai 6\\\\. Salarzai 7\\\\. Utmankhel Tribes Bajaur is inhabited almost exclusively by Tarkani (Tarkalani) Pashtuns, and there are their main sub-tribes in Bajaur: Utmankhel, Tarkalanri (Mamund, Kakazai, Wur and Salarzai) as well as a small population of Safis. The Utmankhel are at the southeast of Bajaur, while Mamund are at the southwest, and the Tarkani are at the north of Bajaur. Its border with Afghanistan's Kunar province makes it of strategic importance to Pakistan and the region. Gujar are also present.  History and events =Ancient history The area was the site of the ancient Scythian kingdom of Apraca from the 1st century BCE to the 1st century CE, and a stronghold of the Aspasioi, a western branch of the Ashvakas (q.v) of the Sanskrit texts who had earlier offered stubborn resistance to the Macedonian invader Alexander the Great in 326 BCE. The whole region came under Kushan control after the conquests of Kujula Kadphises during the first century CE. Alexander The Great Alexander turned south from Aornus and continued march towards the Indus, but the greatest surprise during the march came when he neared the town of Nysa. The local people and even the flora seem strangely out of place in these mountains. The Nysains placed their dead in Cedar coffin in the tree___some of which Alexander accidentally put on fire___ and made wines from the grapes unlike other tribes in the area. The Acuphis, the chief man of the city, who has been sent to them along with other thirty leaders, begged him not to harm their towns as they were descendent of settlers that the god Dionysus placed their generation before. Their prolific ivy, a plant sacred to Dionysus that nowhere else in the mountain, was proof they were the people blessed by god. Then they were only commanded to give him 300 cavalry, after which he restored their freedom and allow them to live under their own laws, having made acuphis governor of the city. Alexander took his son and grandson as hostages. He sacrificed there to Bacchus under this god‚Äôs others name of Dionysus. Bajaur Casket The Bajaur casket, also called the Indravarma reliquary, year 63, or sometimes referred to as the Avaca inscription, is an ancient reliquary from the area of Bajaur in ancient Gandhara, in the present- day Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. It is dated to around 5-6 CE. It proves the involvement of the Scythian kings of the Apraca, in particular King Indravarman, in Buddhism. The casket is made of schist. Babur's attack on Bajaur In 1518, Babur had invested and conquered the fortress of Bajaur, The Gabar-Kot from Sultan Mir Haider Ali Gabari the Jahangirian Sultan and gone on to conquer Bhera on the river Jhelum, a little beyond the salt ranges. Babur claimed these areas as his own, because they had been part of Taimur's empire. Hence, \\"picturing as our own the countries once occupied by the Turks\\", he ordered that \\"there was to be no overrunning or plundering [of the countryside]\\". It may be noted that this applied to areas which did not offer resistance, because earlier, at Bajaur, where the Pashtun tribesmen had resisted, he had ordered a general massacare, with their women and children being made captive. Babur justifies this massacre by saying, \\"the Bajauris were rebels and at enmity with the people of Islam, and as, by heathenish and hostile customs prevailing in their midst, the very name of Islam was rooted out...\\". As the Bajauris were rebels and inimical to the people of Islam, the men were subjected to a general massacre and their wives and children were made captive. At a guess, more than 3,000 men met their death. We entered the fort and inspected it. On the walls, in houses, streets and alleys, the dead lay, in what numbers! Those walking around had to jump over the corpses. Recent decades During the Soviet invasion in the 1980s, the area was a critical staging ground for Afghan and local mujahideen to organise and conduct raids. It still hosts a large population of Afghan refugees sympathetic to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a mujahideen leader ideologically close to the Arab militants. Today, the United States believes militants based in Bajaur launch frequent attacks on American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan.} In 2001 to 2007, a person named Marvan was in a truck (Datsun), in Loi sum checkpoint, they inquired of him that who is he? On that, he jumped from the truck, run away and started firing. The militants were trying to capture him, after 5‚Äì6 miles running, firing, they encountered him. Local people were saying that a great Mujahid was martyred, fragrant smell was coming from his blood. After his death, a breakout of Talibanization occurred. then the government were shifted from military to Taliban in this area. this change was slowly and gradually, Taliban target the checkpoints, firstly from peripheral areas and then in central areas. Then they targeted the schools, government servants, retired soldiers, all those people who had some relation with government. They made their own rules, Like no one will shave, wearing caps etc. An aerial attack, executed by the United States targeting Ayman al- Zawahiri, took place in a village in Bajaur Agency on January 13, 2006, killing 18 people. Al-Zawahiri was not found among the dead and the incident led to severe outrage in the area. On October 30, 2006, 80 people were killed in Bajaur when Pakistani forces attacked a religious school they said was being used as a militant training camp. There are many unconfirmed reports that the October attack was also carried out by the United States or NATO forces, but was claimed by Islamabad over fears of widespread protest similar to those after the US bombing in January 2006. Maulana Liaqat, the head of the seminary, was killed in the attack. Liaqat was a senior leader of the pro- Taliban movement Tanzim Nifaz Shariat Mohammadi (TNSM), that spearheaded a violent Islamic movement in Bajaur and the neighbouring Malakand areas in 1994. The TNSM had led some 5,000 men from the Pakistani areas of Dir, Swat and Bajaur across the Mamond border into Afghanistan in October 2001, to fight US-led troops. In what is thought to be a reprisal for the October strike in Bajaur, in November, a suicide bomber killed dozens in an attack on an army training school in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Loi sum is on a strategic location, road come from four sides, (khar, Nawagi, Tangai and Inzari), so approach was easy from Charmang and Ambar. That was the reason that this area was affected mostly. A military offensive by the military of Pakistan (FC and Leaves) was launched in early 8 August 2008 to retake the border crossing near the town of Loi-Sum, 12 km from khar from militants loyal to Tehrik-e-Taliban, the so- called Pakistani Taliban. In the two weeks following the initial battle, government forces pulled back to Khar and initiated aerial bombing and artillery barrages on presumed militant positions, which reportedly has all but depopulated Bajaur and parts of neighbouring Mohmand Agency, with an estimated 300,000 fleeing their homes. The estimate of casualties ran into the hundreds. The offensive was launched in the wake of Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's visit to Washington in late July, and is believed by some to be in response to U.S. demands that Pakistan prevent the FATA being used as a safe haven by insurgents fighting American and NATO troops in Afghanistan. However, the offensive was decided by the military, not the civilian government. The bloody bombing of Pakistan Ordnance Factories in Wah on August 21, 2008, came according to Maulvi Omar, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, as a response to the Bajaur offensive. after a few weeks, the Pak army came to battlefield. In an initial way toward the Loi sum Taliban did not resist and let them to come to middle position, when they reach to Rashakai, ( 3-4 km from Loi sum) Talaiban started to attack them but the Army was far stronger than their expectation. For several weeks they stayed in Rashakai, then 1st attempt Army come to loi sum, stay for whole day and come back to Rashakai, In 2nd attempt was the same, and 3rd attempt they come to loi sum and took the control of the area. Army continues there journey, control the main road of Bajaur from Khar to Nawagi, and the peripheral areas were still in the hold of Taliban. After nine months of vigorous clashes between government security forces and Taliban, military forces have finally claimed to have forced militants out of Bajaur Agency, and advanced towards strongholds of Taliban in the region. According to figures provided by the Government of Pakistan, 1,600 militants were killed and more than 2,000 injured, while some 150 civilians also died and about 2,000 were injured in the fighting. The military operation forced more than 300,000 people to flee their homes and take shelter in IDP camps in settled districts of the province. To date, more than 180,000 IDPs have returned to their homes in Bajaur Agency, facing widespread destruction to their lives, livelihoods and massive unemployment. Now there were main issues to peripheral area, this situation occurred especially in Inzari and Ghwandu. In the middle of Loi sum and Inzari a checkpoint was made in KhatiKhwar, which was exposed from every side, and easily approachable because from every side there's a great (Kayia). There was not a single day they were not attached, but the checkpoint was made in best way, according to captains, ‚Äúwe made this checkpoint in a way that even a super power country can‚Äôt push us backward from this point‚Äù In August, 2012, the Pakistani Army de-notified Bajaur as conflict zone. EducationHealthTourism  Bajaur is located near swat and District Dir, so the climates of these districts are comparatively same. Koh-i-Mor Koh-i-Mor is the highest peak in Bajaur. It is also called three peak mountain. Its top is covered with white sheet of snow about 5-7 months of the year and clouds touching its head. The peak of Koh-i-Mor is visible from the Peshawar valley when there is no clouds. It was here, at the foot of the mountain, that Alexander the Great founded the ancient city of Nysa and the Nysaean colony, traditionally said to have been founded by Dionysus. The Koh-i-Mor has been identified as the Meros of Arrian's history‚Äîthe three-peaked mountain from which the god issued You can climb to top by three ways; 1. Khar side 2. Barang side 3. Ambar side. On each way there is roads to less than midpoint. On Khar Side; It is situated in North Khar about 17 km on road drive. 7 km to base and 10km base to Tower (TV tower is present) Trekking From the tower to peak of khoh-i-mor is about 6 to 7 km trekking of about 5‚Äì6 hrs, the way is tough and narrow, but the scenery is changing after half a mile, 1st the track is less steep and slowly the steepness increases as you go up then there is a broad head about a mile, here Muddy lake made by locals for storage of rain water, and again the steepest like bottleneck and then the summit point. People are living in koh-i-mor up- to the bottleneck. These people have simple houses with only a single room, there is no extra boundary wall. Rooms are made like caves in mountain. Majority of them are formers and shepherds. Chenarran (platane Orientalis) At the base of Koh-i-Mor a lot of chenar trees along with spring. Locals people are coming here and enjoy the nature, making their own cooking, some have load speakers, music, etc. majority people come along with their families. Gabar Chenna It is situated in Tehsil Salarzai, it is snowy like water, people are come from all over the Bajaur and DIR to enjoy it especially in Ramadan and Eids. It is a historically spring, once here was a undefeated king .... Charmang Hill Like koh-i-Mor the charmang hills are reach of forest and beauty.

Economy=Agriculture Bajaur is a semi-independent in agriculture field, The soil is fertile but the no proper irrigation system. Harvest Crops; People grow wheat, maze and rices in some areas. All the crops is mainly dependent on rain. Vegetable and Fruits; The different types of vegetables are growing in Bajaur. Potato, tomato, onion, lady fingers, spinach, and orange parsimon, etc Marble Marbles are found in various regions, mainly in Inzari and Nawagai. There are different types of marble supper white, Badle etc. In the local areas are marble factories, cut to into different sizes of the base of demand, and supply to all over the country and even abroad. Marble factory The marble cutting factories are found in Shaikh kali and Umary. The supply to the factories of marble mainly from the local mountains and they also bring the marble from ambar and Zairat.

They are approximately 217 light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major. Both stars orbit each other at an average distance of 1,200 astronomical units. The binary system is listed as Œ£1341 in the Struve Catalogue of Double Stars, however this designation is not in wide use and the system is usually referred to by the HD designations of its constituent stars. An extrasolar planet has been confirmed to orbit HD 80606 in a highly elliptical orbit. Planetary system The orbital motion of HD 80606 b. The variable radial velocity of HD 80606 was first noticed in 1999 from observations with the 10-m Keck 1 telescope at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii by the G-Dwarf Planet Search, a survey of nearly 1000 nearby G dwarfs to identify extrasolar planet candidates. The star was then followed up by the Geneva Extrasolar Planet Search team using the ELODIE spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Haute-Provence Observatory. The discovery of HD 80606 b was announced on April 4, 2001. Its orbit is misaligned with the star's rotation at 53 degrees. Additional studies using the Spitzer Space Telescope in the infrared, and the Very Large Array in the millimeter radio, have shown that the highly eccentric planet 'b' orbiting HD 80606 grazes the parent star at its closest passage to produce difficult-to-detect stellar lobing, severe 'space weather', aurorae and other non-thermal activity. At the time, its orbit was the most eccentric orbit of any extrasolar planet known.Since then, HD 20782 b has been found, with an eccentricity of 0.97. It has an eccentricity of 0.9336, comparable to that of Comet Halley in the Solar System. The eccentricity may be a result of the Kozai mechanism, which would occur if the planet's orbit is significantly inclined to that of the binary stars. This conclusion is reinforced by the detection of the misalignment, an expected result of the Kozai mechanism. In a simulation of a 10 million year span, the planet \\"sweeps clean\\" most test particles within 1.75 AU of HD 80606. The 8:1 resonance hollows out another Kirkwood gap at 1.9 AU. There cannot be any habitable planets in this system. Also, observation has ruled out planets heavier than 0.7 Jupiter mass with a period of one year or less.

This species has also been introduced to Hawaii. It is one of the most variable of all poison dart frogs next to Dendrobates tinctorius and some Oophaga spp. It is considered to be of least concern from a conservation standpoint by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Description The green-and-black poison dart frog has the typical appearance of the members of its family. Males average , while females are slightly larger, averaging an inch or longer. The green-and-black poison frog typically has mint-green coloration; however, this pigment can also be forest, lime, emerald green, turquoise, or even cobalt blue or pale yellow. Mixed with this typically green are splotches of dark color, ranging from wood brown to black. The green-and-black poison dart frog is one of the most variable of all poison frogs in appearance; some have black or brown splotches, others are dappled, or have \\"splashes\\" of black, like Oophaga sylvaticus. Green and black poison dart frog (Dendrobates auratus) in captivity in England Distribution The green-and-black poison dart frog is found in the humid lowlands from southeastern Nicaragua on the Atlantic slope and southeastern Costa Rica on the Pacific coast through Panama to northwestern Colombia (Choc√≥ Department). An introduced populations exist on Oahu; the species was purposefully introduced there in 1932 for mosquito control. Later on, it seems to have also become established on Maui. Poison The green-and-black poison dart frog, while not the most toxic poison dart frog, is still a highly toxic animal. The very small amount of poison the frog possesses is enough to make a human heart stop beating. However, like most poison dart frogs, the green-and-black poison dart frog only releases its poison if it feels threatened, and wild specimens can be handled provided the human holding it is calm and relaxed. The green-and-black poison dart frog, as with all poison dart frogs, loses its toxicity in captivity due to a change in diet. This has led some scientists to believe that the green-and-black poison frog actually takes its poison from the mites and other insects on which it feeds. Behavior The green-and-black poison dart frog is semiarboreal, hunting, courting, and sleeping in the trees. However, as it is a small frog, it cannot jump far enough to span the distances between trees, so it returns to the ground when it wants to travel. To assist in climbing, the frog has small, sucker-like discs on the ends of its toes, which create a slight suction as the frogs climb, making their grip mildly adhesive. Reproduction Unlike all poison dart frogs, green-and- black poison dart frogs gather in large groups before mating. They squabble over territories; eventually, each individual male frog clears a small patch for himself. Females wander among the males, with the latter then attempting to impress the former with their bird-like mating calls. Once a male has caught the attention of a female, he leads her to a site he has selected for egg deposition. The female lays her eggs, which he then fertilizes. In about 14 days, these hatch into tadpoles. Their parents, typically the male, then carry the tadpoles into the canopy, with the tadpoles sticking to the mucus on their parents' backs. The parents then deposit their tadpoles into the small pools of water that accumulate in the center of bromeliads, and guard the tadpoles while they feed on algae and small invertebrates that inhabit the tiny pool. As pets Green-and-black poison dart frogs are popular exotic pets due to their small size, bright colors, and intriguing behavior. As with all frogs, they have permeable skin and should not be handled.

On the grounds of picture and audio quality, the 703 is widely considered one of the best non-Elite LaserDisc players ever made by Pioneer. It evolved into the CLD-D704, which itself was the basis for the CLD-79 and CLD-99 Elite line of high-end models. Information Pioneer introduced the CLD-D703 to provide a \\"stop gap\\" model to fit in between the CLD-D503, a lower mid-range player, and the more expensive, prior models in their Elite lineup. Although lacking an AC-3 RF output for transmission of Dolby Digital sound, it did include many high-end features including a 51db video signal-to-noise ratio, 116db audio signal-to-noise ratio, quick Gamma-Turn side flip, Digital Field Memory (allowing for freeze frame and slow motion options on CLV discs), One Shot Memory (for displaying a frame as a background), coaxial and TOSLINK audio outputs, adjustable digital noise reduction, digital time base correction, twin 1-bit DLC digital-to-analog converters, and a backlit remote control with jog dial (CU-CLD098). This model is also a combi player, meaning it could also play Compact Disc and CD video via an independent standard CD- sized tray. Photo of playback of Image Entertainment's THX-certified LD of The Terminator (1984) For 1995, Pioneer upgraded the player, adding the AC-3 RF output and rebadging it as the CLD-D704. Other than an AC-3 RF output, the player largely remained the same. However, the 703 can be modified with an aftermarket AC-3 RF circuit for Dolby Digital capability. The optical TOSLINK output provides the 703 with full DTS audio capability with LDs carrying such tracks to any DTS-equipped AV receiver or processor. The unit also possesses excellent, \\"sync-to-play\\" capability with older LDs bearing the LaserVision and DiscoVision label. Pioneer used the CLD-D703/704 hardware for two \\"spin- off\\" Elite lineup players. First was the CLD-79, which was little more than a rebadged CLD-D704 with a high-gloss black \\"urushi\\" finish, different electroluminescent front panel placement, gold-plated RCA jacks, and slightly higher audio signal-to-noise ratio. The second, the CLD-99, was again only a minor evolution; in terms of hardware it was simply a CLD-79 but with an improved 3D comb filter that worked via the S-Video output to increase picture quality. After the discontinuation of this model, the CLD-D704, CLD-79 and 99; Pioneer began abandoning LaserDisc in 1996 with the release of the DVD format set to debut the following year with the brand introducing several less- performance, more-ease of use geared DVD/LD combi players and a few prior, very basic LD models that were all that remained available for the North American consumer base.

It was also located north of the present day Butchertown area. Overview The facade of the Heigold House is being moved from its Fulton Street location to make room for the massive River Park Place condominium project Starting in the 1840s it was home to many upper income residents who had moved from New Orleans, giving the area on Fulton Street the nickname \\"the Frenchmen's Row\\". They built many mansion houses in the area, the best known of which was the Heigold House (completed in 1853), which featured a very detailed facade with the faces of early American leaders engraved on it. It was built by immigrant stonemason Christopher Heigold. In 1854 many houses were demolished when Beargrass Creek was rerouted from its original outflow near 4th St. in downtown Louisville to its current location through the area. Many more houses were torn down after the great Ohio River flood of 1937. It was also the site of The Louisville Municipal Yacht Basin (later Municipal Boat Harbor) built in 1936. Contemporary Louisville leaders of the time wanted the entire area depopulated and replaced with a park called Point Park Project, which was done to the extreme northern part of the area, now called Thruston Park. This remained the preferred urban public park throughout the 1940s and 50s. The park was severely disrupted by the construction of I-64 in the early 1960s and by the 1980s, it was in a neglected and dismal state. The harbor remained until it was closed by the city in 2005. Today the only remaining structures are the decorated front facade of the Heigold House which was moved to its present location from the area of Frankfort Ave. and Paget House, the last remaining of the riverfront mansions along Fulton St. Both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Heigold facade was moved to a roundabout on Frankfort Avenue near River Road, while the fate of the historic Paget House remains uncertain.

The search for their killer was one of the biggest manhunts in South Australian history.  Murders Pete and Sally Bowman with their two daughters Wendy and Marion managed Glen Helen station in the Northern Territory. In November 1957, a family friend named Thomas Whelan (22) travelled north to visit the family while on holiday. The Bowmans agreed to travel with Whelan back to Adelaide via Alice Springs by car. After arriving in Alice Springs on 4 December 1957, Pete and Marion took a plane and flew to Adelaide. The remaining three travelled by car, with two family dogs. They had ¬£85 in cash and were last spotted at Kulgera Homestead near the South Australian border, where the party purchased petrol. They then continued south towards Adelaide, but never arrived. A huge ground search was launched, bosses and workers from nearby properties joining in. Eight days later, the vehicle was spotted by a Royal Australian Air Force aircrew under a clump of trees at the deserted Sundown Station. Reaching the car some hours later, Aboriginal trackers found the bodies. All three victims had been beaten about the head and then shot. The trackers also found the spot were the killer had parked his car. They noted that the car was towing a two-wheel trailer. First reports announced that witnesses had seen a grey Ford Zephyr towing a green trailer travelling north to Alice Springs in the area around the time of the slayings. The car was later sighted east of Tennant Creek. Finke police and trackers played an important part in the murder investigation. The prosecution case is as follows. :Mr. Scarfe said that what really happened might never be known. He suggested, however, that Raymond John Bailey held up the Bowman party at gunpoint and demanded money for petrol for the journey to Mount Isa, 1,000 miles away. Whelan went for his gun and was shot in the back. Bailey then clubbed the women with Whelan's gun (a Remington), put the bodies in the Bowman's Vanguard and drove to the opposite side of the road to hide them. He helped himself to Whelan's wallet before he hid the bodies. \\"Petrol is dear up in that neck of the woods and Bailey's old car and caravan would not be doing more than 10 or 12 miles to the gallon.\\" Mr. Scarfe said.  The accused Raymond John Bailey was born at Gilgandra on 3 December 1932. He had four brothers and a sister. Bailey left school at 14 and got work as a carpenter. He married young and worked for a time as an itinerant worker. He purchased a black 1938 DeSoto in Renmark in September 1957 and took a rifle he had agreed to buy but never paid for in Wirrulla. Bailey was travelling north in the DeSoto car and caravan. Bailey had his wife and young son with him. Bailey had told another traveller on the Alice Springs road that he was heading north looking for work. He was working at Mount Isa Hospital, Mount Isa, Queensland, when the law caught up with him. Bailey was arrested in Mount Isa in January 1958 on charges of false pretences in relation of a motor vehicle and being in possession of an unlicensed weapon. Two days later he was charged with the murder of Thyra Bowman. He was extradited to Adelaide where he stood trial.  Trial The trial took place in Adelaide. David Iles met Bailey when both men worked around Wirrulla, South Australia, in September 1957. Bailey and Iles struck up a friendship and the men went rabbit shooting. Iles later agreed to sell to Bailey his huntsman rifle but Bailey skipped town without paying for it. Iles took Constable Grope to the spot were the men fired the rifle and Grope recovered used cartridge cases. The cartridges later matched cartridges found at the murder scene. Bailey was tried, convicted and executed in Adelaide Gaol. Bailey was hanged on 24 June 1958. His two brothers had visited him the day before.  Stay of execution Bailey managed to get a stay of execution of one week by claiming that he wasn't the trio's killer but he himself killed the real killer in self-defence. The State Cabinet made a decision to test the accuracy of Bailey's new statement. The police flew Bailey back to the scene of the crime to see if Bailey could produce a body. Bailey and a fourteen-man team of police trackers, lawyers and gaol wardens flew to Alice Springs then drove south to the crime scene at Sundown Station. Bailey's story was that on the night of the murders he came across a man removing Mrs Bowman's shoes and after a fight he stabbed the man to death and then buried the man four miles north of where the victims' bodies were found. After a three and a half hour search found no body, Bailey stated, \\"I have nothing more to say.\\" Later investigations Author and investigative journalist Stephen Bishop claims that detective Glen Patrick Hallahan lied on oath and in records of police interviews with Raymond Bailey. Detective Hallahan was one of the three high-ranking Queensland detectives known as the \\"Rat Pack\\" who had been exposed as corrupt by the Fitzgerald Inquiry in the late 1980s. The main points that Bishop advanced included that the murder weapon, which Bailey claimed he had sold to a man near Coober Pedy before the murders, was never found. The description of the murders in Bailey's confession contradicted the post mortem results. Bailey claimed to have shot all three of the victims as they ran from him; however, the autopsies indicated that the Bowmans and Whelan were shot while lying on the ground unconscious. During his trial, Bailey claimed that he had only signed the confession after hearing his wife crying in another room. Bailey told the court that detectives then told him that they would leave her alone if he signed. A grey Ford Zephyr was seen near the murder scene while Bailey drove a black 1938 DeSoto. Footprints believed to belong to the killer had been found at the murder scene, and were estimated as being a size 7 or 8. Bailey wore a size 5¬Ω shoe. In February 2013, Bishop appealed to the Governor of South Australia, Kevin Scarce, to grant a posthumous pardon for Bailey but was declined.

Their core beliefs are based on the teachings of Jesus with special emphasis on his decree from the Sermon on the Mount, that his followers \\"cannot serve God and money\\" Since disbanding in 2010, the group has operated under many different names. The different bases of the new organisation began experimenting with making YouTube videos as a way of disseminating their message. As early as 2012, a base in South America started a YouTube channel, called Como Vivir Por Fe (\\"How to Live by Faith\\"). A website of the same name appeared around the same time. For several years, Como Vivir Por Fe only made Spanish translations of sermons by American evangelist, Francis Chan.. However, in 2015, the South American base started producing their own material, including a 45-minute documentary about Microchip Implants being the Mark of the Beast. In 2016, \\"disbanded\\" Jesus Christian bases from around the world started to contribute videos to another YouTube channel, called End Time Survivors.. The channel featured anonymous presenters whose faces were digitally altered or concealed with a mask. The only named presenter was ‚ÄúBrother Dave‚Äù . Through this forum, Dave McKay, who had previously only preached through print, began experimenting with delivering online sermons . Non-members were also allowed to post videos , as long as they shared similar views on Bible prophecy. An End Time Survivors website was also created in 2016 . A more successful channel, A Voice in the Desert, was created in October 2016 , by the Australian base . It predominantly featured sermons, accompanied by animated illustrations, on a broad range of Christian topics usually delivered by Dave , but not always . In May 2020, A Voice in the Desert channel had chalked up 104,000 subscribers and over 13 million views .

Some older newspaper articles were reproduced on the group's website, and where these are used below this is noted in the references. Early days The group was started in Melbourne, Australia, by Dave and Cherry McKay when Neville Williams moved in with the Mckay family in early 1981. David Mckay was a former member of the Children of God and left following the revelation of heretical practices such as flirty fishing. The Jesus Christians operated under several different names, including Christians; The Medowie Christian Volunteers; Australian Christian Volunteers, and Voices in the Wilderness. The name 'Jesus Christians' was selected in 1996. (\\"A Change of Name\\", August, 1996)A Change of Name.

The protest was broadcast on national television by Mike Willisee. =Messages with money= In January 1985 the group glued Australian $2 notes to pavements to spell out messages against greed and money outside post offices around Victoria and New South Wales. Christian messages also appeared written on a claimed AUS$100,000 worth of $2 notes in Sydney.

In 1995 the Jesus Christians converted a section of open sewer in Chennai into a children's playground. The real estate created by covering the sewer was estimated to be worth AUD $950,000. After one year the project was handed over to Indian charities to run, however the Indian government eventually demolished the site because it had been built on government land without permission. =Nappy Chappies / Children of God= In April 1997 and 1998 several Jesus Christians were arrested at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney dressed as babies in over-sized nappies while distributing \\"The Baby Books\\", highlighting how Jesus said his followers need to become like children to enter into God's Kingdom. The introduction of the books stated \\"We are children of God\\" which led to confusion about the group being the same as the Children of God group started by David Berg of the same name. This continuing confusion can be seen in a 2013 article which uses a photograph of the \\"Nappy Chappies\\" labelled as the Children of God. =Split= In 1998 there was a split in the community. Craig and Yesamma Hendry and their family, Kevin and Elisabeth McKay, Boyd and Sheri Ellery and their family, Darren and Donna Cooke, Ray Sippel, Josh and Tim left the community in Australia. Boyd wrote to the remaining community \\"The Spirit you are following is not Christ's. We will have no part of your hierarchies and fleshly importance.\\" The remaining community were \\"encouraged to avoid private correspondence or discussions with them...\\" ' =Kyri and Berni Sheridan= In July 1999, 19-year-old Kyri Sheridan joined the Jesus Christians in the UK. His mother reported him missing to the Guildford Police in Surrey. Kyri (accompanied by fellow Jesus Christian Francisco Gonzales) signed in at the Guildford police station to state that he was not actually \\"missing\\". The police confirmed Kyri was happy and making his own decision to be with the Jesus Christians. When his mother held Kyri to stop him from leaving she was pinned down, handcuffed and arrested by the police. 2000-2010 Bobby Kelly (left) caused a British tabloid media frenzy by \\"disappearing\\" with the religious group \\"Jesus Christians\\" in June 2000 as a teenager. 17 years later Bobby poses with friends Roland and Sue Gianstefani who were convicted of contempt for refusing to reveal his whereabouts to a High Court judge. =Bobby Kelly controversy= On 14 July 2000 the group was splashed across the front page of the British tabloid Daily Express, which declared that members Susan and Roland Gianstefani had kidnapped a 16-year-old boy, Bobby Kelly. Bobby had picked up a Jesus Christians cartoon book called The Liberator in Romford High Street, Essex, near the end of June 2000, and gone home to tell his grandmother about the Christian man he met. Bobby went out again that afternoon and returned to tell his grandmother he wanted to join the Jesus Christians. A few days later \\"an Australian couple with their young son, a German and two English men\\" from the group visited and met Bobby's grandmother. In the first two weeks of July while Bobby was with the group, before the scandal had hit the headlines, Bobby visited his youth worker from St. Peters Anglican Church in Harold Wood. He had previously attended that church. The youth worker, David Whitehouse, told the press a week later, \\"The group has a veneer of respectability, but there is something very disturbing about them. When I saw Bobby a week ago, he was with three of them, and he seemed very scared, which was unlike him. Sometime before July 14, anti-cult expert, Graham Baldwin, was reportedly contacted by \\"someone close to the family who suspected that something was wrong, and did something to try to save him.\\" It has not been established that David Whitehouse was the person who contacted him. Baldwin worked for a charity, Catalyst, which helps families of people caught up in groups with whom the family disagrees. A solicitor who \\"specialises in cases against cults\\" was hired after legal aid was acquired and the solicitor succeeded in getting an emergency High Court action to try to \\"rescue the schoolboy\\". The front page newspaper report in The Express was published two weeks after Bobby first met the Jesus Christians with the story that Bobby had \\"disappeared\\" after he met the group: \\"Within hours Bobby had forsaken his possessions and moved in with the group. The police were called and the airports and docks were put on the highest alert.\\" After The Express broke the story, instead of handing the boy over to the police, the Jesus Christians with Bobby \\"in tow\\" panicked went \\"on the run\\". The UK Jesus Christians became fugitives for two weeks. When the Jesus Christians could not be found in the nationwide search, and when Bobby started doing telephone interviews with the media declaring that he had not been kidnapped, an emergency court ruling was made banning the broadcast of interviews with Bobby or the group, which the BBC successfully challenged. Bobby was eventually located hiding out with two Jesus Christian men, including Reinhard Zeuner, in a Hampshire forest, and placed in a foster home. No members of the Jesus Christians were charged with kidnapping but a charge of contempt of court (for failing to answer questions from the High Court judge) resulted in six-month sentences for Susan and Roland Gianstefani. The solicitor for the Gianstefani's told the court that the Gianstefani's feared Bobby might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts. Minutes before the Gianstefanis were due to be sentenced, Bobby, who was kept in a separate room at the High Court, sent a note to the judge through the representative of the Official Solicitor saying that the Gianstefani's had acted nobly and they feared he (Bobby) might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts. Bobby said: \\"I hope they don't get into trouble. They were willing to go to prison for me.\\" The Gianstefanis' sentences were suspended after Bobby had pleaded with the judge in their defence. =Kidney donations= Over half of the Jesus Christian members donated a kidney to people they did not know prior to agreeing to donate, thus earning them the nickname 'the kidney cult'.Hospital refuses to accept kidney - National. smh.com.au. Retrieved on 2010-11-26. In January 2003, Jon Ronson's documentary called Kidneys for Jesus aired on Channel 4 in the UK. After an invitation from Dave McKay, Jon Ronson followed the group over a year as they attempted to donate their kidneys to strangers in the UK and the US. The successful donations of members Casey Crouch, Robin Dunn and Susan Gianstefani are featured. The film also documents the tension that arose between Ronson and McKay during filming: McKay became increasingly concerned that Ronson was portraying the Jesus Christians in a poor light and Ronson was concerned about McKay's ideas to try to manipulate a media storm around the donations as well as his role in the decisions made by members to donate kidneys. In 2004 the group made headlines in Australia when the leader, David Mckay, revealed that members in Australia had lied to health authorities in order to be able to donate their kidneys. David Mckay later admitted it was his teaching that if you must lie, be honest about your dishonesty. In June 2008, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a report on Ash Falkingham's fight for his right to donate a kidney to a stranger. The documentary covers the attempts of his parents to thwart the young Jesus Christian's intentions and his final success. Ash left the community shortly afterwards to work restoring bicycles for a charity.Australian Story :: Body And Soul. Abc.net.au (2010-02-08).

In 2005 a charge of abduction was made against Roland and Susan Gianstefani in Kenya, this time by the father of a 27-year-old single mother, Betty Njoroge, who had joined the community with her 7 year old son. The woman released a video on the group's website declaring that she and her son had not been kidnapped and that her father was responsible for the case being pursued as he wanted custody of her son. Roland Gianstefani was arrested and questioned by police and held for several days without charge, until the Australian embassy insisted he be charged or else released. Roland and his wife Susan were charged and Roland was held in a remand prison in Nairobi until 600,000 Kenyan shillings bail was paid. The charges against him and Susan were dropped when Betty Njoroge appeared in court and presented an affidavit confirming she was acting of her own free will. Roland contracted tuberculosis in prison and Susan, who had earlier told the media that she and her husband would never stoop to bribery, not even to save their lives, claimed she had to resort to bribery to get basic amenities provided for Roland from the prison guards. =Californian whipping trial= Jesus Christian, Joseph Johnson, South London, 2006 In October 2006 Jesus Christians in the United States, along with Dave and Cherry McKay, held a mock trial in Long Beach, California where they charged the parents and two brothers of one of their members, Joseph Johnson, with attempted murder and with aiding and abetting others in doing this.

Roland and Susan Gianstefani still identify as Jesus Christians UK, but have been excommunicated by the founder. Evidence that Jesus Christians appear to be operating under the name of End Time Survivors with Dave and Cherry Mckay continuing to lead the group in a more covert form has recently come to light. In October 2017 Roland and Susan Gianstefani had a live radio interview with Bobby Kelly on a Welsh radio station where they discussed their life and the controversies they were involved in when they were a part of the community now called End Times Survivors, formerly called the Jesus Christians community. On December 7, 2017 at the annual conference of The Australian Association for the Study of Religion in Sydney, an academic paper was presented with a formal discussion about a New religious movement that was founded in Australia in the 1980s and led by Dave and Cherry McKay. The author, Geraldine Smith, described the movement as a \\"Christian millennialist group\\" called the \\"End Time Survivors (ETS)\\". There is evidence that a web site and YouTube channel called \\"End Time Survivors\\" appeared in 2015. Several ex members of the Jesus Christians know and recognise voices and faces of Jesus Christians long term members despite minor attempts to digitally obscure their identities. Ex members, Roland and Sue Gianstefani assert that it has been a deliberate long term plan by David McKay to take the group underground and hide its identity from the public, by presenting the group or groups under different names while claiming loose associations between members living in different locations. They assert that the influence of the founder over these groups and their real identities is to be kept hidden from the public in order to avoid persecution.http://makingitreal.wixsite.com/jesus-christians-uk/going- underrground :\\"Led by Dave and Cherry Mckay a movement mostly based in Australia but with significant global outreach. This movement derives its guiding ethos from a very particular reading of The Bible that prioritises the teachings of Jesus as an apocalyptic figure.\\" The EndTime Survivors website contains many identical teachings from the Jesus Christians and promotes David McKay's books Survivors, Armageddon for Beginners and Jesus Christian pamphlets such as Christian But Not Religious as well as many of the Jesus Christians articles from their website. \\"End Time Survivors\\" also appears as a you tube channel and is linked to \\"Voice in the Desert\\" with similar topics.

August 2019 \\"Voice in the desert\\" YouTube channel finally admits links to Jesus Christians. The official website of the Jesus Christians which has been largely dormant for 9 years makes a front page announcement that the former group has \\"officially linked up with one another\\" and that content on the page will be revived with direct links to Voice in the Desert you tube content. A link to Geraldine Smiths full original thesis is also included as well as the link to the WRSP website.

The Arfak Astrapia is the third largest of its genus, being approximately 76 cm long, including the tail. The male has a black head with a bluish-purple sheen, or iridescence, an elongated jet- black nape crests extending up along the sides of the neck up to the eyes on each side, a shiny, metallic greenish-yellow cape from the mantle up to the nape, very black, dense and elongated upper breast feathers, and an almost exaggeratedly long tail almost two times the length of its body. The female is less appealing, being dark brown over most of its body and a blackish head, and sporting much shorter tail feathers. The female is also exceptionally shorter than the male. Levaillant of France described this bird as L‚ÄôIncomparable or Incomparable bird-of-paradise.  Ecology  The habits of the Arfak Astrapia are very little known. The birds are found mostly in cloud forests at 1700-2250 m at the apex of the Arfak Mountains. Foraging habits observed include the birds probing fruits, mostly pandanus fruits, off of moss and epiphytes in the montane canopy. Arthropods also recorded in the diet. Breeding habits mostly unknown; female definitely builds the nests and tend the chicks, as with most other birds-of-paradise, though the exact rearing period is unknown. All that is known about the courtship display is that the males display on a branch upside-down with their nape crests spread out, dense breast feathers flared up, and tail standing vertically upwards above the branch. No other information. Distribution Astrapia nigra is endemic to the Arfak Mountains in Vogelkop Peninsula, West Papua.

He was known for pouring water for all the wounded members of the battlefield no matter whether they were Sikhs or fighting against the Sikhs. Early life Bhai Sahib was born in a Dhawan Khatri family of Sodhara (now sohdra) near Wazirabad in Sialkot district). His father was a wealthy trader, but he himself being of a religious bent left home when he was still very young and roamed about with saddhus and ascetics in search of spiritual peace. During his youth he also spent a lot of time in the company of Nanua Bairagi, who was also a disciple and comrade of last three Sikh gurus. Nanua Bairagi was a renowned poet-mystic of Punjab and he left a deep imprint on Bhai Kanhaiya' spiritual and humanitarian outlook in his formative years. Baptism into Sikhism His quest ended as he met Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621‚Äì75) and accepted initiation at his hands. Kanhaiya established a dharamsdhal at Kavha village in the present Attock district of Pakistan which he turned into a preaching centre. His special mission was selfless service of humanity with no distinction of nationality, caste or creed. In 1704‚Äì5, he was on a visit to Anandpur when the city was invaded by a combination of hill troops and the imperial Mughal army. Exemplary Service (Aduti Sewa) During the frequent sallies and skirmishes between the Sikhs and the enemy, Bhai Kanhaiya was often seen carrying a mashak (a sort of pouch made of goat's skin that was used to carry water from one place to another), to serve water to anyone who was thirsty. He took upon the task of quenching the thirst of the wounded soldiers in the battle of Anandpur Sahib in 1704. He did this sewa with love and affection without any discrimination between the Guru's Sikh soldiers and the Mughal armies' soldiers. His act of compassion stirred up stern criticism amongst his fellow Sikhs, who complained to Guru Gobind Singh Ji, pointing out that Bhai Kanhaiya Ji was serving water to the wounded soldiers from the enemy camp. They were especially annoyed because the Mughals had surrounded the city and stopped all their food supplies, and here was Bhai Kanhaiya sharing with them what little water they had. They had tried to stop him many a time, but he would not pay any heed. Guru Gobind Singh summoned Bhai Kanhaiya and explained that he had received a complaint about his actions on the battlefield. Guruji said, ‚ÄúThese brave Sikhs are saying that you go and feed water to the enemy and they recover to fight them again ‚Äì Is this true?‚Äù Bhai Kanhaiya Ji replied \\"Yes, my Guru, what they say is true. But Maharaj, I saw no Mughal or Sikh on the battlefield. I only saw human beings. And, ... Guru Ji, .. they all have the same God‚Äôs Spirit? ‚Äì Guru Ji, have you not taught us to treat all God's people as the same? OUR SIKH HEROES DESTROY ENEMIES BY KILLING THEM, BUT I DESTROY ENMITY BY GIVING THEM WATER.\\" The Guru was very pleased with the reply. Bhai Kanhaiya Ji had understood the deep message of Gurbani correctly. Guru ji smiled and blessed Bhai Kanhaiya. Guru Ji said, \\"Bhai Kanhaiya Ji, You are right. You have understood the true message of Gurbani\\". He then continued and told the Sikhs that Bhai Kanhaiya had understood the deeper message of the Gurus' teachings correctly and that they all have to strive to learn lessons from the priceless words of Gurbani. Guru also gave Bhai Kanhaiya Ji medical Balm and said ‚ÄúFrom now on, You should also put this balm on the wounds of all who need it‚Äù Then turning to the sangat Guru Ji said, \\"Saadh sangat ji, Bhai Kanhaiya is a God-fearing saintly soul. His impartial and non-biased behaviour towards others has led him to achieve Sehaj-avastha. Let him carry on with his mission. Many more will follow in his footsteps in the years to come and keep the tradition of Nishkam sewa alive.\\" Guru ji reminded the Sikhs of Guru Arjan Dev Ji Shabad: * I have totally forgotten my jealousy of others, since I found the Saadh Sangat (the holy congregation). ((1))Pause No one is my enemy, and no one is a stranger. I get along with everyone. ((1)) Whatever God does, I accept that as good. This is the sublime wisdom I have obtained from the Holy. ((2)) The One God is pervading in all. Gazing upon Him, beholding Him, Nanak blossoms forth in happiness. ((3)(8)) (Guru Granth Sahib Page 1299 line 55528) To have respect for every person is a fundamental pillar of Sikhism and a strong message advanced by the Tenth Guru. Death Bhai Kanhaiya died in 1718 CE after retiring to Sodhara.  The Kanhaiya Principles  This Sakhi has a deep message for the Sikhs. In times of Human Suffering, a Sikh must adhere to the following guidelines as promoted by their Tenth Master, Guru Gobind Singh: # SERVE SELFLESSLY: The Sakhi tells us that we should serve Humanity selflessly (Nishkam) and with complete dedication; To open our minds to see divinity in all beings # TREAT ALL EQUALLY: To Serve All of Humanity Equally without discrimination; provide help and assistance to everybody without prejudice or indifference; make no distinction between friend or foe; # SERVE WITH COMPASSION & LOVE: It tells us how we should treat even our fallen enemies (when they do not have their swords drawn) with respect, compassion, humility and Love. # THE FIVE WEAPONS: The Five Weapons to destroy the five internal Thieves ‚Äì Deep level of Compassion (Daya), Complete compliance to Truth (Sat), Inner Contentment (Santokh), Overflowing Humility (Nimrata) and Total Love (Pyar). The Sakhi puts into practise the 5 major virtues promoted by Gurbani # SHARE WITH OTHERS: To Share ones wealth with the people who are suffering to reduce their suffering and pain. Remembering the Three Pillars of Sikhism ‚Äì Naam Japo; Kirat Karni and Wand kay Shako. # SEWA: To carry out whatever Sewa that we are able to, to help make life more comfortable for anyone who is hurt, in pain, is suffering or otherwise in a bad way. This is part of Sikhism's Two Pronged Dedication to God of Simran and Sewa.  Gurbani  * You have no compassion; the Lord‚Äôs Light does not shine in you. You are drowned, drowned in worldly entanglements. (4) (Guru Granth Sahib Page 903 line 38569) * Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life. One who is so blessed by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all. (3) (Guru Granth Sahib Page 51 line 2072) * The fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. (Guru Granth Sahib Page 235 line 10192) * Bow in humility within your heart, and you will not have to be reincarnated over and over again. (2) (Guru Granth Sahib Page 971 line 41521) * Those who practice Truth, contentment and love, obtain the supplies of the Lord‚Äôs Name.

The park lies inside the Nimpkish Valley watershed. On October 28, 1977, the \\"Class A\\" park was officially created to protect, exhibit and interpret an example of the natural features and processes of the Insular Mountains Natural Region. The park covers a total area of 8,775 hectares (21,684 acres). Within those hectares of park land is a number of lakes, creeks and mountain ranges. The largest lake is Schoen Lake which is long and has a mean depth of . At the west end of Schoen Lake is a 9 site campground with a natural boat launch. Nestled in old growth forest consisting of coastal Western Hemlock, Douglas Fir, Red Alder and Western Red Cedar, the campgrounds offer prime access to recreation activities that lead to a true remote wilderness experience. The campgrounds offer picnic tables, pit toilets, fire pits and a camp host during the months of May to September. The road into the campground from highway 19 is narrow and rough and not maintained. Campers, motor homes, rv's and vehicles towing trailers use the road access regularly despite the challenges associated with the poor condition of the gravel road. The higher elevations of the park surrounding Schoen Lake also consist of mountain hemlock, Pacific Silver Fir and Yellow Cedar with the majority residing in old growth forests around the upper portions of the lake. Wildlife in the area consists primarily of black bears, Columbian black-tailed deer, cougars, Roosevelt elk and wolves. The Adams River herd of Roosevelt Elk use the valley bottoms, wetland areas and avalanche chutes for their summer ranges in Schoen Lake Provincial Park. Roosevelt Elk rut in the fall season and can usually be observed frequently in the Nisnak Meadows area of the park. Columbian black-tailed deer use the old growth forests that make up Schoen Lake Provincial Park as their summer and winter ranges. Because deer require at least 65% covered canopy within old growth forests to be able to survive the winter months, Schoen Lake Provincial Park plays a vital role in their survival. The numbers of Columbian black- tailed deer within the park during the mid 1970s was high but because of the increasing wolf predation their numbers have decreased substantially since. Waterfowl in Schoen Lake Provincial Park is limited to loons and mergansers but the Nisnak Meadows and upper meadows in the Nisnak Lake area are very important for migrating waterfowl as reported in the Canada Land Inventory classification on land capability for waterfowl.

Distribution and habitat Dendrobates leucomelas is found in the northern part of continent of South America, most notably in Venezuela. It is also found in parts of Guyana, Brazil, and the extreme easternmost part of Colombia. This amphibian is normally found in very humid conditions in tropical rain forests, close to fresh water. It is often found on flat rocks, trees, plants (notably bromeliads), and the leaf litter of the forest floor. During the dry season, specimens are known to congregate in damper places, such as under rocks or fallen tree trunks. The D. leucomelas' natural habitat is tropical, and not subject to great seasonal temperature variations. Typically, temperature variances are related to elevation and time of day, and range from the low 20s to the low 30s ¬∞C. In captivity, care must be taken not to overheat the frogs, as they can be sensitive to higher temperatures. Although preferring high humidity levels, this species can handle lower humidity levels much better than other species in the genus. Specimens can also be found in the seasonally drier forest islands in its natural range, and at elevations ranging from sea level to 800 metres AMSL. Morphology UK 2p) coin Dendrobates leucomelas is one of the largest species in the genus Dendrobates, with a snout-to-vent length between . Average adult size, however, rarely exceeds . Their average weight is reported as being around . Females tend to be slightly larger than the males, but otherwise, little in their appearance can be used to determine the sex of the species. Like most poison dart frogs, the yellow-banded poison dart frog has evolved aposematic colouration as a warning to potential predators that it will make an unpalatable or toxic meal. Predominantly, these frogs have a bright yellow colouration with varying numbers of broad black stripes and/or spots that extend over the whole body. Some morphs are orange in colour, and variations exist within the species (naturally occurring and not morphs solely within the exotic pet community) that dictate the extent of these markings ranging from fine spots to thick, unbroken banding. They have glandular, adhesive pads on their toes (which aid in climbing and positioning) and, in common with other species in their order, they have a short, protrudable, unnotched, sticky tongue, which extends to catch prey. Behaviour Dendrobates leucomelas frogs are diurnal by nature, and are known to be fiercely territorial. They live in small groups in the wild, and will attack neighbouring groups with surprising ferocity for creatures of their size. They will also warn off rivals by emitting loud calls; D. leucomelas is known to have one of the loudest calls among poison dart frogs; theirs can be heard from some distance and is described as an innocent- sounding, bird-like trill. D. leucomelas, as with all frogs, can also call to attract members of the opposite sex. Uniquely, it is also the only poison dart frog to estivate during dry spells. Toxicity Like all Dendrobatidae, D. leucomelas frogs secrete toxins from their skin, which they gain from eating certain unspecified arthropod prey. It is uncertain precisely which arthropods lend their toxicity to which genus of Dendrobatidae, but one such arthropod is thought to have been identified as a possible source of the toxin for Dendrobatidae Phyllobates terribilis (aka the golden poison frog), and it is a local variant of the Melyrid beetle. Dendrobatidae toxins vary from species to species, but some are extremely potent neurotoxins. The alkaloid toxins, secreted from the frogs' skin, interfere with nerve impulses, which can lead to heart failure or fibrillation. Husbandry and conservation status Three Dendrobates leucomelas frogs in a tropical rainforest vivarium The species' robustness, relatively common numbers in the wild, and widespread natural distribution has helped maintain this frog's status of \\"Least Concern\\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's conservation red list, despite some overharvesting of wild specimens for the exotic pet trade. The species' ability to be easily bred in captivity has led to a fall in prices within the free market, which is an alleviative factor to the problem of overharvesting.

It was a typical representative of the suborder Gorgonopsia, the dominant predators of their day, which in the largest forms grew to over three metres long. Description G. whaitsi restoration Gorgonops itself was a medium-sized representative of the group, with a skull length of 22 to 35 centimetres, depending on the species. It ranged from 1.2 to 2 metres long from nose to tail. Gorgonops would have been one of the key predators across southern Africa during the Late Permian, because the canines were so large, they would have had little trouble in penetrating the tough hides of some of the herbivores of the time, particularly pareiasaurs such as Bradysaurus. Aside from the teeth, one of the key predatory advantages that Gorgonops had over prey were that the legs supported the body from below rather than sprawling out to the sides like in most prey animals of the time. Aside from allowing for more energy efficient locomotion, the legs would have also allowed for a much faster pace. What animals were hunted however would depend upon the size of the individual Gorgonops, and there were some quite broad differences between species in terms of size. Skull Relative to body size, Gorgonops had a deep skull which had a triangular profile when viewed from above. Perhaps the most distinctive features were two enlarged canine teeth that were so big (12-cm long) they almost protruded beyond the lower jaw. To help protect these teeth, the lower jaws grew in such a shape so that the anterior (front) portion was thicker than the posterior (rear) portion. This form would have protected the enlarged canine teeth from accidental damage, and was similar in bone function to the flanges of bone of sabre-toothed cats in the Cenozoic. History of discovery The holotype of the type species, Gorgonops torvus, was in 1876 one of the first therapsids described, by Richard Owen, who also coined the name \\"Dinosauria\\" on the basis of the first known dinosaur fossils. It was also used as the type for which Richard Lydekker described the family in 1890. Five years later, in 1895, Harry Govier Seeley used this genus to establish the group as a whole. In later years, a large number of further species and genera were designated, but some of these turned out to be synonyms. Since the publication of the Sigogneau-Russell (1989), the dating of the Karoo Basin (Beaufort Group) has been revised. According to Smith and Keyser 1995, Gorgonops is known from the Tropidostoma and most of the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zones. Head of G. torvus Head of G. whaitsi * Gorgonops torvus (Owen, 1876) The type species. The holotype is an incomplete and flattened skull found at Mildenhalls, Fort Beaufort, South Africa. A number of other specimens have been found since, all from the Tropidostoma and/or Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone(s). This was a medium-sized therapsid, with a skull about 22 cm in length. It is distinguished from other species by a longer snout, and other details of the bones of the skull. Originally considered rather simple, it is actually (according to Sigogneau-Russell) a rather specialised member of the group. * Gorgonops whaitsi (Broom, 1912) Larger than G. torvus, with the rear of the skull wider, and other details of proportion. Originally the type species of Scymnognathus. Despite being known from a large number of specimens from the Karoo Basin, Beaufort West (Tropidostoma/Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone), the species remains poorly known. Watson and Romer placed Gorgonops and Scymnognathus in two different families, while Sigogneau-Russell 1989 placed the two species in the same genus, and considers G. whaitsi a more primitive (less derived) form.

As enemies are destroyed, they leave behind different colored gemstones which serve as the game's currency. Twice during each level, a shop appears where power-ups, health, and extra lives can be purchased (except for the third and sixth levels, where it only appears once). Touching obstacles and the ground does not kill the player such as in Gradius but it does impede progress. If the player gets trapped behind objects at the left-hand side of the screen, \\"scrolling damage\\" will occur. Each stage is presented with the name of the mid-boss encountered, and keeping with the magic theme, is titled as a magical seal. Each level has a mid-boss and end-boss. Plot The game stars a young witch named Ripple, an apprentice to a terrifying witch. Ripple has just broken a promise she made to the witch and took a peek inside a forbidden book, freeing six demons. Unless she can catch all six and get them back inside the book, the witch will turn Ripple into a frog. Ripple sets off on her quest with her two Elf-Star friends, known as \\"Star Maidens\\": Topsy and Turvy.  Development  The game was developed by Quest, and the team that made it would later go on to work on Ogre Battle, Tactics Ogre, and Final Fantasy Tactics. Hiroshi Minagawa is credited with Art Direction and Game Design for this game. The game features parallax scrolling, which is done by using several traditional technics: horizontal split-screen, animated tile mapping and layered sprites. The North American release has different graphics than the original Japanese release, such as the graphics on the first level. Release Game Boy Color version screenshot. Magical Chase was originally released for the PC Engine in Japan on November 15, 1991. Magical Chase was a bestselling game on the PC Engine in Japan during late 1991 and early 1992. Its late 1993 release in the U.S. at the end of the TurboGrafx's life, coupled with extensive hype and only being available through a mail order, makes the game harder to find and more expensive than earlier releases. Some sprites and the entire first stage were extensively modified in the U.S. version. The game has since gone onto become a rare collector's item that fares high prices on the resale market. The first port of Magical Chase to appear outside the NEC console family was a Windows 95 port released on April 10, 1998. Magical Chase was later ported to the Game Boy Color by Micro Cabin and released in Japan on August 4, 2000. The IP is currently owned by Square Enix, as per their buyout of Quest in 2002. Its soundtrack was released in 2013. Reception Upon release, Famitsu gave the game a score of 26 out of 40. Reviewers noted the game incorporated elements from R-Type, Super Mario World, and Fantasy Zone. Four reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly all gave the game scores of 7/10. Italian magazine Consolemania gave it a score of 90/100. Video Games & Computer Entertainment praised the game giving it 7/10 score. Famitsu gave the Game Boy Color version a score of 23/40. In 2008, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas included both Cotton and Magical Chase (\\"two different games, one same idea\\") at number four among the top ten \\"unreleased TurboGrafx games\\" for the Wii Virtual Console. In 2008, Retro Gamer placed the game on at number 10 on its top 10 list of PC Engine games. They said that past the cute visuals, the game is a solid shooting game. Hardcore Gamer praised the game's use of parallax scrolling as a technical feat that places it far above other games for the PC-Engine.

The event was first held in 2001. In 2001, U.S. President Bush initiated what he described as the \\"White House Tee Ball Initiative\\". The purpose was to promote interest in childhood sports, including baseball and softball. According to the White House, the Tee Ball Initiative promoted \\"a spirit of teamwork and service for America's youth.\\" The plan was to invite teams from around the United States to play tee-ball at the White House. Teams were to be selected by the Little League Baseball Association. About tee-ball Tee-ball is considered \\"the entry sport to baseball for young players\\", as it generally requires less skill than baseball. Tee-ball associations allow children between the ages of four and eight to play in their leagues. It is estimated that 2.2 million children play tee-ball. The principal difference between tee-ball and softball or baseball is that the child hits the ball off of a tee; the ball is not pitched. Thus, tee-ball allows a young child to learn the skills of batting, catching, running the bases, and throwing, while making it both easier to hit the ball and less likely for batters to be injured since they do not need to dodge wayward pitches. The capitalized, spaced spelling \\"Tee Ball\\" is actually a registered trademark in the US of one particular, church-affiliated organization since the 1970s, though the game goes back to at least the 1950s in various parts of the United States.

The conflict became a major international issue with the birth of Israel in 1948. The Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict has resulted in at least five major wars and a number of minor conflicts. It has also been the source of two major Palestinian uprisings (intifadas). Background=Ottoman era Tensions between the Zionist movements and the Arab residents of Palestine started to emerge after the 1880s, when immigration of European Jews to Palestine increased. This immigration increased the Jewish communities in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire by the acquisition of land from Ottoman and individual Arab landholders, known as effendis, and establishment of Jewish agricultural settlements. At the time, Arabs lived in an almost feudal existence on the effendis' land.The Jewish National Fund: Land Purchase Methods and Priorities, 1924 ‚Äì 1939 by Kenneth W. Stein. Middle Eastern Studies. April 1984. Volume 20 Number 2, pp. 190‚Äì205 Demographer Justin McCarthy estimated from Ottoman census data that the population of Palestine in 1882‚Äì3 was about 468,000, consisting of 408,000 Muslims, 44,000 Christians and 15,000 Jews. By the eve of World War I, these numbers had increased to 602,000 Muslims, 81,000 Christians and 39,000 Jews, plus a similar but uncertain number of Jews who were not Ottoman citizens. The first Statistician General of Israel, Roberto Bachi, give similar numbers except for a lower count (525,000) of Muslims in 1914. British Mandate (1920‚Äì1948) Emir Faisal and Chaim Weizmann (left, also wearing Arab outfit) During the time of the Mandatory Palestine, the Balfour Declaration signed in 1917, stated that the government of Great Britain supported the establishment of a \\"Jewish national home\\" in Palestine. This exacerbated tensions between the Arabs living in Mandate Palestine and the Jews who emigrated there during the Ottoman period. Signed in January 1919, the Faisal‚ÄìWeizmann Agreement promoted Arab-Jewish cooperation on the development of a Jewish national homeland in Palestine and an Arab nation in a large part of the Middle East, though this event had little to no effect on the conflict.Sela, Avraham. \\"Arab-Israeli Conflict.\\" The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 58‚Äì121. In 1920, the San Remo conference largely endorsed the 1916 Anglo-French Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement, allocating to Britain the area of present-day Jordan, the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, and Iraq, while France received Syria and Lebanon. In 1922, the League of Nations formally established the British Mandate for Palestine and Transjordan, at least partially fulfilling Britain's commitments from the 1915‚Äì16 McMahon‚ÄìHussein Correspondence by assigning all of the land east of the Jordan River to the Emirate of Jordan, ruled by Hashemite king Abdullah but closely dependent on Britain, leaving the remainder west of the Jordan as the League of Nations Mandatory Palestine. While the British had made promises to give both Arabs and Jews land, the British claimed they had never promised to give either side all of the land. Rising tensions had given way to violence, such as the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, and Jaffa riots of 1921. To assuage the Arabs, and due to British inability to control Arab violence in the Mandatory Palestine any other way, the semi- autonomous Arab Emirate of Transjordan was created in all Palestinian territory east of the Jordan river (roughly 77% of the mandate). The conflicting forces of Arab nationalism and the Zionist movement created a situation which the British could neither resolve nor extricate themselves from. Pogroms in Russia and the Ukraine as well as Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany created a new urgency in the Zionist movement to create a Jewish state, and the evident intentions of the Zionists provoked increasingly fierce Arab attacks against the Jewish population (most notably in the preceding 1929 Hebron massacre, the activities of the Black Hand, and during the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine). The British-appointed Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, led opposition to the idea of turning part of Palestine into a Jewish state.\\"Though attracted to the economic benefits generated by Zionist settlement‚Äîan estimated 300,000 Arabs would eventually enter the country from neighboring Arab states‚Äîthousands of Palestinian fellaheen ... were displaced by Jewish land purchases while urban workers were marginalized by more technologically skilled Jewish laborers.\\" Oren, Michael B. Power, Faith, and Fantasy: American in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2007. p. 421 In search for help in expelling British forces from Palestine, thus removing the enforcer of the Zionist enterprise, the Grand Mufti sought alliance with the Axis Powers. The response of the British government was to banish the Mufti (who spent much of World War II in Germany and helped form a Muslim SS division in the Balkans), curb Jewish immigration, and reinforce its police force. The Jewish leadership (Yishuv) \\"adopted a policy of restraint (havlaga) and static defense in response to Arab attacks\\"Sela, 63. and criticized the British for \\"what they regarded as Britain's retreat from the Balfour Declaration and its conciliation of Arab violence.\\" It was at this time that critics of this policy broke away from the Hagana (the self-defense organization of the Yishuv) and created the more right-wing militant Irgun, which would later be led by Menachem Begin in 1943. For a list of Irgun attacks on Palestinian civilians and policemen during this period, see List of Irgun attacks during the 1930s. A British Royal Commission of Inquiry that came to be known as the Peel Commission was established in 1936. In its 1937 report, it proposed a two-state solution that gave the Arabs control over all of the Negev, much of the present-day West Bank, and Gaza and gave the Jews control over Tel Aviv, Haifa, present-day northern Israel, and surrounding areas. The British were to maintain control over Jaffa, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and surrounding areas. The two main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation.William Roger Louis, Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization, 2006, p.391Benny Morris, One state, two states:resolving the Israel/Palestine conflict, 2009, p. 66Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, p. 48; p. 11 \\"while the Zionist movement, after much agonising, accepted the principle of partition and the proposals as a basis for negotiation\\"; p. 49 \\"In the end, after bitter debate, the Congress equivocally approved ‚Äìby a vote of 299 to 160 ‚Äì the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation.\\"Eran, Oded. \\"Arab-Israel Peacemaking.\\" The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. The Arabs, however, rejected it while demanding cessation of immigration and land sales to Jewish people. The Arabs' demands prompted the British to stop Jewish immigration, thus preventing refugees from escaping the Holocaust.Oren, Michael B. \\"Israel‚Äôs 1967 Victory Is Something to Celebrate.\\" New York Times. 4 June 2017. 5 June 2017. Jewish violence against the Mandatory Palestine continued to mount throughout the later half of the 1940s, with attacks by the Irgun, assassination of British authorities officials by the Lehi, and the 1946 King David Hotel bombing. In 1947, the population was reported as 1,845,000, consisting of 608,000 Jews and 1,237,000 Arabs and others. War of 1948 UN Partition Plan offered to both sides of the conflict before the 1948 war. The Jews accepted the plan while the Arabs rejected it. The 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War (1948‚Äì49), known as the \\"War of Independence\\" by Israelis and al-Nakba (\\"the Catastrophe\\") by Palestinians, began after the UN Partition Plan and the subsequent 1947‚Äì48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine in November 1947. The plan proposed the establishment of Arab and Jewish states in Palestine. The Arabs had rejected the plan while the Jews had accepted it. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating.Benny Morris, 1948. A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, Yale University Press, 2008, p.79. By March 1948 however, the United States was actively seeking a temporary UN approved trusteeship rather than immediate partition, known as the Truman trusteeship proposal.The Avalon Project : United States Proposal for Temporary United Nations Trusteeship for Palestine ‚Äì Statement by President Truman, March 25, 1948 The Jewish leadership rejected this.

Iraqi and Saudi troops invaded Palestine subsequent to the British withdrawal and the declaration of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. The Arab invasion was denounced by the United States, the Soviet Union, and UN secretary-general Trygve Lie, although it found support from Taiwan and other UN member states. The Arab states proclaimed their aim of a \\"United State of Palestine\\"Cablegram from the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States to the Secretary-General of the United Nations May 15, 1948, at Wikisource. Retrieved 22 March 2006. in place of Israel and an Arab state. The Arab Higher Committee said, that in the future Palestine, the Jews will be no more than 1/7 of the population. i.e. only Jews that lived in Palestine before the British mandate. They did not specify what will happen to the other Jews.[\\"1948 A History of the First Arab-Israeli War,2008, Benny Morris, p. 66] They considered the UN Plan to be invalid because it was opposed by Palestine's Arab majority, and claimed that the British withdrawal led to an absence of legal authority, making it necessary for them to protect Arab lives and property.The Origins and Evolution of the Palestine Problem, PART II, 1947‚Äì1977 , United Nations Information System on the Question of Palestine (UNISPAL), June 20, 1990, ST/SG/SER.F/1 About two thirds of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from the territories which came under Jewish control; the rest became Arab citizens of Israel. All of the much smaller number of Jews in the territories captured by the Arabs, for example the Old City of Jerusalem, also fled or were expelled. The official United Nations estimate was that 711,000 Arabs became refugees during the fighting.General Progress Report and Supplementary Report of the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine, Covering the Period from 11 December 1949 to 23 October 1950 , published by the United Nations Conciliation Commission, October 23, 1950. (U.N. General Assembly Official Records, 5th Session, Supplement No. 18, Document A/1367/Rev. 1). The Committee believed the estimate to be \\"as accurate as circumstances permit\\", and attributed the higher number on relief to, among other things, \\"duplication of ration cards, addition of persons who have been displaced from area other than Israel-held areas and of persons who, although not displaced, are destitute.\\" May 15 ‚Äì June 10 The fighting ended with signing of the several Armistice Agreements in 1949 between Israel and its warring neighbors (Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria), which formalized Israeli control of the area allotted to the Jewish state plus just over half of the area allotted to the Arab state. The Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt and the West Bank by Jordan until June 1967 when they were occupied by Israel during the Six-Day War. Aftermath of the 1948 war The about 711,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from the areas that became Israel were not allowed to return to their homes, and took up residence in refugee camps in surrounding countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and the area that was later to be known as the Gaza Strip; they were usually not allowed to leave refugee camps and mix with the local Arab society either, leaving the Palestinian refugee problem unsolved even today. Around 400 Arab towns and villages were depopulated during the 1948 Palestinian exodus. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East was established to alleviate their condition. After the war, \\"[t]he Arab states insisted on two main demands\\", neither of which were accepted by Israel: 1\\\\. Israel should withdraw to the borders of the UN Partition Plan ‚Äî Israel argued \\"that the new borders‚Äîwhich could be changed, under consent only‚Äîhad been established as a result of war, and because the UN blueprint took no account of defense needs and was militarily untenable, there was no going back to that blueprint.\\" 2\\\\. The Palestinian refugees deserved a full right of return back into Israel ‚Äî Israel argued that this was \\"out of the question, not only because they were hostile to the Jewish state, but they would also fundamentally alter the Jewish character of the state.\\" Over the next two decades after the 1948 war ended, between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews fled or were expelled from the Arab countries they were living in, in many cases owing to anti-Jewish sentiment, expulsion (in the case of Egypt), or, in the case of Iraq, legal oppression but also quite often to promises of a better life from Israel; of this number, two-thirds ended up in refugee camps in Israel, while the remainder migrated to France, the United States and other Western or Latin American countries. The Jewish refugee camps in Israel were evacuated with time and the refugees were eventually integrated in the Jewish Israeli society (which in fact consisted almost entirely of refugees from Arab and European states). Israel argued that this and the Palestinian exodus represented a population exchange between Arab nations and the Jewish nation. For the 19 years from the end of the Mandate until the Six-Day War, Jordan controlled the West Bank and Egypt controlled the Gaza Strip. In 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank, but this annexation was recognized only by the United Kingdom. Both territories were conquered (but not annexed) from Jordan and Egypt by Israel in the Six-Day War. Neither Jordan nor Egypt allowed the creation of a Palestinian state in these territories. The effect this had on Israel during this period \\"were frequent border clashes ... terror and sabotage acts by individuals and small groups of Palestinian Arabs.\\" War of 1956 The 1956 Suez War was a joint Israeli-British-French operation, in which Israel invaded the Sinai Peninsula and British and French forces landed at the port of Suez, ostensibly to separate the warring parties, though the real motivation of Great Britain and France was to protect the interests of investors in those countries who were affected by Egyptian President Nasser's decision to nationalize the Suez Canal. Israel justified its invasion of Egypt as an attempt to stop attacks (see the Fedayeen) upon Israeli civilians, and to restore Israeli shipping rights through the Straits of Tiran, which Egypt claimed was within its territorial waters. The invading forces agreed to withdraw under U.S. and international pressure, and Israel withdrew from the Sinai as well, in return for the installation of United Nations Emergency Forces and guarantees of Israeli freedom of shipment. The canal was left in Egyptian (rather than British and French) hands. Between 1956 and 1967 This period saw the rise of Nasserism; the founding of the United Arab Republic in 1958 and its collapse in 1961; Syrian plans for the diversion of water from the Jordan River; continued fedayeen raids, mostly from Syria and Jordan, and Israeli reprisals; and the increasing alignment of the Arab states with the Soviet Union, who became their largest arms supplier. In 1964, the PLO was established by mostly Palestinian refugees mostly from Jordan. The Article 24 of the Palestinian National Charter of 1964 stated: \\"This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area.\\" War of 1967 The background from which erupted the Six-Day War was caused by an erroneous information given to Nasser from the Soviet intelligence services that Israel was amassing troops near the Israeli-Syrian border. The state of conflict was also very tense after increased conflicts between Israel and Syria and Israel and Jordan ‚Äì i.e. the Samu Incident. On 14 May 1967 Mohamed Fawzi (general) left for Syria for one day tour, verified that the Soviet report was false and reported that there were no Israeli armed forces near the Syrian border. Still, Nasser declared full mobilisation in Egypt as of 14 May 1967, citing the joint defence agreement with Syria.Oren 64, 65Stein, \\"Fawzi reported to Nasser that: 'There is nothing there. No massing of forces. Nothing.'\\" p. 266 The Egyptian further steps were stationing of 100,000 Egyptian troops at the Sinai Peninsula, expulsion of UNEF peacekeeping forces (UNEF II) from the Sinai Peninsula along the border with Israel, and closure of the Straits of Tiran on May 21‚Äì22, 1967 (thus \\"blocking all shipping to and from Eilat ... a casus belli\\" according to a possible interpretation of international law). The Israeli army had a potential strength, including the not fully mobilized reserves, of 264,000 troops. Following the breakdown of international diplomatic efforts to solve the crisis, the fighting in the Six-Day War of 1967 began on 6 June 1967 with surprise Israeli air strikes that destroyed the entire Egyptian air force while it was still on the ground. In spite of Israel's request to Jordan to desist from attacking it, Jordan along with Syria began to shell Israeli targets. In addition, Hussein, reluctant at first, sent ineffective bomber strikes because of Nasser's requests and affirmation of a sound Egyptian victory. Attacks on other Arab air forces took place later in the day as hostilities broke out on other fronts. A subsequent ground invasion into Egyptian territory led to Israel's conquest of the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula. With the rapid and rather unexpected success on the Egyptian front, Israel decided to attack and successfully captured the West Bank from Jordan on June 7, and the Golan Heights from Syria on June 9. Khartoum Resolution, UN Resolution 242, and peace proposals The Khartoum Resolution of September 1, 1967, was issued at the conclusion of 1967 Arab League summit convened in the wake of the Six-Day War, in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. The resolution ended the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War, and called for the establishment of the Kuwaiti-led Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development.League of Arab States, Khartoum Resolution, 1 September 1967 On the conflict with Israel, it said: > \\"The Arab Heads of State have agreed to unite their political efforts at the > international and diplomatic level to eliminate the effects of the > aggression and to ensure the withdrawal of the aggressive Israeli forces > from the Arab lands which have been occupied since the aggression of June 5. > This will be done within the framework of the main principles by which the > Arab States abide, namely, no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, > no negotiations with it, and insistence on the rights of the Palestinian > people in their own country.\\" Israel and some analysts interpreted the \\"three noes\\" of the resolution as a firm proof of Arab intransigence. Others noted that the resolution called for Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines rather than Israel's destruction and understood the \\"three noes\\" as meaning that the Arab states must negotiate as a group and not individually. Following the Six-Day War, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 242 which proposed a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The resolution was accepted by Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, but rejected by Syria until 1972‚Äì73 and the Yom Kippur War. To this day, Resolution 242 remains controversial due to conflicting interpretations over how much territory Israel would be required to withdraw from in order to conform with the resolution. Also, after the Israeli occupation of the West Bank following the war, Palestinian nationalism substantially increased. Armed resistance was encouraged from within the newly occupied territories and from the Arab nations that lost in the war. U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers proposed the Rogers Plan, which called for a 90-day ceasefire, a military standstill zone on each side of the Suez Canal, and an effort to reach agreement in the framework of UN Resolution 242.‚ÄúThe Ceasefire/Standstill Proposal‚Äù 19 June 1970, http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/db942872b9eae454852560f6005a76fb/3e33d676ae43229b85256e60007086fd!OpenDocument last visited 2007/6/11 The Egyptian government accepted the Rogers Plan even before Anwar Sadat became president. Israel refused to enter negotiations with Egypt based on the Rogers peace plan. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender. No breakthrough occurred even after President Sadat in 1972 surprised everyone by suddenly expelling Soviet advisers from Egypt and again signaled to the United States government his willingness to negotiate.‚ÄúThe Camp David Accords: A Case of International Bargaining‚Äù Shibley Telhami, Columbia International Affairs Online, http://www.ciaonet.org/casestudy/tes01/index.html, last visited 2007/6/11 War of 1967‚Äì1970 The War of Attrition was a limited war fought between Egypt and Israel from 1967 to 1970.

Palestinian insurgency in South LebanonWar of 1973 When the ceasefire came into effect, Israel had lost ground on the east side of the Suez Canal to Egypt (shown in red) but gained ground west of the canal and in the Golan Heights (shown in gray/brown) The 1973 Yom Kippur War began when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise joint attack, on the Jewish day of fasting, in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. The Egyptians and Syrians advanced during the first 24‚Äì48 hours, after which momentum began to swing in Israel's favor. By the second week of the war, the Syrians had been pushed entirely out of the Golan Heights. In the Sinai to the south, the Israelis had struck at the \\"hinge\\" between two invading Egyptian armies, crossed the Suez Canal (where the old ceasefire line had been), and cut off an entire Egyptian army just as a United Nations ceasefire came into effect. During this time, the United States airlifted military supplies to Israel while the Soviet Union airlifted military supplies to Egypt. Israeli troops eventually withdrew from the west of the Canal and the Egyptians kept their positions on a narrow strip on the east allowing them to re-open the Suez Canal and claim victory.Slantchev, Branislav L. \\"National Security Strategy: The Rise and Fall of D√©tente, 1971‚Äì1980.\\" UCSD ‚Äì Department of Political Science. 2 March 2005. 26 March 2008. p. 7. According to The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East (ed. Sela, 2002), Israel clearly had the military victory over both Syria and Egypt, but it suffered a large blow to morale as well as substantial human casualties. The outcome of the Yom Kippur War set the stage for \\"a new phase in Israeli-Egyptian relations\\" ending ultimately in the signing of the Camp David Accords. South Lebanon=1978 conflict Operation Litani was the official name of Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon up to the Litani river. The invasion was a military success, as PLO forces were pushed north of the river. However, international outcry led to the creation of the UNIFIL peacekeeping force and a partial Israeli retreat. 1982 Lebanon War The 1982 Lebanon War began when Israel attacked Lebanon, justified by Israel as an attempt to remove the Fatah militants led by Yasser Arafat from Southern Lebanon (where they had established, during the country's civil war, a semi-independent enclave used to launch attacks on Israel). The invasion was widely criticized both in and outside Israel, especially after the Israeli-backed Phalangist Christian militia's Sabra and Shatila massacre, and ultimately led to the death of roughly 1,000 Palestinians. Although through the war, Israel succeeded in exiling the PLO military personnel, including Arafat to Tunisia, it became entangled with various local Muslim militias (particularly Hezbollah), which fought to end the Israeli occupation. 1982‚Äì2000 conflict By 1985, Israel retreated from all but a narrow stretch of Lebanese territory designated by Israel as the Israeli Security Zone. UN Security Council Resolution 425 (calling on Israel to completely withdraw from Lebanon) was not completely fulfilled until 16 June 2000. Despite UN Security Council resolutions 1559 and 1583, Hezbollah continues to have a military wing. Intifada of 1987‚Äì1993 The First Intifada, 1987‚Äì1993, began as an uprising of Palestinians, particularly the young, against the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the failure of the PLO to achieve any kind of meaningful diplomatic solution to the Palestinian issue. The exiled PLO leadership in Tunisia quickly assumed a role in the intifada, but the uprising also brought a rise in the importance of Palestinian national and Islamic movements, and helped lead to the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in 1988. The intifada was started by a group of young Palestinians who began throwing rocks at the Israeli occupying forces in Jabalia (Gaza Strip) in December 1987. In May 1989, the government of Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister of Israel at the time, \\"suggested that violence cease, and that elections should be held in the West Bank and Gaza for a political delegation with whom Israel would come to terms regarding the implementation of Palestinian interim self-governing authority in these areas.\\" These elections however never materialized. During the Gulf War, 1990‚Äì1991, Iraq tried draw Israel into the confrontation and thereby make it difficult for Arab regimes to remain in the coalition. During the war, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and King Hussein of Jordan supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while PLO chairman Yasser Arafat had allegedly received $100 million from Saddam Hussein. However, under strong pressure from the US, which feared direct Israeli involvement would threaten the unity of the coalition, Israel did not retaliate against Iraq and the multinational coalition ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The defeat of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War \\"was a devastating blow to ... the Palestinians.\\"Lewis, Bernard. The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror. New York: The Modern Library, 2003. p.62. After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein. They also withdrew their financial support from the Palestinian cause due to PLO support of Saddam Hussein. It was this political environment that allowed for the PLO to begin talks with the United States and Israel. The First Palestinian Intifada ended with the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the signing of the Oslo Accords by Israel and the PLO in 1993. Oslo peace process (1993‚Äì2000) In September 1993, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat signed the Declaration of Principles (DOP) which \\"shaped the principles for a prospective process of the establishment of a five-year interim self-governing authority\\" in the Palestinian territories. In May 1994, the first stage of the DOP was implemented, Arafat arrived in the Gaza Strip, and financial aid started pouring in from the parts of the Western world and Japan. Unfortunately, \\"the new trend in Israeli-Palestinian relations also entailed a wave of violence by religious fanatics.\\" In September 1996, after the opening of some ancient tunnels near the Temple Mount, a small wave of violence occurred. This frightened many Israelis into believing that \\"the new reality created by the Oslo Agreements, namely the presence of an armed police force of approximately 30,000 Palestinians, ... could easily shift from cooperation to hostility.\\" In October 1998, Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed the Wye Memorandum which \\"called for the implementation of Israel's first and second redeployments according to the DOP in three phases.\\" Shortly after, Netanyahu's government fell and the Labor Party (under Ehud Barak) won control of the Knesset. Barak's election campaign was mostly geared toward a lasting peace in the Middle East by further implementation of the Wye Memorandum and the Oslo Accord. Barak won the election and attempted to deliver on his promises in 2000, when he and Arafat met at Camp David. Barak had offered Arafat a Palestinian state in all of the Gaza Strip and most of the West Bank with a capital in East Jerusalem. Arafat rejected the proposal, did not make a counteroffer, and walked away from the negotiating table.Goldberg, Jeffrey. Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror. New York: Vintage Books, 2008. p. 253. Intifada of 2000 The al-Aqsa Intifada, or Second Intifada, began in late September 2000, around the time Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon and a large contingent of armed bodyguards visited the Temple Mount (Haram al- Sharif) complex in Jerusalem and declared the area as an eternal Israeli territory. Widespread riots and attacks broke out among Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel in Jerusalem and many major Israeli cities, and spread throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority (PA) involvement in the Intifada was handled by the Tanzim organization, which was the secret armed branch of Arafat's Fatah party within the PLO. In January 2002, the \\"PA's direct involvement in the Intifada was confirmed ... when the IDF intercepted a cargo ship in the Red Sea carrying tons of rockets, mortars, and other weapons and ammunition from Iran, earmarked for smuggling into PA [Palestinian Authority] areas.\\" In March 2002, just prior to the Arab Peace Initiative, suicide bombings committed by Palestinians against Israeli civilians \\"intensified ... in buses, restaurants, coffee shops, and other public places in Israel.\\" An Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, estimated the death toll to be 3,396 Palestinians and 994 Israelis, although this number is criticized for not showing the whole picture, and not differentiating between combatants and civilians (suicide bombers, for example, are counted in that death toll). The Intifada also created \\"heavy economic losses to both sides\\" of the conflict. Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 In 2002, Saudi Arabia offered a peace plan in The New York Times and at a summit meeting of the Arab League in Beirut. The plan is based on, but goes beyond UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Resolution 338. It essentially calls for full withdrawal, solution of the refugee problem through the Palestinian \\"right of return\\", a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem in return for fully normalized relations with the whole Arab world. This proposal was the first to receive the unanimous backing of the Arab League. In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said: \\"... the details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya\\", referring to the Netanya suicide attack. In 2005, the United States Congress acknowledged that Saudi Arabia has been funding to Hamas and other Palestinian insurgency groups.Levitt, Matthew and Dennis Ross. \\"Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad.\\" Google Books. 11 January 2011. Israel's Disengagement of 2005 In 2005 Israel unilaterally evacuated settlements, and military outposts from the Gaza Strip and the northern West Bank. The Disengagement Plan was a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, adopted by the government and enacted in August 2005, to remove a permanent Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip and from four Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank. The civilians were evacuated (many forcibly) and the residential buildings demolished after August 15, and the disengagement from the Gaza Strip was completed on 12 September 2005, when the last Israeli soldier left. The military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later. Israel‚ÄìLebanon conflict of 2006 The 2006 Lebanon War began on 12 July 2006, with an attack by Hezbollah on Israel. Three Israeli soldiers were killed, and two were kidnapped and taken prisoner into Lebanon. In a search and rescue operation to return the captured soldiers, a further five Israeli Defense Forces troops were killed. It marked the beginning of a new wave of clashes between Israel and Hezbollah which saw the Lebanese capital, the sole Lebanese international airport, and much of southern Lebanon attacked by the Israelis, while Lebanese militias, presumably Hezbollah, bombarded northern Israeli cities, striking as far south as the city of Haifa. The conflict killed more than a thousand people, most of whom were Lebanese civilians and Hezbollah fighters; and displaced 974,184 LebaneseLebanon Higher Relief Council (2007). \\"Lebanon Under Siege\\" . Retrieved March 5, 2007. and 300,000‚Äì500,000 Israelis. Fears were growing that the situation could deteriorate further, with the possibility of either Syria or Iran becoming involved. But a ceasefire was signed, and went into effect 14 August. Aftermath From the election of Mahmud Ahmedinijad as Iranian President, the Islamic Republic of Iran has actively supported numerous Arab organizations opposing Israel and has also actively called for waging war against it. Iran was widely referred as attempting to create a Shi'a Islam dominated axis, including the Syrian Ba'athist government, dominated by Alawites, Lebanon with Hezbollah dominance and making a strategic alliance with Sunni Hamas in Gaza Strip, which lasted until 2012 (terminating due to Shi'a ‚Äì Sunni discourse in the Syrian civil war). In January 2007, concerns increased among Israel's leaders that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran might be planning some sort of nuclear arms buildup, which might be considered for use in opposition to Israel.For Israelis, a new worry: Iran's nuclear intentions , John Murphy, Baltimore Sun, 1/19/07 The Security Council voted to put sanctions on Iran for its pursuit of nuclear technology.UN passes Iran nuclear sanctions , BBC, 12/23/06. In 2020, the United States brokered a deal for Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In return for normalized relations, Israel agreed to suspend controversial plans to annex portions of the West Bank. This was the first time a Gulf Arab country established diplomatic relations with Israel.\\"Israel.\\" World History: The Modern Era, ABC- CLIO, 2020, worldhistory.abc-clio.com/Search/Display/317267.

(also known as SVI) is a manufacturer of M1911-styled modular pistols. The Strayer-Voigt system is called modular because the lower grip and trigger guard, which is made of carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium or aluminum, is a separate component from the metal upper portion of the frame that comprises the dust cover and frame rails. They are the most famous for their Hybrid series of pistols as well as their IMM Open division pistols made for competitions. SVI markets its products under the brand name Infinity Firearms. The Infinity pistols are sometimes unofficially known by the combined name of Strayer-Voigt Infinity among some enthusiasts, a play on the SVI acronym. History Strayer-Voigt, Inc. was started in June 1994 when Sandy Strayer left STI International Inc to form his own company. Sandy Strayer joined forces with Michael Voigt, a professional shooter and gunsmith, to manufacture and market their own line of modular frame 1911s. The new age of 1911s The original polymer grip was formerly a shared patent design between Strayer-Voigt and STI International Inc. It offers a modular version of the M1911 design optimized for competition use. By making the lower half of the frame from thin polymer, the gun can make use of double-stack magazines without a significant increase in grip thickness (current production utilizes various metals for the grip). SVI and STI pistols generally hold approximately twice as many rounds of ammunition per magazine as traditional 1911s (i.e., 14 rounds of .45 ACP instead of 7 rounds). SVI Infinity pistols currently rank among the most popular - and most expensive - competition 1911 pistols made. Complete SVI handguns start at $4,200 (as of 2019) plus the cost of any customizations. They are produced in a variety of calibers, including .38 Super, 9x23mm Winchester, .40 S&W;, .45 ACP, 10mm Auto, and .357 Sig. SVI Infinity pistols make exclusive use of Infinity Accuracy Enhanced pistol barrels. The barrels and all major components are manufactured in-house from billet barstock. Heat treatment and cryrogenic treatments are also done in- house. SVI also now uses slides with interchangeable breech faces, which makes caliber changes cheaper for customers wanting to shoot several different calibers in the same weapon. SVI provides accuracy certificates with their pistols which feature the accuracy enhanced barrels that produce groups smaller than 1.50‚Ä≥ at fifty yards, which is remarkable accuracy for a pistol.

It is located in the basement of Wadsworth Hall in Houghton, Michigan, and operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Staff is constituted of a volunteer general staff featuring a general manager and six different departments as well as the air staff. Open DJ signups are held the first Wednesday and Thursday of each semester, including the summer tracks. History The station's precursor, WVRW (Voice of Radio, Wadsworth), began broadcasting in 1956, as a carrier current AM station. It changed its callsign to WRS (Wadsworth Radio Service) two years later, to show that it now served all dormitories on campus. The current WMTU callsign was adopted in 1975. Two years after that WMTU began broadcasting as a cable FM station via the local cable television system. The 24-hour format, with three-hour shows, was adopted two years later in 1979. In 1993 WMTU received an FM broadcasting license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The following year the station began over-the-air broadcasting from atop the Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Mechanics building on the Michigan Tech campus with an effective radiated power of 100 watts. In 1998 WMTU began broadcasting via RealAudio, utilizing a Helix server located in the basement of Michigan Tech's Electrical Engineering Resources Center (EERC). In 2004 renovations to Wadsworth Hall resulted in a move from the original location next to the Tri- Hall Weight Club to a temporary location near the Campus Cafe. In 2005 the FCC approved a request for WMTU to move its transmitter to a university-owned tower atop Arcadia Hill. This allowed the station to upgrade its power from 100 watts to 4400 watts effective radiated power, providing coverage to campus as well as many surrounding communities. Later that year the station returned to its original location, now sporting a new \\"storefront\\" look along with nearly triple the music storage space. Renovations also resulted in a \\"commons\\" area outside of the station, used for small concerts and other activities, as well as a room which the WMTU staff uses for weekly meetings. In 2009 WMTU changed its daily schedule to 12 two-hour shows. In 2012 the station remodeled its DJ booth with new equipment and a new look, and began broadcasting continuous 24-hour broadcast over breaks for the first time. Station programming WMTU currently runs seventy programs, all of which are staffed by volunteers who apply at semesterly DJ meetings. Primetime slots are generally allocated based upon seniority, volunteer work at the station, and uniqueness of programming offered. All programming decisions are made by the Program Director and the Broadcast Supervisor, both positions elected yearly by WMTU's General Staff. WMTU allows DJs to play music of their choice without any prescribed playlisting. Commercial free programming including metal, hip hop, techno, punk, indie, classic rock, electronica, Americana, noise, industrial, world, local, and freeform all appear on WMTU's current programming schedule. The Local Music Show used to air every Saturday evening from 5-7pm. This program was formed by local musicians and DJs Brian Weeden and Markku Savolainen for WMTU in 2003, and highlighted both local and touring acts in the area, often including live in-studio performances and interviews. Local artists that have performed on air include Erik Koskinen, VSEPR, the Lumber Janes, Flashing Red Airplane, Carp, and Sycamore Smith. In the fall semester of the 2010 school year local music blog Mostly Midwest partnered with WMTU for an official Mostly Midwest radio show every Tuesday and Thursday from 6-8pm. This program showcases local midwestern acts and promotes upcoming local area shows, as well as providing information on upcoming local CD releases, interviews with out-of-town musicians, and occasional CD giveaways. The DJ of the Week program airs each Saturday afternoon from 2pm-5pm, featuring WMTU's up-and-coming DJs and giving the programming and broadcasting departments the chance to evaluate the musical selections and general style of newer DJs. Spotlight on... airs Saturday afternoon from noon-2pm. This program, usually hosted by a current WMTU DJ, presents two hours of studio favorites and rarities from one of the DJs favorite artists. \\"PB and JAMZ\\" airs Thursdays from 12pm to 2pm EST, hosted by DJ Suckaa. Concerts Concert space has been provided to WMTU by the Campus Cafe (the Wads Annex), the McArdle Theatre (the Black Box), the Memorial Union Building commons, the Suburban Exchange, the ExUrban, the Level 2 Skate Park, and a commons area outside of WMTU's current location. The Copper Country Crush-a-Thon, established 2002, is an annual metal festival sponsored by WMTU. The day-long show allows the students of Michigan Tech and the surrounding communities the opportunity to see live black, death, and speed metal alongside of punk rock and hardcore.

The partnership, formed in 1993, involved eight federal agencies,Departments of Commerce, Energy, Defense, Interior and Transportation, the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Environmental Protection Agency the national laboratories, universities, and the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), which comprises DaimlerChrysler, Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. \\"Supercar\\" was the unofficial description for the R&D; program. On track to achieving its objectives, the program was cancelled by the George W. Bush Administration in 2001 at the request of the automakers, with some of its aspects shifted to the much more distant FreedomCAR program. Objectives The main purpose of this program was to develop technologies to reduce the impact of cars and light trucks on the environment as well as decrease U.S. dependency on imported petroleum. It was to make working vehicles that can achieve up to triple the contemporary vehicle fuel efficiency as well as further minimizing emissions, but without sacrificing affordability, performance, or safety. The common term for these vehicles was \\"supercar\\" because of the technological advances. The goal of achieving the target with a family-sized sedan included using new fuel sources, powerplants, aerodynamics, and lightweight materials. The program was established in 1993 to support the domestic U.S. automakers (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) develop prototypes of a safe, clean, affordable car the size of the Ford Taurus, but delivering three times the fuel efficiency.  Results  The PNGV program \\"overcame many challenges and has forged a useful and productive partnership of industry and government participants\\", \\"resulting in three concept cars that demonstrate the feasibility of a variety of new automotive technologies\\" with Diesel-electric transmission. The three domestic automakers, GM, Ford, and Chrysler, developed fully operational concept cars. They were full sized, five-passenger family cars that achieved at least . General Motors developed the 80 mpg Precept, Ford designed the 72 mpg Prodigy, and Chrysler built the 72 mpg ESX-3. They featured aerodynamic, lightweight aluminum or thermoplastic construction and were hybrid powered using 3- or 4-cylinder diesel engines and NiMH/lithium batteries. Researchers for the PNGV identified a number of ways to reach 80 mpg including reducing vehicle weight, increasing engine efficiency, combining gasoline engines and electric motors in hybrid vehicles, implementing regenerative braking, and switching to high efficiency fuel cell powerplants. Specific new technology breakthroughs achieved under the program included: * Development of carbon foam with extremely high heat conductivity (2000 R&D; 100 Award) * Near frictionless carbon coating, many times slicker than Teflon (1998 R&D; 100 Award) * Oxygen- rich air supplier for clean diesel technology (1999 R&D; 100 Award) * Development of a compact microchannel fuel vaporizer to convert gasoline to hydrogen for fuel cells (1999 R&D; 100 Award) * Development of aftertreatment devices to remove nitrogen oxides from diesel exhaust with efficiencies greater than 90 percent, when used with diesel fuel containing 3 ppm of sulfur * Improvement of the overall efficiency and power-to-weight ratios of power electronics to within 25 percent of targets, while reducing cost by 86 percent to $10/kW since 1995 * Reduction in cost of lightweight aluminum, magnesium, and glass-fiber-reinforced polymer components to less than 50 percent the cost of steel * Reduction in the costs of fuel cells from $10,000/kW in 1994 to $300/kW in 2000 * Substantial weight reduction to within 5 to 10 percent of the vehicle weight reduction goal Criticisms Ralph Nader called PNGV \\"an effort to coordinate the transfer of property rights for federally funded research and development to the automotive industry\\". The program was also criticized by some groups for a focus on diesel solutions, a fuel that is seen by some as having inherently high air pollutant emissions. Elizabeth Kolbert, a staff writer at The New Yorker, described that renewable energy is the main problem, and that \\"If someone, somewhere, comes up with a source of power that is safe, inexpensive, and for all intents and purposes inexhaustible, then we, the Chinese, the Indians, and everyone else on the planet can keep on truckin'.

Israeli peace offers When Israel met Arab leaders who spoke the language of peace to their own people and were willing to take concrete steps for peace, such as President Sadat of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan, Israel made sacrifices for the sake of peace and reached peace agreements with them.http://www.israelemb.org/faq_main_peace.htm Peacemaking requires concessions and confidence-building measures on both sides. Just as Israel is willing to address the rights and interests of other parties in the conflict, Israelis insist that their rights and interests must be addressed as well. In 2000, at Camp David, the Palestinians were offered a nominally independent state. Led by Yasser Arafat, the Palestinians rejected this offer. When U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Israelis asked the Palestinians to offer a counter-proposal, Arafat declined and returned to the West Bank. Later, further negotiations did take place, but they were terminated. In his book The Missing Peace: The Inside Story of the Fight for Middle East Peace, Dennis Ross, the American ambassador and facilitator, writes that the idea the Palestinian state would be a \\"Bantustan\\" was a myth, and provides maps showing an offer that included contiguous territory. Arab peace offers The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has stated that it is prepared to recognize the state of Israel on the basis of the removal of settlements and retreat from Palestinian territory back to the 1967 borders. Israel maintains that Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, on grounds that Hamas's 'peace offerings' are a ploy. Arab hostility Many if not most Israelis believe that the conflict is largely a result of Arab attempts to destroy Israel, and that only Israeli military power stands between them and annihilation. They characterize the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War as attempts to destroy Israel. As evidence of this intent, pro-Israeli literature often places a heavy emphasis on statements made by Arab leaders during and preceding the wars. The following quotes are mainstays of these arguments: * \\"If Israel embarks on an aggression against Syria or Egypt. ... The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel.\\" (Gamal Abdel Nasser's speech to Arab Trade Unionists, May 26, 1967)http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign%20Relations/Israels%20Foreign%20Relations%20since%201947/1947-1974/7%20Statement%20by%20President%20Nasser%20to%20Arab%20Trade%20Unio * On May 30, 1967, Nasser proclaimed: \\"The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel ... to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.\\" (Isi Leibler, The Case For Israel, 1972, p. 60.) After Iraq joined the Arab military alliance on June 4, its president Abdur Rahman Aref announced: \\"The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear ‚Äì to wipe Israel off the map.\\" (Leibler, p. 18) Israel chooses to fight in self-defense SC 242, the Land for peace formula, was adopted on November 22, 1967 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War and the Khartoum Resolution. It called for withdrawal from occupied territories and for \\"termination of all claims or states of belligerency\\" and mutual \\"acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence\\" by Israel and the other states in the area, and recognized the right of \\"every state in the area\\" to live \\"free from threats or acts of force\\" within \\"secure and recognized boundaries\\". Immediately after the Six-Day War, Israel offered to return the Golan Heights to Syria and the Sinai Peninsula (including the Gaza Strip) to Egypt in exchange for peace treaties and various concessions, but Syria and Egypt refused the offer and this offer of land for peace was very soon withdrawn. Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian President at the time, proposed negotiations towards peace with Israel in the early 1970s but Israel refused the offer, claiming that it held unreasonable preconditions. Later Israel signed the Camp David Accords (1978) with Egypt and subsequently withdrew from all Egyptian territory it occupied. Many, including the original framers of the resolution, have noted that the English-language version of SC 242 did not state all territories occupied during the conflict, recognizing that some territorial adjustments were likely and rejected previous drafts with the word all (see UN Security Council Resolution 242). The French language translation of the text did include the definite article. Israel considers it has complied with this sense of the resolution when it returned the Sinai to Egypt in 1982. Israel has no partner for peace Israel says that it has demonstrated flexibility and understanding by bringing about the initiation of the peace process, agreeing to painful concessions, and partially implementing them. As opposed to this, many Israelis consider that the predominant Palestinian views of the peace process do not recognize Israel's right to exist, and believe that the only real long-term Arab goal is the complete destruction of the Jewish state. Non-recognition of Israel's right to exist and non- recognition of democratically elected Hamas Many Jews and supporters of Israel, and most Palestinians and supporters of Palestine, take the view that the very existence of the state of Israel is at stake. Most of the other parties to the dispute maintain formally that Israel should be recognized as a state, although some consider that it should be abolished. Some opponents of Israel do not even acknowledge its existence, refusing any contact with or mention of it, and instead describing it as \\"The Zionist Entity\\" with outdated land claims. On the other hand, Hamas were democratically elected to govern in Gaza, although they are regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel. It can be claimed that by refusing to recognise the democratically elected government of Gaza, Israel can effectively prevent meaningful peace negotiations indefinitely. Israelis argue that the continued Jewish presence in the area throughout the past three millennia, and the deep religious ties maintained by Judaism with the Land of Israel, give Jews a continuing and valid claim. Although the 1800 years preceding the establishment of Israel saw limited Jewish presence, they emphasize that the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel and Jewish Diaspora were due to foreign conquests. They also point out that since antiquity, Jewish beliefs were frequently branded as \\"obsolete\\" (see Against Apion, Supersessionism). It may also be noted that historical grounds are not the only reasons given for the establishment of a Jewish state. Israelis regard many of the Arab criticisms against the state of Israel as threats to the state's existence, and say that against the multitude and power of the Arab states, there is only one Jewish state, which, they feel, should behave vigilantly, and assert its power in both a defensive and preemptive manner as deemed necessary. Issues of democracy and fairnessTreatment of Jews in Arab-ruled societies and vice versa Some Israelis point to issues of unfair and prejudicial treatment of Jews in Arab-ruled societies historically and currently. Israelis say that Arab countries such as Syria and Yemen do not give full rights and freedoms to Jews, and others (such as Saudi Arabia) do not even allow Jews to be citizens. The United Nations Human Development Reports and human rights groups report that many Arab countries do not allow political opposition and other freedoms and lack checks and balances and separation of powers. They also argue that within Israel, Israeli Arabs are not subject to this type of discrimination. They point to Israel's democratic system which protects the rights of Jewish and Arab Israelis alike. Within the pre-1967 armistice lines, Arab and other minorities are given freedom of religion, culture and political organization. Several Arab political parties have elected parliament members in the Knesset. Arabs are typically not conscripted into the Israeli military (though they are accepted as volunteers), so they will generally never have to fight their peoples. However, it is recognized that this can affect later job opportunities, as some jobs in Israel require previous military service. Many Israeli Arabs, however, say that they are discriminated against, and that Israeli government agencies treat them worse than non-Arab Israelis. In 2004, the US State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices indicates that Israel \\"did little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens\\". =Islamic vs. other views of Land ownership= Some views focus on differences in concepts of land ownership as a root source of conflict. Sharia (Islamic law) contains the concept of Waqf, revenue-generating property as religious endowment that, once established, is permanent in nature. Under some traditional interpretations, Muslim territory encompass all land that was ever under Muslim control. The Hamas charter embraces this view of land ownership: \\"The Islamic Resistance Movement maintains that the land of Palestine is Waqf land given as endowment for all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. One should not neglect it or [even] a part of it, nor should one relinquish it or [even] a part of it. No Arab state, or [even] all of the Arab states [together], have [the right] to do this; no king or president has this right nor all the kings and presidents together; no organization, or all the organizations together ‚Äì be they Palestinian or Arab ‚Äì [have the right to do this] because Palestine is Islamic Waqf land given to all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection. This is the legal status of the land of Palestine according to Islamic law. In this respect, it is like any other land that the Muslims have conquered by force, because the Muslims consecrated it at the time of the conquest as religious endowment for all generations of Muslims until the Day of Resurrection.\\" Also concerning the oftly quoted Hadith, \\"The Last hour won't occur until you (Muslims) fight the Jews and kill them.\\"Sahih Muslim Book 41. Signs of Turmoil and the Last Hour Hadith 6981-6185 This view is not universally agreed in the Muslim world. Muslim scholars such as Abdul Hadi Palazzi, the leader of Italian Muslim Assembly, accept Israel's sovereignty over the Holy Land and Jerusalem, on condition that the rights of other religions are protected. Palazzi quotes the Qur'an to support Judaism's special connection to Israel, and claims that the Qur'an \\"expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims\\". =Characterizations of Zionism as racism and colonialism= Some Arabs believe that Zionism is a racist ideology, that implies the superiority of Jews. They view Jewish immigration, from the late 19th century, as a colonization of Palestinians' land. Most Israelis see Zionism as the desire of Jewish people to live as free people in the land of Israel, where the concept of Jewish nationhood first materialized somewhere between the 13th and 6th century BCE. They argue that Zionism does not imply the superiority of Jews over any other nationality or ethnicity, but is simply a re-establishment and realization of Jewish dreams of nationhood, autonomy, and self-determination. Religious Zionists also believe that Land of Israel was promised to Jews by God, whereas religious Muslims consider the Land of Israel to be an Islamic waqf, as it was historically conquered in the name of Islam, and should forever remain the provenance of the Islamic faith. People of many races, colors and ethnic backgrounds live in Israel. It is pointed out that Israeli Jews come from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. In the 1930s, ideas of a 'population exchange' of Arabs and Jews between Arab states and Israel were actually popular among Zionists. In practice, most Jews living in Arab Nations in 1948 have currently left Arab countries: 2/3 have moved to Israel. Zionism allows Arabs, Druze, Bedouin and other non-Jews to live in Israel as well, although by most interpretations it requires a Jewish majority to be established. While some extremist Israelis (particularly supporters of outlawed Kach party) believe in the forced transfer of Arabs from Israel, this is not a widely held view. Zionists hold that Zionism is not colonialism, since the area was the Jewish homeland, before Romans expelled the Jews from Palestine, in the 2nd century CE. They argue that Jews have the right to return to their historical national homeland, and that living in the Diaspora restricted the full growth of Jewish individual and national life. Refugee issuesJewish refugees= After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, most of the Jewish population in Arab countries fled, were expelled, were coerced by Arab governments, or voluntarily left their homes in an increasing climate of hostility, with nearly 66% absorbed by Israel. The State of Israel reacted by encouraging and facilitating emigration of non- local Jews to Israel. In a few Arab countries, this population change occurred over several decades and was accelerated by the promise of prosperity and acceptance in Israel. Many Jews lost much of their property and continue to claim compensation. There has since been various return invitations from Arab states although these are mostly dismissed as politically motivated attempts to discredit Israel, and virtually no resettled Jews have shown interest in returning to their former homes, as they have integrated in their new homes or fear persecution in Arab states. According to Benny Morris, \\"[i]n the early years of statehood, Israeli leaders like David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sharett viewed the flight of Palestinians and the influx of Oriental Jews as simply a 'population exchange,' akin to those between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s or India and Pakistan in 1947.\\" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri as-Said and other Arab leaders viewed it the same way. Many continue to view it this way. Some Palestinian refugees never accepted that a \\"population exchange\\" had occurred, though others do accept that an irrevocable population exchange has occurred. Furthermore, Israel has charged that Palestinian refugees were neglected by most Arab nations, whereas Jewish refugees were integrated into Israeli society, and that this neglect is a contributing cause to the poverty and misery experienced by the residents of those camps. =Palestinian refugees= Israel does not recognize a Palestinian Right of Return. Property that belonged to Arabs who left or fled Israel before, during and after the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War is confiscated under the Absentee Property Act. Israel maintains that the General Assembly resolutions establishing the Right of Return are merely recommendations under International law, and in any event doubt that the refugees wish to \\"live in peace with their neighbors\\". Jewish Israelis fear that if Palestinian refugees were allowed to return to Israel, the Jews would become a minority and Israel would no longer be a Jewish state. Many believe that if surrounding Arab states integrate the Palestinian refugees hostilities could be defused, and that the harsh treatment of refugees in Arab states is done deliberately by those states in order to keep the conflict alive. Israel has stated that it is willing to allow a limited number of Arabs to immigrate on a humanitarian basis (such as the unification of families) and limited compensation for others in the framework of a comprehensive peace plan. Although serious discussion of how this would be implemented between both sides have yet to take place. The text of UN Resolution 194 refer to a \\"just settlement of the refugee problem\\" and does not specifically mention either the Palestinian refugees or the Jewish refugees, nor what a \\"just solution\\" would entail. Nevertheless, this resolution is the primary basis for the concept of a \\"Right of Return\\" and is often referenced as if it were such. For example, in 2004, Resolution 59/117, the UN General Assembly \\"[n]otes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet been effected and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to be a matter of grave concern\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20060318104053/http://www.un.org/unrwa/publications/resolutions/2004/res59117.pdf Settlements Israelis typically of the political right, support settlements in the West Bank. The platform of the \\"Likud\\" party states that \\"settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel.\\" Israelis typically of the political left oppose settlements, believing they are illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention and/or thwart peace efforts. However, most Israelis do not view the building of houses and stores in Israeli settlements as an act of war, and believe that disputes over land do not justify violent resistance or terrorism, but that there should be politically negotiated solutions. This view is rejected by Palestinians and many outside Israel, as Israel's leadership continues to build settlements on land they contend to be Palestinian, an activity that is roundly condemned by much of the world except Israel and overlooked by the United States. Israel's settlement supporters argue that the Fourth Geneva Convention does not technically apply to the territories, since they have no \\"High Contracting Party\\", and claim that the Convention in any event only applied to forcible transfers of populations into or out of captured territories. However, a conference of High Contracting Parties in 2001 \\"reaffirmed the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem\\" and \\"they reiterated the need for full respect for the provisions of the said Convention in that Territory.\\" Palestinian and other Arab views There is not a single \\"Arab view\\"; there are many different Arab views, which differ widely. Nevertheless, Palestinian perspectives have mostly remained static throughout the conflict.Sela, Avraham and Neil Caplan. \\"Epilogue: Reflections on Post- Oslo Israeli and Palestinian History and Memory of 1948.\\" The War of 1948: Representations of Israeli and Palestinian Memories and Narratives, edited by Sela and Alon Kadish, Indiana University Press, 2016, pp. 203-221. Illegitimacy or illegality of Israel :See also International law and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Palestinians claim they have International law on their side. UN General Assembly Resolution 181 orders that \\"Independent Arab and Jewish States... shall come into existence in Palestine\\". Arab leaders and governments rejected the plan of partition in the resolution and indicated an unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division.[8] Their reason was that it violated the principles of national self-determination in the UN charter which granted people the right to decide their own destiny.[6] [9] Israeli founding father and author of Resolution 181 Abba Eban claimed that Israel \\"tear[s] up its own birth certificate\\" when it ignores UN resolutions. Palestinians hold that Israel disregards the following UN resolutions/International Law provisions: * UN General Assembly Resolution 194 calls for \\"the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property\\" not naming either Palestinian refugees or Jewish refugees. Palestinians hold that this resolution should allow for the Palestinian exodus to return to their homes in Israel. Israel has blocked the return of these refugees and confiscated their land as \\"absentee\\". * UN Security Council Resolution 242, adopted after the Six-Day War, emphasizes \\"the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security,\\" and calls for \\"withdrawal of Israel armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict\\" and for the recognition of the \\"sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force\\". These territories occupied included the Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, West Bank and the Sinai Peninsula. The Palestinian Authority intends eventually to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel maintains control of the West Bank and maritime/aerospace control of the Gaza Strip. * The Fourth Geneva Convention forbids an occupying power from confiscating occupied land and transferring its own population to that territory. * UN Security Council Resolution 446 declares that the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are illegal. Historical treatment of Jews in the Arab world Many Muslims and contemporary western historians assert that Jews were treated better by Muslims than by other rulers who persecuted them. One pertinent example is the mass expulsion of Jews from Spain after the fall of their last refuge there, the Muslim kingdom of Granada in 1492. This resulted in the migration of Jews (especially those fleeing the Spanish Inquisition) to the Ottoman Empire, including the present-day region of Israel and surrounding areas. Authoritative works summarizing Jewish treatment within Muslim lands written by Jews have concluded that although occasional violent persecution did occur, it was not systemic nor continuous and substantially better than treatment by Christians in the pre-modern era. (Lewis, 1984) Treatment of Palestinians Restrictions on Palestinian movements were introduced to increase levels of security within Israel and Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. They have been of variable severity over time. The international community often views these as punishments of the masses because of the actions of a few. This perception of unjust persecution provides a continuing rationale for hostility toward Israel. Bulldozing of houses and destruction of infrastructure within Palestinian residential areas in the name of Israeli security add to the poor conditions and lack of opportunities for the Palestinians. This is a frequently-used point of indignation against Israel by Palestinian sympathizers. Arab publications and others have compared Zionism to German Nazism and other historical examples of oppression and ethnic cleansing. Many Arabs, and others, believe Israel practices a form of Israeli apartheid against the Palestinian people, as bad as, or worse than, that practiced by South Africa, and that Zionism is a form of colonialism and has been carried out through extensive ethnic cleansing against the \\"indigenous people of Palestine\\", even though Jews are also indigenous to the area encompassing modern day Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and are closely related to the Palestinian Arabs. Furthermore, pro-Israel advocates reply that these claims are non-factual and the comparisons are specious, or with assertions that such claims are hypocritical, since Arabs have created twenty-two Arab states, in some of which the remaining Jews are discriminated against. Palestinians hold that the existence of other Arab nations is irrelevant; they want to have the land they owned back, rather than being forced to throw themselves on others' charity in foreign countries. Israel's Family Reunification Law allowed the Interior Minister to grant permanent resident status to West Bank Palestinians who have family members in Israel. A recent revision to this Law required that the Interior Minister \\"shall not grant\\" citizenship except in exceptional cases; recent additional modifications allow some citizenships, but limit based on age. In his comment to the Knesset Interior Affairs committee on July 19, 2005, Shin Bet Chief Yuval Diskin stated that \\"11% of those involved in terror attacks are Palestinians who entered Israel via the Family Reunification Law.\\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3115064,00.html Refugee issues UN General Assembly Resolution 194 calls for \\"the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property\\". Israel has blocked the return of these refugees and confiscated their land as \\"absentee\\". The supporters of Israel argue that the return of Palestinian refugees and millions of their descendants would mean the end of Jewish self-determination and assert the historical necessity for Jews to have a safe haven. See also Jewish refugees. Furthermore, some argue that Palestinians, if allowed to return, would not live in peace with their neighbours. Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip Map of Israeli settlements, in navy blue, in the West Bank There are currently 246,000 Jewish settlers living in settlements in the West Bank, not including 200,000 Israeli Jews who live in annexed East Jerusalem. Ongoing settlement development and growth are major reasons Palestinians claim the peace process has failed, and the issue figures prominently in the larger narrative of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict among non-Palestinian Arabs. To monitor and control Palestinian movement, Israel has established 50+ checkpoints in and around the West Bank. As well, recently, Israel has begun construction of a controversial West Bank barrier.see map Palestinians complain that these measures greatly restrict their movement and are often humiliating, while Israel asserts that they are necessary for security. Palestinians also point out that Israel accelerated the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip throughout the Oslo peace process. During Fateh Central Committee meeting on September 5, 2005, \\"[r]eferring to the lands Israel would evacuate in Gaza Strip, President Abbas said that 97.5% of these lands were state-owned lands\\". In 2005, approximately 9,000 settlers were evicted by Israel from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Arab Peace Offer In 2002, Saudi Arabia offered a peace plan in The New York Times and at a summit meeting of the Arab League in Beirut. The plan is based on, but goes beyond UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Resolution 338. It essentially calls for full withdrawal, solution of the refugee problem, and a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem in return for fully normalized relations with the whole Arab world. This proposal received the unanimous backing of the Arab League for the first time. In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said: \\"[T]he details of every peace plan must be discussed directly between Israel and the Palestinians, and to make this possible, the Palestinian Authority must put an end to terror, the horrifying expression of which we witnessed just last night in Netanya.\\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/About+the+Ministry/MFA+Spokesman/2002/Response+of+FM+Peres+to+the+decisions+of+the+Arab.htm Palestinians as victims of extremism Today, some Palestinians think that an equitable arrangement for all involved parties requires dialogue with Israelis and the international community. The PLO has officially accepted the right of Israel to exist within the pre-1967 armistice lines. However, some PLO representatives, including Yasser Arafat, have also declared at times that they saw these statements as politically necessary steps. Some observers interpret this to mean that they view the two-state solution as a stepping stone to a more integrated long-term solution. Others, particularly some Israelis, claim that these statements betray a hidden agenda and worldview where the peace process with Israel is only a temporary measure in support of the ultimate Palestinian goal, which is the destruction of the state of Israel, and presumably the eviction of its Jewish citizens. They point to the fact that the PLO never updated its formal statement of policy, the Palestinian National Covenant to reflect their recognition of the State of Israel and that it still calls for the destruction of Israel; however the U.S. Embassy in Israel is on record confirming that \\"On April 24, 1996, the Palestinian National Council (PNC) amended the charter by canceling the articles inconsistent with its commitments to Israel\\".Palestinian National Charter Amended . United States Embassy in Israel. Still, belief in an existential threat from the PLO causes alarm among much of the Israeli public. Mutual claims=Biased text books Many Palestinian school textbooks, including those distributed and sponsored by the Palestinian Authority since 1994, have historically minimized or ignored Jewish history of the land prior to the 20th century. Israeli textbooks and school curriculum also often ignore Palestinian history. Texts and school curriculum on both sides are accused of propagating \\"myths\\" about the history of the conflict, and relegating important points of view and facts. The role of the superpowers Palestinians cite many reasons for the perceived lack of support of their cause in the United States, despite the perception that it is more broadly supported in Europe. One such reason is postulated to be ethnic bigotry in the U.S.; while stereotyping of many other groups is no longer rampant, many people believe that Muslims, and Arabs in particular, continue to be vilified and victimized by crude attacks. There is also belief that American policy is largely shaped by American Jewish groups like AIPAC. It has also been argued that the U.S. continues to support Israel in order to have a strong foothold in the region for their own national interests, politically and economically. Many also cite the political nature of the Cold War that aligned the U.S. with Israel against the USSR and its allies in the region. The USSR traditionally used Arabs as a proxy in the Cold War against the Western world (and the West's proxy in the Middle East, Israel). Some of today's anti-Zionist rhetoric still reflects the position of Soviet Zionology. Peace and reconciliation Despite the long history of conflict between Israelis and Arabs, there are many people working on peaceful solutions that respect the rights of peoples on all sides.

They exist in two forms: as fast-burning events, leading to almost immediate loss of control, and as slow-burning pyrolysis which can continue for over a decade. They are noted for being difficult to extinguish. Such fires produce much smoke, which carries toxic chemicals from the breakdown of synthetic rubber compounds while burning. Tire fires are normally the result of arson or improper manipulation with open fire. Tires are not prone to self-ignition, as a tire must be heated to at least for a period of several minutes prior to ignition. Extinguishing tire fires is difficult. The fire releases a dark, thick smoke that contains cyanide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and products of butadiene and styrene. Burning tires are heated, and, as they have a low thermal conductivity, they are difficult to cool down. Moreover, they frequently burn inside even if they are extinguished from outside, and easily reignite when hot. One possible remedy is to cover the fire with sand, reducing the supply of oxygen and the exhaust of smoke. After extinguishing and cooling down (which may last several days), toxic chemicals can be neutralized. In Northern Europe, new and used tires are stored in large warehouses also known as tire hotels. Fire is a growing concern, and as tire fires are difficult to extinguish, regular sprinkler systems are not sufficient. Inert gas extinguishing systems like INERGEN in combination with an effective detection system would be the preferred choice for protecting these warehouses. Tests for establishing the minimum design concentration (MDC) are currently being performed in Denmark. Notable tire fires Some notable tire fires include: *1983 - Seven million tires burned for nine months in Winchester, Virginia, polluting nearby areas with lead and arsenic. The location was cleaned up as a Superfund project from 1983 to 2002. *1984 - A pile estimated at four million tires, known locally as Mount Firestone, ignited in Everett, Washington, and burned for months as the fire department was unable to extinguish it. *1989 - In Heyope (near Knighton, Powys, Wales) a fire involving approximately 10 million tires burned for at least 15 years. *1990 - In Hagersville, Ontario, a fire started in a pile of 12 to 14 million tires; it burned for 17 days and forced 4,000 people to evacuate. *1994 - In East Chicago, Indiana, a fire consumed 70,000 tons of tires and shredded rubber. It started on July 16, 1994 and burned until August 22, 1994. *1995 - The Hornburg tire fire in Sinclairville, New York burned over a million tires in a blaze lasting more than a week. *1996 - An arson in March at an illegal tire yard underneath a section of I-95 in Philadelphia caused $6 million in damage and completely closed a section of the highway for weeks and partial closures for six months. *1998 - A grass fire ignited the 7 million tires at the unlicensed S.F. Royster Tire Disposal Facility in Tracy, California. It was extinguished, after 26 months, with water and foam in December 2000. *1999 - On August 21, arsonists ignited the former Kirby Tire Recycling facility, containing an estimated 25 million tires located on near Sycamore, Ohio. The fire burned for 30 hours, involved over 250 firefighters, the Ohio National Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and caused significant environmental damage. The fire was controlled and finally extinguished in part by covering it with dirt. In the intervening years the EPA has performed a massive clean up effort on the site.http://www.epa.gov/reg5rcra/wptdiv/solidwaste/tires/large2.pdf *1999 - Lightning struck a tire dump in Westley, California, which burned for 30 days.

Well-known from The Lawrence Welk Show as the country/pop bass baritone from 1979 until its eponymous host retired in 1982, he was earlier cast on Broadway for the original Jesus Christ Superstar, while he was in New York City on a Nashville folk rock tour. He was nominated in 2008 for a Dove Award as a country and gospel singer for his first radio release in the Christian music genre. He is the founder of The Sounds of Purpose and remains on the board of directors of this music-charged charity. Life and career Born and reared in Knoxville, Tennessee, Turner got his early experience in a local band performing on the southeastern college concert and club circuit. He toured Europe as a youth soloist and classical guitarist for the University of Tennessee choir. After graduating with honors, majoring in Engineering Management and working summers in Music, he moved to the capital city of Nashville and launched a career in the lounges of country music, \\"jamming\\" with Doug Kershaw, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson. He found immediate success as a songwriter, session musician and recording artist. Booked on a trip to New York performing with a variety show, Turner auditioned on Broadway for Jesus Christ Superstar, singing the only ballad from Pilate (not with the rehearsal pianist, but his classically played acoustic guitar). Turner was the only lead role cast at that time. He went on to play the bass part of Caiphas, plus the screaming tenor of Pilate. After the Los Angeles run of Superstar, Turner decided to stay on the West Coast but returned to his country music roots while adding folk and rock to his acoustic guitar and vocals. He was entertaining on the Los Angeles club circuit (the Palomino, the Pasadena Ice House, the Troubadour), plus colleges, fairs and clubs throughout the country. Turner was signed to the GRC record label, and was produced by both Neil Wilburn and Larry Cox. In 1979, he was discovered at a \\"gig\\" by Welk reedman, Russ Klein, who suggested he audition for his boss, Lawrence Welk. Turner sang the Broadway ballad, \\"My Cup Runneth Over\\", with a classical arrangement he had worked out on his guitar while still in college. Turner became the show's featured country/pop singer for its final three years on syndicated television. Episodes in which he appeared are sometimes seen in weekly reruns in most states on PBS. On the show, and on its concert tours, he also performed duets with Ava Barber and sang with The Aldridge Sisters and with Gail Farrell in addition to his solo numbers. During the 1982 World's Fair, Turner starred in the Broadway pre-run of Drumwright, a project of two-time Tony Award winner, John Cullum. This original musical was booked for the next season at the Performing Arts Center. Instead of playing a \\"character\\" again, Turner returned to Los Angeles to sing, where he went on to headline in his own shows at Knott's Berry Farm, the former Opryland USA, plus long-term commitments on the General Jackson Showboat and at the Louise Mandrell Sunday Morning Show in the Grand Ole Opry. He was next cast as \\"Jud\\" in Oklahoma in Nashville. He also completed several tours all across the United States, on cruise ships, and in symphonic concerts, plus more recently, his Christian country concerts. Turner is also an ordained minister from the Church of Jesus of Nazareth, a non-denominational church in nearby Madison, Tennessee. He also obtained his doctorate in Contemporary Music from Oxford, England in 1993 upon submission of his body of work and thesis. His Master's work was accomplished at the Dick Grove School of Music in Hollywood, with a Major in Harmony. He is married to the former Terri Lynn Fraser. When he first met her in 1980, she was an audio engineer at ABC. They live near Nashville. He permits his label, High Anchor Records, to be used by new talent. Turner continues releasing songs to radio in five genres. His album, Sunday Best, was released in 2012. Turner's first radio song released on FrostByte Records received a Dove Award nomination for best singer.

The 140th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 22, 2006. The episode was the first after the departure of actor Isaac Hayes, who voiced the character Chef. Hayes, a Scientologist, left after a falling-out with the creators over their treatment of Scientology in the previous season's episode \\"Trapped in the Closet\\". Scientology has been accused of using brainwashing techniques, and the episode portrays Chef as having been brainwashed. In a press statement, Hayes was quoted as saying: \\"There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins.\\" While the statement did not directly mention Scientology, South Parks co-creator Matt Stone responded that Hayes' complaints stemmed from the show's criticism of Scientology and that he \\"has no problem ‚Äì and he's cashed plenty of checks ‚Äì with our show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons, or Jews.\\" Stone adds, \\"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begins.\\" Chef's dialogue in the episode is edited from previous recordings of Hayes. Plot After leaving South Park to join the \\"Super Adventure Club\\", Chef returns and the boys quickly notice that he is acting strangely as he expresses a desire to have sex with them. They go to the Super Adventure Club headquarters and discover that the group is made up of explorers who travel worldwide, molesting children. When the explorers' leader, William P. Connelly, unsuccessfully tries to hypnotize the boys, they realize that the club has brainwashed Chef. In an attempt to restore Chef to his former self, the boys take him to a strip club. Chef returns to his old self, but the Super Adventure Club members appear, and kidnap him. The boys follow them back to their headquarters and rescue Chef. As they are leaving, Connelly reminds Chef why he joined the Super Adventure Club in the first place, telling him that his life will be grand and eternal if he stays with them. Though the boys plead him not to, Chef walks back towards the club. However, the bridge that Chef is crossing suddenly gets struck by lightning and collapses, causing him to fall to his apparent death. As a funeral for Chef is held back in South Park, the Super Adventure Club members resurrect Chef as Darth Chef, now fully embracing the club's ethics. Production Series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone described season ten's production as turbulent, particularly more so than other seasons, because it seemed that each episode they produced caused controversy and thus resulted in distractions. They specifically cited the circumstances surrounding Isaac Hayes' departure from the show as being a catalyst for the extra attention the show began receiving. They decided to create \\"The Return of Chef\\" as a way of retaliating to the press release statement that Hayes had made regarding his departure. They thought that Hayes and the show had parted ways on good terms, and were somewhat angered by the release, calling it \\"ridiculous\\". Before that press release, however, Parker and Stone had been working on what would turn out to be \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\" and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\", with the intent to open the season with those episodes. They ran into difficulties with the network and postponed those episodes until later in the season. Parker and Stone felt that if the statement by Hayes was never released, they would not have produced more episodes involving Scientology. Reception The original television airing of the episode drew more than 3.5 million viewers, including 2.3 million aged between 17 and 49. This popularity made the episode Comedy Central's highest- rated season premiere since \\"Jared Has Aides\\" in 2002 according to a Comedy Central spokesman and Nielsen Media Research. The episode was also ranked fourth in video sales on iTunes. \\"The Return of Chef\\" received a generally positive critical reception. Eric Goldman of IGN reviewed the episode and gave it an overall rating of 8.0, noting the creation of new dialogue for Chef by splicing previous recordings of his character. Goldman also noted that the eulogy for Chef \\"probably says how Parker and Stone really feel about Hayes\\". Adam Finley reviewed the episode for TV Squad, and described the episode as \\"one of the funniest, and most memorable, of the series\\". Home release \\"The Return of Chef\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co- creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

In 1997, Hall formed a partnership with the state of New Jersey and Montclair State University, Floyd Hall Enterprises, which supervised construction of the 4,000-seat Yogi Berra Stadium, home field for the New Jersey Jackals baseball team, and a two-rink ice arena, Floyd Hall Arena, both located on the campus of Montclair State University. Hall sold the Jackals to Al Dorso in 2017 and the ice arena back to Montclair State in a transaction finalized in early 2020; the university then renamed the building the Montclair State University Ice Arena.

It was an armor- covered pareiasaur that lived around 265‚Äì254 million years agohttp://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=taxonInfo&taxon;_no=37565 in Russia, in the later Permian period. Its genus name refers to large plates of armor scattered across its body. It was a large anapsid reptile that, unlike most reptiles, held its legs underneath its body to support its great weight. Fossils have been found in the Sokolki Assemblage Zone of the Malokinelskaya Formation in European Russia, close to the Ural Mountains.  Research history  Restoration The first fossils were uncovered by Russian paleontologist Vladimir Prokhorovich Amalitskii while documenting plant and animal species in the Upper Permian sediments in the Northern Dvina River, Arkhangelsk District, Northern European Russia. Amalitskii had discovered the site in 1899, and he and his wife Anne Amalitskii continued to oversee excavation until 1914, recovering numerous nearly complete and articulated (in their natural position) skeletons belonging to a menagerie of different animals. Official diagnoses of these specimens was delayed due to World War I. The first published name of what is now called Scutosaurus karpinskii was in 1917 by British zoologist David Meredith Seares Watson, who captioned a reconstruction of its scapulocoracoid based on the poorly preserved specimen PIN 2005/1535 \\"Pariasaurus Karpinskyi, Amalitz\\" (giving credit to Amalitskii for the name). Amalitskii died later that year, and the actual diagnosis of the animal was posthumously published in 1922, with the name \\"Pareiosaurus\\" karpinskii, and the holotype specimen designated as the nearly complete skeleton PIN 2005/1532. Three partial skulls were also found, but Amalitskii decided to split these off into new species as \\"P. elegans\\", \\"P. tuberculatus\\", and \\"P. horridus\\". \\"Pariasaurus\\" and \\"Pareiosaurus\\" were both misspellings of the South African Pareiasaurus. In 1930, Soviet vertebrate paleontologist Aleksandra Paulinovna Anna Hartmann-Weinberg said that the pareiasaur material from North Dvina represents only 1 species, and that this species was distinct enough from other Pareiasaurus to justify placing it in a new genus. Though Amalitskii had used a unique genus name \\"Pareiosaurus\\", this was an accident, and she declared \\"Pareiosaurus\\" to be a junior synonym of Pareiasaurus, and erected the genus Scutosaurus. She used the spelling \\"karpinskyi\\" for the species name, but switched to karpinskii in 1937. At the same time, she also split off another unique genus \\"Proelginia permiana\\" based on the partial skull PIN 156/2. In 1968, Russian paleontologist N. N. Kalandadze and colleagues considered \\"Proelginia\\" to be synonymous with Scutosaurus. Because the remains are not well preserved, the validity of \\"Proelginia\\" is unclear. In 1987, Russian paleontologist Mikhail Feodos πevich Ivakhnenko erected a new species \\"S. itilensis\\" based on skull fragments PIN 3919, and resurrected \\"S. tuberculatus\\", but Australian biologist Michael S. Y. Lee considered both of these actions unjustified in 2000. In 2001, Lee petitioned the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to formally override the spelling karpinskyi (because Watson clearly did not intend his work to be a formal description of the species, and karpinskii was much more popularly used) and list the author citation as Amalitskii, 1922. Scutosaurus is a common fossil at the North Dvina site, and is known from 6 at least fairly complete skeletons, as well as numerous various isolated body and skull remains, and scutes (osteoderms). It is the most completely known pareiasaur. All Scutosaurus specimens date to the Upper Tatarian (Vyatskian) Russian faunal stage, which may roughly correspond with the Lopingian epoch of the Upper Permian (259‚Äì252 million years ago). In 1996, Russian paleontologist Valeriy K. Golubev described the faunal zones of the site, and listed the Scutosaurus zone as extending from roughly the middle Wuchiapingian to the middle Changhsingian, which followed the \\"Proelginia\\" stage beginning in the early Wuchiapingian.  Anatomy  Scutosaurus with a sprawling posture Pareiasaurs were among the largest reptiles during the Permian. Scutosaurus is a rather large pareiasaur, measuring about in length. The entire body would have been covered in rough osteoderms, which feature a central boss with a spine. These osteoderms appear to have been largely separate from each other, but may have been closely sutured together over the shoulder and pelvis as in Elginia. The limbs bore small conical studs. Pareiasaurs feature a short stout body, and a short tail. Scutosaurus has 19 presacral vertebrae. Pareiasaurs, as well as many other common herbivorous Permian tetrapods, had a large body, barrel- shaped ribcage, and engorged limbs and pectoral and pelvic girdles. The pareiasaur shoulder blade is large, plate-like, slightly expanded towards the arm, and vertically oriented. The acromion (which connects to the large clavicle) is short and blunt, like those of early turtles, and is placed at the bottom of the shoulder blade. In articulated specimens (where the positions of the jointed bones has been preserved), there is a small gap between the clavicle and the shoulder blade. Early pareiasaurs have a cleithrum which runs along the shoulder blade, but later ones including Scutosaurus lost this. The digits on the hands and feet are short. The dorsal vertebrae are short, tall, and robust, and supported large and strongly curved ribs. The broad torso may have conferred an expansive digestive system. Scutosaurus skull The cheeks strongly flare out and terminate with long pointed bosses. The bosses of the skull are generally much more prominent than those of other pareiasaurs. The maxilla features a horn just behind the nostrils. The two holes on the back of the palate (the interpterygoid vacuities) are large. All pareiasaurs have broad snouts containing a row of closely packed, tall, blade-like, and heterodont teeth with varying numbers of cusps depending on the tooth and species. Scutosaurus has 18 teeth in the upper jaw (which feature anywhere from 9‚Äì11 cusps), and 16 in the lower (13‚Äì17 cusps). The tips of the upper teeth jut outward somewhat. The tongue side of the lower teeth bear a triangular ridge, and some random teeth in either jaw can have a cusped cingulum. Unlike other pareiasaurs, Scutosaurus has a small tubercle (a bony projection) on the base of the skull between the basal tubera.  Palaeobiology  Scutosaurus was a massively built reptile, with bony armor, and a number of spikes decorating its skull. Despite its relatively small size, Scutosaurus was heavy, and its short legs meant that it could not move at speed for long periods of time, which made it vulnerable to attack by large predators. To defend itself Scutosaurus had a thick skeleton covered with powerful muscles, especially in the neck region. Underneath the skin were rows of hard, bony plates (scutes) that acted like a form of brigandine armor. As a plant-eater living in a semi-arid climate, including deserts, Scutosaurus would have wandered widely for a long time in order to find fresh foliage to eat. It may have stuck closely to the riverbanks and floodplains where plant life would have been more abundant, straying further afield only during times of drought. Its teeth were flattened and could grind away at the leaves and young branches before digesting them at length in its large gut. Scutosaurus swallowed gastroliths to digest plants. Given that it needed to eat constantly, Scutosaurus probably lived alone, or in very small herds, so as to avoid denuding large areas of their edible plants. Pareiasaurs had long been thought to be terrestrial, but it is difficult to assess their range of locomotion given the lack of modern anatomical analogues. In 1987, Ivakhnenko hypothesised that they were aquatic or amphibious due to the deep and low-lying pectoral girdle, short but engorged limbs, and thick cartilage on the limb joints, which are reminiscent of the aquatic dugong. Subsequent studies‚Äîincluding stable isotope analyses and footprint analyses‚Äîon various African and Eurasian remains have all reported results consistent with terrestrial behavior. Caseids have a broadly similar build to pareiasaurs, and possibly exhibited the same locomotory habits. Both have thin, porous long bones which is consistent with modern diving creatures, but the overall heavy torso would impede such a behavior. Nonetheless, similarly graviportal creatures have much thicker long bones. In 2016, zoologist Markus Lambertz and colleagues, based on the thin bones and short neck unsuited for reaching low- lying plants, suggested that caseids were predominantly aquatic and only came ashore during brief intervals. Overall, anatomical evidence seems to be at direct odds with isotopic evidence; it is possible that bone anatomy was more related to the animal's weight than its lifestyle. Like other pareiasaurs, Scutosaurus have been shown to have had a fast initial growth rate, with cyclical growth intervals. Following this possibly relatively short juvenile period, an individual would have reached 75% of its full size, and continued growing at a slower rate for several years more. This switch from fast to slow growth potentially signaled the onset of sexual maturity.  Paleoecology  Scutosaurus comes from the Salarevskaya Formation, which has a uniformly red coloration and comprises paleosol horizons, which deposit in cyclically shallow-water and dry area. The paleosol horizons are highly variable in shape and size throughout the formation, which may mean they came from different sources (polygenic). Paleosols gradually disappear in the upper part of the formation where the thickness of beds becomes much more discontinuous as well as irregular (from some millimeters to several meters), and the appearance of blue spots which may represent the accumulation of reduced iron oxides. These beds are capped off by a carbonate shell, varying from a small knot to up to a meter (3.3 ft) thick. The paleosols and shells feature holes left behind by plant roots, but these are absent in the clay-siltstone breccias and sand lenses. The formation has typically been explained as the result of several catastrophic floods washing over arid to semi-arid plains during wet seasons, featuring several temporarily filled channels and permanently dry lakes. Scutosaurus was a member of the pareiasaurian‚Äìgorgonopsian fauna dating to the Upper Tatarian, dominated by pareiasaurs, anomodonts, gorgonopsians, therocephalians, and cynodonts. Unlike earlier beds, dinocephalians are completely absent. Scutosaurus is identified in the Sokolki fauna, which features predominantly the former 3 groups. The only herbivore other than Scutosaurus is Vivaxosaurus. Carnivores are instead much more common, the largest identified being Inostrancevia (I. latifrons and I. alexandri); the other gorgonopsians are Pravoslavlevia and Sauroctonus progressus. Other carnivores include the therocephalian Annatherapsidus petri and the cynodont Dvinia; chroniosuchid and seymouriamorph amphibians have also been identified, including Karpinskiosaurus, Kotlassia, and Dvinosaurus. As for plants, the area has yielded various mosses, lepidophytes, ferns, and peltaspermaceaens.

He is also noted for his other contributions like preaching of Sikhism in West Punjab and abroad, punishing Shihan and Dhir Mal for the attack and initial settlement of Guru Tegh Bahadur at Anandpur Sahib. Birth and early life In 1619, he was born to Bhai Dasa Labana, who was devout Sikh of Guru Hargobind. There are different views of different scholars regarding his birthplace. Giani Gian Singh believes that he was born in Tanda, probably in Kashmir, but Col. Gurbachan Singh refute this claim.Retrieved from Labana Sewak, Oct 2007 Also, there many places with name Tanda in India like Mansura Tanda in Rajasthan, Khed Tanda;Basti Tanda;Sankpur Tanda;Chikvadi Tanda in Madhya Pradesh, Naka Tanda in Maharashtra, Anapur Tanda;Andhara ;Goda Tanda in Karnataka, Tanda in Kashmir and in Punjab there are multiple villages. Scholars like Max Arthur Macauliffe, GS Chabra, Sukha Singh believes that he was native of Kathiawar in Gujarat.. Following is commentary from Bhatt Vahis regarding background of Makhan Shah: * Makhan Shah, son of Bhai Dasa, grandson of Binai, maternal grandson of Beheru. Page 40, Guru Kian Sakhian, Saroop Singh Kashish * The cavalcade of Bhai Makhan Shah who was the Sikh of Guru, was going to Kashmir. The Satguru joined him there. After pilgrimage of Mutton Martand along with Bhai Dasa and Bhai Aru Ram, he reached the place of Bhai Makhan Shah at Mota Tanda. Bhai Dasa, father of Bhai Makhan Shah breathed his last there. He learned Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic and other languages, but his mother tongue was Labanki. Makhan Shah was married, according to Rajput Customs, with Sital Devi (also known as Suljai). She was daughter of Naik Puroshotam Das, belong to Sandlas caste of Naik Rajputs. They had a son who they named Bhai Lal Das. It is believed Lal Das took was baptized by Guru Gobind Singh and named as Naik Jawahar Singh who was martyred in the Battle of Chamkaur. Bhai Lakhi Shah Banjara had family and business relationships with Bhai Makhan Shah Labana (1619-1674), who was an international trader, and used to travel whole of the world. He had fleet of ships and was dealing through marines. Bhai lakhi Shah Vanjara, who was based at Delhi, use to coordinate the business activities at Delhi, of Bhai Makhan Shah Labana. (reference found in book Mahal Sikh Bhai Makhan Shah Labana 1940, written by Baba Harnam Singh and Diwan Singh Mehram page 27). Profession He continued his ancestral profession of merchant trading. Makhan was a merchant who used to bring valuable merchandise by land and sea and sell it wholesale in parts of Gujarat, Punjab in India and abroad up to Mediterranean. He traded in spices, Bengali silk, Kashmiri shawls. In India he used camels, oxen and horses, often pulling carts. He crossed beyond Egypt and sailed the Mediterranean with his goods, trading as far as Portugal. Discovery of Guru Tegh Bahadur The Sakhi (true story) of that discovery was recorded in \\"Janamsakhis\\" and told as stories for many generations of Sikhs. Ship Struck Incident His ship was caught up in a furious storm while he was sailing, fully loaded with trade goods northwards, up the coast of India towards the Gulf of Khambhat. It was terribly damaged, with the force of lightning splitting the mainsail, the sails hanging in shreds, the ship taking on water and when it seemed like he would lose the ship, Makhan decided his time had come to remember his Guru and ask for his help. Completely powerless, he knelt down, and said his Ardas (prayed) to God and Guru Nanak for safety. Miraculously the winds started to die down, and the wild seas calmed. Safely secure, in the very centre of the storm, the ship was carried past the dangerous rocks, and guided without further harm, through the treacherous waters, into the nearest harbour, the Port of Surat. From there he made his way to Punjab, where he made it his mission to fulfil his vow and present himself to his Guru and present the 500 Mohar to the Guru's charity.  Guru Harkrishan prophecy and Baba Bakala  Following Harkrishan's prophecy that the next Guru would be found in Bakala, he went there, arriving in August 1664. But on reaching Bakala he found as many as 22 people posing as the next Guru. He decided to offer only two Dinars (also given as five mohars ) to every one posing to be Guru Harkrishan's successor. The true Guru would himself demand the exact amount he had vowed to give. According to him it would not be possible for the false and imposters to define the exact purpose of his visit. Thereby their ignorance, lack of spiritual insight and character would be exposed. As expected, none of the imposters could recognise him, which still left him the problem of having to find the rightful Guru. Then he heard of the solitarian Teg Bahedur, son of Guru Hargobind. Makhan Shah was taken to see him on August 10, 1664 by a local youth. When Makhan placed the two Dinars before Tegh Bahadur, he remarked \\"God bless you, my man, why only two Dinars after pledging five hundred? The Guru is never in need of any thing but a Sikh is expected to keep his pledge to the Guru.\\" Thus the issue was clinched and the real Guru was discovered by Makhan Shah. Makhan Shah proclaimed that he would inform everyone upon discovering the True Guru. Guru Teg Bahadur was still desiring to meditate in solitude and told Makhan Shah not to tell anyone. The Guru tried to discourage him by saying his face would be blackened if he did so. (meaning dishonour will be obtained). Makhan Shah took this as a challenge instead of a curse and put ash on his face and climbed to the roof top to announce to all that he had found the Guru.

The Court held that a police officer is required to hold off on his or her investigation upon arresting an individual until the detainee has been informed of his or her rights and given sufficient information and access to contact a private lawyer or duty counsel. The case applied the earlier Supreme Court of Canada decision R v Brydges.[1990] 1 SCR 190 [Bridges]. The judgment was released with three other decisions: R v Pozniak,[1994] 3 SCR 310. R v Harper,[1994] 3 SCR 343. R v Matheson[1994] 3 SCR 328. and R v Prosper.[1994] 3 SCR 236. Background=Police investigation On 22 June 1991, Kenneth Bartle was arrested for impaired operation of a motor vehicle. The police officer then read the following to Bartle from a pre-printed card: > You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. You have > the right to telephone any lawyer that you wish. You also have the right to > free advice from a Legal Aid lawyer. If you are charged with an offence, you > may apply to the Ontario Legal Aid Plan for legal assistance. Bartle advised that he understood. The officer did not mention the existence of duty counsel, which could give immediate legal advice, or that there was a 24-hour toll-free number for legal aid. The officer asked Bartle if he wanted to speak to a lawyer \\"now\\", notwithstanding there was no telephone in the area. Bartle advised the officer that he had five or six beers at a baseball game that evening. Upon arrival at the police station, the officer again asked Bartle if he wished to speak to a lawyer \\"now\\". Bartle said no. Bartle then provided two samples of his breath, indicated that he had a blood alcohol content over the legal limit, and was charged accordingly. Trial The trial was held in the Ontario Court of Justice (Provincial Division). Bartle testified he waived his rights to counsel because he did not know whom to call or whom he could get hold of. The trial judge found there was no requirement for the police to advise Bartle of the existence of duty counsel or the toll- free number, and that there was no Charter infringement. Summary conviction appeal The summary conviction appeal was heard in the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division). The appeal judge found there was a requirement for the police to advise Bartle of the existence of duty counsel and the toll-free number, and that there was a Charter infringement. He went on the exclude the breath samples as evidence under section 24(2) of the Charter. Court of Appeal The appeal from the summary conviction appeal was heard in the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The court unanimously found that a detainee is not required to be advised of the existence of duty counsel or the toll-free number unless the circumstances warrant it (i.e., the detainee expresses concern about the availability of duty counsel). Consequently, there was no Charter infringement. Reasons of the Court There were two issues before the court: (1) does section 10(b) of the Charter require the police to advise a detainee of the existence of duty counsel; and (2) if so, should the evidence in Bartle's case be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter? Section 10(b) Lamer CJ wrote the majority decision. The majority found that the proper application of Brydges required the police to advise a detainee in all cases the existence of duty counsel and the toll-free number. Otherwise, a detainee cannot make an informed decision about whether to call a lawyer. In a concurring opinion, La Forest J agreed with the majority's decision entirely. McLachlin J also wrote a concurring opinion, agreeing with the majority's decision. She also found that Bartle's rights to counsel were infringed because he should have specifically been told he had the right to be told that he had the right to speak to counsel prior to incriminating himself before being charged. Although disagreeing with the majority on the ultimate issue (see below), Gonthier J agreed with the majority's decision on the scope of rights to counsel. In a dissenting opinion, L'Heureux-Dub√© J disagreed the police were required to always inform a detainee of existence of duty counsel or the toll-free number, since there is no constitutional requirement for such programs to exist in the first place. Section 24(2) Since the majority found that there was an infringement of the Charter, the next issue was whether the evidence should be excluded under section 24(2). In applying the test in R v Collins[1987] 1 SCR 265. (which has since been overtaken by the test in R v Grant2009 SCC 32.), the majority found that the evidence should be excluded, as the breath samples were compelled by statute. The majority also found that if the Crown wants to argue that a detainee would have made the same decision notwithstanding a Charter infringement, the Crown has the burden of proving that. The majority ultimately found that a court must not speculate on what a detainee might have done or said. La Forest J agreed with the majority, although he did not find the case for exclusion overwhelming. McLachlin J also agreed with the majority's decision. L'Heureux-Dub√© J found that even if she agreed with the majority on the first issue, she would not have excluded the breath readings. The breach was not serious, and the public is put at a very high risk due to drinking and driving. Although Gonthier J agreed with the majority on the first issue, he agreed with L'Heureux-Dub√© J's dissenting opinion on whether the evidence should be excluded.

It is the fourth game in the Battlefield series. Battlefield 2142 is set in 2142, during a new ice age, depicting a war known as \\"The Cold War of the 22nd Century\\", in which two military superpowers ‚Äì the European Union (EU) and Pan Asian Coalition (PAC) ‚Äì battle for the remaining unfrozen land during a new Ice Age. The game was designed primarily for multiplayer gameplay and allows for a maximum of 64 players on a server or a maximum of 16 players in single player mode against bots on Conquest mode. It has its own ranking system to keep track of the user's statistics similar to the one used in its predecessor, Battlefield 2. It opens up new categories of vehicles and weapons not seen in Battlefield 2. Battlefield 2142 has an unlock system that allows the player to choose a new unlock every time they achieve a new rank instead of forcing the player to purchase items. A booster pack called Northern Strike contains new maps, unlocks, and vehicles; a deluxe edition was released that contains Battlefield 2142 and Northern Strike. As of July 2014, all online components of the game have been deactivated following the shutdown of GameSpy. Gameplay The player character is looking towards an armoured walker that is being piloted by another player. Battlefield includes two gameplay modes, Conquest and Titan, the latter of which can only be played online in multiplayer maps (without using modifications (\\"mods\\")). Both modes support varying numbers of players, up to 64, depending upon the server a player chooses to join online. The single player mode consists of a maximum of 16 players, which includes 15 AI bots. Commander Mode from Battlefield 2 returns, as one player from each team can apply and either accept or turn down the role of becoming commander. The player in the commander position has vital roles in the game, such as deploying UAV's, artillery strikes, airdropping supplies or vehicles for his team. Classes Battlefield 2142 features four different playable kits. These kits can be selected at any time during gameplay. The kits are a combination of the kits in Battlefield 2, which had seven playable kits, but were less customizable and upgradeable in comparison. Each kit has different weapons and equipment that are unique. Each contains a basic weapon, a secondary weapon, and a knife. The knife differs in this game from Battlefield 2 because when a player is killed with a knife, the killer acquires the player's dogtag. The player is able to gain rank, options, and equipment by acquiring points in the game. Battlefield 2142 has customization, allowing the player to gain more unlocks for one kit, which makes it more effective. Each class has two unlockable weapons and one passive unlock which upgrades the soldier's helmet, each helmet upgrade having different functions. The benefits of one soldier's helmet upgrade will be shared with their squadmates. *Assault: The Assault and Medic classes from Battlefield 2 are combined as the Assault kit in Battlefield 2142. The main weapons are assault rifles with unlockable rocket or shotgun add-ons. Other unlocks include advanced first-aid kits which can be deployed to restore the health of anyone standing close to it, smoke grenades for screening, and a defibrillator for reviving fallen comrades. *Engineer: The Engineer class works the same way it was intended since Battlefield 1942. Engineer can still repair vehicles and have the access to heavy weapons that can damage and destroy enemy vehicles, such as rocket launchers and mines. *Support: The Support class provides ammunition with ammo boxes and can deploy turret guns and electric shields to help the team in the close quarters combat. *Recon: The Recon kit is aimed to provide perimeter support for the team with high velocity sniper rifles. In the other hand the Lambert-carbine is a full-automatic carbine weapon suitable for the assault gameplay style and combined with RDX explosives and the cloaking device recon turns into special ops class. Conquest Conquest mode, similar to its predecessors, involves two teams of players fighting each other while working to capture and defend spawn points. Spawn points are represented by flags and display the color of the controlling faction. To hold a simple majority of flags will initiate a ticket drain on the opposing faction, which will only speed up if one faction controls all the flags. Both teams begin the match with a preset number of tickets. Each time a soldier dies, a ticket is removed from their team. Players have the opportunity to reduce their number of lost tickets by reviving their \\"critically wounded\\" teammates with the Assault class' defibrillator. By reviving a teammate within 15 seconds (or the amount of time the server has been set to), no ticket will be lost and the player will not need to respawn (the player who killed the now revived player will keep their kill point). The team that has no tickets, or no places to spawn with no one alive, loses the match. There are several types of Conquest modes: Head-on, Assault, Assault Lines, and Double Assault Lines, Conquest Assault, No Vehicles. *In Head-on, both teams start with one flag that cannot be captured. The rest of the flags are neutral. *In Assault, play in either of the Assault Lines modes. *In Conquest Assault, which is identical to normal Assault in both its coding and function, the PAC starts with one uncapturable flag (an immobile Titan), while the EU starts off with the rest of the flags and an immobile Titan which can be captured by the PAC. *In No Vehicles, infantry are the only option, which will stack with the conquest mode that the map uses. No vehicles will spawn, including static ground turrets. Titan The Titan mode involves players from opposing teams whose objective is to destroy the other team's Titan, while trying to defend their own. Titans are massive, heavily armored, flying warships that have powerful force fields protecting them from enemy intrusion or conventional weapons fire. As the force fields are up during the first part of a battle, players must fight to control the anti-Titan missile silos scattered about the battlefield on the ground. Titans can be moved around the battlefield, but only by the team's Commander. Each Titan can defend itself and contribute to the fight on the ground with 4 anti-ground guns and 2 anti-aircraft guns. Titan movement can cause latency issues, so some players prefer not to move them at all. Some servers even disable the commander's ability to move the Titan. After the shields are down, there are two methods to destroy the enemy Titan. One way is to simply remain on the ground and hold the anti-Titan missiles until they wear down the hull. A quicker alternative is to board the Titan using \\"assault pods\\" launched from an APC (Armored Personnel Carrier), air transport, Titan, or spawn beacon, spawn on your squad leader, or land an air transport on a Titan as a mobile spawn point. Once inside, the players must destroy 4 reactor consoles to gain access to the reactor room. There, they can blow up the reactor, and have 30 seconds to flee the Titan before it is destroyed. During the beta release of the game, players who managed to escape the destroyed Titan before the 30-second timer ended received an award. In the retail game, the round ends when the Titan is destroyed, and because player deaths triggered by the end of a round do not count, the evacuation of the Titan had little significance aside from inciting a rush in the player. In patch 1.05, DICE reinstated the award for those attacking players who escaped the destruction in the \\"Titan Survival Pin.\\" However, receiving the pin requires very precise timing to land on the ground, causing confusion amongst players initially. Vehicles The vehicles of Battlefield 2142 are similar to those in Battlefield 2 except for a more futuristic design. For example, the PAC team tank, the Type 32 Nekomata, has a hovercraft driving system. The air vehicles are more futuristic, propelled by turbines instead of rotors. Almost all vehicles have a short duration protective shield called active defense. The active defense protects the vehicle from all attacks (except for electromagnetic attacks) for about five seconds. Statistics tracking The ranking and points system of Battlefield 2142 is similar to Battlefield 2, however, different ranks are featured. As with Battlefield 2, a key feature of the game is \\"Character Persistence\\", which saves and tracks almost every aspect of gameplay for players. Unlike Battlefield 2, however, the user is given the option to create up to four soldiers, as opposed to Battlefield 2's limitation of one per account. When playing the game in online multiplayer mode on specified servers, a master server tracks player points, ranks, equipment, and other statistics. Ranks The Battlefield 2142 rank system consists of a number of partially fictitious, partially realistic military ranks, and are (for the most part) each divided by a silver/gold format, with players attaining the silver version of the rank (e.g. Corporal Silver) before reaching the gold rank (e.g. Corporal Gold). New ranks are earned by attaining experience points, which can be earned for actions on a ranked server such as killing an enemy soldier/vehicle, healing/resupplying teammates, repairing ally vehicles/strategic objects (SAT Track, UAV, Orbital Strike, and EMP Strike which are located at the main base), capturing/neutralizing control points/missile silos, assisting in kills (such as piloting a gunship) or carrying out orders given by the Squad Leader/Commander (negative points may be earned by actions such as teamkilling). The rank system is designed to be progressive so ranks are earned faster when a player begins (for example, 40 points are needed to climb from the lowest to the 2nd lowest rank while 3600 points are needed to advance from the 2nd highest to the highest rank). This provides new players with a number of unlocks straight away to give them an edge (as well as ambition). Later ranks require more effort, time, and skill from the player as the extremely high number of points can usually be attained only through awards (which may give up to 2000 points apiece). The final three ranks of the game are only given to a certain number of players at a time, with Major General given to 50 players, Lieutenant General given to 25 players, and the highest rank, Supreme Commander, given to only one player at a time. These top three are brevet ranks; players retain those ranks until other players surpass them. Awards Awards can be earned only in multiplayer mode, with each award having its own specific criteria. Most awards typically have two to five criteria, composed of In A Round (IAR) criteria and Global criteria. IAR criteria must be accomplished within a single round, not through multiple rounds. Global criteria is accumulated by playing on a ranked server. For example, the Titan Commander badge (silver) requires a player to be the commander in Titan mode for twenty minutes in one round after accumulating 1000 commander points in Titan mode globally. Each award (with the exception of medals, which are more for prestige, since they are the hardest to obtain) delivers a certain number of experience points, which go towards attaining a new rank. Badges, which have three levels of achievement (bronze, silver, and gold), and ribbons deliver the most points, while pins offer very few points since they are relatively easy to get, and may be obtained more than once. Unlocks In Battlefield 2142, every time a player earns a new rank, they are able to choose a new unlock. Players with the Northern Strike Booster Pack are also able to earn unlocks by earning the badge or ribbon awards associated with Northern Strike. There are a total of 50 unlocks (40 Battlefield 2142 Core Game, 10 Northern Strike) and there are different categories of unlocks including class unlocks, squad unlocks, and ability unlocks. Class unlocks are specific to the class type which is being used. Ability unlocks are universal for all the classes. Squad unlocks can be equipped by anybody but they may only be used by squad leaders who have the required number of members in their squad. Unlocks are in tiers and require the player to progress up through the tree to unlock higher-level equipment. The player can test the other unlocks by picking up a dead soldier's equipment who is higher rank and contain more unlocks than the player. A \\"Field Upgrade\\" is a temporary unlock which can be awarded to all members of a squad when they either kill, resupply, heal or revive a teammate while they are following an attack or defend order. The Field Upgrade is a sort of 'try before you buy' feature (while the player has their own customizable inventory), allowing players to experience certain unlocks before they use one of their hard earned unlock credits to unlock it. They only allow players to test the equipment one level higher on their original unlock tree. Field Upgrades will be available to the player until the player disconnects from the server. If a player unlocks a new item which they have already Field Upgraded on their current server, the next unlock will not become available to them for a Field Upgrade until they leave the server. Certain unlocks are only available after purchasing the Northern Strike booster pack, and they are on top of all the other unlocks in the unlock trees of the core game. Field Upgrades also allow players without Northern Strike to have temporary access to the upgrades that are only available in Northern Strike. Field Upgrades are only applicable on ranked servers. Synopsis In the year 2106, a new ice age began. As the ice expanded, millions of people all over the world were displaced, particularly in Russia and Japan. Combined with their increasing inability to find sufficient natural resources, the Pan Asian Coalition grows desperate. Meanwhile, the European Union is able to withstand the displacements and find sufficient resources, mostly from North Africa due to their relationship with the Union of African States (Africa remaining mostly ice-free). Seeing this, the PAC launches a full-scale invasion of Europe and North Africa in 2139, beginning the Cold War of the 22nd century, a war for the world's last remaining land and resources. The Final Stand multiplayer expansion pack for Battlefield 4 gives new insight about the cold war, revealing that the PAC was formed as early as 2020 (the year Battlefield 4 takes place) as early versions of the coalition's symbol can be seen. Furthermore, early prototypes of Titans and other vehicles and futuristic technology were already in development in 2020 by the PAC in remote regions of Russia. Development Battlefield 2142 was rumored to be in development ever since a 30-second video was leaked to the Internet in January 2006. The video described itself as an \\"internal test.\\" The proof of concept depicts the game's various vehicles storming through a futuristic city. A screenshot depicting the walker was taken from this video and subsequently used in marketing for the game. The rumors began in earnest following a February 2006 interview with Dan Blackstone, a senior producer from Electronic Arts, in which he mentioned \\"We're about to announce something very big, so stay tuned. One other interviewer asked this and I gave him a hint, so it's only fair that I do the same for you: 3213/3*2. Or said another way: S.R. 4588164.\\" The square root (\\"S.R.\\") of 4588164 is 2142 (3213√∑3√ó2 equals 2142 as well), hence the rumors. The only proof of existence was the cover story of the PC Gamer magazine and the trailer, published on the very same magazine, until March 21, 2006, when Electronic Arts and DICE announced that, the next game in the Battlefield series would be Battlefield 2142, in their March 21, 2006 Community Update. Several pieces of early concept art were released onto the internet. However, during a hacking attack on the board where the images were posted, most of the images were lost. Early in the development process, the game was set on a different planet, as hinted by three moons in the sky in one piece of concept art. Additionally, it was to be the United States, rather than the European Union, versus the Pan-Asian Coalition, and several files within the game indicate the U.S. (most notably the texture files used by the EU and PAC, with the EU folder being labeled 'US' rather than 'EU'). In the Battlefield 2 Armored Fury Booster Pack map Midnight Sun, there was a drivable muscle car with license plate number 2142. Additionally in Armored Fury, there was a billboard advertising a digital wrist watch, which displays '21:42' as the time, and a Mushroom cloud with the caption message, \\"Watch For The Future.\\" Additionally in Armored Fury, the drivable semi-truck had a magazine on the passenger seat that reads \\"Ice Age Approaches.\\" Battlefield 2142 was officially announced and playable at E3 2006.\\" The Battlefield 2142 beta was released in the third week of August. However, it was revealed that the beta was not a complete \\"open\\" beta upon its release. At first, the general belief was that it was to be a FilePlanet subscriber-only beta, but it was later revealed to additionally have an invite system. At that time the beta was only available to certain FilePlanet subscribers (keys were given out on a first-come, first-served basis) and those who were invited. Some fansites had been holding contests giving out invitations to the BF2142 beta as prizes. On August 31, a large number of keys were given out by FilePlanet for free, and the beta client was upgraded. The FilePlanet beta ended on September 12, 2006. It was noted by many users that at the beginning of the beta the game worked great, but by the end it was horribly broken, with players getting stuck in walls and titans disappearing into thin air. It was decided to ship it anyway. At the 2007 WWDC, it was announced that Battlefield 2142 would be released for Macintosh computers in July 2007. It was released in 2007, for Mac OS X. Since the game uses Cedega it will only work with Intel based Macintosh systems and not PowerPC. Advertising components Battlefield 2142 shipped with dynamic in-game advertising provided by IGA Worldwide. A similar system is featured in games such as Battlefield 2, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, and PlanetSide. The system changes advertisements on objects such as billboards in-game. These in-game advertisements have been dubbed adware by some, and there has been a vocal backlash against this element of the game. Additionally, much of the recent \\"advertising space\\" has been used to show propaganda for new in game features and helping to feed rumors of a new game type in the works. Intel has advertised in the game, and recently the Discovery Channel has placed advertising in the game for their Future Weapons series. More recently advertisements for the DVD release of the movie Ghost Rider have appeared. An in-house advertisement for Battlefield: Bad Company have appeared recently, stating such things as \\"Celebrating the 134th anniversary of the Battlefield: Bad Company demo.\\" Another current one is advertising the DVD and Blu-ray release of I Am Legend. Billboards without paid advertisements generally have recruitment posters for the factions, and ads for \\"DICE Travel.\\" These travel ads sell the reader into going to the various maps, such as Verdun or Berlin, for ¬£2142, with taglines such as \\"Gun not included\\" and \\"One-way.\\" Some billboard ads recently added after the new year can be found during the gameplay saying \\"Happy 2143 EU Soldiers!\\" Additionally there is a reference to the sci-fi film Starship Troopers, and by extension, World War II recruitment posters, on billboards featuring the slogan ‚Äì \\"He's Doing His Part. Are You?\\" Ads have also recently appeared for the Northern Strike booster pack, displaying pictures like those of the Goliath, with a tag line of \\"A soldier's best friend\\", and PAC propaganda posters with the faction flag and a line reading \\"–ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞ –∑–∞–≤–æ—ë–≤–∞–Ω–∞!\\" (\\"Europe is conquered!\\"), in Russian. In the UK, ads consist almost entirely of ads for Intel Core 2 Duo which states \\"Battle- Tested\\" and EA's own Northern Strike. More recently in Britain (August 2007), the bank Lloyds TSB placed adverts in-game showing various accounts and products available from them. Also recently, billboards sporting ads for Battlefield: Bad Company have been popping up. The most recent of which being advertisements for Bad Company's free Conquest mode addition. Updates EA Games released five updates for Battlefield 2142. These addressed various issues in-game, some of which are causes of minor imbalance (for example, a bug causing the missiles of one faction's gunships to be homing while the other faction's gunship had \\"dumb\\" missiles). However some players complained that minor issues (such as small bullet deviation adjustments to guns) were repeatedly tweaked while major issues (exploits which allowed sentry guns to locate players behind walls, allowed critically wounded players to \\"see through\\" the whole Titan, and \\"Pod Surfing\\" which would allow players who altered their controls to extend the APCs' and Squad Leader Beacons' drop pod range almost infinitely) remained unaddressed. Certain fixes have also created more problems. For instance, an exploit that allows players to reach normally inaccessible locations such as high rooftops was remedied in the 1.25 update. However, the fix had repercussions in the form of equipment that can kill the player or become stuck on map geometry. Patch 1.4 fixed many of these exploits and enhanced certain features of the game. Three major additions (in 1.40) are the new map Highway Tampa, and an auto save feature that saves the last kit layout used for each class (although there have been noted problems with certain weapons and gadgets randomly being saved incorrectly). The 1.40 update allows a second gunship to spawn on each titan after the first one has taken off. In the Highway Tampa map, there are a total of three gunships per faction. Patch 1.50 was released for Windows-based systems on May 30, 2008 and includes 2 new maps ‚Äì Wake Island and Operation Shingle ‚Äì as well as numerous bug fixes and game enhancements; a mid-June 2008 announcement on the Battlefield website indicated that Patch 1.50 would eventually also be released for the Mac OS; the Mac patch became available. The latest patch to date, Version 1.51, featured the 4 new maps of Molokai, Yellowknife, Operation Blue Pearl, and Strike at Karkand as well as a Northern Strike booster pack. Music An official soundtrack has been released, containing 14 songs, including a new version of the classic Battlefield: 1942 theme. Each song (excluding tracks 1, 6, 7, and 14) corresponds with a map from the game. All tracks were composed by Gregor Narholz. Release=Demo EA released an online-only standalone demo of the retail game, featuring the Sidi Power Plant map, with either conquest or Titan modes. Demo versions were limited to demo- only servers, of which a few were initially run by EA, but were quickly supplanted by player run servers. Ranked points or unlocks could not be earned in the demo, though several demo servers ran their own ranking system. The demo was not updated in parallel with the complete game, and so several exploitable glitches and bugs existed, though most were patched or policed by the demo modding community and server admins. Unlike in the full game, a modding community thrived within the demo servers, primarily because of the static frozen environment untouched by patches, and the desire and competition between server administrators, to create fresh and diverse features to add to an otherwise limited gaming environment. EA discontinued support for the demo August 11, 2011; it is no longer possible to create a player character in the demo game client, or login with an existing demo account to an EA player database server, which essentially renders the demo game no longer functional. Retail bonuses * Collector's Edition: A Collector's Edition of the game was released on DVD, which came in a numbered metal box. This edition came with a Battlefield 2142 chain and handphone strap, as well as a free rank. * Best Buy: Players who pre-ordered Battlefield 2142 from Best Buy were not only given a free 64MB dog tag styled flash drive, but also a free \\"downloadable assault weapon\\", which replaced the existing standard EU assault rifle (Scar 11), with the \\"Bofors Defense Machine Gun\\", which was a cosmetically changed version of the same weapon. The Bofors Defense Machine Gun causes many players to reinstall the game and sell the code for the price difference because of the massive size of the weapon compared to the SCAR 11. * GameStop: Players who pre-ordered Battlefield 2142 from GameStop received a free in-game rank. This rank was stackable with the Battlefield 2 Veteran's Program promotion, allowing players to begin halfway through the second rank upon release of the retail game. * BF2 Veterans Program: People that played Battlefield 2 could participate in a \\"Veterans Program\\" that let them reserve their name for Battlefield 2142 before launch, get an immediate in-game rank-up, placed the red '2' from the Battlefield 2 logo next to their in-game BF2142 username during play, and receive exclusive verbal taunts to use against other players in Battlefield 2. Reception Battlefield 2142 received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Battlefield 2142 generally received positive reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Hyper's Kosta Andreadis commended the game for its \\"Titan Mode, refined reward and promotion system [and] well designed maps\\". However, he criticized it for \\"lag issues when boarding Titans\\". Months after the buggy initial release, EA released a patch which resolved most of the game's bugs; official widescreen support didn't come until the 1.5 patch was released for the PC version of the game on May 30, 2008. The Mac version of the patch was released two months later, on August 1, 2008. Northern Strike On March 8, 2007, Electronic Arts released the Northern Strike booster pack for the Battlefield 2142 game. However, in the UK, retailers are selling empty Northern Strike game boxes containing a download code for those who wish to purchase the booster pack in the digital form. In Northern Strike, the battle moves to northern and central Europe and is set in 2145. The PAC has set up strongholds in the urban areas left abandoned due to their constant assault, and the advancing ice sheets. The EU launches an offensive to take back its land from the PAC. This fictional invasion greatly resembles the 1944 invasion of Normandy, whereas Europe was finally reclaimed by Allied Forces after an invasion expedition had arrived. The booster pack contains ten new unlocks, three new maps, two new vehicles, and a new game mode called Assault Lines. The booster pack was exclusively available through the EA Link for $9.95 US$; Since January 2008, Battlefield 2142 Deluxe Edition contains Northern Strike. It is now available from retailers outside the U.S. Awards and unlocks Northern Strike contains eleven new awards: Four new ribbons, two new badges (with three ranks each), and a new pin. Each new award in Northern Strike is worth one equipment unlock credit including each level of the badges for a total of ten unlock credits (except the pin, which is worth 10 career points toward a player's in-game rank). While these unlocks can be used to unlock Northern Strike items, they can also be used to unlock items from the core game. While it is not possible to permanently acquire Northern Strike unlocks without purchasing the expansion, they can be chosen as Field Upgrades if the unlocks preceding them are unlocked, or can be used by picking up the equipment of a fallen soldier if that soldier had a Northern Strike unlock equipped when they died. Maps Northern Strike offers three new maps, Bridge at Remagen, Liberation of Leipzig, and Port Bavaria. The new maps, which are the only available maps for Assault Lines (excepting the Highway Tampa map, obtained through the 1.40 patch), are the only maps that spawn either of the new vehicles, and feature relatively large numbers of Battlewalkers but no tanks and little air support outside of Titan Mode, which is also available on the Port Bavaria and Bridge at Remagen maps. They also feature a new \\"Horizontal Pod Launcher\\" structure that functions similarly to the Pod Launchers found on the Titans (but with reduced range and a maximum time after the player gets in until the pod is automatically launched). Assault Lines Assault Lines mode is similar to Conquest, but with a couple of major differences. Most asymmetrical Conquest maps feature the PAC as the attacking force with the EU defending, whereas Assault Lines reverses the roles. In Assault Lines, the APCs on Port Bavaria and the Goliath are spawn points for troops, much like they are in Titan mode, however the Goliath may not be stolen by the other team. Finally, the PAC home base cannot be captured until every other base on the map belongs to the EU team before they can begin claiming the base as their own. Completion of this awards a pin to those playing as EU at the time, players who switch teams after the home base has been captured do not receive the pin. If the PAC successfully recaptures the base and controls at least one other point on the map then it becomes locked again while the EU can not lock this point even through controlling all other points on the map. Reception Northern Strike received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", albeit slightly less than the original Battlefield 2142, according to Metacritic.

It is a part of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system. Its feeder school is Severna Park Middle School. SPHS opened its doors to students in 1959, making it the fourth public high school in Anne Arundel County, being built after Arundel, Annapolis, and Glen Burnie High Schools. Its current principal is Mr. Patrick Bathras, who has been at the school since 2008. A new school was built on the same grounds, and opened in January 2017. Severna Park High has gained a strong reputation in Anne Arundel County for its consistent success in academics and athletics. Severna Park High School students consistently achieve high scores in the High School Assessment (HSA). On a national level, the school was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 2011 and hosted nine National Merit Scholarship finalists in 2006. The Falcons are sport rivals with nearby Broadneck High School and have excelled at the state level in lacrosse (both the boys and girls lacrosse teams were state champions in 2007), field hockey, swimming and cross-country. The school's mock trial team has won the state championships in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2015. Academics and Rankings Severna Park High School has often been ranked among the best high schools in Anne Arundel County and the state of Maryland. Severna Park High School was ranked among the top 10 high schools in Maryland and the top 300 - 400 high schools in the country by U.S. News & World Report in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2020. The first year that U.S. News released high school rankings, 2012, Severna Park High School was ranked as the number 1 high school in the entire Baltimore region and number 211 in the United States. U.S. News included Anne Arundel County Public Schools, Howard County Public Schools, Baltimore County Public Schools, Carroll County Public Schools, Baltimore City Public Schools, Harford County Public Schools, and Queen Anne‚Äôs County Public Schools as being part of the Baltimore region.. In 2020, U.S. News ranked Severna Park as the 3rd best high school in the Baltimore region, the 9th best school in the state of Maryland, and #403 in the United States. In 2018, the Maryland State Department of Education began assigning star ratings to schools in the state. In 2019, Severna Park High School and all the other schools within the Severna Park feeder system received a 5/5 star rating. Severna Park‚Äôs ratings were among the best in the state of the Maryland, with its scores being comparable to that of the Walt Whitman High School feeder system in Bethesda. In 2020, GreatSchools gave Severna Park High School a 10/10 score in terms of racial equity and said that the school is successfully closing the academic achievement gap between white students and disenfranchised ethnic minority students. Black and Asian students‚Äô test scores and performance at the school were rated a 10/10, and Hispanic students‚Äô performance at the school were rated a 8/10, the same as that of white students. However, the school has notable equity issues when it comes to low-income students‚Äô scores and performance Academic competition= It's Academic!  Severna Park High School It's Academic competes in a regional game show against outstanding students from other high schools. The team has been the top Anne Arundel County team in back-to-back years and has also reached the Baltimore semifinals in 2015, 2016, and the finals in 2017. Mock trial The mock trial team has been a powerhouse in the county for many years and did not lose in county competition until 2009. In their 2010 run to the State Championship, the mock trial team went undefeated. The team reached the State Championship level in 2015 after being undefeated in the county and regional competitions, and won.

The Court upheld the Albertan provincial Communal Properties Act of 1955, which among other things, restricted the amount of land that could be owned by Hutterites and Doukhobors. The Act required that those wishing to use land for communal colonies must first obtain the permission of the provincial government. It was intended to restrict communal use of land, but had the effect of discriminating against religious groups. Paul Walter, not a Hutterite, wished to sell his land to a group of Hutterites and was prevented from doing so by the Communal Properties Act. The plaintiffs argued that the Act was \\"colourable\\" legislation (i.e. law that had a hidden purpose), and that its true purpose concerned freedom of religion, which is a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government. The Court unanimously upheld the Act. The pith and substance of the Act, the Court said, related to land ownership in Alberta. Accordingly, property within the province was a valid matter of provincial jurisdiction, even though it had an incidental effect on religion.http://scc.lexum.org/en/1969/1969scr0-383/1969scr0-383.html See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Richards Court through Fauteux Court) References Category:Canadian federalism case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Supreme Court of Canada case articles without infoboxes Category:1969 in Canadian case law Category:Christianity and law in the 20th century Category:Canadian property case law Category:Hutterites in Canada Category:Doukhobors Category:Communalism Category:Canadian freedom of religion case law Category:Christianity in Alberta Category:Alberta litigation Category:1969 in Alberta ","title":"Walter v Alberta (AG)"},{"id":"4462315","text":"Sanabria may refer to: *Sanabria (genus of katydids) - genus of bush crickets or katydids in the family Tettigoniidae, subfamily Phaneropterinae * Sanabria or Senabria, a comarca in the province of Zamora, Spain ** Puebla de Sanabria, town in the Sanabria comarca *Sanabria Lake, one of the few natural lakes of Spain **Sanabria Lake Natural Park *25089 Sanabria-Rivera, a Main Belt minor planet * Sanabria or Sanawrya, a mountain in Bolivia People Sanabria is also used as a surname in Spanish speaking countries and refers to: *Antonio Sanabria (b. 1996), Paraguayan football (soccer) striker *Bobby Sanabria (b. 1957), American Latin jazz drummer of Puerto Rican ancestry *Edgar Sanabria (1911-1989), ex-president of Venezuela *Mariangela Sanabria, party candidate in Ontario, Canada *Miguel Sanabria (b. 1964), Paraguayan football (soccer) midfielder *Miguel √Ångel Sanabria (1967-2006), Colombian road cyclist *Nicolas Sanabria (1889-1945), philatelist of New York City *Ricardo Sanabria (b. 1969), Paraguayan football (soccer) defender *Ulises Armand Sanabria (1906-1969), builder and engineer of television station in Chicago ","title":"Sanabria"},{"id":"4462318","text":"Margaret Campbell (April 24, 1883 ‚Äì June 27, 1939) was an American character actress in silent films.

The Court rejected the US principle of \\"one man, one vote\\" from the US Supreme Court decision of Baker v. Carr (1962), and instead held that the right to vote meant \\"effective representation\\". Background The government of Saskatchewan passed a law establishing a commission to revise the provincial electoral boundaries. The Act created a quota for rural and urban constituencies, and required that the boundaries conform with the existing municipal boundaries. Consequently, the degree of representation between the districts varied between 15 and 25%. Opinion of the Court Justice McLachlin, writing for the majority, held that the deviation between districts did not violate section 3 of the Charter. She stated that \\"the purpose of the right to vote in section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is not equality of voting power but the right to 'effective representation'. Our democracy is a representative democracy. Each citizen has the right to be represented within the governmental edifice.\\" However, the decision also meant that constituencies should have a reasonably similar number of voters for the representation to be effective; room for disproportionality was allowed due to geographical limits in drawing boundaries and to give minorities more representation within a constituency. Justice Cory, writing in dissent, held that the provincial government should not be able to impose restrictions on boundaries revision committee, and accordingly, there should be a violation of section 3 of the Charter.

Her nickname was given by a fellow journalist colleague for her tenacity and determination to achieve goals and leadership. Her most notable achievement was the creation of one of the most important cultural and musical events of Colombia, the Vallenato Legend Festival, which promoted her beloved Vallenato music. She was kidnapped by the FARC September 24, 2001 in the outskirts of Valledupar and was killed six days later by this guerrilla to prevent her from being rescued by the Colombian Army on September 30, 2001 during a heavy military operation. elcolombiano.com Accessed October 2, 2006. Early years She was the youngest of nine siblings. Her father, Santander Ara√∫jo, was a respected politician, militant and regional leader of the Liberal Party around Valledupar, whose firm character largely influenced his daughter. She went to in a government public nursery school and subsequently attended Escuela Tercera para Ni√±as. She then transferred to the Colegio Nari√±o Middle School and later to the Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen. She attended high school at the Colegio de la Sagrada Familia. At the age of fifteen, she dropped out of high school and started to work as a bankteller to help pay for the schooling of three of her older brothers. During this period she also spent her spare time reading and self-educating. Journalist, writer and politician Largely self-educated, she was committed to become a freelance journalist and writer. She started as a writer for a national newspaper El Espectador, also writing a column called \\"La Carta Vallenata\\" (The Vallenata letter), published for 22 years in the same newspaper. She also collaborated with RCN Radio and RCN TV networks, and El Heraldo, a Barranquilla newspaper between 1988 and 1989. Between 1984 and 1985 she worked as a reporter in Valledupar for the Noticiero del Medio D√≠a, a national news show. She also and predominantly worked as a radiohost for her own show La Cacica Contesta on Radio Guatapuri, a radio station in Valledupar owned by her family. Always a defender of the unprotected and poor, she was a harsh critic of local governments' and politician's abuses of power and advocated for women empowerment, but most of all she was devoted to the local customs and culture of Valledupar. This devotion for people pushed her to run for the governorship of the Department of Cesar but lost; she later became Minister of Culture for the Colombian government during Conservative president Andr√©s Pastrana's term. The Vallenato Legend Festival In 1968, with the help of former Liberal president of Colombia and then acting first governor of the Cesar Department; Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen and Vallenato composer Rafael Escalona, she founded the Vallenato Legend Festival, a festival whose primary purpose was to celebrate a religious legend about a miracle by Virgin Mary during the colonial times over a fight between Spanish settlers and Indians; but the people focused more on the music, which ended up overshadowing the other events. Thus the main purpose of the festival changed, becoming a vehicle for showing and exalting local customs and culture, including the dances, music, arts and crafts, and the whole diversity of people from the region. Death She was kidnapped by the FARC on the outskirts of Valledupar and was later killed. Her body was found with two shots in the head and with gunpowder burns, indicating that the shots were probably fired at close distance by her kidnappers. Her family, the Colombian government, and the OAS condemned the FARC as the party responsible for the murder. The FARC blamed the Army for provoking the situation that led to her death.

Shot and produced in Kyrgyzstan, it is representative of the first wave of independently produced cinema in the country after its independence from Soviet Union. It was directed by Aktan Abdykalykov, and stars the director's son Mirlan Abdykalykov in the lead role. This simple bildungsroman went on to receive critical acclaim, and won numerous international awards including the Silver Leopard Prize at the 1998 Locarno International Film Festival. The film was selected as the Kyrgyz entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 71st Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot The film starts with an adoption ceremony presided over by five old women (Beshkempir literally means \\"five grandmothers\\"), in a village in Kyrgyzstan. The movie then flashes forward a decade or so to show the coming of age of the adopted child - Beshkempir. He is shown indulging in childhood pranks and activities with friends in a rural setting, like stealing honey from beehives and going to watch screened Hindi movies. However, approaching adolescence leads the boys to spy on a village woman's breasts, make clay models of the female form and pretend to make love and eye girls. Beshkempir is even shown as the message carrier between an older boy and his girlfriend. Rivalry over a girl Aynura leads to Beshkempir's friend divulging the fact of his adoption to Beshkempir by calling Beshkempir a foundling, who had been unaware of his roots till then. Even though his grandmother denies the story, Beshkempir is upset, and this leads to numerous scuffles with his friend. Hostility is also shown between Beshkempir's adoptive mother and his friend's mother on numerous occasions, culminating in the friend's mother coming to Beshkempir's house to complain about Beshkempir beating up his son. Beshkempir's adoptive father beats Beshkempir over the incident, who runs away and joins a fisherman. Meanwhile, Beshkempir's grandmother dies and asks that Beshkempir be told the truth in her will. Beshkempir is located and brought home, and is reconciled with adoptive family and friends. The funeral ceremony shows Beshkempir suddenly growing up by giving the customary speech at the funeral where he pledges to repay his grandmother's debts (if any) and to forgo any outstanding debts to his grandmother. The film ends with Beshkempir courting Aynura and a brief shot of an engagement ceremony. Critical appeal The film is a bildungsroman, treating universal issues of growing up in a rural landscape (see Pather Panchali for a famous movie of similar form). The movie shows little or no Kyrgyzstan-specific footage, except for a brief glimpse of money at one point. However, it depicts several Kyrgyz customs - including the ceremony of placing a baby in a cradle (biseke salu), the funerary ceremony and the engagement ceremony. The ceremonies depict several ethnic Kyrgyz artifacts, like the tekemet rugs of the region, the kigiz felt carpets and the Kyrgyz cradle or besik. The storytelling is simple and direct, and the plentiful visuals of nature and village life is complemented by soundtrack recordings of accentuated village sounds and the sounds of nature. The film is shot in black and white, occasionally interspersed with color sequences. The color sequences typically depict colorful focal themes like the girl Aynura, colorful Tekemet rugs, or a hoopoe (a kind of bird). Some critics have placed the film in the Neorealist school.J. Hoberman, Review , Village Voice, Feb 17 - 23, 1999 Most of the shooting took place on location in the village of Bar- Boulak in Kyrgyzstan.

History The Hudson Motor Car Company, headed by Roy D. Chapin, developed a reputation and success in the automobile marketplace by building solid cars with good performance and reliability for the money. The introduction of the Essex Six in 1924, targeting budget minded buyers, increased the combined sales of Hudson Motors from seventh to third place in the U.S. automobile market by 1925. Production of Hudson and Essex cars continued to hold third place for 1927, fourth place in 1928, and returned to capture third in 1929 with a total of 300,962 units.US Automobile Production Figures, Retrieved on 23 November 2010. The automaker decided to move upmarket, and in 1930 launched a line of cars called Great Eight. Hudson Eights were \\"often luxurious, and usually smooth, effortless performers\\" powered by a new for 1930 straight- eight engine that would be produced through 1952. Total production in 1930 for Hudson Motors fell by almost 40% to 113,898 units. For 1931, the automaker renamed the line to \\"Hudson Greater Eight\\" ‚Äì implying that the new models \\"were even better than\\" the previous year because of additional engineering and styling advances. Production declined even further dropping Hudson from the top eight brands in the U.S. Hudson hired its first professional designer in early 1931, Frank S. Spring, with the title of \\"engineering stylist\\". His work was first incorporated on the 1932 model year Hudsons, but he became best known for his contributions to the 1948‚Äì54 \\"Step-Down\\" design (third- generation Hudson Commodores and first-generation Hudson Hornets) and remained with the company until its merger with Nash, forming American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1954. Annual designs=1931 The Greater Eight models were built on Hudson's wheelbase \\"T-Series\\" chassis riding on solid front and rear axles with semi-elliptic leaf springs and four-wheel mechanical brakes. Power for the 1931 models was supplied by a cast iron L-head inline eight-cylinder (I8) engine producing mated to a three-speed sliding gear manual transmission. The Greater Eight received Hudson's first attempts at having a softer, less rigid styling. The Greater Eight offered a number of stylish features including a fine mesh grille-work that set it apart from other contemporary marques. It came with full instrumentation. Hudson made only a few boat-tailed roadster models. The bodies were built by Murray and even though the style never made the sales literature, a 1931 Hudson Greater Eight boat-tailed roadster was built making it the one and only time this style appeared on a Hudson chassis. image of front image of rear Even with their larger engines and lower prices than the 1930 models, sales during the Great Depression in the United States were down from the previous year. Sales of the Greater Eight totaled 22,250 for 1931. 1932 For 1932, the Greater Eights received new, more streamlined styling, including a greater slope of the windshield. Hudson's engineering stylist, Frank S. Spring, made the fenders more graceful and gave the car's body gentler curves. The 1932 models featured a prominent Vee'd grille with vertical chrome theme. The cars were recognizable by their uniquely styled rounded-triangle shaped headlights and parking lights, which mimicked the shape of Hudson's triangle logo. The triangle theme was also repeated in the interior, including the driver's floor pedals. The new design also received mechanical upgrades including 30% larger brakes than those on the previous models. The I8 engine was also increased to and produced . Options included a freewheeling clutchAn over-running clutch that allowed the engine to drive the wheels, but not the other way around, so that the driver could release the accelerator and the car would coast on its own momentum while still in gear and it prevented \\"engine braking\\". Source: to disengage the driveline, as well as a selective-control automatic clutch. Economic conditions were not improving and sales for 1932 totaled less than 8,000 Greater Eights, despite prices remaining the same and the addition of two \\"lush\\" new series to the product offer: the Sterling (Series U on a chassis and the Major (Series L with a wheelbase). Total production for both Hudson and Essex moved up to 57,550 during the lowest point for the U.S. automotive industry during the Great Depression. Epilogue For 1933, the Hudson Eights were four \\"standard\\" models riding on a 119-inch wheelbase and five luxurious Major series models built on a platform. The line was renamed the Hudson Pacemaker Standard Eight. By this time, the company was struggling because of low sales and mounting financial losses. In May 1933, Roy D. Chapin returned to Hudson after serving as the United States Secretary of Commerce during the last months of President Herbert Hoover's administration and spent his final three years of life trying to save the automaker from the effects of the Great Depression. Hudson had fared poorly during the Great Depression (1929‚Äì36) compared with other domestic automakers with its rank falling back from third to eight in terms of production. During the 1930s, automobile production by the Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) increased, while all the other domestic automakers were damaged and saw their total market share drop from 25% in 1929 to 10% by 1939. with many of the premium- type brands disappearing, such as Cord, Durant, Franklin, Peerless, Pierce- Arrow, and Stutz.

History=Formation and independent releases (2000‚Äì2005) The band originally composed of J. Loren Wince, age 15, as the main singer, songwriter, and guitarist and Wil Quaintance as a drummer. The two sought other band members for years until picking up Steven Fletcher to play bass guitar. The band was named two years later, upon conception of their first album. J. Loren Wince is the lead singer of the band Hurt. This band's self-titled first studio album was written and performed by Wince and Wil Quaintance on drums, with programming credits given to Brian Winshell on the entire album, except \\"Confession\\" by Jonathan Minis. It was released in 2000 and approximately 1,200 copies were created. The band's second independently released album, The Consumation was also written and performed by Wince, with Quaintance on drums, Shawn Sawyer on bass and given credits on the song \\"Unclean,\\" with Brian Winshell on Engineering for \\"House of Cards\\" and \\"Velvet Rolls Royce.\\" This album was released in 2003 in Wince's home state of Virginia, with approximately 2000 sold, and around 3000 promos and full albums distributed for free. The band (with the original line- up) was discovered by Tom Lewis, an ex-Universal Records A&R; man, somewhere around 2005. The show was at The Continental in New York, where a friend of Lewis, Jay Silverman, passed the band's CD on to him., March 30, 2008 After the initial contact with Wince, it was another 8 months until they heard from Lewis again. The band met up with Lewis and his company (Metropolitan Hybrid). The band went to record its demo to help find a record label. After undisclosed issues with the current drummer for the band, session drummer Evan Johns was asked if he could be a part of the recording, which Wince agreed to., December 29, 2007 In the process of trying to find a major label, the bass player at the time decided it would be best if he quit the band, at which time they began to seek out his replacement, former Streetlight Manifesto bassist Josh Ansley. When asked about how he became part of the band, Paul Spatola has been quoted in saying that he received a phone call from Josh Ansley, saying he should fly to New York and try out for the band, as they were looking for guitarists. Spatola states, \\"A month later I didn't hear anything and I said 'I just gotta fly out there.'\\" His first performance with the band was at a night club called 'The Mint,' at which time, Spatola intended on being with the band for a few days but ended up staying for two weeks. The first day he tried out for the band, and with a little help from Tom Lewis, Wince was convinced to bring Spatola into the band as the guitarist. The next day, the band played a showcase in New York City, at which time they had spoken with several record companies including Columbia, Interscope, Island, Universal, Virgin and Atlantic, but nothing came of these conversations. Initially, Capitol Records had purchased the album, Vol. 1, from the band at cost which was approximately 100k. No other apparent changes other than signing the recordings rights to them took place. Vol. 1 and Vol. II (2006‚Äì2008) Victor Ribas is the drummer of the band Hurt. The band's first work under a major record label would be two albums entitled Vol. 1 and Vol. II. They were both recorded and produced with Eric Greedy. The initial plan was to have the albums be released as a double album, but Capitol rejected the idea as \\"too much of an investment at once\\". Instead, the band used the extra time to re-record and improve upon Vol. II., October 21, 2007 Vol. 1 was released on March 21, 2006. Three singles were released to radio ‚Äì \\"Rapture\\", \\"Falls Apart\\", and \\"Danse Russe.\\" Vol. II was later released on September 25, 2007, along with two more singles, \\"Ten Ton Brick\\" and \\"Loded\\". After their having major record label exposure, the band opted to re-release The Consumation as The Re-Consumation on February 19, 2008, in response to fans spending hundreds of dollars to buy their now-rare original independent releases. The re-released contained one new song, and two other altered songs. Shortly afterwards, in April, Ansley announced his departure from the band, to pursue a career in writing and directing. On May 12, 2009, Hurt received an award for the song \\"Ten Ton Brick\\" during SESAC's 13th annual New York Music Awards. Goodbye to the Machine (2009‚Äì2010) Vol. 1 and Vol. II did not prove to be commercial successes, and as a result, the band was dropped from Capitol Records. Their next album, Goodbye to the Machine, would be an allusion to the band's negativity towards major record labels. The album was released on April 7, 2009, on the much smaller label Amusement Records. Prior to the album's release, the single \\"Wars\\" was released to radio on February 3, 2009. The album has peaked at No.100 on the Billboard 200. The Crux (2010‚Äì2014) The band began working on new material in early 2010. On February 5 the new song \\"Numbers\\" made its debut radio play on 94.1 WJJO in Madison, WI. It was released on iTunes on March 9, 2010, with artwork by Spatola. On March 21, the band announced that all tracking had been completed. In August, the band announced they had signed to Carved Records, and aimed to release a new album in early 2012. It was also announced that Spatola had departed the band due to personal issues. On September 27, 2011, on Hurt's Facebook page, the band said that the new album would be a return to both the Vol. albums, in sound and style. The first single, \\"How We End Up Alone\\", was released through iTunes on January 3, 2012 and peaked at Number 10 on the Billboard 20. The Crux was released on May 1, 2012, and peaked at Number 75 on Billboard 200. This was the highest Billboard placement in the band's history, and the last time the world would see new material from the Band. On April 8, 2014 Amusement Management announced their intentions to release a remastered version of the often spoke of the band's self-titled album, stating \\"It will be remastered and come with a handwritten replication of the lyrics by J. It will most likely not be available digitally\\". The announcement was made on the band's official Facebook page. The album was released in a limited quantity of only 2000, each individual numbered and signed by J Loren Wince. The album included two bonus tracks; one previously unreleased, \\"Cellophane\\", and another, the original version of \\"Talking to God\\". Members ;Current Members *J.

Various empirically derived standard units for electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time, and of a convenient scale for practical work as early as 1861. As of 2020, the definition of the ohm is expressed in terms of the quantum Hall effect.  Definition  One of the functions of many types of multimeters is the measurement of resistance in ohms. The ohm is defined as an electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of one ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.BIPM SI Brochure: Appendix 1, p. 144 :\\\\Omega = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{V}}{\\\\text{A}} = \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\text{S}} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{W}}{\\\\text{A}^2} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{V}^2}{\\\\text{W}} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{s}}{\\\\text{F}} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{H}}{\\\\text{s}} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{J} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{s}}{\\\\text{C}^2} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{kg} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{m}^2}{\\\\text{s} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{C}^2} = \\\\dfrac{\\\\text{J}}{\\\\text{s} {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{A}^2}=\\\\dfrac{\\\\text{kg}{\\\\cdot}\\\\text{m}^2}{\\\\text{s}^3 {\\\\cdot} \\\\text{A}^2} in which the following units appear: volt (V), ampere (A), siemens (S), watt (W), second (s), farad (F), henry (H), joule (J), coulomb (C), kilogram (kg), and metre (m). Following the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, in which the ampere and the kilogram were redefined in terms of fundamental constants, the ohm is effected by very small scaling in measurement. In many cases the resistance of a conductor is approximately constant within a certain range of voltages, temperatures, and other parameters. These are called linear resistors. In other cases resistance varies, such as in the case of the thermistor, which exhibits a strong dependence of its resistance with temperature. A vowel of the prefixed units kiloohm and megaohm is commonly omitted, producing kilohm and megohm.The NIST Guide to the SI: 9.3 Spelling unit names with prefixes reports that IEEE/ASTM SI 10-2002 IEEE/ASTM Standard for Use of the International System of Units (SI): The Modern Metric System states that there are three cases in which the final vowel of an SI prefix is commonly omitted: megohm, kilohm, and hectare, but that in all other cases in which the unit name begins with a vowel, both the final vowel of the prefix and the vowel of the unit name are retained and both are pronounced. In alternating current circuits, electrical impedance is also measured in ohms.  Conversions  The siemens (symbol: S) is the SI derived unit of electric conductance and admittance, also known as the mho (ohm spelled backwards, symbol is ‚Ñß); it is the reciprocal of resistance in ohms (Œ©).  Power as a function of resistance  The power dissipated by a resistor may be calculated from its resistance, and the voltage or current involved. The formula is a combination of Ohm's law and Joule's law: :P=V\\\\cdot I =\\\\frac{V^2}{R} = I^2\\\\cdot R where: :P is the power :R is the resistance :V is the voltage across the resistor :I is the current through the resistor A linear resistor has a constant resistance value over all applied voltages or currents; many practical resistors are linear over a useful range of currents. Non-linear resistors have a value that may vary depending on the applied voltage (or current). Where alternating current is applied to the circuit (or where the resistance value is a function of time), the relation above is true at any instant but calculation of average power over an interval of time requires integration of \\"instantaneous\\" power over that interval. Since the ohm belongs to a coherent system of units, when each of these quantities has its corresponding SI unit (watt for P, ohm for R, volt for V and ampere for I, which are related as in , this formula remains valid numerically when these units are used (and thought of as being cancelled or omitted).  History  The rapid rise of electrotechnology in the last half of the 19th century created a demand for a rational, coherent, consistent, and international system of units for electrical quantities. Telegraphers and other early users of electricity in the 19th century needed a practical standard unit of measurement for resistance. Resistance was often expressed as a multiple of the resistance of a standard length of telegraph wires; different agencies used different bases for a standard, so units were not readily interchangeable. Electrical units so defined were not a coherent system with the units for energy, mass, length, and time, requiring conversion factors to be used in calculations relating energy or power to resistance. Two different methods of establishing a system of electrical units can be chosen. Various artifacts, such as a length of wire or a standard electrochemical cell, could be specified as producing defined quantities for resistance, voltage, and so on. Alternatively, the electrical units can be related to the mechanical units by defining, for example, a unit of current that gives a specified force between two wires, or a unit of charge that gives a unit of force between two unit charges. This latter method ensures coherence with the units of energy. Defining a unit for resistance that is coherent with units of energy and time in effect also requires defining units for potential and current. It is desirable that one unit of electrical potential will force one unit of electric current through one unit of electrical resistance, doing one unit of work in one unit of time, otherwise all electrical calculations will require conversion factors. Since so-called \\"absolute\\" units of charge and current are expressed as combinations of units of mass, length, and time, dimensional analysis of the relations between potential, current, and resistance show that resistance is expressed in units of length per time ‚Äì a velocity. Some early definitions of a unit of resistance, for example, defined a unit resistance as one quadrant of the Earth per second. The absolute-units system related magnetic and electrostatic quantities to metric base units of mass, time, and length. These units had the great advantage of simplifying the equations used in the solution of electromagnetic problems, and eliminated conversion factors in calculations about electrical quantities. However, the centimeter-gram- second, CGS, units turned out to have impractical sizes for practical measurements. Various artifact standards were proposed as the definition of the unit of resistance. In 1860 Werner Siemens (1816‚Äì1892) published a suggestion for a reproducible resistance standard in Poggendorffs Annalen der Physik und Chemie. He proposed a column of pure mercury, of one square millimeter cross section, one metre long: Siemens mercury unit. However, this unit was not coherent with other units. One proposal was to devise a unit based on a mercury column that would be coherent ‚Äì in effect, adjusting the length to make the resistance one ohm. Not all users of units had the resources to carry out metrology experiments to the required precision, so working standards notionally based on the physical definition were required. In 1861, Latimer Clark (1822‚Äì1898) and Sir Charles Bright (1832‚Äì1888) presented a paper at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting suggesting that standards for electrical units be established and suggesting names for these units derived from eminent philosophers, 'Ohma', 'Farad' and 'Volt'. The BAAS in 1861 appointed a committee including Maxwell and Thomson to report upon standards of electrical resistance. Their objectives were to devise a unit that was of convenient size, part of a complete system for electrical measurements, coherent with the units for energy, stable, reproducible and based on the French metrical system. In the third report of the committee, 1864, the resistance unit is referred to as \\"B.A. unit, or Ohmad\\". By 1867 the unit is referred to as simply ohm. The B.A. ohm was intended to be 109 CGS units but owing to an error in calculations the definition was 1.3% too small. The error was significant for preparation of working standards. On 21 September 1881 the Congr√®s internationale des √©lectriciens (international conference of electricians) defined a practical unit of ohm for the resistance, based on CGS units, using a mercury column 1 sq. mm. in cross-section, approximately 104.9 cm in length at 0 ¬∞C, similar to the apparatus suggested by Siemens. A legal ohm, a reproducible standard, was defined by the international conference of electricians at Paris in 1884 as the resistance of a mercury column of specified weight and 106 cm long; this was a compromise value between the B. A. unit (equivalent to 104.7 cm), the Siemens unit (100 cm by definition), and the CGS unit. Although called \\"legal\\", this standard was not adopted by any national legislation. The \\"international\\" ohm was recommended by unanimous resolution at the International Electrical Congress 1893 in Chicago. The unit was based upon the ohm equal to 109 units of resistance of the C.G.S. system of electromagnetic units. The international ohm is represented by the resistance offered to an unvarying electric current in a mercury column of constant cross-sectional area 106.3 cm long of mass 14.4521 grams and 0 ¬∞C. This definition became the basis for the legal definition of the ohm in several countries. In 1908, this definition was adopted by scientific representatives from several countries at the International Conference on Electric Units and Standards in London. The mercury column standard was maintained until the 1948 General Conference on Weights and Measures, at which the ohm was redefined in absolute terms instead of as an artifact standard. By the end of the 19th century, units were well understood and consistent. Definitions would change with little effect on commercial uses of the units. Advances in metrology allowed definitions to be formulated with a high degree of precision and repeatability.

Various resistance coils were constructed by the British Association and others, to serve as physical artifact standards for the unit of resistance. The long-term stability and reproducibility of these artifacts was an ongoing field of research, as the effects of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and time on the standards were detected and analyzed. Artifact standards are still used, but metrology experiments relating accurately-dimensioned inductors and capacitors provided a more fundamental basis for the definition of the ohm. Since 1990 the quantum Hall effect has been used to define the ohm with high precision and repeatability. The quantum Hall experiments are used to check the stability of working standards that have convenient values for comparison.R. Dzuiba and others, Stability of Double-Walled Maganin Resistors in NIST Special Publication Proceedings of SPIE, The Institute, 1988 pp. 63‚Äì64 Following the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, in which the ampere and the kilogram were redefined in terms of fundamental constants, the ohm is now also defined in terms of these constants.  Symbol  The symbol Œ© was suggested, because of the similar sound of ohm and omega, by William Henry Preece in 1867. In documents printed before WWII the unit symbol often consisted of the raised lowercase omega (œâ), such that 56 Œ© was written as 56œâ. Historically, some document editing software applications have used the Symbol typeface to render the character Œ©.E.g. recommended in HTML 4.01: Where the font is not supported, a W is displayed instead (\\"10 W\\" instead of \\"10 Œ©\\", for instance). As W represents the watt, the SI unit of power, this can lead to confusion, making the use of the correct Unicode code point preferable. Where the character set is limited to ASCII, the IEEE 260.1 standard recommends substituting the symbol ohm for Œ©. In the electronics industry it is common to use the character R instead of the Œ© symbol, thus, a 10 Œ© resistor may be represented as 10R. This is the British standard BS 1852 code. It is used in many instances where the value has a decimal place. For example, 5.6 Œ© is listed as 5R6. This method avoids overlooking the decimal point, which may not be rendered reliably on components or when duplicating documents. Unicode encodes the symbol as , distinct from Greek omega among letterlike symbols, but it is only included for backwards compatibility and the Greek uppercase omega character is preferred.Excerpts from The Unicode Standard, Version 4.0, accessed 11 October 2006 In DOS and Windows, the alt code ALT 234 may produce the Œ© symbol. In Mac OS, does the same.

Karras dies by throwing himself down a flight of stone steps in order to purge the demon from his own body after having coaxed it out of Regan's. Legion In the 1983 sequel, it is revealed that after the demon departed, another evil spirit invaded Karras's body. Karras was found wandering and amnesiac, and was placed in the care of a mental hospital near Washington, D.C.. While incarcerated there, the spirit suppresses Karras's personality and makes forays into the bodies of other patients in order to commit a series of ritual murders. Adaptations In the films The Exorcist and The Exorcist III, he is played by Jason Miller (who was in fact educated at the Jesuit University of Scranton). Jack Nicholson was up for the part of Karras before Stacy Keach was hired by Blatty. According to The Exorcist director William Friedkin, Paul Newman also wanted to portray Karras.William Friedkin, director of THE EXORCIST at the 2013 Dallas International Film Festival. on YouTube Friedkin then spotted Miller following a performance of Miller's play That Championship Season in New York. Even though Miller had never acted in movies, Keach's contract was bought out by Warner Bros. and Miller was signed. Karras is voiced by Robert Glenister in the 2014 BBC Radio dramatization. Fictional biography Damien Karras was born on 12 April 1933 to a Greek family. He became a Jesuit priest on 30 July 1957. Over the years, the priest began to doubt the existence of God, the Devil, and many Biblical and supernatural beings. Still a Jesuit, he decided to become a psychiatrist. Along with fellow-Jesuit Father Lankester Merrin, Karras attempts to exorcise 12-year-old Regan MacNeil (who was possessed by a demon). In the process, Merrin suffers a fatal heart attack and an embittered Karras provokes the possessed child, forcing the demon to channel itself into him instead. Karras, briefly dominated by the demon, throws himself out the window of the MacNeils's residence, seeing it as his chance to purge the world of the evil being; tumbling down the stairs of M Street to his death. At the same time that Karras died, a criminal by the name of James Venamun (the infamous \\"Gemini Killer\\") was executed. The demon left the body of the dead Karras and placed Venamun's soul into Karras's body as a means of revenge for having been thrown out of Regan's. The body was switched prior to interment and an amnesiac Karras was found roaming the streets of Washington D.C.. Soon, he was placed under the care of a mental hospital. He remained in cell number eleven for 15 years. His brain and bone tissues mended over time, but he alternated between his own personality and that of Venamun. Also, the spirit of Venamun left Karras's body by night to invade the other patients in the ward, making them commit murders for him without Venamun taking the blame. The \\"Gemini Killer\\" had come back to wreak havoc. In the film, during the course of an exorcism, Venamun is forced to abandon Karras's body and Lt. William Kinderman shoots Karras several times, ending Karras's life for the final time. In the book, Venamun's father passes away from natural causes and Venamun wills Karras's body to die as he sees no more reason to remain in the world if he cannot continue to shame his father.

Her real name was Uemura Tsune. Sh≈çen was known primarily for her bijin-ga paintings of beautiful women in the nihonga style, although she produced numerous works on historical themes and traditional subjects. Sh≈çen is considered a major innovator in the bijin-ga genre despite the fact she often still used it to depict the traditional beauty standards of women. Bijin-ga gained criticism during the Taisho era while Sh≈çen worked due to its lack of evolution to reflect the more modern statuses of women in Japan. During bijin-ga's conception in the Tokugawa, or Edo, period, women were regarded as lower class citizens and the genre often reflected this implication onto its female subjects. Within the Taisho era, women had made several advancements into the Japanese workforce, and artistry specifically was becoming more popular outside of pass times for the elite, which opened way for Sh≈çen's success.Morioka, Michiyo. \\"Changing images of women: Taisho- period paintings by Uemura Shoen (1875-1949), Ito Shoha (1877-1968), and Kajiwara Hisako (1896-1988),\\" PhD diss. University of Washington (1990). Sh≈çen received many awards and forms of recognition during her lifetime within Japan, being the first female recipient of the Order of Culture award, as well as being hired as the Imperial Household's official artist, which had previously only employed one other official woman in the position. In 1949 she died of cancer just a year after receiving the Order of Culture Award.  Biography  Sh≈çen was born in Shimogy≈ç-ku, Kyoto, as the second daughter of a tea merchant. She was born two months after the death of her father and, thus, grew up with her mother and aunts in an all-female household. Her mother's tea shop attracted a refined, cultured clientele for the art of Japanese tea ceremony. As a child at age 12 (1887), Sh≈çen drew pictures and exhibited considerable skill at drawing human figures. By the age of 15 (1890) she was exhibiting her work and winning awards in official art contests as well as commissioning work for private patrons. She became obsessed with the ukiyo-e, Japanese woodblock print, works of Hokusai. Her mother supported her decision to pursue an artistic career. This was quite unusual for the time, and although Sh≈çen did have successful contemporaries who were female, such as Ito Shoba (1877-1968) and Kajiwara Hisako (1896-1988), women were largely still not part of the Japanese public art scene outside of Tokyo. Among Japan's wedding traditions, specifically among upper-class unions, brides were gifted a konrei ch≈çdo (bridal furnishing set), usually containing art supplies, such as brushes and paints. Provided with the necessary tools, many women pursued painting as an individual and private hobby, out of the public eye and in an amateur setting. Due to most women of the time's lack of formal education in the arts, few made a professional career of painting, regardless of how talented they may be. However, women living in the company of a professional artist, such as their fathers or husbands, had the resources and guidance to hone their skills in the craft, although few of these women became known for their work as an individual away from their educators. Sh≈çen was sent to the Kyoto Prefectural Painting School, where she studied under the Chinese style landscape painter Suzuki Sh≈çnen (1849‚Äì1918). She also began studying the Kan≈ç school and Sessh≈´ schools styles of painting. Suzuki was so impressed that he gave her the first kanji of his own pseudonym of \\"Sh≈çnen\\" in recognition of her talent. Sh≈çen even allowed her to pursue her desire to paint figurally in his private studio despite the fact that the school's traditional teaching method did not allow students to being figural practice until their later years. This was an exceptional breakthrough for the times; however, for a while her reputation was tainted as she was suspected of a liaison with her teacher, which may have been true. Soon afterwards she gave birth to an illegitimate son (the future painter Uemura Sh≈çk≈ç) whom she raised as a single mother. She later gave birth to a daughter and, likewise, never revealed the name of the father.SEE DISCUSSION In 1894, Sh≈çen became a disciple of K≈çno Bairei and later of his successor Takeuchi Seih≈ç. She won her first local award in 1898 with a work selected for the Exhibition of New and Old Art (\\"Shinko Bijutsu Tenrankai\\" or \\"Shinkoten\\") in Kyoto. She won her first national award in 1900 for a painting submitted to an exhibition sponsored by the Japan Fine Arts Academy (Nihon Bijutsuin) with the Japan Painting Association (Nihon Kaiga Kyokai). She later focused on producing work for display and sale at the government-sponsored Bunten exhibitions starting from 1907. The purchase of her painting, The Beauty of Four Seasons, by the Duke of Connaught on his visit to Japan, raised her to celebrity status at the mere age of fifteen. Sh≈çen was chosen shortly after by the Japanese government to have her work shown in the Chicago World Exposition of 1893 along with many other prominent artists at the time, all older and mostly from Tokyo in comparison. Sh≈çen painted another version of The Beauty of Four Seasons for the exposition and received an award for the painting. Sh≈çen drew from her artistic training and her personal interest in woodblock prints and older painting styles to develop new techniques and styles of composition with a broad range of subjects. Themes and elements from the traditional Noh drama frequently appeared in her works, but images of beautiful women (bijin-ga) came to dominate her work. Eventually, her work would combine the themes of both Noh and women in a single composition. From 1917 to 1922, she entered a slump and declined to participate in exhibitions for several years. In 1924, she returned to the art world by exhibiting a painting titled \\"Ê•äË≤¥Â¶É\\" (Yohki Hime, Princess Yohki) at the Fourth Exhibition of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. The painting is now at the Sh≈çhaku Art Museum in Nara. During the 1930s, when Sh≈çen was in her late 50s and early 60s, she began producing very large works. These include Spring and Autumn (1930), Jo-no-mai (1936), and Soshi- arai Komachi (1937). Many of these works, especially Jo-no-mai are now considered her greatest masterpieces. It is believed that the model for Jo-no- mai is Shoen's daughter-in-law portraying a confident and dignified women in a brilliantly colored orange kimono fading into a cloud pattern at the hem. Jo- no-mai and Soshi-arai Komachi were inspired by the Noh theater. (Jo-no-mai is a dance performed in the introduction to a Noh play, and Soshi-arai Komachi is the title of a Noh play about the Heian period poet Ono no Komachi.) Shoen took great inspiration from the female character in noh theater. It is important to note that men performed all the roles in noh theater including the female roles. Despite this Shoen used women models to recreate the poses of her work suggesting something of her views of women. Both paintings are characterized by a strong feeling of majesty, with a large central figure against an empty background. The use of color is carefully planned so that the light surfaces of clothes and other items stand out prominently against the negative space. In 1941, Sh≈çen became the first woman painter in Japan to be invited to join the Imperial Art Academy. She was appointed a court painter to the Imperial Household Agency in 1944. During World War II she supported nationalism in pieces like Late Autumn which depicts a beautiful woman doing her part to help the war. Despite her advanced age, she traveled to the war zone in China at the invitation of the Japanese government for propaganda purposes, to prove to people back home that all was going well. Many of her works from this period, including Twilight (1941), Clear Day (1941), and Late Autumn (1943), depict working women engaged in daily chores, who display a strong sense of vitality. As with her work from the 1930s, Sh≈çen shows a skillful use of negative space, with realistic detail, neat lines, and a calm use of color. As the war situation deteriorated, in February 1945, Sh≈çen was evacuated from Kyoto to the suburbs of Nara. In 1948, she became the first woman to be awarded Japan's prestigious Order of Culture. Her painting Jo no mai was the first painting by a Japanese woman to be rated as an Important Cultural Property by the Agency of Cultural Affairs. Philately Uemura Sh≈çen's works have been selected as the subject of commemorative postage stamps twice by the Japanese government: * 1965: Jo no mai, to commemorate the 1965 Philatelic Week * 1980: Mother and Child, as part of the Modern Art Series In 2000, Uemura Sh≈çen herself was the subject of a commemorative postage stamp under the Cultural Leaders Series by Japan Post. In 2017, Sh≈çen's work was featured in Uemura Sh≈çen and Quintessential Bijinga, Paintings of Beautiful Women, a two month-long (August 29, 2017 - October 22, 2017) an exhibition organized by Yamatane Museum of Art and Nikkei Inc. The exhibition featured four sections: Uemura Sh≈çen‚ÄîFragrant Beauty, Famous Women from Literature and History, Maiko and Geisha, Beauties Past and Present‚ÄîChic Japanese Garb Gorgeous Western Garb. Sh≈çen dominated the selected works in the first section, with additional work being showcased in the second. Beautiful women Despite being known for works of beautiful women bijinga (Ukiyo-e beauty portraits) Sh≈çen reportedly said \\"Never once did I paint a work with the expectation that it would be a fine work as long as the woman depicted was beautiful. My earnest hope is that all my works are like fragrant jewels, always with a sense of fresh purity, never with even an iota of the vulgar\\". She is respected for her fight for women's rights in Japan and her achievements as a great artist not just a female artist. During Sh≈çen's time, Japanese art was experiencing a change in style and influence. Western production of oil paintings became popular for many artists. Sh≈çen, however, stuck to her use of mineral pigments, or iwaenogu, and Japanese-style themes. Her paintings show ordinary women, female characters in noh theater, but the majority of her work shows women out in the elements in their finery. In Women Walking Against a Snowstorm (1911), a dramatic action scene is depicted of a beautiful woman not bending to the elements or the power of the storm. Sh≈çen's work shows the quiet empowerment of women through her subtle portrayal of emotion. She was criticized for her subjects resembling porcelain dolls instead of real women's flesh and blood. Sh≈çen contributed to the change for how the public viewed women's art through her own works. References * Briessen, Fritz van. The Way of the Brush: Painting Techniques of China and Japan.

It is the busiest port of entry between the two countries, serving as a major transporting, shipping, and receiving site. Towr Kham Collins Maps. Retrieved 21 January 2011 Highway 7 connects Torkham to Kabul through Jalalabad. On the Pakistani side, the border crossing is at the end of the N-5 National Highway, which connects it to Peshawar in the east via the Khyber Pass and further connects it to Islamabad by other routes. The Afghan Border Police and Pakistan's Frontier Corps are the main agencies for controlling Torkham. They are backed by the Pakistani and Afghan Armed Forces. There is also some presence of NATO forces on the Afghan side of the crossing. The American Forward Operating Base Torkham (FOB Torkham) is located a few miles from the crossing in Nangarhar province. Torkham belongs to the Momand Dara district of Nangarhar. History The location has been used throughout history by Afghan and Turkic caravans, including marching armies of powerful empires. Most of these were on their way to Northern India, passing through Peshawar and then Lahore. Some of the well known regional historical figures who are believed to have passed through Torkham are Chandragupta Maurya, Hs√ºan-tsang, Jayapala, Al-Biruni, Ibn Battuta, Babur, Humayun, Nader Shah, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Zaman Shah Durrani, Dost Mohammad Khan, and Akbar Khan. Over much of the last century, there have been proposals to extend the (defunct) Khyber rail service to Afghanistan and possibly beyond, passing through Jalalabad. These proposals have the support of the current Afghan government. In recent years, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) for going ahead with the laying of rail tracks between the two countries. Work on the proposed project was supposed to start in 2010.Pakistan, Afghanistan ink MoU on rail links In November 2001 the New York Times reported that Torkham is Hajji Ali's hometown. Ali was an anti-Taliban militia leader who seized power after the Taliban retreated. It was reported that Hajji Ali had joined forces with two other militia leaders, Mawlawi Yunis Khalis, and Ezatullah, to set up a regional provisional government. On the Pakistani side, Torkham lies at the end of the N-5 National Highway. It is connected to city of Peshawar in the east. Transported goods arrive to Tokham from the port city of Karachi in Sindh province. Torkham is west of the summit of the Khyber Pass. It lies on the most important supply route for US-led NATO forces in Afghanistan. Pakistan's government sometimes block supplies due to the American use of drone strikes in Pakistan.Pakistan blocks fuel to US forces, SEPTEMBER 06, 2008 In April 2006 the Afghan Border Police began requiring travelers crossing the border at Torkham to possess valid travel documents. Pakistan has completed the construction of border gate, crossing terminal and other associated infrastructure on its side of Torkham border by July 2016. Border gate has been named as Bab-i-Pakistan and the crossing terminal has been named \\"Shaheed Major Ali Jawad Changezi terminal\\" after the officer lost his life in skirmishes against the Afghan security forces at the same border and in the clashes that resulted from the construction of this very gate. The flag hosting ceremony has also started just like the one at Wagah border crossing with India. Now no one will be allowed to cross border without proper documentations to check the infiltration of terrorists from Afghanistan into Pakistan. Work on the construction of the gate and associated facilities began in 2014 but kept getting delayed because of Afghan reservations and abrupt clashes. Pakistan plans to have similar border control measures at all six major crossing points between the two countries on the 2,600km-long porous border. http://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/28-Jul-16/torkham-gate-titled-as- bab-i-pakistan Climate With an influence from the local steppe climate, Torkham features a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSh).

Unipart as it operates its business today was formed in 1974 by John Egan. British Leyland put him in charge of its Unipart parts and service division, let him make it independent and brand it Unipart. The use of the Unipart brand to market service parts for British Leyland vehicles was similar in concept to Ford's Motorcraft brand. The next year British Leyland was effectively nationalised. Egan left in 1976 to join Massey Ferguson. Then 29-year-old John Neill replaced Egan and he continued Egan's policy of providing the same logistical services to its parent's competitors as well as to British Leyland. In 1987, shortly after British Leyland had been re- privatised as the Rover Group, Neill led a management buyout of Unipart, in part financed by a wider employee buy-in. Unipart is now 70% owned by its workforce and pension fund, the other 30% is held by sympathetic institutions. After the buyout, Unipart's main business stream was in distribution and logistics, including the marketing and distribution of automotive products, but included two manufacturing sites.

Biography Born and raised in New York, Cates began his music career shortly after his graduating from New York University, where he found work with the vaudeville team of Olsen and Johnson on their legendary revue, Hellzapoppin. His early career included arranging and playing saxophone with such bands as Henry Busse, Dick Stabile, and Russ Morgan between 1945 and 1951. In the mid-1950s, he was A&R; director for Coral Records, writing and conducting for the label's stars that included the Andrews Sisters, Teresa Brewer, Bing Crosby, and Danny Kaye. During this time (1956), he hit the Top 40 charts (#31) with his release of a medley of \\"Moonglow\\" and \\"Theme from Picnic.\\" The record \\"Moonglow and Theme from Picnic\\" had some wordless vocal effects by Norma Zimmer, at the time a session vocalist, who, coincidentally, would later become Lawrence Welk's Champagne Lady. \\"Moonglow and Theme from Picnic\\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Starting in 1951, he served as Lawrence Welk's musical director. In that role, he conducted the orchestra in the rehearsals and spent many years behind the scenes as an arranger. After leaving the ABC television network in 1971, Welk syndicated his show and continued on TV using the theme song \\"Champagne Fanfare,\\" which Cates had composed. A prolific writer, Cates' songs were sung by many of the show's \\"Musical Family\\" members. In 1973, the Maestro asked him to conduct the orchestra on-camera, a role he carried until the show ended in 1982. Notably, he presented occasional classical music selections in addition to the band's lighter fare. In addition to his work with Welk, Cates wrote and arranged several albums with other prominent bandleaders of the era. One of his albums, Polynesian Percussion, featured some instrumental work by his brother-in-law guitarist Alvino Rey, and Buddy Cole playing a console steel guitar, and Novachord, as well as another fifteen-plus odd percussion instruments producing some unique sounds. Cates died of heart failure at his home in Santa Monica, California, at the age of 90.

While never released as a single, it remains a staple of their live shows and is usually played as the last song before the encore. It prominently appeared in 1999 feature film The Matrix to punctuate the final scene, increasing its exposure and cultural cachet. Composition The lyrics discuss racism within the American government and the counter-intelligence programs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); a spoken portion of the song is taken from an actual FBI memo in which its director J. Edgar Hoover suggests targets for the suppression of the black nationalist movement. (reprinted; archived link) The song also makes references to prominent African-American figures targeted by the government such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr., and goes as far as saying that the government arranged their assassinations. The closing lines to the song are: These lyrics refer to a speech made by Martin Luther King Jr., which paraphrases part of a well-known Bible verse, \\"whatever a man sows, this he will also reap\\" (Galatians 6:7). The speech was delivered at the end of the Selma to Montgomery March on the steps of the State Capitol Building in Montgomery, Alabama. The final lines in that speech read \\"How Long? Not long, because 'you shall reap what you sow'.\\" \\"Wake Up\\" is one of many songs by Rage Against the Machine that is played in drop D tuning on the guitar and bass. Political speeches In live performances, the band's frontman Zack de la Rocha frequently makes statements about political and social issues during a quiet section towards the end of the song before screaming \\"WAKE UP!\\" eight times. On the record, this part of the song features de la Rocha reciting a memo written by J Edgar Hoover. At the 2007 Coachella Festival, de la Rocha made a speech during the song, citing a statement by Noam Chomsky regarding the Nuremberg Trials,Noam Chomsky interviewed by Tom Morello, The Noam Chomsky Website. Accessed January 1, 2009. as follows: The event led to a media furor. A clip of Zack's speech found its way to the Fox News Channel program Hannity & Colmes. An on-screen headline read, \\"Rock group 'Rage Against the Machine' says Bush admin should be shot.\\" Ann Coulter (a guest on the show) quipped, \\"They're losers, their fans are losers, and there's a lot of violence coming from the left wing.\\" Then Alan Colmes reminded Coulter when she said about former President Bill Clinton that \\"The only issue is whether to impeach or assassinate.\\" On July 28 at their performance at the Rock the Bells festival in New York City, they made another speech during \\"Wake Up\\" just as they had done at Coachella. During this, de la Rocha made another statement, defending the band against Fox News, who allegedly misquoted his speech at Coachella: At the Voodoo Music Festival, during the performance of \\"Wake Up,\\" de la Rocha gave a rousing speech about his experience in the 9th Ward of post-Katrina New Orleans. De la Rocha stated that the United States is fighting two wars: one in Iraq and one \\"against the people of New Orleans,\\" before breaking into screams of \\"Wake Up!\\" at the end of the song. At the Big Day Out in Australia 2008, de la Rocha gave a speech discouraging globalism, saying it makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. He applauded the crowd for voting out former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, then broke into screams of \\"Wake Up\\". At the band's June 8, 2010 gig at the O2 in Dublin, Ireland, de la Rocha gave a speech discussing the current economic system and how multinational companies are blaming the middle/working class for the problems that the multinational companies themselves caused.

It has the second highest population density in the city and contains the core of the original city of Havana. The positions of the original Havana city walls are the modern boundaries of Old Havana. Old Havana is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Plaza Vieja Paseo del Prado, Havana and Hotel Telegrafo Havana was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish galleons on the crossing between the New World and the Old World. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in baroque and neoclassical styles. Many buildings have fallen into ruin in the latter half of the 20th century, but a number are being restored. The narrow streets of Old Havana contain many buildings, accounting for perhaps as many as one-third of the approximately 3,000 buildings found in Old Havana. It is the ancient city formed from the port, the official center and the Plaza de Armas. In 1555, Old Havana was destroyed and burned by the French corsair Jacques de Sores. The pirate had taken Havana easily, plundering the city and burning much of it to the ground. After limiting the scarce defenders, De Sores left without obtaining the enormous wealth that he was hoping to find in Havana. The city remained devastated and set on fire. Since the incident, the Spanish brought soldiers and started building fortresses and walls to protect the city. Castillo de la Real Fuerza was the first fortress built; initiated in 1558, the construction was overseen by the engineer Bartolom√© Sanchez. Old Havana resembles Cadiz and Tenerife. Alejo Carpentier called it \\"de las columnas\\"(of the columns), but it could also be named for the gateways, the revoco, the deterioration and the rescue, the intimacy, the shade, the cool, the courtyards...

The Cuban State had undertaken enormous efforts to preserve and to restore Old Havana through the efforts of the Office of the Historian of the City, which was directed by Eusebio Leal. The reconstruction effort successfully transformed Old Havana into a tourist attraction, and also resulted in Leal becoming recognized as Old Havana's de facto Mayor.https://week.com/2020/07/31/eusebio-leal-who-oversaw-renewal-of- old-havana-dies- at-77/https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/07/31/world/europe/31reuters- people-eusebio-leal-obituary.html Main sights Payret Cinema View from Capitolio steps * The Malec√≥n is the avenue that runs along the seawall at the northern shore of Havana, from Old Havana to the Almendares River. * The Paseo del Prado, Havana is the street that forms the western edge of Old Havana, being its boundary with Centro Habana. * Castillo del Morro, a picturesque fortress guarding the entrance to Havana bay. The construction of the castle Los Tres Reyes del Morro owed to the step along in Havana of the English pirate Sir Francis Drake. The king of Spain arranged its construction on a big stone which was known by the name of El Morro. He sent the field master Juan de Texeda, accompanied by the military engineer Battista Antonelli, who came to Havana in 1587 and began the task at once. * La Caba√±a fortress, located on the east side of the Havana Bay. It impresses with its 18th-century walls, constructed at the same time as El Morro. Every night at 9 p.m., soldiers dressed in uniforms of the era shoot from here, the ‚Äúel ca√±onazo de las nueve‚Äù, (gunshot of the nine). It goes off every day, to warn of the closing of the doors of the wall that surrounded the city. * San Salvador de la Punta Fortress, On the shore opposite to the Castle of El Morro, at the beginning of the curve of El Malecon, rises the fortress of San Salvador de la Punta. It was constructed in 1590, and in 1629 the Chapter of Havana decided that to defend better the port, to join it, at night, with the El Morro by using a thick chain that prevented the entry of enemy ships. * Castillo de la Real Fuerza, The fortress or (lit.) Castle of the Royal Army is another big monument that closes the Plaza de las Armas. It was the first big fortification of the city, initiated in 1558 on the ruins of an ancient fortress. In the same year, the Crown sent to Cuba the engineer Bartolom√© Sanchez, supervised by 14 official and main stonemasons in order to reconstruct the castle, which had been set fire and destroyed by the French corsair Jacques de Sores. * Catedral de San Crist√≥bal, the most prominent building on the Plaza de la Catedral. The cathedral was raised on the chapel after 1748 by order of the bishop from Salamanca, Jose Felipe de Trespalacios.

Threats An unrestored street in Old Havana In 2008, Hurricane Ike destroyed many structures in Old Havana, overturning years of conservation work directed at the iconic antiquated buildings of the area. Not only did it damage historic buildings, but it forced many of Old Havana's residents to flee for safety. The threats that hurricanes pose adds to an already tenuous state for Old Havana's many historic buildings. Age, decay, and neglect combine with natural factors in a complex set of threats to the long-term preservation of this historic old town. UNESCO Heritage site In 1982, La Habana Vieja was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.Habana Vieja ‚Äì UNESCO World Heritage List A safeguarding campaign was launched a year later to restore the authentic character of the buildings.

The Court held that the mere presence of the accused at the scene of a criminal act is not sufficient to convict the person for aiding and abetting a criminal act. There must be something more. Background Two teenagers, Dunlop and Sylvester, were members of a motorcycle club. One evening they went to a party held by the club where other members were involved in a gang rape of a teenage girl. The girl testified at trial that the two teens had participated in the rape. The trial judge directed the jury to find whether the teens had participated enough to have aided or abetted the rape under section 21(1) of the Criminal Code or had a common intention to rape the victim under section 21(2) of the Criminal Code. Opinion of the Court Justice Dickson wrote the decision for the majority. He held that the trial judge had erred in instructing the jury to consider the \\"common intention\\" provision of the Criminal Code. The sole issue was whether the teens had aided and abetted the commission of the crime. In considering the provision he held that: :In the case at bar I have great difficulty in finding any evidence of anything more than mere presence and passive acquiescence. Presence at the commission of an offence can be evidence of aiding and abetting if accompanied by other factors, such as prior knowledge of the principal offender's intention to commit the offence or attendance for the purpose of encouragement. There was no evidence that while the crime was being committed either of the accused rendered aid, assistance or encouragement to the rape of Brenda Ross. There was no evidence of any positive act or omission to facilitate the unlawful purpose.p. 896 Accordingly, the two teens were acquitted.

His surname is a Yoruban word meaning \\"born during father's absence\\". is a mutant fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as a member of the student body of the Xavier Institute.  Fictional character biography = Xavier Institute/M-Day  Prior to M-Day, he was part of Storm's unseen squad.Nezhno's position as a member of Storm's former squad was revealed by his creators on the uncannyxmen.net forum. He kept his powers in the wake of M-Day, and thus still resides at the Xavier Institute. Emma Frost told him to step out from a sparring match to determine who would become the team of X-Men trainees. It is later noted that Nezhno is from Wakanda, and he was the only student allowed to attend the wedding of Storm and the king of Wakanda, the Black Panther.New X-Men, vol. 2 #29  Quest for Magik  Nezhno is among the students who are listening to Blindfold's story about Magik, Belasco and Limbo. He, with the other students are transported to Limbo. It is revealed that Nezhno's code-name is Gentle and he has the ability to temporarily increase the mass of his muscles. Messiah Complex During his return to the school after Limbo, Nezhno went into a deep meditative state to calm himself and to pray about his \\"violence\\" in defense of his friends. It was at this point that he revealed that his power was a dangerous one, and that it would eventually take his life. He also retained his calm while fellow student Pixie, whom he had saved in Limbo, showed obvious interest in him.New X-Men vol. 2 #42 This was nothing more, however, than a calm before the storm because soon he was thrust head first into a life changing battle when the O*N*E Sentinel went rogue and attempted to not only destroy the Xavier Institute but to kill him and his fellow students. Springing into action Nezhno used his power like never before and increased his muscle mass, height, and weight to dangerous degrees. Despite the health risks and being told to stay put by headmaster Scott Summers, he jumped into the fray and may have saved many lives by his intervention. Despite knowing that his life may be forfeit he did his best to halt the Sentinels and was apparently neutralized by one and lay depowered and unconscious on the battlefield.Uncanny X-Men #493 Nezhno proved himself quite durable however and was not seen in the infirmary with the sick and injured but turned up in defense of his sick friends when Predator X attacked the school looking for an easy meal. Nezhno and Armor use a combination of their powers to hold off the beast while Pixie teleports them to what remains of Muir Island. Once there they continue their fight with the monster.New X-Men vol. 2 #46 Divided We Stand Just three days after the events of Messiah Complex, Nezhno decided to head back to his homeland, Wakanda. He was relieved to be free of the pestering of his former classmates, saying that they \\"nearly destroyed [him] with their insanity\\". During his return however, he found himself ostracized not only by his fellow Wakandans, but also by his own mother - due to the facts that his biological father was Russian, and therefore he is only seen as an outsider to his people. He then reflects that the only people who accepted him were the New X-Men, and he regrets having pushed them away.X-men: Divided We Stand #1 Worlds Apart Nezhno kills a Wakandan priest and is then placed in jail; however, Storm doesn't believe he is responsible until she is shown security footage of the act taking place. Ororo notices Nezhno acting out of character when he winks at the camera. She asks him to wink for her but he doesn't know what it is so Ororo has him freed declaring him innocent. Later the Black Panther orders his execution and winks at Ororo. It is revealed Shadow King is the one framing Nezhno. Manifest Destiny Neznho moves to San Francisco along with the rest of the X-Men. Powers and abilities Nezhno has the ability to temporarily increase the muscle mass of his body to extreme levels. He can will himself to immediately grow and strengthen to the extent that he can lift at least 100 tons.X-Men Worlds Apart vol. 1. Gentle uses his powers However, he cannot sustain this form for long since it causes massive strain on his body and leads to seizures. After Belasco had kidnapped the New X-Men to Limbo, Nezhno was able to protect Pixie and defeat N'astirh before passing out. The vibranium tattoos adorning his body help to keep his powers in check, but Nezhno indicated that eventually his powers may kill him.New X-Men vol. 2 #42 Also important to note is the fact that when his powers are in use his vibranium tattoos glow. It was revealed that the tattoos are actually Vibranium-based paints that were intended to be fused with his skin, due to his powers. Nezhno has also said that he lacks any sense of touch, but it is possible that he might have felt Mercury touch him at some point. Nezhno was excused from Emma's New X-Men brawl for his own safety and only participated in minimal violence while in Limbo. He saves this power for emergencies as it can only be used for a short period of time. It is later revealed that the reason behind Nezhno‚Äôs pain in using his powers and from his lack of touch stems from a subconscious form of self-restraint he placed on himself due to the verbal and physical abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother. When Jean Grey helped to remove these psychological scars this has now enabled Nezhno to use his powers without any detriment and restored his sense of touch. According to Jean Grey, Gentle is powerful enough to go toe-to-toe with the Hulk if he could just will it.X-Men Red #2 Personality and beliefs Nezhno is a calm and passive individual. Though not cold, he does not speak much. He seems to hold strong pacifistic beliefs and refrains from any sort of violence, though those may originate from the self-lethal nature of his mutation. His codename spawns from these beliefs. Likewise, he only uses his powers \\"in emergencies\\". He also looks similar to the character Requiem who appeared in Uncanny X-Men #382 as part of the Neo Lost Souls. Other versions=Age of X In the Age of X reality, Gentle is seen as an inhabitant of Fortress X.

He was a member of the Army ROTC program obtaining the rank of Cadet Captain and being elected Finance Office of Phalanx, the University's military honor fraternity. Here he met an Elizabeth Jane Herd, whom he would marry on May 16, 1942, at Fort Benning, Georgia, in the Post Chapel. Military service After graduation, Bogen was commissioned as a reserve officer in the Army and assigned the command of a CCC division in Louisiana. After the Nazi invasion of Poland, Bogen requested his reserve commission to be activated. Upon activation, he was assigned to the 2nd Armored Division as an assistant to then Colonel George S.

He saw combat from Normandy, Brittany, North France, the Ardennes, the Rhineland, and across Germany. He was among early American Army soldiers to meet up with the Russians near Mittweida, Germany along the Zschopau River on May 8, 1945. Graduate education After World War II, he left active duty and became an Army reserve lieutenant colonel. During this time, he pursued a doctorate in Speech Communications at Ohio State University with research in the nascent fields of educational radio and television. As he neared completion of his degree, the growing tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the Army re-activating him. When he returned from his tour of duty, he was disappointed to find that his faculty adviser at Ohio State had published his dissertation as his own work. He decided not to start over so he did not get his doctorate. Korean War From 1951-1954, during the Korean War, he was an instructor at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas where he revamped the curriculum, introduced modern pedagogical techniques, better training of instructors, and helped design Bell Hall.

Upon graduation, he became a professor at the War College. When the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was established in 1961, Bogen was made the Assistant to the Director. During his time at the DIA, Bogen was assigned to be the chief of security for the visit of Nikita Khrushchev to the United States. Vietnam War From 1964 to 1965, Colonel Bogen served under General William Westmoreland as the head of the Army Concept Team in Vietnam and was an outspoken opponent of the Tactical Air Command System Report that favored consolidating all tactical air operations under the US Air Force. During his service in Vietnam, he received the Legion of Merit twice, a Bronze Star, and an Air Medal. Return to War College In 1966 after returning from Vietnam, Colonel Bogen was again a faculty member at the U.S. Army War College as the first recipient of the Eisenhower Chair of Strategic Appraisal During this time, he was recognized as one of the first professional soldiers to advocate the military as nation-builders. 4th Army In 1969, Bogen was transferred to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas where he served as the Chief of Staff of the 4th Army. Upon the merging of the 4th and 5th Armies in 1971, he was offered a promotion to brigadier general as commander of Schofield Barracks in Hawaii after being passed over at least four times for a promotion. Retirement Colonel Bogen, however, decided he did not want to relocate again, particularly since his second oldest son had just started college and his youngest was in the middle of high school. Instead, he retired and began to write his memoirs. However, he died of anaphylactic shock from a hornet sting at his home in San Antonio in 1972.

The first two were both primarily the enemies of Batman. Fictional character biographies=Eric Needham The original Black Spider first appeared in Detective Comics #463 (September 1976) and was created by Gerry Conway. Eric Needham is a small-time crook who is addicted to heroin. Eric was first sentenced to prison after mugging and nearly killing an elderly woman but, as a minor, he was out in three years. Over the next two years, Eric married his friend Linda Morrel and they had a son, Michael. Desperate for money to buy more drugs, he robs a liquor store. He kills the owner, who turns out to be his father. After being arrested, he kicks the habit out of remorse and begins a war on the drug trade. Donning a costume, he becomes a self-styled vigilante and begins killing those suspected of dealing drugs. This brings him into conflict with Batman. Needham believes that the two should be allies, as he sees common purpose in their war against criminals. His murderous methods, however, continually put him at odds with the Dark Knight. Needham's paraphernalia and missions as the Black Spider were bankrolled by a man who is secretly involved with narcotics and wants to take out the competition. Despite his professed desire to fight criminals, the Black Spider occasionally allies himself with costumed villains (most notably in the gathering of super-villains in Detective Comics #526 and Batman #400). Ostensibly, Black Spider's goal in this is to seek revenge against Batman, or at least, this is how he attempted to justify his actions in his own mind. Needham also faced King Faraday and Nightshade in a brief flashback in Secret Origins #28. During his war, Needham's wife and son are killed by a drug lord who discovers the Black Spider's identity. In a rage, the Spider prepares for one final assault. After being shot multiple times, Needham invades the drug lord's headquarters and detonates explosives strapped to his back, killing the drug dealers in the process. Eric Needham later turns up in Neil Gaiman's critically acclaimed fantasy comic The Sandman dating supporting character Lyta Hall. No explanation was given for his resurrection. Whatever the case, Needham's survival has since been confirmed and the character has made subsequent appearances as the Black Spider, such as in the miniseries Underworld Unleashed. He was seen in Identity Crisis as an ally of Deadshot, Monocle, and Merlyn. He is later a member of The Society. He is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell Free card from the Secret Six. =The New 52= In The New 52, Eric first appears as a member of the Suicide Squad, though he resents being forced to work with criminals despite being one himself. Despite his holier-than-thou attitude towards much of the team, he does not view himself as a hero, just as a man who kills criminals, even willing to smother them in their hospital beds. He is also slightly overconfident of his abilities, getting himself injured multiple times while assuming he could easily defeat several armed opponents.Suicide Squad (vol. 4) #1 Amanda Waller eventually offers him an opportunity to quit the team, stating that he is not a monster like the others. Eric declines, stating that he \\"needs\\" the team after losing his family.Suicide Squad (vol. 4) #8 However, this turns out to be a ploy, as Needham was actually a double agent working for Regulus of the terrorist group Basilisk. A double of Black Spider had accompanied the team to Basilisk's hideout, only to be shot by Deadshot, who realized it wasn't the true Spider because he would've dodged the bullet. The real Black Spider had invaded Amanda Waller's grandmother's home in order to kill both of them. However, he underestimates the cunning of both the senior Waller and the younger Waller and is defeated. He was then locked away in maximum security at Belle Reve. =DC Rebirth= The Black Spider reappears in DC Rebirth, in the title All Star Batman by Tom King and John Romita Jr.. He is one of the many villains that attempts to kill Batman for Two-Face's bounty. Needham this time has two cybernetic claws on his back and utilizes a machine gun. Batman defeats him and cuts these arms off with a chainsaw. All- Star Batman #1 Johnny LaMonica Johnny LaMonica, the second Black Spider. The second Black Spider first appeared in Batman #518 (May 1995). Professional hitman Johnny LaMonica takes the name \\"Black Spider\\" when he is sent to kill the crime lord Black Mask. He is thwarted by Batman and sent to prison. He sustains injuries during this incident that leaves his face a disfigured web of scars, giving his choice of codename an ironic touch. He is later killed by Detective Crispus Allen during a gang shooting. Black Spider had opened fire on Detective Renee Montoya, preparing to kill her, when Allen unloaded his magazine on the villain. Jim Corrigan sold the bullet that killed Black Spider on the black market.Gotham Central #23 (November 2004) Derrick Coe A third Black Spider appears shortly after as a member of the Society. He first appeared in Birds of Prey #87 (December 2005). Other Society members reported that he was presumed dead. Real name Derrick Coe, he apparently bought his \\"villain franchise\\" from the Calculator, who assigns him to help torture Savant into revealing the identity of Oracle. When Oracle sends in her task force, the Birds of Prey, to rescue Savant, Savant throws Coe out a window, nearly killing him ‚Äî Black Canary speculates that he may be a metahuman, allowing him to survive the experience.

His primary instrument was the clarinet but he sometimes played various saxophones. Early life and education He was born in Syracuse, New York, and moved to New York City in 1939; he played tenor saxophone with Will Bradley, Tommy Reynoldshttp://www.worldsrecords.com/pages/artists/r/reynolds_tommy/tommy_reynolds_61224.html and Joe Marsala until 1940. After a brief time with Charlie Spivak, he joined the Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band in which he served in Europe during World War II. During this time, Peanuts (the nickname comes from a childhood love of the food) began to concentrate on the clarinet \\"because we did a lot of marching in sand, which was awkward with the tenor.\\" He was featured in Miller's hard-driving versions of \\"Stealin' Apples\\" and \\"Mission to Moscow\\". Post-war period Jack Lesberg, Max Kaminsky, and Peanuts Hucko Photo: Gottlieb During the post-war period, Hucko played in the bands of Benny Goodman, Ray McKinley, Eddie Condon and Jack Teagarden. From 1950 to 1955, he was busy in New York as a studio musician for CBS and ABC. This was followed by more work with Goodman and Teagarden, after which he joined the Louis Armstrong All-Stars from 1958 to 1960. When he visited Tokyo, Japan, as the lead alto saxophone player of Benny Goodman's Orchestra in January, 1951, he listened to clarinetist Shoji Suzuki and his Rhythm Aces. With Suzuki and his band, they recorded the song \\"Suzukake No Michi\\", which broke sales records in Japan. Hucko led his own group at Eddie Condon's Club from 1964 to 1966. He became famous as the clarinet soloist on Cole Porter's \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\", which was featured on Frank Sinatra's 1955 album In the Wee Small Hours. In 1964, he opened his own nightclub in Denver, Peanuts Hucko's Navarre, featuring his singer wife Louise Tobin (formerly Mrs. Harry James) and Ralph Sutton. From 1966, he was featured regularly at Dick Gibson's Colorado jazz parties where he appeared with the Ten Greats of Jazz, later called the World's Greatest Jazz Band. In the 1970s he led the Glenn Miller Orchestra and toured with them across the U.S. and abroad. During this period he toured the U.K. as guest soloist with the Million Airs Orchestra, appearing with them in recreations of the Glenn Miller AEF Orchestra concerts and broadcasts. Hucko is perhaps best known to the public for his appearances with the Lawrence Welk Orchestra on national TV during the early 1970s. The 1980s brought renewed success with a busy concert and touring schedule as a soloist and with his award-winning Pied Piper quintet. He and Tobin later settled into semi-retirement in Denton, Texas. His last recording was 1992's Swing That Music featuring Tobin, trumpeter Randy Sandke, and pianist Johnny Varro. He died 2003 in Fort Worth, Texas at the age of 85.Michael \\"Peanuts\\" Hucko: Newspaper Obituary and Death Notice, _The Fort Worth Star-Telegram_ , June 23, 2003 Compositions Peanuts Hucko wrote or co-wrote the following songs: \\"See You Again\\", \\"A Bientot\\", \\"Peanut Butter\\", which appeared on V-Disc 812B, \\"Blintzes Bagel Boogie\\", which appeared on V-Disc 825A, \\"Falling Tears\\", \\"First Friday\\", \\"Tremont Place\\", and \\"Sweet Home Suite\\".

Sir Henry Parkes' Birthplace, Moat House Lane. Canley Fire Station Canley Community Centre Canley is a suburban neighbourhood located in southwest Coventry, England. Canley became part of Coventry as a result of successive encroachment of the latter's boundaries between 1928 and 1932, having historically been part of the Stoneleigh parish. Electorally, it is split largely between the Wainbody and Earlsdon wards. The area is home to many students attending the nearby University of Warwick. There was a level crossing adjacent to Canley railway station until 2003, when the road was closed and a foot bridge was built over the railway. The suburb is bisected by the A45 dual-carriageway, with a major state housing development (built in the early-1950s) lying to the south and an area of private housing (Canley Gardens) situated north of this road towards Canley rail station. Adjacent districts include Cannon Park and Cannon Hill to the east, Tile Hill South to the north and Westwood Heath to south. History Canley is known as the site of the main factory of the Standard Motor Company and was all open farmland before 1916. The initial factory was built around 'Ivy Cottage', near the Canley Train Halt and was first used in 1916 to build First World War fighter aircraft. 'Standard' cars were produced there from 1918 onwards. The factory continued to expand over the site throughout the 1920s and most significantly just before the Second World War when two additional Shadow Factories were added. Production of Standard and Triumph cars continued until car production ceased in August 1980 as part of British Leyland's rationalisation, although the Triumph brand survived until 1984 with the last cars being built at other British Leyland factories. Some of the Triumph car factory site was retained as a technical centre until the mid-1990s but was successively demolished thereafter. A commemorative sculpture of the Standard-Triumph badge now stands on the site of the works, on Herald Avenue, close to the Standard Triumph Club, which is now the only remaining building of the industrial complex where thousands of Coventry people once worked. Sir Henry Parkes (1815‚Äì1896), Australian statesman and five times Premier of New South Wales, was born in Canley, in a cottage off Moat House Lane. Canley Fire Station is in Sir Henry Parkes Road near to the A45. A school named after him in Canley has been demolished.

It is a herbaceous perennial which is valued in cultivation for its erect stems of foamy cream flowers in summer. Description Tiarella cordifolia has a scaly horizontal rhizome and seasonal runners. The leaves are long, basal, long stalked, hairy, with 3-7 shallow lobes, and heart-shaped at the base. They are dark green usually mottled with brown, rough-hairy above and downy beneath. They have long flowering stems that can grow as tall as . The flowers are white, small and feathery and form a long terminal cluster on a leafless stalk. The inflorescences are tall, with the flowers borne in close, erect racemes. The flowers have 5 petals (entire) and 10 stamens (long and slender), giving the flower cluster a fuzzy appearance. The two unequal seed capsules split along their inside seams, releasing several pitted seeds. This tiarella spreads well by rhizomes, unlike other cultivated tiarellas, but lacks the invasive tendencies of many more-commonly employed groundcovers. The flowers are visited by small bees, syrphus flies, and butterflies that may affect pollination. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Inflorescence Origin of name Tiarella meaning a little tiara, is a diminutive of the Greek word tiara meaning turban. The genus name refers to the unequal seedpods. The Latin specific epithet cordifolia means ‚Äúheart-shaped leaves‚Äù. Cultivars * Tiarella cordifolia 'FM Mooberry' is named after F. M. Mooberry of the Brandywine Conservancy. Uses It is listed in herbology as a tonic and a diuretic. It has been used for kidney problems, liver problems, and congestion of the lungs. References * *Cox, Donald.

The peak was named in 1870 to honor Henry D. Washburn, leader of the Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition. The Washburn Range is one of two mountains ranges completely within the boundaries of Yellowstone. History On August 29, 1870, members of the Washburn- Langford-Doane Expedition ascended the peak they named Mount Washburn after their expedition leader, Henry D. Washburn. A portion of Lt. Gustavus Cheyney Doane's description is quoted below: Mount Washburn became a very popular tourist attraction early in the park's history. Many tourist accounts tell of a trip to the summit of Mount Washburn. In 1879, Mrs. Elizabeth D. Wickes of Boulder, Montana, in a party of eight men and five ladies, spent six weeks touring the park. Her account of Mount Washburn follows: In 1914, two years before automobiles were allowed in Yellowstone, noted author Elbert Hubbard and his wife Alice spent two weeks touring Yellowstone. In a short article written after the trip‚ÄîA Little Journey to the Yellowstone Hubbard described his visit to Mount Washburn. Mount Washburn trails Views from the summit include much of the northern section of Yellowstone National Park and on clear days, the Teton Range is also visible. The mountain trails are some of the most frequented in the park, so summer hikes can be crowded. With an altitude gain of 1,393 feet (424 m) in 3 miles (4.8 km), the hike from Dunraven Pass to the summit is moderate. Another trail that climbs 1,491 feet (454 m) in only 2.25 miles (3.6 km) starts from the Chittenden parking area. One of three active fire lookout towers in Yellowstone is located on the summit. There is a small visitor center and restrooms on the first floor, an observation deck on the second, and a ranger's residence on the top floor (closed to the public).

The valley has an area of and is located in the Sierra de los √ìrganos mountains (part of Guaniguanico range), just north of Vi√±ales in the Pinar del R√≠o Province. Overview Manuel Rivera-Ortiz: Tobacco Harvesting, Vi√±ales Valley, Cuba 2002 Tobacco and other crops are cultivated on the bottom of the valley, mostly by traditional agriculture techniques. Many caves dot the surrounding hillfaces (Cueva del Indio, Cueva de Jos√© Miguel). The conspicuous limestone cliffs rising like islands from the bottom of the valley are called mogotes. They can be up to 300m tall. Vi√±ales is a major tourist destination offering mainly hiking and rock climbing. The local climbing scene has started to take off in the last few years with many new routes being discovered resulting in an increase in local tourism. Geography There are some mountain formations, unique in the island, called mogotes. These mogotes constitute unique geomorphological formations where some of them come to measure great height. These mogotes resemble a great diversity of forms because they are only comparable with those located in China and the peninsula of Malacca. In the valley, there are other elevations, such as Alturas de Pizarras, which are formed by a variety of rocks, the oldest existing throughout the country and also in the Caribbean area. Conservation Many endemic plants and animals are specific to this valley. Flora found in the region include Bombax emarginatum, mountain palm (Gaussia princeps), Ekmanianthe actinophilla, and Microcycas calocoma. Fauna includes bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae, zunz√∫n), Cuban trogon (Priotelus temnurus), Cuban tody (Todus multicolor), Cuban solitaire (Myadestes elisabeth) and Cuban grassquit (Tiaris canorus). Mural of Prehistory Mural in Vi√±ales Valley In the valley of Dos Hermanas, we can find the Mural of Prehistory, which is painted on a stone of one of the elevations. This mural shows the evolution of life in a natural sense of Cuba. The Mural of Prehistory is located in the mogote called Pita. It can be found on a perpendicular slope. The rock was washed and drains were also made in it to avoid erosion in the future due to the rain. It is 120 meters high and 160 meters in length. The artist was Leovigildo Gonz√°lez Morillo, who was Director of Cartography of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba. In it are represented Guanahatabeyes Indians, species of mammals, gigantic animals, as well as some mollusks. In the Mural can be seen in 12 pieces the evolutionary process of men and animals in the Sierra de los Organs, in its different stages.

Every year it is held the Saturday after summer examinations finish and all proceeds go towards charities selected earlier in the academic year. So far it has raised over ¬£150,000. The committee is a student group associated with University of Birmingham Guild of Students, the university's students' union. The beginning of each year sees the nomination and selection of charities that each year would raise money for, from student depression and adolescent mental health, to general poverty causes. Generally, several stages are organised on the day, as well as comedy and performance tents, society events and workshops, and an after party.  History = 2000s  With the aim of both raising money and awareness for AIDS-related causes and addressing the lack of live music on campus, the Birmingham University Stop AIDS society attempted to arrange a large festival at the Guild Building in 2005. The Guild of Students pulled out, deeming the event unfeasible. Simultaneously a much larger event was being planned on University (rather than guild) property: The Vale Festival. The Vale Festival team, an independent group of students and the Student Stop Aids committee joined forces. Local bands, student societies and the large team of volunteer organisers worked to make the event, held in the Vale student village, a substantial success in June 2005. The chosen focus was the crisis in Sudan. ¬£12,000 was raised, and the event was widely viewed as a major success. The Vale Festival 2006 took place on 6 June. Attended by over 3,900 students, and raising approximately ¬£25,000 for two charities - UNICEF and SPW, for their HIV/AIDS projects in Kenya and Zimbabwe respectively - the event was hailed as probably the biggest and best event ever to be staged at The University of Birmingham .History section of \\"About Us\\" page of Vale Festival 2007 website Highlights of the day included performances from numerous bands, singers and DJs - Old School Tie, The Anomalies, First Rate, Vijay Kashore and the 360 headlined once again, pulling in a crowd of over 200 students which created an amazing end to a great line up of live bands. DJ, drumming and singing workshops also went on throughout the day, as did drama performances, healing spaces and many stalls run by student societies. The day culminated in an outdoor cinema screening of 'The Constant Gardener', and three different rooms for the club night inside Shackleton Hall. The 2007 festival was held on 12 June, with just over 5,000 students on the day. The event aimed to raise awareness of the humanitarian effects of climate change on people in poorer nations. Vale Festival '07 supported two charities, Kids for Kids and Action Aid, and raised over ¬£30,000. The line-up was as follows: Main Stage: The Anomalies, The Tommys, Laid Blak, Floors and Walls, Hobbit, Lazy J, Old School Tie, Friendly Fire, Stanley's Choice, University Gospel Choir Kids for Kids Chillout Tent: Transient Dreams, Two Spot Gobi, Yamit Mamo, Swing Manouche, Tanante, The Old Dance School, KTB, Kid-iD, Hannah Rhodes ActionAid Dance Arena: Deepgroove, Will Bailey, Aries, Far Too Loud, Joebot, Mikee Lazy, Hobbit & Bass6, Fat Gold Chain, DJ Shei\\"Program\\" page of Vale Festival 2007 website Vale Festival 2008 took place on 10 June and had near the full capacity of 5500. The theme for the year was 'Water for Life', with the festival focussed on the issue of sustainable access to clean water in the developing world and raised ¬£30,000 for WaterAid, Play Pumps and Pump Aid. The main stage, dance tent and Hilltop Tent were headlined by Misty's Big Adventure, Andy Morris and Watch this Fire Spread respectively. There was a generous mix of entertainment throughout the festival, including African drumming, wood carving and capoeira. The open air cinema screening was of 'Shooting Dogs' and the after party took place on The Vale within the University. Vale Festival 2009 took place on 9 June, with the charitable causes being chosen as Self Help Africa and FareShare. The ethic proposed was to 'Unite Against Hunger'. The Main Stage, Hill-Top Tent and Forest Edge Stage were headlined by 360, Picture Book and Rafiki and Tangawizi respectively. With the growth of the festival since its introduction in 2005, more stages were added as well as workshop spaces, societies and stalls among others. The Jungle Jam was also introduced- encouraging students to create their own unique musical experience. Once again the festival was committed to raising awareness for ethical causes. The ideals promoted were to \\"Think Globally, Act locally\\" and \\"We must be the change we want to see in the world\\". The chosen causes were a direct result of these ideals, with both charities working towards the sustainable use of natural resources, reducing the vulnerability to Aids and the redistribution of food aid to areas of intense poverty.  2010s  Vale Festival 2010 took place on 8 June, with the charitable causes being chosen as Oxfam, Procedo Foundation and the Malaria Consortium. The focus was on raising money and awareness for projects supporting sufferers of malaria. The 2010 programme also stated that since its formulation over ¬£115,000 had been donated to charitable causes. The Main Stage, Hill Top Tent, Forest Edge and Jungle Jam were headlined by Scarlet Harlots, Lucy Ward, Bigger Than Barry and Uprizing respectively. Once again the range of live performance, interactive workshops and stalls was widened. These included bicycle-powered smoothies, a vintage clothes stall and live graffiti and art battles. There was also an outdoor screening of The Hurt Locker, as well as the official after party. The ethical causes were chosen to raise the awareness of those who suffer with malaria in the face of extreme poverty. The money raised by ValeFest was donated directly to training for health workers, education and the treatment and diagnosis for the prevention of malaria. As well as this, money was donated toward the construction of sanitation systems in Kirakhadi, with the long-term goal being the prevention of disease. Vale Festival 2011 took place on 15 June, with the Helen Bamber Foundation and the Calla Trust being chosen as the causes. The Main Stage, Hill Top Tent and Dance Tent were headlined by 360, Rachel Harlow and Tom Leech Trio, and Seedy Sonics respectively. The range of workshops included (in part) Dancing, Circus skills, Fire spinning and Yoga. Creative workshops and stalls were also running throughout the day simultaneously with the musical entertainment. Valefest 2011 also presented a live performance of 'X', which was commissioned specifically for the festival with the aim of focusing upon human trafficking. The causes were chosen to address the issue of human trafficking in part as a response to work within the Midlands. The money raised by Valefest for The Calla Trust and Helen Bamber Foundation would aim to provide training and counselling directly to those involved, as well as working toward durable solutions. Vale Fest 2012 was on 2 June, raising money for Action for Children and War Child, with both charities focusing on relief for children in warzones. Electric Swing Circus, whose guitarist Tom Hyland was part of the original Vale Festival organisers, headlined the Main Stage. On 1 June, Vale Festival 2013 introduced the Beats Around the Bush dance stage. Magnus Puto headlined the Main Stage, and the focus of this year was 'Music for the Mind', specifically student depression and adolescent mental health. ¬£15,000 was raised and completely donated to two charities: Students Against Depression and YoungMinds. The main-stage headliner was The Magnus Puto. 2014's Valefest was on 7 June, with cancer charities Macmillan Cancer Support and Trekstock selected as the charities to have money raised for them. Electric Swing Circus returned as headliners, with the woodland Dance Stage returning by popular demand. This event was the most successful so far, raising over ¬£25,000 for both charities. thumb This ValeFest saw a focus on the rebranding of the festival as a sustained and continuous annual festival, with the official event renaming and branding as 'ValeFest', while the committee of student volunteers remained 'The Vale Festival'. It was decided that poverty would be the focus of this years festival, with proceeds received by Child Poverty Action Group and Medic Malawi. A change in infrastructure and professionalism led to a greater emphasis on expanding the festival beyond students. The Main Stage was headlined by Will and The People, and the dance stage by New York Transit Authority. Taking place on 4 June, the charities chosen for ValeFest 2016 were Action Against Malaria Foundation and Birmingham Children's Hospital. The festival was headlined by The Dub Pistols, alongside Adam Barnes, Everybody Looks Famous and Shadow City. In 2017, the theme of the charities were mental health. The chosen charities for 2017 were Rape & Sexual Violence Project, a charity providing support across Birmingham and Solihull, and BasicNeeds, a global mental health organisation. Headlining the festival were The Mouse Outfit, Bodalia, Buckfast Boys Club, Lisbon and IORA. 2018 saw the festival grow bigger than ever before, with headline acts Fickle Friends and Little Comets causing tickets to sell out in record time. The chosen charities were ShelterBox and Sifa Fireside. Growing from the success of 2018, 2019's event took place on 8 June and was headlined by The Hunnahttps://twitter.com/TheValeFestival/status/1116762965708034048 with Saint Raymond, Ivory Wave and Chopstick Dubplate also performing. The size of the festival site was increased and more tickets were sold than ever before to raise money for the chosen charities St Basil's, Sense and Kids Adventurehttps://twitter.com/TheValeFestival/status/1135881234733850624.  Organisation  The festival takes months of planning, with a committee team being assembled at the start of the academic year, which tends to increase in number year on year. The committee is non-hierarchical, meaning there is no single individual who is in charge of the event. A core committee maintains the sub-committees which take responsibility for different aspects of the festival, such as entertainments, marketing, site, decorations, relations, charities and catering.

Khar is an affluent suburb of Mumbai, north of Bandra and south of Santacruz, Mumbai. Originally one of the 'villages' that made up the larger Bandra, the present suburb is divided into Khar West and Khar East areas. It is serviced by Khar Road railway station of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. It is an area within convenient distances of several schools, restaurants, parks, promenades and shopping centres. Khar, which means 'salty' in the local language Marathi has acquired this name in reference to the sea water near the Carter Road Promenade shore. Here, one also finds the historic fishing village of \\"Khar Danda\\", which is one of the villages that made up the original Bandra area. History and Present Khar Road station Local fishing community drying fish at Khar Danda. Most of the historic Khar area of Bandra was marshlands of salty sea water. Khar (East) barely makes its presence felt existing as a small spread of land between the railway station and the Western Express Highway, sandwiched between Bandra and Santacruz. Khar (West) on the other hand has been one of Mumbai's finest neighbourhoods to reside in, and is widely considered and clubbed together as one overall Bandra-Khar suburb. This is evident from several destinations and establishments in Khar (West) being attributed to Bandra West; eg. McDonald's and KFC outlets at Linking Road, the northern parts of both Carter Road and Pali Hill are all technically in Khar West, bearing the Khar postal code 400052 instead of Bandra's 400050, but are yet regarded and also referred to in their addresses as being a part of Bandra. The joint Bandra-Khar Residential Zone is an affluent and peaceful area which is evergreen throughout the year. Peaceful, tree-shaded lanes are a charming characteristic of this area. Pathare Prabhus were one of the earliest inhabitants of Khar, from almost a century and half ago. In the early 1900s, the Pathare Prabhu community lived in South Mumbai and used their quaint bungalows in Khar as weekend dwellings. Khar Danda was one of the original villages of the erstwhile larger Bandra. Back then, the local Bandra railway station was felt distant to alight from trains and hire 'tangas' (horse carriages) to get to these bungalows in the Khar part of Bandra. Keeping these factors in mind, as well as the growing number of homes in this part, a second railway station named 'Khar Road' was introduced in north Bandra on 1st July, 1924. This development is the primary reason for Khar to start being spoken of as a suburb by itself. The Pathare Prabhu community still has land ownership over a large area of Bandra/Khar. Khar is home to many Bollywood celebrities. Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Parineeti Chopra, Karan Johar, Ramesh Sippy, Ashutosh Gowarikar, Karisma Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, Tiger Shroff, Shilpa Shirodkar, Anuradha Paudwal and Srijit Mukherji live in Khar (West). It was once inhabited by stars like Dilip Kumar and his wife Saira Banu, Sunil Dutt and Nargis with son Sanjay Dutt, Manoj Kumar, Sadhana and music director/singer Hemant Mukherjee and Shailendra. Khar is also home to union minister of railways, Suresh Prabhu, Sharukh Khan's office Gauri Khan production house is at Khar and Mahesh Bhatt's office is also located here. It is an area with some of Mumbai's best shopping and fine dining addresses. Khar also has some renowned sports facilities. Khar Gymkhana is one of Mumbai's most exclusive sports clubs. The Wellington Catholic Gymkhana is also located in Khar near the Khar Subway. There are a number of turfs that have come up in Khar for cricket and football.

He guided the city through a series of tornadoes that shattered the region on May 11, 1970. He imposed a curfew to restore order. He had just become mayor when the tornadoes occurred. He served only one two-year term from 1970-1972. He was a member of the Lubbock City Council from 1966-1970. He did not seek a second two-year term in 1972 and was succeeded by city councilman Morris W. Turner. Mayors and council members in Texas are all officially nonpartisan, but Granberry was known to be a Republican. In 1974, Granberry was the Texas Republican gubernatorial nominee. He won only 7 of the 254 counties and hence lost the general election by a wide margin to incumbent Democratic Governor Dolph Briscoe of Uvalde. Gubernatorial race Granberry was opposed for the Republican gubernatorial nomination by Odell McBrayer, the candidate of what later became known as the \\"Religious Right\\". Granberry handily defeated McBrayer, an attorney, 53,617 votes (77.6 percent) to 15,489 ballots (22.4 percent) in a low-turnout primary. Granberry was the choice of Republican U.S. Senator John G. Tower, the nominal head of the Texas GOP at the time. He would carry his party's tattered banner in the year in which the national party was dragged down by the Watergate scandal, which had forced the resignation of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. Dolph Briscoe hence defeated Granberry in the strongly Democratic year nationwide. Briscoe polled 1,016,334 votes (61.4 percent), compared to 514,725 (31.1 percent) for Granberry, and 93,295 for the Hispanic Raza Unida Party nominee, Ramsey Mu√±iz, who had also been the La Raza candidate in 1972. Another approximately thirty thousand ballots were cast for other candidates. Briscoe, who had served the last two-year gubernatorial term in Texas, therefore became the first Texas governor to win a four-year term since the establishment of the Texas Constitution of 1876. Yet, Briscoe polled 617,159 fewer votes against Granberry than he had with his initial election in 1972 against the conservative Republican Henry Cushing Grover of Houston, because of a much lower turnout in 1974. Bush \\"Beer Bash\\" In 1978, Granberry advised congressional candidate George W. Bush, who was seeking to succeed the retiring veteran Democrat George Mahon of Lubbock. Bush said that Granberry urged him to \\"expose Hance's ownership\\" of a Lubbock bar across the street from Texas Tech that sold beer to Tech students. But Bush declined to do so. An advertisement appeared in the Texas Tech University newspaper in Lubbock which invited students to a \\"beer bash\\" at Granberry's home to drum up support for Bush. Hance, the Democrat candidate who defeated Bush in that election, attributed his victory more to the endorsement by Mahon than from public outrage over the \\"beer bash.\\" Later years In 1989, William Perry \\"Bill\\" Clements, Jr., the first Texas Republican governor since Reconstruction, appointed Granberry as chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. He resigned in the summer of 1991. In his later years, Granberry, an orthodontist, returned to his native Smith County. He was born in Lindale, Texas and resides in Hideaway, Texas.

The case was filed in early 1968 and implicated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others in conspiring with India against the stability of Pakistan. The case is officially called State vs. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others, but is popularly known as Agartala Sho≈óojontro Mamla (Agartala conspiracy case) as the main conspiracy was purported to have taken place in the Indian city of Agartala in Tripura state, where Sheikh Mujib's associates met Indian military officials. \\"The case against them became known as the Agartala Conspiracy Case since it was at Agartala that the accused were alleged to have met Indian army officers\\" On 22 February 2011, one of the accused of Agartala conspiracy case, Shawkat Ali, told the parliament in Bangladesh that the Agartala conspiracy case was not false and the charges brought against the accused were all true. He also confirmed that Mujibur Rahman and Mohammad Ali Reza had indeed gone to Agartala, India to seek Indian support for Bangladesh's independence. Accused The government of Pakistan brought charges against 35 political personalities including three eminent civil servants officials under civil law. \\"The list of thirty-five conspirators included three high-ranking East Pakistan civil servants.\\" They were Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ahmed Fazlur Rahman CSP, Steward Mujibur Rahman, Commander Moazzem Hossain, former LS Sultanuddin Ahmad, LSCDI Nur Mohammad, Flight Sergeant Mahfiz Ullah, Corporal Abdus Samad, former Havildar Dalil Uddin, Ruhul Quddus CSP, Flight Sergeant Md. Fazlul Haq, Bibhuti Bhushan Chowdhury alias Manik Chowdhury, Bidhan Krishna Sen, Subedar Abdur Razzaque, former clerk Mujibur Rahman, former Flight Sergeant Md. Abdur Razzaque, Sergeant Zahurul Haq, Benedict Dias, A.B. Khurshid, Khan Mohammad Shamsur Rahman CSP, AKM Shamsul Haque, Havildar Azizul Haq, Mahfuzul Bari, Sergeant Shamsul Haq, Shamsul Alam, Captain Mohammad Abdul Muttalib, 21 Baluch Regiment, Captain Shawkat Ali, Captain Khondkar Nazmul Huda, Captain A.N.M Nuruzzaman, Sergeant Abdul Jalil, Mahbub Uddin Chowdhury, Lt. M Rahman, former Subedar Tajul Islam, Ali Reza, Captain Khurshid Uddeen Ahmed, Master Warrant Officer Abdul Latif Majumdar, and Lt. Abdur Rauf. Plot and detection The plot was conceived by Sheikh Mujib in an attempt to ignite an armed revolution against West Pakistan that would result in the secession. Two of the accused, navy steward Mujibur Rahman and the educator Mohammad Ali Reza, went to Agartala, Tripura, a city in North-Eastern India to seek Indian support for an independent Bangladesh. The alleged conspiracy was uncovered by the Lieutenant Colonel Shamsul Alam, who commanded the East Pakistan Detachment of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). It was during this time that an officer of the East Bengal Regiment, Rauf ur Rahman, who was in league with the conspirators made an attempt on Alam's life. Alam displayed great bravery and chased the would-be assassins; for this Alam was awarded the Sitara-e-Basalat, the highest award for bravery in action during peacetime. In all, 1,500 Bengalis were arrested in connection with the plot in 1967. In January 1968 the Home Department of Pakistan declared that it had detected a scheme to destabilise Pakistan and break the Eastern wing through an armed revolt, and had arrested 8 people. Later on 18 January, the Department implicated Sheikh Mujib as well. He and others were arrested on 9 May 1968, and were subsequently released, only to be arrested later. At the time of the trial, the existence of a conspiracy between Mujib and India for the secession of East Pakistan was never successfully proven. \\"The Agartala contacts however did not provide solid evidence of a Mujib-India secessionist conspiracy in East Pakistan, and in its absence the accusations were to prove extremely counterproductive given the prevailing political atmosphere.\\" A confession in 2010, however, revealed the charges as fact. Trials Pakistan decided to try the accused by court-martial since a lot of the accused were military personnel. However, this was overturned in favour of a civil trial to implicate the politicians ahead of the 1970 elections as well as to provide transparency of the trials. Hence, only 35 were finally accused. The accused were then moved from Dhaka Central Jail to the secured borders of the Dhaka Cantonment. The penal codes were amended to benefit the prosecution of the accused, and the trial began on 19 June 1968 under a special tribunal. The hearings took place inside a secured chamber within the Dhaka Cantonment. The hearing became for Mujib an opportunity to publicise the Awami League demands. \\"Moreover, the hearing in open court presented Sheikh Mujib with the perfect platform to argue the Awami League cause.\\" The charge sheet of 100 paragraphs were presented before the tribunal, with 227 witnesses and 7 approvers. The tribunal was headed by 3 judges ‚Äì the chair, Justice SA Rahman was a non- Bengali; the other members MR Khan and Maksum-ul-Hakim were Bengalis. The government was represented by the Attorney General TH Khan and former Foreign Minister Manzur Quader. Thomas Williams, a British lawyer, along with local attorneys challenged the formation of the tribunal by filing a petition in favour of Sheikh Mujib. The approvers appeared in the witness box and testified that they provided false evidence under the coercion of the State. Members of public looked at the case as a conspiracy of the Pakistan government against the political autonomy movement of East Pakistan, especially since the government was keen to prove that Sheikh Mujib was an Indian agent and a separatist. They organised mass movement and demanded immediate withdrawal of the case and release of all prisoners. According to the government decision, the final date for the case was 6 February 1969. However, because of the mass upsurge of 1969, the government had to defer the date. In the morning of 15 February 1969, a Pakistani habildar shot point blank at Sergeant Zahurul Haq at the door of his jail cell, and killed him. \\"The popular hostility evoked by the case peaked when one of the defendants, Seargeant Zahurul Haq, was murdered while in custody.\\" The news of the killing led a furious mob to set fire to the State Guest House and other government buildings, where the chief lawyer for the government and the Chair of the tribunal resided. They vacated secretly. Some of the case files and evidence got burnt as a result of the arson. In the face of mass movement, the government withdrew the Agartala Conspiracy Case on 22 February 1969. The accused were released on the following day and the Race course Maidan saw a grand reception of the accused, where Sheikh Mujib was given his famous title Bangabandhu. Aftermath Angry protesters formed an action committee. This popular hostility forced Ayub Khan to withdraw the case and convene a Round Table Conference which Sheikh Mujib triumphantly attended but walked out of when his Six-Point demands were ignored. \\"In a by now familiar pattern, students led the protests forming an Action Committee with its own 11-Point Programme. Ayub attempted to placate the rising tide of anger by dropping the case and convening a Round Table Conference. Sheikh Mujib triumphantly emerged from prison to represent the Awami League at the Conference, but he walked out when its demands for full provincial autonomy were ignored.\\" The case and the resulting uprising was a major factor in the fall of Ayub Khan's government \\"The continuing disturbances in the eastern wing played an important role in the toppling of the Ayub regime.\\" and is also seen as one of the major events leading to Bengali nationalism and the Bangladesh Liberation War. Sergeant Zahurul Haq were honoured by the naming of a students' residential hall of the University of Dhaka after him. Confession In 2010, and on the anniversary of the withdrawal on 22 February 2011, surviving conspirator and Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Shawkat Ali confessed to the parliament at a point of order that the charges read out to them were accurate, stating that they formed a Shangram Parishad (Action Committee) under Sheikh Mujib for the secession of East Pakistan. Parliamentarian Tofael Ahmed added that had the case not been filed, the plot would have culminated in the secession of East Pakistan without bloodshed, and credit the Deputy Speaker for planning the liberation of the nation.

It is a series that examines some of the absurd effects of the rampant real estate speculation brought about in Japan in the late 1980s and the subsequent recession in the early 1990s. Story Raizo Fuwa is a 25-year-old salaryman living in a cramped home and working in a crowded office in Tokyo. His hopes for improved conditions are dashed when the new office building his company is supposed to move into is condemned as unsafe because the construction company has been cutting corners. Since the old building is already being demolished, they have no choice but to \\"temporarily\\" move the office into Fuwa's new flat. The final complication arrives in the form of the new employee Izumi Hiyama, a high school dropout the boss has promised to take care of as a favour to her family. No landlords are willing to rent to a 15-year-old girl, so she too has to move into Fuwa's home/office. Fuwa is instructed to be Izumi's 'Senpai' or senior both in terms of work experience and age. Fuwa begins to develop a close relationship with Izumi, and very early on in the series, Izumi admits that she has fallen in love with him. However, he does not respond initially, feeling that he should be more responsible and should first achieve his dream of buying (or, as suggested mid-way through the series, designing and constructing a house manually), a spacious home to call his own. Both Izumi and Fuwa struggle with their own maturity and very small network of relationships, and the 10-year difference in their age is dismissed as an unimportant factor in their romantic relationship.  Characters = Main characters  ; : Raizo Fuwa a 25-year-old man is the main character in this manga. He is certainly a reckless and irresponsible person. He lives in a very cramped apartment. He works in a small office which later will change into a home office, because the building that was supposed to be used as an office is condemned as unsafe because the construction company has been cutting the expenses for making it. His life started to change from this point, he had to give up his own room in apartment to be used as a temporary office and then he had to live together with Hiyama Izumi a 15-year-old girl that his company hired. He thinks like he was in some kind of hell to live with a girl 10 years younger, he must able to control his every desire as an adult. There were times that he couldn't control his desire anymore, but luckily there were always breaks that stopped him from doing anything to Izumi. He has a dream that he can have his own house, but he knows that such things were only a mere dream, but his passions never run out. With the help of Izumi he lived his life to the fullest. ; Izumi : She is an inexperienced 15-year-old who moved from the country to Tokyo to find work.

Detached on the 10th, she joined a hunter-killer group centered on the escort carrier on the 15th. On the 18th, the group returned to Casablanca, replenished and sortied again on the 23rd for another anti-submarine sweep west of the Canary Islands and south of the Azores. On the 29th, Block Island was sunk and was struck in the stern. Both were victims of torpedoes from . The remaining escorts commenced rescue and search operations, with Robert I. Paine taking on 279 survivors from the CVE, then moving in to cover the crippled DE. Another escort, , made contact with the U-boat, and assisted by , sank her.

Anti-submarine warfare training in Casco Bay followed, and on 12 July she anchored in Hampton Roads to await the sailing of UGS-48, a slow convoy to Bizerte. Underway on the 13th, her radar picked up enemy aircraft shadowing the convoy on the 31st, and she assisted in beating off a Luftwaffe attack on 1 August. At Boston again at the end of the month, she completed another escort run to Bizerte and back in early November; then, after further training, resumed anti-submarine activities, this time ranging between Casco Bay, Halifax, Nova Scotia and NS Argentia, Newfoundland.

He landed his first professional job with a local dance band at age 12. By the age of 16, his talent as a trombonist was recognized with a scholarship from the Interlochen Music Camp in Michigan and Bob held the first trombone chair in the school's 250 piece concert band. He later held the first trombone chair in the Quincy Symphony while also playing in many popular dance groups in Illinois. After serving in the Illinois National Guard as a bandsman during the Korean War, he left Quincy in 1955 to tour with the Ralph Flanagan Orchestra. In 1956, he joined George Girard's Dixieland Band at the Famous Door in New Orleans. There, he met his idol, Jack Teagarden. In 1957, Bob joined Al Hirt at Dan's Pier 600 on Bourbon Street when Hirt formed his very first band. The front line consisted of Hirt, Havens and Pete Fountain.

History Several years after the release of the GP32, its maker GamePark began to design their next handheld. A disagreement within the company about the general direction of this system prompted many of the staff (including the majority of engineers) to leave and create their own company, GamePark Holdings, to create, produce and market a 2D handheld system that they saw as the evolution of the GP32. In contrast, GamePark began developing the XGP, a 3D system similar to the PlayStation Portable. The XGP was never released and in March 2007, the old company filed for bankruptcy. The name of the 2D console was conceived as the GPX2. Eventually, GPH would run into difficulty with it due to a possible trademark violation with the name of a Japanese printer, the GPX, being considered too similar. Potential confusion with a \\"second generation printer\\" needed to be avoided, so a contest for a new name was announced on August 3, 2005. Around 1500 names were submitted by the deadline of the 15th day, but trademark issues hindered the registration of the fifteen selected names. Eventually, GamePark Holdings simply decided to swap some letters and name their handheld GP2X, finding it an available trademark. By the time it was discontinued in August 2008, 60,000 GP2X units had been sold. In May 2009, the GP2X Wiz was released, the successor to the GP2X. In August 2010 GPH launched a new handheld console, Caanoo, as a successor to the GP2X Wiz, with games purchased through GPH's simultaneously released online app/game store called FunGP.

Androphilia describes sexual attraction to men or masculinity; gynephilia describes the sexual attraction to women or femininity. Ambiphilia describes the combination of both androphilia and gynephilia in a given individual, or bisexuality.Diamond M (2010). Sexual orientation and gender identity. In Weiner IB, Craighead EW eds. The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology, Volume 4. p. 1578. John Wiley and Sons, The terms are objectively used for identifying a person's object of attraction without attributing a sex assignment or gender identity to the person. This can avoid bias inherent in normative conceptualizations of human sexuality, avoid confusion and offense when describing people in non-western cultures, as well as when describing intersex and transgender people, especially those who are nonbinary or otherwise falling outside the gender binary. Historical use=Androphilia Magnus Hirschfeld, an early-20th century German sexologist and physician, divided homosexual men into four groups: paedophiles, who are most attracted to prepubescent youth, ephebophiles, who are most attracted to youths from puberty up to the early twenties; androphiles, who are most attracted to persons between the early twenties and fifty; and gerontophiles, who are most attracted to older men, up to senile old age.Sexual anomalies: the origins, nature and treatment of sexual disorders : a summary of the works of Magnus Hirschfeld M. D. Emerson Books, ASIN: B0007ILEF0Wayne R. Dynes, Stephen Donaldson. Encyclopedia of homosexuality, Volume 1. Garland Pub., According to Karen Franklin, Hirschfeld considered ephebophilia \\"common and nonpathological, with ephebophiles and androphiles each making up about 45% of the homosexual population.\\" In his book Androphilia, A Manifesto: Rejecting the Gay Identity, Reclaiming Masculinity, Jack Donovan uses the term to emphasize masculinity in both the object and the subject of male homosexual desire and to reject the sexual nonconformity that he sees in some segments of the homosexual identity.Donovan J (2007). Androphilia, A Manifesto: Rejecting the Gay Identity, Reclaiming Masculinity Scapegoat Publishing, Dynes, Wayne R. (ed.) (1990) Androphilia. Encyclopedia of Homosexuality, p. 58.

Psychology Press, ;Alternate uses in biology and medicine In biology, androphilic is sometimes used as a synonym for anthropophilic, describing parasites who have a host preference for humans versus non-human animals.Covell G, Russell PF, Hendrik N (1953).

Freud and the Passions. Penn State Press, He also used the term in correspondence.Sigmund Freud to S√°ndor Ferenczi, March 25, 1908: \\"I have often seen it so: a woman unsatisfied by a man naturally turns to a woman and tries to invest her long-suppressed gynecophilic component with libido.\\" Sigmund Freud to Wilhelm Fliess, March 23, 1900: \\"A good-natured and fine person, at a deeper layer gynecophilic, attached to the mother.\\" The variant spelling gynophilia is also sometimes used.Money, John (1986). Venuses Penuses: Sexology, Sexosophy, and Exigency Theory. Prometheus Books, Rarely, the term gynesexuality has also been used as a synonym. Psychoanalyst Nancy Chodorow proposed that the preoedipal moment of psychological and libidinal focus on the mother, which both boys and girls experience, should be called gynesexuality or matrisexuality for its exclusive focus on the mother.Chodorow, Nancy (1999). The Reproduction of Mothering: Psychoanalysis and the Sociology of Gender. University of California Press, Sexual interest in adults Following Hirschfeld, androphilia and gynephilia are sometimes used in taxonomies which specify sexual interests based on age ranges, which John Money called chronophilia. In such schemes, sexual attraction to adults is called teleiophilia or adultophilia.Jay R. Feierman: ‚ÄûReply to Dickemann: The ethology of variant sexology\\", Human Nature, Springer New York, vol. 3, No 3, September 1992, pp. 279‚Äì297 In this context, androphilia and gynephilia are gendered variants meaning \\"attraction to adult males\\" and \\"attraction to adult females,\\" respectively. Psychologist Dennis Howitt writes: > Definition is primarily an issue of theory, not merely classification, since > classification implies a theory, no matter how rudimentary.

Magnus Hirschfeld distinguished between gynephilic, bisexual, androphilic, asexual, and narcissistic or automonosexual gender-variant persons.Veale JF, Clarke DE (2008). Sexuality of male-to-female transsexuals. Archives of Sexual Behavior (citing Hirschfeld, 1922, as cited in Freund, 1985) Since then, some psychologists have proposed using homosexual transsexual and heterosexual transsexual or non-homosexual transsexual. Psychobiologist James D. Weinrich has described this split among psychologists: \\"The mf transsexuals who are attracted to men (whom some call 'homosexual' and others call 'androphilic') are in the lower left-hand corner of the XY table, in order to line them up with the ordinary homosexual (androphilic) men in the lower right. Finally, there are the mf transsexuals who are attracted to women (whom some call heterosexual and others call gynephilic or lesbian).\\"Weinrich JD (1987). Sexual landscapes: why we are what we are, why we love whom we love. Scribner's, The use of homosexual transsexual and related terms have been applied to transgender people since the middle of the 20th century, though concerns about the terms have been voiced since then. Harry Benjamin said in 1966: > ....it seems evident that the question \\"Is the transsexual homosexual?\\" must > be answered \\"yes\\" and \\" no.\\" \\"Yes,\\" if his anatomy is considered; \\"no\\" if > his psyche is given preference.

The Transsexual Phenomenon. The Julian Press ASIN: > B0007HXA76 (via Internet Archive) Many sources, including some supporters of the typology, criticize this choice of wording as confusing and degrading. Biologist Bruce Bagemihl writes \\"..the point of reference for \\"heterosexual\\" or \\"homosexual\\" orientation in this nomenclature is solely the individual's genetic sex prior to reassignment (see for example, Blanchard et al. 1987, Coleman and Bockting, 1988, Blanchard, 1989). These labels thereby ignore the individual's personal sense of gender identity taking precedence over biological sex, rather than the other way around.\\"Bagemihl B. Surrogate phonology and transsexual faggotry: A linguistic analogy for uncoupling sexual orientation from gender identity. In Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality. Anna Livia, Kira Hall (eds.) pp. 380 ff. Oxford University Press Bagemihl goes on to take issue with the way this terminology makes it easy to claim transsexuals are really homosexual males seeking to escape from stigma. Leavitt and Berger stated in 1990 that \\"The homosexual transsexual label is both confusing and controversial among males seeking sex reassignment.Leavitt F, Berger JC (1990). Clinical patterns among male transsexual candidates with erotic interest in males. Archives of Sexual Behavior, full text Volume 19, Number 5 / October, 1990Morgan AJ Jr (1978). Psychotherapy for transsexual candidates screened out of surgery. Archives of Sexual Behavior. 7: 273-282. Critics argue that the term \\"homosexual transsexual\\" is \\"heterosexist\\", \\"archaic\\",Wahng SJ (2004). Double Cross: Transamasculinity Asian American Gendering in Trappings of Transhood. in Aldama AJ (ed.) Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State. Indiana University Press. and demeaning because it labels people by sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity.Leiblum SR, Rosen RC (2000). Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Third Edition. , Guilford Press of New York, c2000. Benjamin, Leavitt, and Berger have all used the term in their own work. Sexologist John Bancroft also recently expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women. He says that he now tries to choose his words more sensitively. Sexologist Charles Allen Moser is likewise critical of the terminology. Use of androphilia and gynephilia was proposed and popularized by psychologist Ron Langevin in the 1980s.Langevin R (1982). Sexual Strands: Understanding and Treating Sexual Anomalies in Men. Routledge, Psychologist Stephen T. Wegener writes, \\"Langevin makes several concrete suggestions regarding the language used to describe sexual anomalies. For example, he proposes the terms gynephilic and androphilic to indicate the type of partner preferred regardless of an individual's gender identity or dress. Those who are writing and researching in this area would do well to adopt his clear and concise vocabulary.\\"Wegener ST (1984). Male sexual anomalies: the data (review of Sexual Strands) APA Review of Books: Volume 29, Issues 7-12, p. 783. Edwin Garrigues Boring, American Psychological Association Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal explains why the terms are useful in a glossary: > Androphilia ‚Äì The romantic and/or sexual attraction to adult males. The > term, along with gynephilia, is needed to overcome immense difficulties in > characterizing the sexual orientation of transmen and transwomen. For > instance, it is difficult to decide whether a transman erotically attracted > to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male; or a transwoman > erotically attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female. > Any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense > among the affected subjects. In such cases, while defining sexual > attraction, it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather > than on the sex or gender of the subject.Aggrawal, Anil (2008). Forensic and > medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices. CRC > Press, Sexologist Milton Diamond, who prefers the term gynecophilia, writes, \\"The terms heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are better used as adjectives, not nouns, and are better applied to behaviors, not people.\\" Diamond has encouraged using the terms androphilic, gynecophilic, and ambiphilic to describe the sexual-erotic partners one prefers (andro = male, gyneco = female, ambi = both, philic = to love). Such terms eliminate the need to specify the subject and focus instead on the desired partner. This usage is particularly advantageous when discussing the partners of transsexual or intersexed individuals. These newer terms also do not carry the social weight of the former ones.\\"Diamond M (2010). Sexual orientation and gender identity. In Weiner IB, Craighead EW eds. The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology, Volume 4. p. 1578. John Wiley and Sons, Psychologist Rachel Ann Heath writes, \\"The terms homosexual and heterosexual are awkward, especially when the former is used with, or instead of, gay and lesbian. Alternatively, I use gynephilic and androphilic to refer to sexual preference for women and men, respectively. Gynephilic and androphilic derive from the Greek meaning love of a woman and love of a man respectively. So a gynephilic man is a man who likes women, that is, a heterosexual man, whereas an androphilic man is a man who likes men, that is, a gay man. For completeness, a lesbian is a gynephilic woman, a woman who likes other women. Gynephilic transsexed woman refers to a woman of transsexual background whose sexual preference is for women. Unless homosexual and heterosexual are more readily understood terms in a given context, this more precise terminology will be used throughout the book. Since homosexual, gay, and lesbian are often associated with bigotry and exclusion in many societies, the emphasis on sexual affiliation is both appropriate and socially just.\\"Heath RA (2006). The Praeger handbook of transsexuality: Changing gender to match mindset. Greenwood Publishing Group, Author Helen Boyd agrees, writing, \\"It would be much more accurate to define sexual orientation as either \\"androphilic\\" (loving men) and \\"gynephilic\\" (loving women) instead.\\"Boyd H (2007). She's not the man I married: My life with a transgender husband, p. 102. Seal Press, Sociomedical scientist Rebecca Jordan-Young challenges researchers like Simon LeVay, J. Michael Bailey, and Martin Lalumiere, who she says \\"have completely failed to appreciate the implications of alternative ways of framing sexual orientation.\\"Jordan-Young RM (2010). Brain storm: the flaws in the science of sex differences. Harvard University Press, Gender in non-Western cultures Some researchers advocate use of the terminology to avoid bias inherent in Western conceptualizations of human sexuality. Writing about the Samoan fa'afafine demographic, sociologist Johanna Schmidt writes: > Kris Poasa, Ray Blanchard and Kenneth Zucker (2004) also present an argument > that suggests that fa'afafine fall under the rubric of 'transgenderal > homosexuality', applying the same birth order equation to fa'afafine's > families as have been used with 'homosexual transsexuals'.

This link is reinforced by mention of the > fact that similar birth order equations have been found for 'homosexual > men'. The possibility of sexual orientation towards (masculine) men emerging > from (rather than causing) feminine gendered identities is not > considered.Schmidt J (2010). Migrating Genders: Westernisation, Migration, > and Samoan Fa'afafine, p. 45 Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., Schmidt argues that in cultures where a third gender is recognized, a term like \\"homosexual transsexual\\" does not align with cultural categories.Schmidt J (2001). Redefining fa'afafine: Western discourses and the construction of transgenderism in Samoa. Intersections: Gender, history and culture in the Asian context She cites the work of Paul Vasey and Nancy Bartlett: \\"Vasey and Bartlett reveal the cultural specificity of concepts such as homosexuality, they continue to use the more 'scientific' (and thus presumably more 'objective') terminology of androphilia and gynephilia (sexual attraction to men or masculinity and women or femininity respectively) to understand the sexuality of fa'afafine and other Samoans.\\" Researcher Sam Winter has presented a similar argument: > Terms such as 'homosexual' and heterosexual (and 'gay,' 'lesbian,' > 'bisexual,' etc.) are Western conceptions.

The town is located near the Estonian border on the site of an ancient Livonian fishing village. Before 1917, it was known by its German name Haynasch (, Gainash). Etymology \\"Aina≈æi \\" may be derived from the Estonian word heinastee meaning \\"hay-road\\". Other possibilities include the Livonian words aaina meaning \\"hay\\", or ainagi meaning \\"lonely\\". In the Middle Ages, the town was in German as Haynasch. History Aina≈æi existed for centuries as a Livonian fishing village. The town itself was first mentioned in 1564, and through the ages, changed hands among various barons and estates. Aina≈æi entered a great period of growth in the 1870s when its history of shipbuilding and seafaring began. In the 19th century, Vidzeme and Courland was covered with vast forests of pine trees. Aina≈æi's strategic position on the sea and proximity to lumber made it a perfect place for shipbuilding. In 1864 Kri≈°jƒÅnis ValdemƒÅrs sponsored the first naval school in Livonia (today Latvia), training young Estonian and Latvian farmers to become ship captains for free. The school stood for 50 years until it was destroyed in World War I. With the opening of the school and shipbuilding industry, Aina≈æi grew for the rest of the 19th century. From 1857 to 1913, over 50 seaworthy vessels were built in the town, and in 1902 a working port and railway station opened. By World War I, Aina≈æi was the fourth-largest port in all of Latvia and chief in Vidzeme, overtaking neighboring Salacgrƒ´va. The town also had its own windmills, fish-processing plant, and brick kiln. In World War I Aina≈æi was heavily damaged. The port was ruined and the entire shipping fleet destroyed. In February 1919, the Estonian army drove the Germans from Aina≈æi and subsequently occupied it. After the war, Aina≈æi became part of Latvia after its inhabitants voted for Latvia in a referendum,Deep Baltic, How the Baltic states got their shapes but Estonia's troops remained stationed there until 1920 and Estonia kept the northern section of the town, the Ikla village. In the years of independent Republic of Latvia (1918‚Äì1940) Aina≈æi was revitalized. The Aina≈æi fleet, sunken in the war, had completely barricaded the harbor and had to be removed. The harbor was then deepened, and the port was rebuilt in 1923 with new breakers. In 1930 the Aina≈æi lighthouse was built. In World War II, however, Aina≈æi was destroyed again. The second naval academy burned down, the port was bombed, and the warehouses were plundered. Though the port was partially rebuilt after war, Aina≈æi was overshadowed by nearby P√§rnu, and lost its fish-processing factory to Salacgrƒ´va. After Latvia's independence was restored in 1991, a wind turbine was built in Aina≈æi as well as a customs house on the Estonian border. Today the building of the naval school hosts The Museum of Aina≈æi Naval School (Aina≈æu j≈´rskolas muzejs), dedicated to the history of the school and the tradition of shipbuilding along the Vidzeme coast. ClimateEconomy The most important industries are forestry, woodworking and trade. In addition, its location at the Latvia-Estonia border on the A1 road (Latvia), part of Via Baltica international highway favors transit/transport industries. Demographics The population of Aina≈æi and the surrounding area in 2005 was 1794 people, the smallest official town of Vidzeme. Latvians made up 92% of the inhabitants, Russians 3%, Estonians 2%, and others 4%. From 2004 the population had decreased by 5.08% (96 inhabitants).

She has authored several best-selling cookbooks, including Vegan with a Vengeance, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, Veganomicon, Vegan Brunch, Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar and Appetite for Reduction. Her first restaurant, Modern Love, opened in Omaha in 2014, and its second location opened in Brooklyn in 2016. Biography Raised in Brooklyn, New York, and having dropped out of The High School of Music & Art, where she majored in fine art, Moskowitz found herself drawn toward the punk rock scene of the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the late 1980s, embracing first a vegetarian diet, then veganism. The experimentation and adaptation required for her new diet led to developing her skills as a cook and as an inventor of her own recipes. She volunteered with Food Not Bombs, an anarchist organization that provides free vegan meals to the homeless and needy. The inspiration to create her own cooking show came while watching the Food Network and wondering to herself why there were no vegan shows.Moskowitz, Isa Chandra.Vegan With a Vengeance. Marlowe & Company, 2005, p. 3. According to Moskowitz, the show used the title The Post Punk Kitchen to signify the feeling of being \\"older and facing the conundrum of growing up and making compromises that their eighteen-year-old selves might hate them for\\". The show was popular for its laid-back approach and unscripted dialogue. Bands played on the show and even helped out with the cooking. The Post Punk Kitchen was co-hosted by Terry Hope Romero and aired on community access television in both Manhattan and Brooklyn between 2003 and 2005. The success of The Post Punk Kitchen led to the compilation of a cookbook, Vegan with a Vengeance, in late 2005. The recipes, rather than relying on expensive and heavily processed meat substitutes, use readily available and inexpensive ingredients. The book also includes multiple references to the punk-rock subculture with Moskowitz visibly sporting a t-shirt from British anarcho-punk band Crass on the book's cover. In 2006, Moskowitz and her former co-host, Romero, created a cookbook consisting entirely of vegan cupcake recipes, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, which was named Cookbook Of The Year by VegNews magazine. 2007 saw the release of yet another book, Veganomicon, which bills itself as the \\"ultimate vegan cookbook.\\" Moskowitz has since written six more books, Vegan Brunch (2009), Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar (2009), Appetite for Reduction (2010), Vegan Pie in the Sky (2011), Isa Does It (2013), and The Superfun Times Vegan Holiday Cookbook: Entertaining for Absolutely Every Occasion (2016). In April 2008, she relocated from New York to Portland, Oregon, then to Omaha, Nebraska. Her restaurant, Modern Love, has locations in Omaha and Brooklyn. Activism Moskowitz at a Vegan Bake Sale for Haiti event Moskowitz is a vocal opponent of \\"humane meat\\", promoting animal rights through what she calls \\"Culinary Activism\\" or \\"Baketivism\\": > I think that activism isn't what you decide to do but how it affects people. > So if someone says, I'm going to become an activist! I'm going to stand on a > street corner and preach about veganism! And then they go ahead and do that > but no one listens and no one becomes vegan, then is that activism? On the > other hand, maybe there's a girl in the middle of nowhere who loves animals > and decided to bake vegan. And then people taste her cupcakes and are like > \\"What the hell, I'll go vegan, too.\\" Obviously, I think the latter is more > effective, but I guess people might not see it as activism. In 2008 she founded the organization Apron Activists (\\"four courses for causes\\") to raise money for local animal rights organizations in Oregon; she also works with Woodstock Farm Animal Sanctuary to raise money through cooking. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Moskowitz posted on her blog a call for vegans to host bake sales in their home cities to fundraise for relief which resulted in over $75,000 being raised. In July 2011, Moskowitz, along with Anna Dorfman, Leigh Ellis and John McDevitt created The Teal Cat Project to raise money for cat rescue groups across the country that participate in trap‚Äìneuter‚Äìreturn programs. Moskowitz and the crew collect old ceramic cat figurines, upcycle them with a coat of teal paint, and number them for authenticity. T-shirts are also sold to offset the cost of supplies. Media Moskowitz is currently a Bust magazine columnist, where she writes a column called \\"Nickel and Dined\\", which focuses on cooking on a limited budget and has written for Vegetarian Times, Time Out NY, Natural Health and VegNews. Moskowitz also starred in a short-lived podcast with Herbivore Publishing's Josh Hooten called Naked Vaygun in late 2007.

A large program of this kind was initiated by the European Union (EU) in 1988 to reduce the wine lake glut from overproduction and declining demand. In the first five years of the program, growers, mainly in southern France and southern Italy, were paid to destroy 320,000 hectares or of vineyard. This was the equivalent to the entire vineyard area of the world's fourth largest grower of grapes, the United States. The EU has recently resumed a vine pull scheme and Plan Bordeaux proposes additional vine pulls to increase prices for generic Bordeaux wine.

The school has a roll of approximately 1300 students and is widely regarded as one of the best academically performing schools in New Zealand. In 2015, Metro Magazine stated that \\"the top academic results in Auckland, every year, are scored by St Cuthbert‚Äôs College\\" and the school has been awarded the title of Metro Magazine's Highest-Ranked Auckland Secondary School for Academic Achievement in 2013, 2014 (when the equivalent of 53 per cent of the Year 13 roll gained scholarships), 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The school is affiliated with the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA), the New Zealand Boarding Schools' Association (NZBSA), Independent Schools of New Zealand (ISNZ), and is an overseas member of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA). The school offers both the International Baccalaureate diplomas and the national NCEA qualification. History The college was established as the Auckland Presbyterian College for Ladies Ltd in 1915, when a group of Presbyterian elders purchased Mt Eden Collegiate, a private school for girls, and appointed Miss Isobel Macdonald as the school's first principal. Miss Macdonald chose the motto, \\"By Love, Serve\\", and renamed the school St Cuthbert's College as the Trust Board suggested that a shorter and more distinctive name was required. The school is named after the Northumbrian monk-bishop Saint Cuthbert and, since 1918, it has celebrated St Cuthbert's Day annually in March. In 1925, the college moved to its present site in Epsom. In 1932, three school houses were established, Dunblane, Elgin and Melrose, each named after places of significance in the life of St Cuthbert. In 1936, the winter uniform was changed to Black Watch tartan, after the then principal, Lavinia Clouston, had seen the uniform at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney. Black Watch tartan also has been the summer uniform since 1966.  School motto  The St Cuthbert's College motto is \\"By Love, Serve\\". The motto was chosen to encourage students to share, respect the needs of others, accept different viewpoints and to live peacefully. The school verse comes from 1 Corinthians 13 chapters 1‚Äì13 and is consistent with \\"By Love, Serve\\", and students are constantly reminded to be \\"By Love, Serve\\".  Boarding  St Cuthbert's College accepts both day students and boarding students. Boarding students from Years 7 to 13 live in one of St. Cuthbert's three boarding houses: Dunblane, Elgin or Melrose. The boarding community at St Cuthbert's College is very diverse. Boarders come from Asia, the Pacific Islands and a range of other overseas locations, as well as from both urban and rural New Zealand. An increasing number of boarders are local students living between Karaka and the North Shore. Curriculum=Academic The college offers both the NCEA and the IB qualifications. In 1999 a Thinking Skills programme was introduced based on Art Costa's Habits of Mind. Senior management credit this programme for the college's continuing ranking as one of New Zealand's top schools.  Physical education  Physical education is compulsory for all students from Years 1 to 11. Students are also given the opportunity to pitch themselves against other top athletes in local, regional and national tournaments as part of the college's Athlete Pathway Programme. Over 90 per cent of senior students participate in extra-curricular sporting activities.  Kahunui  In Year 10, the students take part in a four-week experience at Kahunui, a large outdoor living space in the Bay of Plenty bush, where the girls participate in physical activities as well as academic work that is taught by practical applications (e.g. maths is covered in budgeting and English through creative writing journal entries). Run by a dedicated team of eight academic and outdoor instructors as well as three ground staff, Kahunui welcomes groups of approximately 24 girls in a number of intakes throughout the year. During their time at Kahunui, the girls are divided into groups of eight students and they are expected to live in and manage their own residence. The outdoor programme includes overnight sea kayaking and tramping trips. Headmistresses/Principal * Isobel MacDonald 1915-1921 * L. Clouston 1921-1948 * V. Wood 1949-1968 * O.J.

The city is renowned for being home of one of Pakistan's most important Sufi shrines, the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar. Owing to the popularity of its Sufi shrine, the terms \\"Sehwan\\" and \\"Qalandar\\" are often used interchangeably in Pakistan. Sehwan is one of Pakistan's most important spiritual centres, along with other shrines such as the Shrine of Abdullah Shah Ghazi in Karachi, Data Durbar Complex in Lahore, Bari Imam in Noorpur Shehan near Islamabad, and the lustrous tombs of the Suhrawardi Sufis in Multan.  History  Sehwan is probably the most ancient place in Sindh. Some historians say that this town is as ancient as the period of Prophet Shees, son of Adam. Hence it was named as Sheestan, Sewistan and then Sehwan. According to Syed Muhibullah, author of \\"A brief history of Sind\\", Sehwan was the name of great grandson of Ham (son of Noah). But there are various other views about the nomenclature of Sehwan as well. William Dalrymple says that the name is derived from Shivistan after Lord Shiva.Nine Lives by William Dalrymple This place in Sind saw amalgamation of Hinduism and Islam.Notable historian Molai Sheedai writes in his book \\"Tarikh e Tamadan e Sind\\" that Sehwan was built by the Sewi Aryas and hence was called Sewistan. Another view is that its name was Sindomana, a name which is well mentioned in Greek literature. Sindhu-m√°n is Sanskrit word, which means \\"the possessor (the capital, or Raja) of Sindh, with which Sindhu-v√†n is synonymous, the latter may have been softened in common speech to the modern Seh-wan. Sindomana was the capital of King Sambos, who was defeated by Alexander in 326 BC. Sehwan was conquered by Muhammad bin Qasim in 711 from son of the King Dahir, and three centuries later by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1026. In all the subsequent dynastic struggles of Sindh, Sehwan continued to feature prominently. It was held successively by the Sumrahs, the Summas, the Arghuns and the Tarkhans. It was the capital of Thatta Kingdom,John F. Richards, The New Cambridge History of India: The Mughal Empire (New York: Cambridge University Press, 19930 p. 51 when an abortive attempt was made by the Mughal emperor Humayun to capture it on his way to Umarkot in 1542, but it finally fell to his son Akbar in 1590s. After the moghuls, it was ruled by Kalhoras and Talpurs.The tomb of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar at Sehwan Sharif, Sindh, Pakistan The city is known for its Sufi patron saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar who lived there in the 13th century. The Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Shrine of the Sufi saint Murshid Nadir Ali Shah, a notable spiritual successor of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar is also located in Sehwan, where large number of people are served free meals round the clock. Another famous place is the inverted city. Manchar Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Pakistan, which is at a short distance from Sehwan Sharif.  Incident  On the 16th of February 2017, a suicide bomber triggered an explosion at the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, killing at least 83 people and injuring almost 250. The attack occurred during a praying session. The bombing took place at an 800 year old Shrine. Later the ISIS claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack stating that their 'martyr' had detonated a vest at the popular Shia gathering at the shrine.

He played college basketball for four years at Villanova University. He played one season (2006‚Äì07) with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association. College career Ray was recruited out of that year's New York State Champions, St. Raymond High School, by Villanova head coach Jay Wright. He committed to the Wildcats in 2001, along with three other players that made up a highly praised recruiting class. Along with Randy Foye, Curtis Sumpter and Jason Fraser, Ray was part of a class proclaimed as the players to lead the Wildcats back to a championship. Freshman and sophomore seasons Ray's career at Villanova was slightly hampered by injuries, but nothing that kept him from scoring 2,000 points as a Wildcat. His freshman season, he was a key contributor. He had 16 points in his Wildcat debut against Marquette on November 15, 2002.Marquette wins despite giving up 31 offensive boards As a sophomore, he averaged a team-leading 17.3 points per game.Villanova Wildcats Statistics - 2003-04 Junior season In his junior season, Ray was named second team all-Big East and led the Wildcats in scoring with 16.2 ppg.Villanova Wildcats Statistics - 2004-05 That year, he also led Villanova to the Sweet 16 of the 2005 NCAA Tournament where they lost to eventual national champion North Carolina by one point.Villanova's spirited surge in closing minutes falls short Senior season His senior season was arguably Ray's best season as a college player when he averaged 18.5 ppg.Villanova Wildcats Statistics - 2005-06 Villanova tied for the Big East regular-season championship with UConn and split their two games with the Huskies. Their final Big East regular-season record was 14-2. Overall, their record was 28-5. In 2006, Ray was named to the Big East first team, along with teammate Randy Foye, who was given the honor of Big East Player of the Year. Ray led Villanova to the Elite Eight of the 2006 NCAA Tournament, playing in a four-guard offense with Foye, Kyle Lowry and Mike Nardi. Eye injury During the 2006 Big East Tournament, Ray was poked in the eye by Carl Krauser during the semifinal game against Pittsburgh. His vision apparently left him for a period of time and his eyeball had seemed to come loose from the socket, leading most to believe it was an extremely serious injury. However, his vision returned and it turned out to be only soft tissue damage. He was able to play less than a week later in the NCAA tournament, without goggles. In his first game back, he led Villanova in scoring. While on the video it appeared as though his eye came loose from the socket, his eyelid actually went behind his eye, giving off the impression of his eye coming loose. Professional career Ray during a game with the Celtics Ray was not selected in the 2006 NBA Draft, surprising many Big East fans and some NBA experts. On July 6, 2006, he was signed as a free agent by the Boston Celtics. Ray was sent to the D-League Austin Toros, but was recalled after just two games there. He led the Toros in scoring in both games he played for them. During the last two months of the season, Ray began receiving extended playing time with the Celtics, and had two 22-point games and three others where he scored 20, 18 and 17 points. Ray was also fourth among rookies in three-point percentage. Despite a seemingly bright future in Boston, Ray agreed to terms on a $2 million contract to play in Italy, instead of having the Celtics pick up his $687,456 option. Ray signed with the Euroleague club Lottomatica Virtus Roma on July 27, 2007. Midway through the following season, after the club signed Brandon Jennings (whom Ray served as a mentor to), Ray left to sign a contract with Carife Ferrara for the remaining part of the season. After sitting out the 2009‚Äì10 season to recover from knee surgery, Ray signed with Sutor Montegranaro for the 2010‚Äì11 season. In November 2011 he signed a temporary contract with BC Krka in Slovenia,KRKA lands Allan Ray but in December 2011 he signed a new contract with √âlan B√©arnais Pau-Orthez in France.Pau-Orthez tabs Allan Ray In August 2012, he moved to Germany and signed with ratiopharm Ulm for the 2012‚Äì13 season.Ratiopharm Ulm lands Allan Ray In November 2013, he signed with the Croatian team Cedevita Zagreb for the rest of the 2013‚Äì14 season.

The group released two albums and one EP before dissolving in 1984. The genesis of Rosetta Stone came in 1973, as childhood friends Mitchell, Terry McKee, Damian McKee, and Colin McKee (not the footballer Colin McKee) formed a band called Young City Stars. They played local clubs and dance halls, often opening concerts for the Bay City Rollers with their sound engineer Brian Herron. In early 1976, Mitchell left the Young City Stars to join the Bay City Rollers. He was replaced by Belfast-born guitarist Andy LeGear. Mitchell would return later that year as the group, now managed by Rollers manager Tam Paton, changed their name to Rosetta Stone. In 1977, Rosetta Stone signed with Private Stock Records. They appeared on Marc Bolan's TV show Marc performing their single, a cover of Cream's \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\". Their eponymous debut album (known as Rock Pictures in some territories) was released in the United States in May 1978. A second album, Caught in the Act, followed in 1979. In early 1979 Ian Mitchell once again departed, to be replaced by Paul \\"Flash\\" Lerwill. Lerwill (a former Edinburgh DJ at local hotspot \\"Clouds\\"). Lerwill left the band in 1982 and was replaced by Enda Walsh. That same year the EP Hiding From Love was released, after which the group permanently disbanded. The tracks \\"Hiding from Love\\", \\"Remember\\" and \\"Straight from the Heart\\", were all penned by Bryan Adams. \\"Hiding From Love\\", which had previously been a #64 hit in Canada for Adams in 1980, became a bigger hit for Rosetta Stone, where it reached #46 in Canada in 1982. Adams would later record his own version of \\"Straight From the Heart\\" in 1983, and made it a Top 20 hit in Canada and a Top 10 hit in the US. Soon after their Roadie Brian left the band due to family commitments went on to produce his own record label in Miami, Florida, US. There have been a number of Rosetta Fests (reunions) where the band have performed together again. The final fest, was held in Toronto in September 2007 In 2012 they held a sold out reunion show in their hometown at Mullan's Bar, Downpatrick.

The book postulates that around the 15th century BC, the planet Venus was ejected from Jupiter as a comet or comet-like object and passed near Earth (an actual collision is not mentioned). The object allegedly changed Earth's orbit and axis, causing innumerable catastrophes that are mentioned in early mythologies and religions from around the world. The book has been heavily criticized as a work of pseudoscience and catastrophism, and many of its claims are completely rejected by the established scientific community as they are not supported by any available evidence. Publication Worlds in Collision was first published on April 3, 1950, by Macmillan Publishers.Velikovsky, Immanuel (1950). Worlds in Collision, Macmillan. . Macmillan's interest in publishing it was encouraged by the knowledge that Velikovsky had obtained a promise from Gordon Atwater, Director of the Hayden Planetarium, for a sky show based on the book when it was published.Whelton, Clark 1980. The Gordon Atwater Affair. S.I.S. Review IV (4), pp. 75-76. \\"Although Gordon Atwater had doubts about certain aspects of Velikovsky's work, he nevertheless found the basic thesis to be tenable. A reading of the manuscript confirmed his view that Worlds in Collision would be a tremendous hit at Hayden. He told Velikovsky that if a publisher for the book was found, the Planetarium would produce a sky show based on Worlds in Collision.\\" The book, Velikovsky's most criticized and controversial, was an instant New York Times bestseller, topping the charts for eleven weeks while being in the top ten for twenty-seven straight weeks.Ellenberger, C. Leroy (1984). Worlds in Collision in Macmillan's Catalogues. Kronos, 9 (2), 46-57. The 20 weeks at the top stated by Juergens in The Velikovsky Affair is incorrect. Despite this popularity, overwhelming rejection of its thesis by the scientific community forced Macmillan to stop publishing it and to transfer the book to Doubleday within two months. Core ideas In the book's preface, Velikovsky summarizes his arguments: :Worlds in Collision is a book of wars in the celestial sphere that took place in historical times. In these wars the planet Earth participated too. [...] The historical-cosmological story of this book is based in the evidence of historical texts of many people around the globe, on classical literature, on epics of the northern races, on sacred books of the peoples of the Orient and Occident, on traditions and folklore of primitive peoples, on old astronomical inscriptions and charts, on archaeological finds, and also on geological and paleontological material. The book proposes that around the 15th century BCE, Venus was ejected from Jupiter as a comet or comet-like object and subsequently passed near Earth, though an actual collision with the Earth is not mentioned. In doing so it changed Earth's orbit and axial inclination, causing innumerable catastrophes which were identified in early mythologies and religious traditions from human civilizations around the world. Fifty-two years later, it again made a close approach, stopping the Earth's rotation for a while and causing more catastrophes. Then, in the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, Mars (itself displaced by Venus) made close approaches to the Earth; this incident caused a new round of disturbances and disasters. After that, the current \\"celestial order\\" was established. The courses of the planets stabilized over the centuries and Venus gradually became a \\"normal\\" planet. These events lead to several key statements: # Venus must be still very hot as young planets radiate heat.W in C, \\"The Thermal Balance Of Venus\\" (Ch. IX): \\"The night side of Venus radiates heat because Venus is hot. [..] Venus experienced in quick succession its birth and expulsion under violent conditions; an existence as a comet on an ellipse which approached the sun closely; two encounters with the Earth accompanied by discharges of potentials between these two bodies and with a thermal effect caused by conversion of momentum into heat; a number of contacts with Mars and probably also with Jupiter. Since all this happened between the third and the first millennia before the present era, the core of the planet Venus must still be hot.\\" # Venus must be rich in petroleum and hydrocarbon gases.W in C, \\"The Gases Of Venus\\" (Ch. IX): \\"On the basis of this research, I assume that Venus must be rich in petroleum gases. If and as long as Venus is too hot for the liquefaction of petroleum, the hydrocarbons will circulate in gaseous form. The absorption lines of the petroleum spectrum lie far in the infra-red where usual photographs do not reach. When the technique of photography in the infra-red is perfected so that hydrocarbon bands can be differentiated, the spectrogram of Venus may disclose the presence of hydrocarbon gases in its atmosphere, if these gases lie in the upper part of the atmosphere where the rays of the sun penetrate.\\" # Venus has an abnormal orbit in consequence of the unusual disasters stemming from its planetary origins. Velikovsky suggested some additional ideas that he said derived from these claims, including: # Jupiter emits radio noises.In a lecture delivered in October 1953, Velikovsky stated: \\"In Jupiter and its moons we have a system not unlike the solar family. The planet is cold, yet its gases are in motion. It appears probable to me that it sends out radio noises as do the sun and the stars.\\" (See Lecture before the Graduate Student Forum in Princeton, December 6, 1967) In correspondence with Albert Einstein, Velikovsky (June 1954) repeated his view that Jupiter is not an inert gravitational body, and that it would be found to emit radio noises of electromagnetic (non-thermal) origin; and he offered to stake their debate on the role of electromagnetism in the mechanics of the solar system on this claim. # The magnetosphere of the Earth reaches at least up to the Moon. # The Sun has an electric potential of approximately 1019 volts. # The rotation of the Earth can be affected by electromagnetic fields. Velikovsky arrived at these proposals using a methodology which would today be called comparative mythology ‚Äì he looked for concordances in the myths and written histories of unconnected cultures across the world, following a literal reading of their accounts of the exploits of planetary deities. He argues on the basis of ancient cosmological myths from places as disparate as India and China, Greece and Rome, Assyria and Sumer. For example, ancient Greek mythology asserts that the goddess Athena sprang from the head of Zeus. Velikovsky identifies Zeus (whose Roman counterpart was the god Jupiter) with the planet Jupiter and Athena (the Roman Minerva) with the planet Venus. This myth, along with others from ancient Egypt, Israel, Mexico, etc. are used to support the claim that \\"Venus was expelled as a comet and then changed to a planet after contact with a number of members of our solar system\\" (Velikovsky 1972:182). Critical reaction=Contemporary reactions The plausibility of the theory was summarily rejected by the physics community, as the cosmic chain of events proposed by Velikovsky contradicts basic laws of physics. Velikovsky's ideas had been known to astronomers for years before the publication of the book, partially by his writing to astronomer Harlow Shapley of Harvard, partially through his 1946 pamphlet Cosmos Without Gravitation,Immanuel Velikovsky, \\"Cosmos Without Gravitation: Attraction, repulsion and electromagnetic circumduction in the Solar System\\" (1946) and partially by a preview of his work in an article in the August 11, 1946, edition of the New York Herald Tribune. An article about the upcoming book was published by Harper's Magazine in January 1950, which was followed by additional articles in Newsweek (Bauer 1984:3‚Äì4) and Reader's Digest in March 1950. Shapley, along with others such as astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (also at Harvard), instigated a campaign against the book before its publication. Initially, they were highly critical of a publisher as reputable as Macmillan publishing such a pseudoscientific book, even as a trade book.Gilbert, James (1997). Redeeming Culture: American Religion in an Age of Science, University of Chicago Press. . Chap. 8, Two Men of Science, pp. 185-7.Grove, J.W. (1989). In Defence of Science: Science, technology, and, politics in modern society, University of Toronto Press. . Chap. 5, Pseudo- science, pp. 120-50. Their disapproval was re-invigorated when Macmillan included Worlds in Collision among other trade books of possible interest to professors listed under the category \\"Science\\" in the back of a textbook catalog mailed to college professors.Ellenberger, C. Leroy (1984). Worlds in Collision in Macmillan's Catalogues. Kronos, 9 (2), 46‚Äì57. Within two months of the book's initial release, the publishing of the book was transferred to Doubleday, which has no textbook division. The fundamental criticism against the book from the astronomy community was that its celestial mechanics were irreconcilable with Newtonian mechanics, requiring planetary orbits which could not be made to conform to the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of angular momentum (Bauer 1984:70). Velikovsky conceded that the behavior of the planets in his theories is not consistent with Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation. He proposed that electromagnetic forces could be the cause of the movements of the planets, although such forces between astronomical bodies are known to be essentially zero. Velikovsky tried to protect himself from criticism of his proposed celestial mechanics by removing the original Appendix on the subject from Worlds in Collision, hoping that the merit of his ideas would be evaluated on the basis of his comparative mythology and use of literary sources alone. This strategy did not protect him: the Appendix was an expanded version of the Cosmos Without Gravitation monograph, which he had already distributed to Shapley and others in the late 1940s ‚Äî and they had regarded the physics within it as egregiously in error. Carl Sagan In his 1979 science book Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science, astronomer Carl Sagan wrote that the high surface temperature of Venus was known prior to Velikovsky, and that Velikovsky misunderstood the mechanism for this heat.Sagan, Carl, (1979) Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science Chapter 7, \\"Venus and Dr. Velikovsky\\", section: Problem VIII: The Temperature of Venus. Velikovsky believed that Venus was heated by its close encounter with the Earth and Mars. He also did not understand the greenhouse effect caused by Venus' atmosphere, which had earlier been elucidated by astronomer Rupert Wildt. Ultimately, Venus is hot due to its proximity to the Sun; it does not emit more heat than it receives from the Sun, and any heat produced by its celestial movements would have long since dissipated. Sagan concludes: \\"(1) the temperature in question was never specified [by Velikovsky]; (2) the mechanism proposed for providing this temperature is grossly inadequate; (3) the surface of the planet does not cool off with time as advertised; and (4) the idea of a high surface temperature on Venus was published in the dominant astronomical journal of its time and with an essentially correct argument ten years before the publication of Worlds in Collision\\" (p. 118). Sagan also noted that \\"Velikovsky's idea that the clouds of Venus are composed of hydrocarbons or carbohydrates is neither original nor correct.\\"Sagan, Carl, (1979) Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science Chapter 7, \\"Venus and Dr. Velikovsky\\", section: Problem VII: The Clouds of Venus. Sagan notes that the presence of hydrocarbon gases (such as petroleum gases) on Venus was earlier suggested, and abandoned, again by Rupert Wildt, whose work is not credited by Velikovsky. Also, the 1962 Mariner 2 probe was erroneously reported in the popular press to have discovered hydrocarbons on Venus. These errors were subsequently corrected, and Sagan later concluded that \\"[n]either Mariner 2 nor any subsequent investigation of the Venus atmosphere has found evidence for hydrocarbons or carbohydrates\\" (p. 113). Regarding Jupiter's radio emissions, Sagan noted that \\"all objects give off radio waves if they are at temperatures above absolute zero. The essential characteristics of the Jovian radio emission ‚Äî that it is nonthermal, polarized, intermittent radiation, connected with the vast belts of charged particles which surround Jupiter, trapped by its strong magnetic field ‚Äî are nowhere predicted by Velikovsky. Further, his 'prediction' is clearly not linked in its essentials to the fundamental Velikovskian theses. Merely guessing something right does not necessarily demonstrate prior knowledge or a correct theory.\\"Sagan, Carl, (1979) Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science Chapter 7, \\"Venus and Dr. Velikovsky\\", Section: Some Other Problems, p. 125. Sagan concluded that \\"there is not one case where [Velikovsky's] ideas are simultaneously original and consistent with simple physical theory and observation.\\"Sagan, Carl, (1979) Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science Chapter 7, \\"Venus and Dr. Velikovsky\\", Section: Some Other Problems, p. 123. He also noted that it was Athena and not Venus who was born from the head of Zeus ‚Äì two utterly different goddesses. Athena was never identified with a planet. Later reactions Tim Callahan, religion editor of Skeptic, presses the case further in claiming that the composition of the atmosphere of Venus is a complete disproof of Worlds in Collision. \\"...Velikovsky's hypothesis stands or falls on Venus having a reducing atmosphere made up mainly of hydrocarbons. In fact, the atmosphere of Venus is made up mainly of carbon dioxide‚Äîcarbon in its oxidized form‚Äîalong with clouds of sulfuric acid. Therefore, it couldn't have carried such an atmosphere with it out of Jupiter and it couldn't be the source of hydrocarbons to react with oxygen in our atmosphere to produce carbohydrates. Velikovsky's hypothesis is falsified by the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus.\\"Callahan, Tim (2008). A New Mythology: Ancient Astronauts, Lost Civilizations, and the New Age Paradigm. Skeptic, 13 (4), 32‚Äì41. Astronomer Philip Plait has pointed out that Velikovsky's hypothesis is also falsified by the presence of the Moon with its nearly circular orbit, for which the length of the month has not changed sensibly in the more than 2,000 years the Jews have used their lunar calendar. \\"If Venus were to get so close to the Earth that it could actually exchange atmospheric contents [i.e., closer than from the surface of the Earth],\\" as Velikovsky claimed, \\". . . the Moon would have literally been flung into interplanetary space. At the very least its orbit would have been profoundly changed, made tremendously elliptical... Had Venus done any of the things Velikovsky claimed, the Moon's orbit would have changed.\\"Plait, Philip 2002. BAD Astronomy, John Wiley & Sons. . Chap. 18: Worlds in Derision: Velikovsky vs. Modern Science. pp. 181‚Äì2. Controversy By 1974, the controversy surrounding Velikovsky's work had reached the point where the American Association for the Advancement of Science felt obliged to address the situation, as they had previously done in relation to UFOs, and devoted a scientific meeting to Velikovsky. The meeting featured, among others, Velikovsky himself and Carl Sagan. Sagan gave a critique of Velikovsky's ideas and attacked most of the assumptions made in Worlds in Collision. His criticism is published in Scientists Confront Velikovsky (Ithaca, New York, 1977), edited by Donald Goldsmith, and presented in a revised and corrected version in his book Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science and is much longer than that given in the talk. Reprinted as Sagan further critiqued Velikovsky's ideas in his PBS television series Cosmos. In Cosmos, Sagan also criticizes the scientific community for their attitude toward Velikovsky, stating that while science is a process in which all ideas are subject to a process of extensive scrutiny before any idea can be accepted as fact, the attempt by some scientists to suppress outright Velikovsky's ideas was \\"the worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair.\\"\\"Heaven and Hell\\". Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, & Steven Soter. \\"Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.\\" PBS. KCET, Los Angeles, United States. 1980-10-19. 29:46 minutes in. In November 1974, at the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association held at the University of Notre Dame, Michael W. Friedlander, professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis, confronted Velikovsky in the symposium \\"Velikovsky and the Politics of Science\\" with examples of his \\"substandard scholarship\\" involving the \\"distortion of the published scientific literature in quotations that he used to support his theses\\". For example, contrary to Velikovsky, R.A. Lyttleton did not write \\"the terrestrial planets, Venus included, must [emphasis added] have originated from the giant planets‚Ä¶\\" Rather, Lyttleton wrote \\"‚Ä¶it is even possible‚Ä¶\\" As Friedlander recounts, \\"When I gave each example, [Velikovsky's] response was 'Where did I write that?'; when I showed a photo copy of the quoted pages, he simply switched to a different topic.\\" A thorough examination of the original material cited in Velikovsky's publications, and a severe criticism of its use, was published by Bob Forrest.Forrest, Bob (1981). Velikovsky's Sources. In six volumes, with Notes and Index Volume. Privately published by the author, Manchester. Earlier in 1974, James Fitton published a brief critique of Velikovsky's interpretation of myth, drawing on the section \\"The World Ages\\" and the later interpretation of the Trojan War, that was ignored by Velikovsky and his defenders whose indictment began: \\"In at least three important ways Velikovsky's use of mythology is unsound. The first of these is his proclivity to treat all myths as having independent value; the second is the tendency to treat only such material as is consistent with his thesis; and the third is his very unsystematic method.\\"Fitton, James (1974). Velikovsky Mythistoricus. Chiron, I (1&2), 29‚Äì36. Excerpts at . A short analysis of the position of arguments in the late 20th century was given by Velikovsky's ex-associate C. Leroy Ellenberger, a former senior editor of Kronos (a journal to promote Velikovsky's ideas) (Bauer 1995:11), in his essay.Ellenberger, Leroy (1986). A lesson from Velikovsky. Skeptical Inquirer, 10 (4), 380‚Äì81. Almost ten years later, Ellenberger criticized some Velikovskian and neo-Velikovskian qua \\"Saturnist\\" ideas in an invited essay.Ellenberger, Leroy (1995). An antidote to Velikovskian delusions. Skeptic, 3 (4), 49‚Äì51. The storm of controversy that was created by Velikovsky's works, especially Worlds in Collision, may have helped revive the Catastrophist movements in the last half of the 20th century; it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the negative aspects of the so-called Velikovsky Affair.Steel, Duncan (1995). Rogue Asteroids and Doomsday Comets, John Wiley & Sons. . p. 155.Morrison, David (2001). Velikovsky at Fifty: Cultures in Collision on the Fringes of Science. Skeptic, 9 (1), 62-76; reprinted in Shermer, Michael (editor) (2002). The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience, Santa Barbara, Calif. . 473-488. Morrison quotes scientists holding the latter view, including Walter Alvarez, David Raup, Richard Muller, Jay Melosh, Peter Ward, and Don Yeomans. This survey confirms the hunch expressed by Morrison and Clark R. Chapman in Chap. 13 \\"Catastrophism Gone Wild: The Case of Immanuel Velikovsky\\" of Cosmic Catastrophes (1989), pp. 183‚Äì96. The assessment of Velikovsky's work by tree- ring expert Mike Baillie is instructive: \\"But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets ‚Ä¶ As if to comfort his readers, at one point he says that no planet at present has a course which poses a danger to this planet: '‚Ä¶only a few asteroids‚Äîmere rocks, a few kilometres in diameter‚Äîhave orbits which cross the path of the earth.' ‚Ä¶ He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects, and, just in case there is any doubt about his mistake, he repeats the notion by noting that a possibility exists of some future collision between planets, 'not a mere encounter between a planet and an asteroid'. This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth.\\" More recently, the absence of supporting material in ice core studies (such as the Greenland Dye-3 and Vostok cores), bristlecone pine tree ring data, Swedish clay varves, and many hundreds of cores taken from ocean and lake sediments from all over the world has ruled out any basis for the proposition of a global catastrophe of the proposed dimension within the Late Holocene age.Ellenberger, C. Leroy (1985). Velikovsky's evidence? (Correspondence). Nature 318, November 21. p. 204. \\"The falsification of Velikovsky's scenario provided by Greenland's Dye 3 ice core [ref. 2: Ellenberger, C.L. Nature 316 386 (1985)] is corroborated by ocean sediments and bristlecone pine rings [ref. 3: Ellenberger, C.L. Kronos X:1, 92-97 (1984)] and the revised late-glacial Swedish varve chronology [ref. 4: Cato, I. Boreas 14, 117-122 (1985)]. Either their mere existence contradicts Velikovsky or they do not contain debris suggesting a catastrophe. Velikovskian catastrophes are neither indicated by nor necessary to explain the natural stratigraphies of the Holocene.\\" Also, the fossils, geological deposits, and landforms in Earth in Upheaval, which Velikovsky regards as corroborating the hypothesis presented in Worlds in Collision have been, since their publication, explained in terms of mundane non-catastrophic geologic processes.Ellenberger, C. Leroy (1984). Still Facing Many Problems (Part I), sec. Tree Rings. Kronos X, 1, October, pp. 94-97. \\"Earth in Upheaval is a brief in favor of global cosmic catastrophes to explain the geological record, but it does not make its case for all geological epochs to the exclusion of alternate explanations. In other words, . . . global, cosmic catastrophes are not necessary to explain the evidence for very recent catastrophes cited in the chapters 'Thirty-five centuries ago', 'Klimasturz', and 'Ruins of the East'.\\"Ellenberger, C.

The sediments, which were misidentified as a \\"raise beach\\", are now attributed to megatsunamis generated by massive landslides created by the periodic collapse of the sides of the islands.McMurtry, G.M., P.

In addition, these conglomerates, as many of the items cited as evidence for his ideas in Earth in Upheaval, are far too old to be used as valid evidence supporting the hypothesis presented in Worlds in Collision.Ellenberger, C.

Cartilage in fetal development In embryogenesis, the skeletal system is derived from the mesoderm germ layer. Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into chondrocytes and begins secreting the molecules that form the extracellular matrix. Early in fetal development, the greater part of the skeleton is cartilaginous. This temporary cartilage is gradually replaced by bone (Endochondral ossification), a process that ends at puberty. In contrast, the cartilage in the joints remains unossified during the whole of life and is, therefore, permanent. Mineralization Adult hyaline articular cartilage is progressively mineralized at the junction between cartilage and bone. It is then termed articular calcified cartilage. A mineralization front advances through the base of the hyaline articular cartilage at a rate dependent on cartilage load and shear stress. Intermittent variations in the rate of advance and mineral deposition density of the mineralizing front, lead to multiple \\"tidemarks\\" in the articular calcified cartilage. Adult articular calcified cartilage is penetrated by vascular buds, and new bone produced in the vascular space in a process similar to endochondral ossification at the physis. A cement line demarcates articular calcified cartilage from subchondral bones. Repair Once damaged, cartilage has limited repair capabilities. Because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae, they cannot migrate to damaged areas. Also, because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply, the deposition of new matrix is slow. Damaged hyaline cartilage is usually replaced by fibrocartilage scar tissue. Over the last years, surgeons and scientists have elaborated a series of cartilage repair procedures that help to postpone the need for joint replacement. In a 1994 trial, Swedish doctors repaired damaged knee joints by implanting cells cultured from the patient's own cartilage. In 1999 US chemists created an artificial liquid cartilage for use in repairing torn tissue. The cartilage is injected into a wound or damaged joint and will harden with exposure to ultraviolet light. Synthetic cartilage Researchers say their lubricating layers of \\"molecular brushes\\" can outperform nature under the highest pressures encountered within joints, with potentially important implications for joint replacement surgery. Each 60-nanometre-long brush filament has a polymer backbone from which small molecular groups stick out. Those synthetic groups are very similar to the lipids found in cell membranes. \\"In a watery environment, each of these molecular groups attracts up to 25 water molecules through electrostatic forces, so the filament as a whole develops a slick watery sheath. These sheathes ensure that the brushes are lubricated as they rub past each other, even when firmly pressed together to mimic the pressures at bone joints.\\" Known as double-network hydrogels, the incredible strength of these new materials was a happy surprise when first discovered by researchers at Hokkaido in 2003. Most conventionally prepared hydrogels - materials that are 80 to 90 percent water held in a polymer network - easily break apart like a gelatin. The Japanese team serendipitously discovered that the addition of a second polymer to the gel made them so tough that they rivaled cartilage - tissue which can withstand the abuse of hundreds of pounds of pressure.  Molecular level  Bone morphogenetic proteins are growth factors released during embryonic development to induce condensation and determination of cells, during chondrogenesis. Noggin, a developmental protein, inhibits chondrogenesis by preventing condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells. The molecule sonic hedgehog (Shh) modifies the activation of the L-Sox5, Sox6, Sox9 and Nkx3.2. Sox9 and Nkx3.2 induce each other in a positive feedback loop where Nkx3.2 inactivates a Sox9 inhibitor. This loop is supported by BMP expression. The expression of Sox9 induces the expression of BMP, which causes chondrocytes to proliferate and differentiate. L-Sox5 and Sox6 share this common role with Sox9. L-Sox5 and Sox6 are thought to induce the activation of the Col2a1 and the Col11a2 genes, and to repress the expression of Cbfa1, a marker for late stage Chondrocytes. L-Sox5 is also thought to be involved primarily in embryonic chondrogenesis, while Sox6 is thought to be involved in post-natal chondrogenesis. The molecule Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is expressed by prehypertrophic chondrocytes. Ihh stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and regulates chondrocyte maturation by maintaining the expression of PTHrP. PTHrP acts as a patterning molecule, determining the position in which the chondrocytes initiate differentiation. Sulfation The SLC26A2 is a sulfate transporter. Defects result in several forms of osteochondrodysplasia.

The PNGV - Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles project was aimed at The Big Three American car manufacturers. ESX I (1996) The first attempt made by Chrysler at exceeding 80 mpg was designated the Intrepid ESX. The ESX I, although a series hybrid, used what might be considered \\"conventional technology\\". Chrysler invested an estimated US$3 million into the project, which used exotic materials in its construction: the model was priced at nearly $90,000; $70,000 more than the base Intrepid of the comparable year. The ESX was designed by Bob Boniface, who went on the design the 1998 production Dodge Intrepid. The engine was derived from a series hybrid-drive propulsion system meant to use 40% of gasoline's potential energy while at optimum RPM (the typical car only uses 15% of gasoline's potential energy due to wide ranges of RPMs). The car was powered by a VM Motori 1.8 L three- cylinder turbocharged diesel, whose energy was diverted to a , 300 V TMFI was the Test and Verification Lab Manager at Bolder Technologiesbattery developed by Bolder Technologies in Golden, Colorado and two oil-cooled electric wheel motors. The electric motors were also part of the regenerative braking system, where energy normally lost through the disc brakes recharged the batteries. ESX II (1998) The second series in the ESX line completed testing in 1998, and made several improvements on its predecessor. The ESX II was dubbed a \\"mybrid\\" (mild hybrid) because its reliance on electrical power was not highly dependent on the battery. This system contained two motors that worked in parallel: a 1.5 L 74 bhp direct-injection diesel and a 20 bhp AC-induction electric motor. Coupled with the powertrains were a 5-speed electronically shifted manual transmission, a nickel-metal hydride battery pack, and controlling equipment which included components from the Patriot hybrid race- car program. The main power came from the diesel engine. The electric motor charged the batteries, added to the acceleration, and powered the reverse gear. To cut down on cost and weight, Chrysler fit the car with an unpainted thermoplastic body attached to an aluminum frame. The shape had low aerodynamic drag. Inside, trim was constructed of carbon fiber and the seats were constructed from tube frame. The final cost: only $15,000 more than a regular Intrepid, or about $37,000. ESX III (2003) The 72 mpg diesel- hybrid ESX III The ESX III progress in fuel efficiency and costs stem from several major improvements in technology: The ESX3's mild hybrid electric (or \\"mybrid\\") powertrain combines an efficient diesel engine, an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery to achieve an average 72 miles per gallon (3.3 liters/100 km) fuel efficiency (gasoline equivalent). That is two miles per gallon better than the fuel efficiency of its predecessor, the ESX2 in 1998, and close to PNGV's goal of . An electro-mechanical automatic transmission (EMAT) developed by DaimlerChrysler engineers provides the fuel efficiency of a manual transmission with the convenience of an automatic. The lightweight body uses injection-molded thermoplastics to achieve significant improvements in weight and cost. The ESX3 weighs in at just 2,250 pounds (1020 kg) while meeting all federal safety standards and providing the roominess and comfort of today's family sedan. The entire vehicle is more than 80 percent recyclable. A total rethinking of the car's electronic and electrical systems cut several pounds from the weight of electronics while providing driver controls, vehicle monitoring and diagnostic indicators, audio and video systems, and a telemetrics package. There are no plans to produce any of the ESX series of vehicles; the Intrepid nameplate has been retired, and Dodge has no immediate plans to produce a hybrid sedan.

Despite having been designed from 1933 as a rather slow but well-armoured light infantry support tank, the type was initially rejected by the French Infantry because it proved difficult to steer while driving cross-country, and was instead adopted in 1936 by the French Cavalry arm. From 1938 an improved version was produced with a stronger engine, the Char l√©ger mod√®le 1935 H modifi√© 39, which from 1940 was also fitted with a longer, more powerful 37 mm gun. It was intended to make this improved variant the standard light tank, with at least four thousand produced to equip new armoured divisions of both the Cavalry and the Infantry arms, but due to the defeat of France in June 1940, total production of both subtypes was limited to about 1200 vehicles. For the remainder of the war Germany and its allies used captured Hotchkiss tanks in several modifications.  Development  In 1926, it had been decided to provide armour support to the regular infantry divisions by creating autonomous tank battalions equipped with a light and cheap infantry tank, a char d'accompagnement. For this role at first the Char D1 was developed which type however, proved to be neither particularly light nor cheap. In 1933, the Hotchkiss company under its own initiative presented a plan to produce a lighter design‚Äîthis was made possible by the application of a new technology to produce cast steel sections to construct an entire hull. On 30 June 1933, this proposal was approved by the Conseil Consultatif de l'Armement. On 2 August 1933 the specifications were issued: a weight of and armour protection all around. Three prototypes were ordered from Hotchkiss, but the French industry as a whole was also invited to provide alternative proposals for a nouveau char l√©ger.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2011, \\"Gamelin impose le Hotchkiss √† la Cavalerie\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel, 98: 6‚Äì17 This allowed the Renault company to beat Hotchkiss in delivering the first prototype, which later was developed into the Renault R35. On 18 January 1935, the first Hotchkiss prototype, not yet made of armour steel, was presented to the Commission d'Exp√©rience du Mat√©riel Automobile (CEMA) at Vincennes; it was a machine gun-armed tankette without turret. It was tested until 4 March 1935, when it was replaced by the second identical prototype to be tested until 6 May. Both had to be rejected because new specifications had been made on 21 June 1934 that increased the desired armour thickness to . On 27 June 1935 the commission approved the type on the provision that the necessary changes would be made. On 19 August the third prototype was delivered, equipped with a cast APX turret and featuring a redesigned hull; it was tested until 20 September and accepted. On 6 November 1935 a first order was made for 200 vehicles. Though it should have been completed between July 1936 and July 1937, the first production vehicle was in fact delivered on 12 September 1936. A first additional orders had already been made of 92 on 7 September 1936, to be completed in November 1937. A third one of 108 vehicles followed on 23 January 1937, to be completed in September 1938. These vehicles had the series number 40000 to 40400. By 1 January 1937 132 hulls had been produced. None of these had at that date yet been fitted with a turret.  Rejection by the Infantry and adoption by the Cavalry  A Hotchkiss H35 at an unknown date. The first series vehicle was again extensively and intensively tested until 4 December 1936. The testing soon showed that its cross-country handling qualities were unacceptably poor. It was simply impossible to safely steer the vehicle on a somewhat bumpy surface, posing an extreme danger to nearby friendly infantry. The Infantry therefore initially rejected any further procurement. Eventually, in 1937, it decided to accept only the last hundred tanks to equip just two battalions with the type: the 13e and 38e Bataillon de Chars de Combat. For political reasons however, stopping production of the tank was unacceptable. As a result the first three hundred vehicles of the production run were offered to the Cavalry, which was forced to accept them because it would not have been granted a budget for other tanks anyway. As the cavalry units would be making more use of the road network and of mounted infantry, its cross-country handling problem was of less consequence. The H 35 was, at , also somewhat faster than the Renault R35, which was capable of , although in practice its average speed was lower than that of the R 35 because of its inferior gear box.  Description  An abandoned Hotchkiss H39 in 1940 The Hotchkiss H35 was a small vehicle, long, wide and tall and weighing . The hull consisted of six cast armour sections, bolted together: the engine deck, the fighting compartment, the front of the hull, the back of the hull and two longitudinal sections left and right forming the bottom. The hull was made water-tight by cementing these sections together with Aslic, a product based on tar mixed with lime. The casting allowed for sloped armour, avoiding shot traps, to optimise the chance of deflection but the protection levels did not satisfy the Infantry. Maximum armour thickness was not the specified but . There were persistent quality problems, worsened by the fact that many subcontractors had to be used: at first the armour was made much too soft; when hardness was increased it became brittle and full of bubbles and hence weak spots. There was a crew of two. The driver sat at the right front, behind a large cast double hatch and next to the combined gearbox and steering unit.AFV Profile No. 36 p. 18 Behind him was a round escape hatch in the bottom of the hull. Driving the vehicle was very hard work. The Hotchkiss lacked the Cleveland differential (\\"Cletrac\\") of its Renault competitor, and it responded unpredictably to changes of direction. The brakes could not sufficiently compensate for this, being too weak, especially when driving down-slope. No less troublesome was the gearbox: it was difficult to engage the highest fifth gear and so the theoretical top speed of was rarely reached. There was one reverse gear. The inevitable rough handling of the tank by the driver resulted in much wear and tear. Mechanical reliability was poor. The suspension consisted of three bogies per side‚Äîeach formed of two bell cranks arranged as \\"scissors\\" with springs at the top. Each bogie carried two rubber-rimmed wheels.AFV Profile No 36 p. 20 The first ten production vehicles, which can be considered as forming a separate pre-series, had curved bogie sides; in later vehicles the bogies had straight sides. The bogies superficially resembled the R35 type, but used horizontal helical springs instead of rubber cylinders. The sprocket was at the front, the idler‚Äîwhich itself was sprung to automatically control tension‚Äîat the rear. There were two top rollers. The rear of the hull formed an engine room, separated from the fighting compartment by a fireproof bulkhead. The tank was powered by a 78 hp six-cylinder 86 x 100 3485 cc engine which was on the left of the engine compartment. A 160-litre fuel tank on the right, combined with a twenty litres reserve reservoir, gave a range of or eight hours on a varied terrain. The engine was cooled by a centrifugal pump. Also a cooling fan drew air through the radiator and was also expected to cool the fuel tank.AFV Profile No. 36 p. 16 The trench-crossing capacity was , the wading capacity . On hard soil a slope of 75 percent could be climbed, on soft soil of 55 percent. Maximum tilt was 50 percent. Clearance was . The APX-R turret was the same standard type as used on the R35 and R40 tanks, made of cast steel and armed with the short 37 mm SA 18 gun, which had a maximum armour penetration of only . Traverse of the turret was with a handwheel. The commander sat in a saddle suspended from the turret. The tank carried about 100 rounds for the gun, and 2,400 rounds for the coaxial 7.5 mm Reibel machine gun ‚Äì the 37 mm ammunition racked on the left hand side of the hull, the 7.5 mm ammunition on the right side in fifteen circular magazines with 150 rounds each; a final magazine was to be at the ready on the machine-gun itself. The turret had a rotating cupola with a PPL RX 180 P visor but there was no hatch in the cupola though its top could be lifted a bit for better ventilation. Apart from the cupola there were protected vision devices, a binocular periscope and diascopes, to the front beside the gun and to each side.AFV Profile No. 36 For access there was a hatch at the back of the turret. When opened, the commander could sit on it for better observation, but this left him very vulnerable and slow to reach the gun. The alternative was to fight closed-up, observing through the vertical slits or the visor of the hatchless cupola. The Cavalry liked neither this arrangement nor the weak gun. The latter problem was lessened somewhat by enlarging the breech so that special rounds with a larger charge could be used. This increased muzzle velocity to about and maximum penetration to about . Only a small part of the tanks with the Cavalry alone were modified however, because it greatly increased barrel wear. In the Spring of 1940 the original diascopes of the Chr√©tien type were gradually replaced with episcopes, offering more protection.  The Char l√©ger mod√®le 1935 H modifi√© 39  An H39 at Saumur; this vehicle has been modified by the Germans who fitted a cupola hatch As the Cavalry wanted an even better top speed, it was decided to bring to fruition experiments already conducted from October 1936 to install a more powerful engine. A new prototype was built in 1937, with a 120 hp instead of a 78 hp engine. The hull was enlarged, giving it a higher almost level engine deck, to accommodate it. The track and the suspension elements were improved, raising the weight to . This improved type was faster, with a top speed of , but also proved much easier to drive. Therefore, it was first presented to the Commission d'Exp√©rimentations de l'Infanterie on 31 January 1939 to see whether the original negative decision could be changed. The commission indeed accepted the type, the Char l√©ger mod√®le 1935 H modifi√© 39; and it was decided on 18 February to let it succeed the original version from the 401st vehicle onwards, which was just as well as both in 1937 and 1938 an order had been made of two hundred vehicles and production had already started, the total orders of the improved type thereafter being expanded to nine hundred. The factory identifier however, was Char l√©ger Hotchkiss mod√®le 38 s√©rie D, its predecessor having been the s√©rie B. The factory designation has caused much confusion; this was still officially the same tank as the H35, only in a later variant; even at the time, many began to refer to it as the 38 H or the 39 H. The new subtype differed from the original one in having a raised and more angular engine deck (in later production vehicles with crosswise instead of longitudinal ventilation slits on the right side); a range decreased to ; closed idler wheels; tracks wider at ; metal instead of rubber wheel treads; a silencer directed to the back and larger, more reliable and effective, ventilators. Free French H39s during the Battle of Gabon. A modernisation programme was initiated in early 1940. Besides the fitting of episcopes, tails and some radio sets, this included the gradual introduction of a longer L/35 37 mm SA38 gun with a much improved anti-tank capability ( penetration at ); about 350 vehicles were (re)built with the better gun, among them about fifty H35s.Pascal Danjou, 2006, \\"Les Hotchkiss H35 R√©arm√©s\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s et Mat√©riel N¬∞74, p. 81 The new gun became standard on the production lines in April. Before that, the trickle of longer guns becoming available had, from January 1940, gradually been fitted to the tanks of platoon, company and battalion commanders; about half of the commander vehicles in Hotchkiss units were so modified. It had been intended to fit the longer gun to all vehicles during the second half of 1940. After the war it was wrongly assumed for a time that H38 was the official name of the tank with the new engine but without the new gun and that H39 was the name of the type that had both major improvements. H38 however, in contemporary use indicated the same type as H39 and it is only possible to refer to the latter with historical accuracy in an informal sense. Parallel to the development of a R40 it was, for a time, considered to create an H40 by adopting the improved AMX suspension of the other vehicle; but this option was ultimately rejected.  Operational history = France  In the Cavalry arm, the main user at first, the Hotchkiss tanks replaced as main combat tanks the light AMR 33 and AMR 35 vehicles, that for want of a better type had been used to form the bulk of the first two Cavalry armoured divisions. As the new medium SOMUA S35 was initially produced in very limited numbers, until early 1939 the Hotchkiss equipped three of the four divisional tank regiments. In April 1940 the 342e CACC (Compagnie Autonome de Chars de Combat or \\"Independent Tank Company\\") was sent to Norway after Operation Weser√ºbung, the German invasion of that country, having first been intended to form part of an expeditionary force to assist Finland in the Winter War. This autonomous company, equipped with fifteen H39s, all with short guns, fought in the later phase of the Battles of Narvik, after having landed on 7 May. After the temporary liberation of that city, the twelve remaining vehicles were withdrawn to Britain on 8 June, where they exceptionally joined the Free French, forming the 1e Compagnie de Chars de Combat de la France Libre. In 1940 and 1941 this 1e CCC fought against Vichy troops in the Battle of Gabon and later in Syria. According to the official army acceptance lists, at the start of World War II 640 Hotchkiss tanks had been delivered. The inventories deviate slightly: of the 300 H35s allocated to the Cavalry, 232 were fielded by ten cavalry squadrons, 44 were in depot, eight in factory overhaul and sixteen in North Africa. Of the hundred used by the Infantry, ninety were fielded by the two tank battalions equipped with the type, six were in mat√©riel reserve and two used for driving training. Of the H39s, sixteen were used by the Cavalry in North Africa and six in depot; 180 were fielded by four Infantry tank battalions and fourteen were in the Infantry mat√©riel reserve. It was decided to concentrate most Allied production capacity for light tanks into the manufacture of a single type, and the Hotchkiss tank was chosen as it had the necessary mobility to be of use in the many armoured divisions the Entente planned to raise for the expected decisive summer offensive of 1941. To this end British and Portuguese heavy industry had to assist in producing the cast armour sections. It was hoped to increase production to 300 a month in October 1940, and even 500 a month from March 1941, the sections of 75 of which to be provided by Britain in exchange for a monthly delivery of nine Char B1s. This can be compared to the planned production of the R40: 120 per month, reflecting the little importance now attached to infantry support. These plans were disrupted by the Battle of France. In May 1940 the type equipped in the Cavalry units two tank regiments (of 47) in each of the three Mechanised Light Divisions and served as AMR in the 9th and 25th Mechanised Infantry Division (sixteen vehicles for each), 3rd DLM (22 H35s and 47 H39s) and in three of the five Cavalry Light Divisions (sixteen vehicles each for the 1re, 2e and 3e DLC). Furthermore, sixteen vehicles were part of the 1er RCA in Morocco. In the Infantry it equipped the two autonomous battalions mentioned above and two battalions of 45 in each of the three Divisions Cuirass√©es, the latter with the H39 variant. Most Hotchkiss tanks were thus concentrated in larger motorised units, in the armoured divisions supplementing the core of heavier tanks, though they were mismatched: the slower H35s fought alongside the swifter SOMUA S35s, whereas the faster H39s joined the slow Char B1s. The vast majority of these vehicles still had the short gun. Several ad hoc and reconstituted units were formed with the type after the invasion. These included 4e DCR (forty vehicles) and 7e DLM (47). Most of these later units were equipped with new vehicles built with the long gun, but 7e DLM also deployed twenty-two old H35s in its 8e dragons-chars. In May deliveries peaked at 122; a recently discovered picture of a Hotchkiss tank with series number 41200 indicates that in June at least 121 were produced for a total of at least 1,200 vehicles, not including prototypes.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2007, \\"Notre Cavalerie M√©canique √† son Apog√©e le 10 Mai 1940\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s et Mat√©riel, N¬∞ 75, p.49  Germany  A pair of Panzerkampfwagen 38H 735(f) used by the Germans in Yugoslavia, 1941 Panzerkampfwagen 38H 735(f) used by the Germans in Yugoslavia, 1942 A Hotchkiss used by the Germans in Split, Croatia, 1943 About 550 Hotchkiss tanks were captured and used by the Germans as Panzerkampfwagen 35H 734(f) or Panzerkampfwagen 38H 735(f); most for occupation duty. Like the French, the Germans made no clear distinction between a H38 and a H39; and fitted many with a cupola with a hatch. =Eastern Front= Panzer-Abteilung 211 was deployed in Finland during Operation Barbarossa, equipped with Hotchkiss tanks. In 1944, three of its vehicles were converted to 7.5 cm self- propelled guns.Panzers in Finland ‚Äì Kari Kuusela, Additional vehicles were sent to Finland as part of the independent Panzerkampfwagenz√ºge (tank platoons) 217, 218 and 219, which were attached to the 20th Mountain Army in February 1942.Panzers in Finland ‚Äì Kari Kuusela, The platoons were the same as those of Panzerabteilung 211, consisting of one SOMUA S35 and four Hotchkiss tanks. They were later disbanded, with the tanks being dispersed for use as fortifications and the crews used to form two batteries of Stug III Gs (741 and 742). =Balkans= German H35/39s also saw action in Yugoslavia with 7.SS-Freiwilligen-Gebirgs-Division \\"Prinz Eugen\\", 12.

Panzerdivision =Western Front= In 1942 a project was launched to make use of French equipment as carrier platforms for heavier guns, directed by Major Alfred Becker, an artillery officer who was a mechanical engineer by trade. He had experience making similar conversions with captured Belgian and British vehicles. Working at his Paris works 24 Hotchkiss tanks were in 1942 converted into a Marder I Panzerj√§ger (tank destroyer), the 7,5 cm PaK40(Sf) auf Gesch√ºtzwagen 39H(f), and 48 into self-propelled artillery, the 10,5 cm leFH18(Sf) auf Gesch√ºtzwagen 39H(f), all to be used by units in France. Some vehicles were modified into munition carriers or artillery tractors (Artillerieschlepper 38H(f)) or rocket-launchers (Panzerkampfwagen 35H(f) mit 28/32 cm Wurfrahmen). A special artillery observation vehicle created, was the Panzerbeobachtungswagen 38H (f). In June 1943, 361 Hotchkiss tanks were still listed in the German Army inventories as 37 mm gun tanks; this number had decreased to sixty in December 1944.  Other countries  Poland = Three Hotchkiss tanks of the \\"H39\\" version had been exported by France to Poland in July 1939 for testing by the Polish Bureau of Technical Studies of Armoured Weapons (Polish: Biuro Bada≈Ñ Technicznych Broni Pancernych) with a view to a larger purchase. During the German invasion of Poland in 1939 the Hotchkiss tanks, together with three Renault R 35 tanks, were organised into an ad hoc \\"half company\\" unit under lieutenant J. Jakubowicz, formed on 14 September 1939 in Kiwerce, Poland. The unit joined the \\"Dubno\\" task force and lost all of its tanks during the marches and fighting against German and Soviet armies, largely due to fuel shortages. = Turkey = Two vehicles were exported by France to Turkey in February 1940. = Bulgaria = In 1943 the Germans, against objections, delivered nineteen H39s to Bulgaria for training purposes, when it proved to be impossible to find 25 unmodified Panzer I light tanks, the type the Bulgarians really desired. After the war these vehicles were used by police units. = Croatia = In 1942, the Germans delivered a small number to Croatia. = Hungary = In October 1942, the Hungarian Army received fifteen Hotchkiss H39 tanks, which formed the bulk of the 101st Independent Tank Company, which was used in the counter- partisan role. The unit operated in the Ukraine, Belarus and Poland and was finally disbanded after losing 30% of its tanks to enemy action and having to blow up the rest due to lack of fuel and spares. The unit returned to Hungary from Warsaw in September‚ÄìOctober 1944. = Vichy France = In North Africa, 27 vehicles (thirteen H35 and fourteen H39) were officially serving in the 1e R√©giment de Chasseurs d'Afrique and were allowed to remain there by the armistice conditions; another five were hidden in Morocco. They fought the Allies during the opening stages of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, near Casablanca in November 1942, destroying four M3 Stuart light tanks. The regiment then joined the allied cause and was re- equipped with M4 Sherman medium tanks in the summer of 1943.  Postwar  After the war, some Hotchkiss tanks were used by French security forces in the colonies, such as French Indochina, and occupation forces in Germany. Ten H39s were clandestinely sold to Israel ‚Äì they were shipped from Marseilles to Haifa in 1948. At least one remained in service with the Israel Defense Forces until 1952.  Surviving vehicles  One Hotchkiss H35 and nine Hotchkiss H35s modifi√© 39 have survived to this present day, all of the modifi√© 39 were further modified by the Germans during World War II.http://the.shadock.free.fr/Surviving_French_Tanks.pdf The sole surviving unmodified Hotchkiss H35 was discovered in December 2008, 200 meters off the coast, at Sainte-Cecile beach, Camiers, Pas-de-Calais, France. It is a turretless chassis, probably a remnant of the Dunkerque gap fighting in May‚ÄìJune 1940. The tank was dredged in late 2008 at low tide. The Mus√©e des Blind√©s at Saumur plans to recover this tank for display in the museum, but its recovery has proved very difficult and costly. One Hotchkiss H35 modifi√© 39 tank is on display in the city square in Narvik as a memorial of Battle of Narvik in 1940. A second vehicle in Norway is part of the collection of the Panserparken at the camp Rena leir. In England the private The Wheatcroft Collection has bought a vehicle from the Norwegian Arquebus Krigshistoriske Museum at Rogaland. In France itself the Mus√©e des Blind√©s at Saumur has a vehicle in a running condition; at the base of 501/503e RCC at Mourmelon-le- Grand a Hotchkiss serves as a monument restored with a Renault R35 turret, fitted with a dummy gun. Another tank is displayed at U≈æice, in Serbia. The Bulgarian National Museum of Military History displays one of the vehicles used by the Bulgarian police forces. In Latrun, the Yad la-Shiryon Museum shows one of the tanks used by the IDF. In Russia, the tank museum of Kubinka has a Hotchkiss tank, captured from 211. Panzerabteilung in the summer of 1944.

The club competes in, and is governed by, the New England Rugby Football Union (their LAU), the Northeast Rugby Union (their TAU), and USA Rugby. In 2014 it joined the American Rugby Premiership. The club was established in the late 1980s as a social touring side, but was not recognised as an official club until 1992, when they entered the NERFU Division II in 1992. They advanced to the NRU Premier Division in 1995, winning it for the first time in 1998 and entered the Super League in 2007. Currently, BIWRFC competes in the NERFU Division 1. BIWRFC is recognised as one of the leading rugby union clubs in the United States. History=Founding The Wolfhounds began as a social touring side of rugby players in the Boston area looking to travel the United States during their off-seasons with their respective clubs. Due to their successes while touring (particularly in New Orleans and Texas) and enormous support from the Boston Irish community, the Wolfhounds became an official team and entered into the New England Rugby Football Union (NERFU) Division II in 1992. An unintended consequence of the establishment was the eventual disestablishment of Beacon Hill RFC (lost most of its first XV pack), the end of Mystic River Rugby Club's appearances as a national level club (lost three key first XV), and the relegation of Charles River RFC (lost complete first XV backline) to Division II. During their inaugural season, the first XV suffered only one regular season loss and reached the Northeast Championships. In 1995, the Wolfhounds met enough success to warrant the leap to the Northeast Rugby Football Union (NRU) Premier Division. 2000‚Äìpresent In 2000, they won the Northeast Championships for the first time. In 2001, they advanced to the USA Rugby Division I National Championship pool for the first time, reaching the Sweet 16 pool. In 2002, they matched their 2001 successes and reached the Sweet 16 for a second straight season. In 2003, the Wolfhounds entered and won a number of local and national tournaments and they were able to win the NERFU Division I Championship as well as the National Championship. Wolfhounds scrumhalf Dave Williams was named tournament MVP. In 2004, the Wolfhounds repeated as both NERFU Division I champions and USA Rugby Division I national champions. Adam Thomas of the Wolfhouds was named tournament MVP. In 2005, the Wolfhounds became NERFU Division I champions for the third straight year and finished in fifth place in the Division I National Championship tournament. In 2006, the Wolfhounds became the first-ever US team to submit two sides to the national championship tournament. Both the first XV and the third XV came in second place (Division I and Division III, respectively). In 2007, the Wolfhounds became USA Division III National Champions in San Diego. The Wolfhounds also field a third XV of \\"old boys\\" and new players with little experience. They compete in the New England Rugby Football Union Division III. They have been met with recent success, winning the NERFU Division III championships in 1996, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2009.

In addition to Amber Bock, the Wolfhounds have several individual sponsorships. Notable primary sponsors include Guinness and Tullamore Dew. The club also has several secondary sponsorships from local and regional businesses.Official Wolfhounds Sponsors Recruiting The Wolfhounds have been able to provide hospitality, housing, and career opportunities for players coming to Boston to play for the Hounds. This is one of the reasons they have been able to maintain success on the field. The team is composed of Americans, but there is also a large contingent of foreigners. Many countries are represented Australia, England, New Zealand, Fiji, and Wales. BIWRFC has established relationships with local high school and college sides, which become feeder teams for the Wolfhounds. This allows the Wolfhounds to maintain a large player pool of young athletes. Members of the Wolfhounds have coached Northeastern University RFC, a nationally ranked Division I college side, Boston College, Harvard University, MIT and University of Notre Dame. Wolfhounds players also coach the Boston collegiate select-side All-Star team, which won the NERFU collegiate all-star tournament last spring. The Wolfhounds also coach Boston College High School RFC, which is perennially one of the best high school teams in the country. In recent years, the Wolfhounds have sent some of these young collegiate athletes abroad to gain experience by playing professionally. As of April 2006, there are two Wolfhounds playing in the NPC league in New Zealand. As of April 2006, members of the Wolfhounds include a current USA Rugby U19 National Team player, two former U19 National Team players, and the current captain of the USA Rugby Collegiate All-Star team. The Wolfhounds were a key player in organizing the Boston Rugby Consortium which consists of all NERFU clubs in the city of Boston. The club lent their administrative expertise to secure practice pitches from the city's Parks and Recreation department on a regular basis for the clubs. They have also initiated several coaching clinics and courses to build rugby in the Boston area among all clubs.

When the NFL was awarding expansion teams to two cities in 1993, Baltimore was among the cities vying for a team; the city had lost its previous team, the Colts, in a middle-of-the-night relocation nine years prior. In their proposal, the potential owners of the team had settled on the \\"Baltimore Bombers\\" as the team's nickname in honor of the B-26 Marauder, a World War II bomber designed by the Glenn L. Martin Company, and produced in Baltimore. Leonard ‚ÄúBoogie‚Äù Weinglass, founder of the retailer Merry-Go-Round, was one of the potential owners of the Baltimore expansion team, as was Malcolm Glazer, who would later go on to purchase the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Decision  Baltimore was not awarded an expansion team, passed up in favor of Charlotte, North Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida. The Bombers proposal was believed to be near the bottom of the list of contenders, and league commissioner Paul Tagliabue opposed any expansion to Baltimore, saying ‚Äúsome towns are football towns and some towns are museum towns. I guess Baltimore is a museum town.‚Äù Shortly after the NFL's rejection, the Canadian Football League approved an expansion team for Baltimore; originally christened the Colts, legal action from the NFL compelled the team to stop using the \\"Colts\\" name. With a team that was eventually re-christened the Stallions, Baltimore became one of several U.S. markets introduced to Canadian football as part of the CFL's ill-fated expansion. Although they played only two seasons, the Stallions were, by far, the most successful CFL expansion team of the era, both on and off the field. Their success was a major factor in Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell's decision to relocate his NFL franchise to Baltimore, announcing his signing of a deal to move the team on November 6, 1995. Further legal action from the NFL eventually produced a settlement whereby Modell agreed to leave the Browns' name and colors in Cleveland in exchange for an expansion franchise in Baltimore that acquired the Browns' roster. Bombers was one of the names rejected by the team in the naming process, with city mayor Kurt L. Schmoke even writing a letter advising against the name in light of the Oklahoma City bombing and the Jaffa Road bus bombings in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The name of Marauders finished third in the final voting. The new NFL franchise would become the Baltimore Ravens while the Stallions ceased operations (although their ownership group was granted a new CFL franchise in Montreal and successfully re-signed much of the Stallions' roster).

Preliminary phase Map of the battle In mid-November 1503, the French and Spanish armies were separated by the Garigliano river, some 60 km north of Naples. Both armies camped in a marshy and unhealthy area. The Spanish had tried several times to cross the river using a makeshift bridge, but always in vain. The French, based at the river's mouth near the ruins of Minturnae (Traetto), enjoyed the advantage of an accessible supply- base in the nearby port of Gaeta. While the Spanish commander hesitated as to whether to attack or to retreat, he received reinforcements from Naples led by Bartolomeo d'Alviano and Orsini. He then decided to move some units in order to convince Ludovico that he was retreating towards the Volturno river. But Cordoba had devised a stratagem to cross the river using bridges made out of boats and barrels, which he had built in the castle of Mondragone, 12 kilometers south of the Spanish camp. The battle During the night between 27 and 28 December, the Spanish brought the bridging materials to a place near the castle of Suio, in a position invisible to the French, some six kilometers north of the latter's camp. D'Alviano, commander of the Spanish vanguard, had the construction begin at dawn. By 10 AM some 4,000 Spaniards had crossed the Garigliano. The 300 Norman crossbowmen in Suio did not notice the move, so Gonzalo de Cordoba was also able to cross the river with 2,000 more, including 200 horsemen led by Prospero Colonna. He then ordered an attack on the French bridge. When d'Alviano's troops reached Suio, the crossbowmen fled towards Castelforte, where they met 300 French troops. These also fled to Traetto, allowing d'Alviano to occupy Castelforte. Gonzalo de Cordoba spent the night in that town. The French had numerous ill soldiers in their Traetto camp, so they were unable to send reinforcements. French captain Alegri then decided to destroy the bridge and to order a general retreat to Gaeta, abandoning all the sick soldiers and nine cannons in the camp. Informed about the French retreat, Gonzalo decided to continue the advance. Colonna and his horsemen made contact with the French at Scauri, but a courageous defence of a bridge by Chevalier Bayard allowed the French a safe retreat. After a series of minor clashes, the French took position near a bridge in Mola where they were able to push back Colonna's attempt to surround them. However, the arrival of the rest of the Spanish forced the Marquis of Saluzzo to order another retreat. The Spanish victory was decisive, as the offensive capacity of the French army was destroyed.Keegan, John: Who's Who in Military History: From 1453 to the Present Day.

It was once a traditional fishing village outside Cromer but is now a popular holiday destination for camping and caravan holidays. The village is within the parish of Runton that also includes West Runton. The village is west of Cromer, east of West Runton, east of Sheringham and north of Norwich. The village lies on the A149 coast road but most of the dwellings can be found just south of the road, nestled around the two village greens. The population in the 2001 census was shown as 1,633 (includes West Runton) in 784 households. at the 2011 census the population was included in the civil parish of Runton. The parish area is 544 hectares. The war dead of East Runton are recorded on the West Runton War Memorial. Public houses There are two public houses in East Runton: the Fishing Boat and the White Horse Inn. The Fishing Boat is the older of the inns, and is on the tithe map of 1840,East and West Runton: Two Villages, One Parish by G.F. Leake, Poppyland Publishing, . although it was simply called the ‚ÄòBoat Inn‚Äô then. In 1734 it is recorded that a court was held at the inn and it was then called the ‚ÄòThree Horse Shoes‚Äô. The White Horse Inn is first recorded in 1851. There is also a social club in the village which is known as ‚ÄòBernies‚Äô Corner House in Beach Road which in years prior was an amusement arcade but this changed to current usage in around 1982. Bernie's was named after Bernie Parkin whose father Reginald (Snr) originally had bought the place and had run it as an amusement arcade. Next door is a fish and chip shop. This was run for some time (especially during the 1980s) by John Parkin (Bernie's brother). The Windmill The tower mill at East Runton dates from at least 1826Bryants Map of 1826 when it is shown on Bryants map. The mill has now been restored and is a private dwelling. The mill was last worked in 1908 and has a cap that resembles an upturned clinker-built boat. This style of top is known as the Norfolk style. The restored tower now is complete with its cap, gallery and fantail but to date has no sails. The tower is high and is built of brick.Norfolk Mills - East Runton tower windmill The tower had five storeys and once had three pairs of stones which were powered from the four double-shuttered sails. The village once also had a wooden post mill although there is no trace of where this was located other than a piece of land close to the railway which to this day is called Mill Hill and is now a caravan storage facility. Story of James Leak James Leak was a resident of East Runton around the early part of the 19th century. Leak was the local blacksmith and renowned Bare-Knuckle prize fighter. He lived in one of six thatched cottages that once stood on the cliff top near Runton gap. His blacksmith‚Äôs forge was at West Runton.White‚Äôs Directory of 1845 In 1827 Leak had a big problem. The story goes that he had developed a gangrenous toe and was in fear of it spreading and causing his death. In his desperation, Leak came up with his own solution to his problem. He went to his forge in West Runton, rested his foot on his anvil and with one mighty blow removed the infected toe with a hammer and chisel. He then cauterized the stump with a red hot poker from out of his forge.The Banville Diaries of 1986, which quotes a report in the Norwich Mercury dated 24 February 1827 This desperate surgery had been as a consequence of Leak being unable to afford surgeon‚Äôs fees. He made a full recovery and his home surgery seems to have had little effect on the man as he continued his prize-fighting and lived to the age of 82.East and West Runton: Two Villages, One Parish by G.F.

It is a family of armored vehicles produced by Force Protection Inc, which manufactures ballistic and mine- protected vehicles. The vehicles are integrated by Spartan Motors. These vehicles are protected against small arms, land mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) using a combination of design features and materials to protect both the crew and engine compartment against a wide range of attacks.Army Bullets A Monocoque type, V-shaped hull extends to the engine bay and serves to direct the blast away from under the vehicle. The dual air-conditioners help keep heavily dressed troops from overheating in temperatures over in Iraq. Development Force Protection, Inc. was formed in 2002 when Sonic Jet purchased Technical Solutions Group, using the name Sonic Jet until 2004. Technical Solutions Group had been a defense company in the US that was involved in a range of products, including mine-resistant vehicles based on South African designs. A few vehicles were sold to the US Army for evaluation, and a small fleet of heavily protected vehicles was sold to the British Army in 2001. In 2004, the new Cougar was designed by a small British-led team in the US at Force Protection, Inc., in response to an urgent requirement by the US Marine Corps. This was a new design, developed in the US, based on an evolution of vehicle mine-protection technology used by the South African Army and Rhodesian Security Forces since the 1970s. The very first sketches of the new vehicle were made in late March 2004 in response to those initial USMC inquiries. The rapid development and production that followed were based upon the USMC request that the first vehicle is delivered within 6 months of an order ‚Äì which was subsequently placed in mid-April 2004 for 27 units. The new design was called Cougar to provide a degree of continuity with the older designs but had little in common with them. The former vehicles were almost entirely non-compliant with NATO standards for protection, human factors, and safety, which made those designs obsolete. The Cougar was effectively a totally new vehicle that incorporated the latest US-made automotives, a new hull design, and structure, as well as built-in growth potential, including dimensions that allowed for the addition of the latest armor and protection systems. After being built, the first vehicle was only trialed by doing some circuits of the company campus and trundling over a few rocks and beams set up by the designer to provide a degree of shake-down testing as well as a demonstration course. Urgent operational requirements dictated that the first unit be shipped to the theatre as fast as possible and those involved in the project decided that the risk of doing so was outweighed by the advantages of having the vehicle available. The Cougar was fully trialed when it became part of the MRAP program. The first Cougars were called HEV (hardened engineer vehicle), which became JERRV when the Army joined the program, and then MRAP for political reasons when the requirement for many thousands of units was issued. Some 4,000 of these vehicles were fielded under the US military's MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) and other vehicle programs.MRAP Vehicle Order: 1,000 Cougars to be Turned Loose. defenseindustrydaily.com US Defense Secretary Robert Gates demanded that the vehicles be ordered in larger numbers after the Marines reported in 2004 that no troops had died in more than 300 IED attacks on Cougars.\\"The truck the Pentagon wants and the firm that makes it\\". USA Today, 10/2/2007. Since then, Cougar vehicles have been hit by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) many times in Iraq with few fatalities. Britain chose the Cougar over the RG-31 Nyala for their \\"Mastiff\\" APV.UK Land Forces Order ‚ÄòMastiff PPV‚Äô Cougar Vehicles (updated). defenseindustrydaily.com , the Pentagon planned to add the Crows II remote weapon station and the Frag Kit 6 anti-EFP armor. Official data states that the Cougar is able to withstand a blast of at least 14 kg TNT (30.86 lb) under a wheel and 7 kg TNT (15.43 lb) under a belly. Variants The Cougar comes in two main configurations, a 4√ó4, and 6√ó6. It is designed for the transport and protection of troops and equipment, especially against mines or IEDs. The two main configurations come in specific variants. ;Cougar HEV (Hardened engineer vehicle): 4√ó4 and 6√ó6 vehicles ordered in 2004 by the USMC. ;Badger ILAV (Iraqi Light Armored Vehicle): Based on the Cougar and manufactured by FPII and BAE Systems for the Iraqi Army. The ILAV is based on the Cougar, which can carry ten passengers (the six-wheel version can carry 16). The Cougar/ILAV vehicle uses a capsule design to protect the passengers and key vehicle components from mines and roadside bombs. The larger Cougar costs about $730,000 each, fully equipped. The Cougars have been very popular with American troops, and with Iraqis who have worked with them. 865 ILAVs were ordered by Iraq and 18 by Yemen. The ILAV gives the Iraqis the same degree of protection that most Coalition troops have. ;Cougar JERRV (Joint EOD rapid response vehicle): 4√ó4 and 6√ó6 variants for the US Army, USAF, and USMC. Approx. 200 ordered in 2005 and 2006, with another 200 ordered in late 2006 but now called MRAPs to take account of the new US military/political initiative to be seen to be responding to public concerns about casualties. ;Cougar ISS: Based on the Cougar 4√ó4, the ISS is fitted with an integrated independent suspension system that gives the vehicle increased cross-country mobility.Cougar ISS ForceProtection.net ;Ridgeback PPV (Protected Patrol Vehicle): British version of the Cougar 4x4 from FPII base vehicles with a British armor package and electronics, including installation of Enforcer remote weapon stations on some vehicles. In 2015, Salisbury coroner David Ridley raised several \\"points of concern\\" relating to the vehicle when recording a narrative verdict on the deaths of four soldiers who drowned in Helmand, Afghanistan in June 2010. ;Mastiff PPV (Protected Patrol Vehicle): British version of the Cougar 6√ó6 which arrived in Afghanistan during December 2006, with FPII providing the base vehicle and NP Aerospace in the UK integrating electronics and the British armor package. Mastiff 2 is an improved version with a capacity of 2 + 8 which arrived in Afghanistan during June 2009. The Mastiff is armed with a 7.62 mm GPMG, 12.7 mm Heavy Machine Gun or 40 mm Grenade Machine Gun. ;Mastiff 2 'Protected Eyes': A version of the British Mastiff specially designed for the Talisman Counter-IED program. It is fitted with an M151 Protector remote weapon station, mine plow, optical camera and a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) with screens in the back to display its camera feed. ;Wolfhound (Heavy Tactical Support Vehicle): British modification of the Cougar 6√ó6, with FPII providing the base vehicle and NP Aerospace in the UK integrating electronics and the British armor package.

In service with those countries, the Cougar is used in a variety of roles, including the HEV (Hardened Engineer Vehicle) and the Joint Explosive Ordnance Disposal Rapid Response Vehicles (JERRV) while in service with the US Marine Corps, US Navy Seabees, and US Air Force RED HORSE. Compared to the original Cougar vehicle, the British variant is fitted with large, vertical armor plates that cover the large vision blocks and weapon firing ports. This is in line with British Army doctrine concerning the role of the APC/MICV, specifically that it is to carry troops under protection to the objective and give firepower support when they have disembarked. The Mastiff is fitted with a turret sporting either a L7A2 GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun), L110A1 Light Machine Gun, L11A1 Heavy Machine Gun or L134A1 40 mm Grenade Machine Gun.Defence image database One aspect of the British Army's approach to APC/MICV units (which differs to that of the United States) is that the ability of the average soldier to fire accurately out the ports of a moving IFV has been questioned. The large armor plates add side protection from RPGs or IED explosions. The British Army has operated an earlier MPV named \\"Tempest MPV\\". As of November 2008, the British Army has ordered over 400 Cougar vehicles for deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan following a series of Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs). Deliveries of the first 86 Mastiffs began in February 2007, and an order for 22 further vehicles was placed in March, bringing the total to 108. In October 2007, Gordon Brown announced a further 140 Mastiffs and 157 new Cougar 4x4 variants, named Ridgeback were being ordered to protect troops from mines and roadside bombs. Canada has deployed the Cougar since October 2007 in Afghanistan. From November 2008, forty Cougar H were lent by the United States for the Polish contingent in Afghanistan. In Polish service they carried 7.62mm PK machine guns.Ho≈Çdanowicz, Grzegorz: Cougary w Ghazni in: \\"Raport ‚Äì Wojsko Technika Obronno≈õƒá\\" Nr. 12/2008, p. 48‚Äì50 On Jan 5, 2012 an Air Force EOD Team, Team Tripwire, 3 Airman, were KIA by a remote detonated IED attack.

Routledge Kegan Paul. One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other properties. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by George Berkeley and Peter Geach.  Development  Abstractionism has its roots in Aristotle's writings, particularly those rejecting the Platonic theory of Forms. They were adopted and developed further by the Scholastics so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century. John Locke also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences. For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things. His theory contradicts the empiricist standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration. There are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor, who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts. Chomsky, for instance, explained the \\"deep structure\\" of the Internet or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that \\"linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction.\\" Berkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word \\"triangle\\" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.

The programming represented some of the earlier efforts of Canada's premium television industry, considering pay-TV movie channels had commenced in 1983. It should not be confused with later Canadian cable channels Life Network (now known as Slice) and CTV Life Channel.  History  The Life Channel was approved for broadcast by the CRTC on 14 March 1985CRTC Decision 85-141 following licensing hearings on 5 February 1985. The company was a partnership between Winnipeg, Manitoba doctor John Tyson, who became president of the company, Toronto, Ontario lawyer Michael G. Rinaldo, who became director and secretary, and broadcast company CUC Limited. On 18 October 1985, The Life Channel began satellite broadcasts to cable companies on a pay-TV basis. The initial broadcasts were available free to cable subscribers as a preview until 1 November 1985. Subscription cost was $5.95 per month, but included free with the other Canadian pay-TV channels at the time, at a cost of $19.95. Notable programming included Ruth Westheimer's Good Sex! programme which was imported from the American Lifetime network. Domestic programming included a talk show hosted by Shirley Solomon and a medical information show, Doctor On Call, hosted by John Tyson. As of September 1986, the service attracted relatively small subscriber base of 380,000 compared to 892,000 for TSN, 848,000 for MuchMusic. The Life Channel had increased the wholesale price it charges cable companies from 15 of 55 cents per subscriber, a move which resulted in some cable systems cancelling the service. Faced with financial problems which included a $4 million debt, The Life Channel ceased broadcasts after 30 November 1986. Its licence was revoked by the CRTC on 1 February 1988.CRTC Decision 88-67 References Category:Defunct Canadian television channels Category:Television channels and stations established in 1985 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1986 Category:1985 establishments in Canada ","title":"The Life Channel"},{"id":"4463084","text":"Robert Edison Sandiford (born 1968) is a Canadian novelist, short story writer and essayist.

It is also the name of the protagonist of the series. The character Rork is a white-haired \\"wizard\\" from another dimension who solves supernatural mysteries, before embarking on a quest to discover his origins. During his quest, he is assisted by a cast of characters including occult detective Raffington Event, astrologer Capricorn, the psychic Deliah Darkthorne (aka \\"Low Valley\\") and her daughter Sy-Ra, the immortal Yosta, and others. His enemies are the mysterious Pharass and Dahmaloch, revealed to be an analogy for the Devil himself in the later and twin Capricorne series. The Rork series is notable for its use of allegory, mysticism, visual sequencing and unusual \\"dynamic\\" framing, with a visual structure and rhythm rather uncommon in European comics. Many mysteries explored in the various albums are not revealed until the seventh album and some albums of the twin Capricorne series, and even then many enigmas remain unanswered for the reader.

A spherical lens or mirror surface has a center of curvature located either along or decentered from the system local optical axis. The vertex of the lens surface is located on the local optical axis. The distance from the vertex to the center of curvature is the radius of curvature of the surface. The sign convention for the optical radius of curvature is as follows: * If the vertex lies to the left of the center of curvature, the radius of curvature is positive. * If the vertex lies to the right of the center of curvature, the radius of curvature is negative. Thus when viewing a biconvex lens from the side, the left surface radius of curvature is positive, and the right radius of curvature is negative. Note however that in areas of optics other than design, other sign conventions are sometimes used. In particular, many undergraduate physics textbooks use the Gaussian sign convention in which convex surfaces of lenses are always positive. Care should be taken when using formulas taken from different sources. Aspheric surfaces Optical surfaces with non-spherical profiles, such as the surfaces of aspheric lenses, also have a radius of curvature. These surfaces are typically designed such that their profile is described by the equation :z(r)=\\\\frac{r^2}{R\\\\left (1+\\\\sqrt{1-(1+K)\\\\frac{r^2}{R^2}}\\\\right )}+\\\\alpha_1 r^2+\\\\alpha_2 r^4+\\\\alpha_3 r^6+\\\\cdots , where the optic axis is presumed to lie in the z direction, and z(r) is the sag‚Äîthe z-component of the displacement of the surface from the vertex, at distance r from the axis. If \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2 are zero, then R is the radius of curvature and K is the conic constant, as measured at the vertex (where r=0).

Vivian Cory and V.C. Griffin. Life Annie Sophie Cory was the youngest of three daughters born to Colonel Arthur Cory and his wife Fanny Elizabeth Griffin. Her older sisters were the poet Adela Florence Nicolson and the editor Isabell Tate, who edited the Sind Gazette in India. She was born in Rawalpindi, Punjab, and was also baptized there on 27 October 1868. Her father was employed in the British army at Lahore, where he was editor of the Lahore arm of The Civil and Military Gazette. Despite her parents' sojourn in India, they eventually returned to England, having maintained ties to their native country. Cory attended London University at nineteen years old in 1888, but did not graduate. In the 1891 England Census, Cory is listed as residing at 35 Tavistock Crescent, Paddington, London with her mother.The National Archives of the UK (TNA); Kew, Surrey, England; Class: RG12; Piece: 11; Folio: 17; Page: 2.

After Arthur's death in 1903, Annie traveled extensively over the Continent with her maternal uncle, Heneage McKenzie Griffin, who was the owner of the Seven-Thirty silver mine in Boulder, Colorado and prominently involved in the mining industry as one of its richest entrepreneurs. They lived together from 1916‚Äì1939, until his death in Italy. Having been bequeathed her uncle's entire fortune, Cory settled in Monte Carlo to live with female friends.

After her death in Milan, Italy, Cory was buried beside her uncle in 1952. She left ¬£87,304 10s 8d in her will.  Writing career  Annie Sophie's most established pseudonym was Victoria Cross. According to The Bookman, she chose this pseudonym, \\"because her initials are V.C. and...she is the descendent of a V.C.\\" (Victoria Cross medal recipient). She had her first piece, Theodora, a Fragment, published in The Yellow Book in 1895. In the same year she wrote The Woman Who Didn't, a response to Grant Allen's book The Woman Who Did. Anna Lombard (1901) was her most successful novel, in which a woman convinces her husband to allow her to continue an extra-marital affair with an Indian. In Six Chapters of a Man's Life (1903), narrated by Cecil, an Englishman working in the East, details his love affair with Theodora, who accompanies him out of love to Port Said, Egypt, disguised for her safety as a male. Once her true sex is revealed to Egyptian males through an impulsive kiss from her lover, Theodora is assaulted and disfigured, returning to Cecil after a week spent as a captive in a brothel. Though their love endures, Theodora drowns herself to escape the shame of her experience.  Reception  While praising Anna Lombard's \\"great success\\" despite its racy themes, William Thomas Stead reviewed its companion volume Life of my Heart (1905) with concern over its clear portrayal of interracial relationships as a positive development. He complained, \\"Victoria Cross has done a daring thing in thus exalting the sacrifice of everything for the love of a bronze archangel in disguise, and if she had not idealised her lover in the latter part of the book, she would have gone perilously near suggesting that the best thing a girl can do is to elope with the best-looking fellow ‚Äì white or coloured makes no matter ‚Äì who crosses her path...But what, in the name of fortune, makes Victoria Cross so crazy about exalting the superiority of natives as husbands over the typical Anglo-Indian?\\" Describing the passion of Cory's plot and language in the recently published novel Tomorrow? (1904), The Navy and Army Illustrated remarks, \\"The image that comes to mind...is that of a falling star; a white-hot thing rushing straight and swift through darkness to be lost in darkness. There is no stopping or turning aside; all is straight, swift motion to the end, and the swifter the star travels through the gloom, the more friction there is, so to speak. Between passion and unhappiness, the whiter and fiercer it glowers...Miss Victoria Cross writes in a white heat of passion.\\" A feminist utopian fantasy, Martha Brown MP (1935), Cory's last novel, describes a future in which women rule England.  Themes  Cory's stories often detail behaviors and desires unusual in the Victorian period such as female cross-dressing, unbridled and unashamed sexual desire, longing for and fear of interracial sexual relationships, and questioning of traditional heterosexual gender roles for men and women.  Legacy  Though her reputation as a writer of New Woman fiction is now more obscure, Cory is remembered chiefly as an author of decadent literature. Fate Knows No Tears (2008) by Mary Talbot Cross is a fictional retelling of the life of Cory's sister Adela as a young woman in India; Annie Sophie appears as a secondary character in the novel.

During the Roman rule it was named Blanda or Blandae. It is known as the \\"Gateway to the Costa Brava\\". Its coast is part of the Costa Brava, which stretches from Blanes up to the French border. The township is 18.29 km¬≤. Blanes is a popular tourist town, and it is known for the Concurs de Focs d'Artifici during the Santa Anna festival; this event includes many fireworks. Other places of interest include botanical gardens, coves, such as the Cala Bona, and beaches which are surrounded by mountains. The population in 2017 was 38,813. History The history of Blanes predates the Roman conquest. Iberian activity has been attested in the area. Romanization of Blanes and its surroundings began around the 3rd century BC. Roman remains of the Blandae site lie nearby. After the rule of the Romans the area shared the fate of much of the Peninsula, being conquered successively by the Goths, the Moors and the Christians shortly after. In the 13th century, after the Christians regained the power, important architectural developments took place in Blanes. Some examples are the palace, Palau Vescomtal, the Esgl√©sia Parroquial church and the city walls. In the 17th century, during the Catalan Revolt (Guerra dels Segadors), Blanes was practically burned to ashes. The Palau Vescomtal was completely destroyed. Another event that affected Blanes was the War of the Spanish Succession. Afterwards the reconstruction of the town and the expansion of agriculture started. Botanical gardens One of the botanical gardens in Blanes is the Marimurtra, which covers almost 15 hectares. It includes over 4000 different plant species and is visited by 300,000 people every year. Another garden is the Pinya de Rosa, which consists of over 7000 different plant species. Fireworks competition Blanes' fireworks. The Festa major or feast of Santa Anna and Sant Joaquim (on the 26th) are usually celebrated in the 3rd or 4th week of July, between the 21st and 27th annually. During the eight days, the major feasts are celebrated as well as the European Concurs de Focs d'Artifici which attracts more than 500,000 visitors. This is an international competition in which various countries from around the world participate. Over 500,000 kg of fireworks are used at each event. Most people watch the fireworks from the beach. The fireworks competition nearly always runs in the last full week of July. 2018 marks the 48th edition of the competition, which will take place Saturday July 21 through Thursday July 26 According to a local radio station, Radio Marina, nearly 1 million people visited the fireworks competition during its 5-day course. Prior to 2012 the competition ran for five consecutive days. At the height of Spain's financial crisis it was decided to drop to four days as a money-saving measure. In 2016 enough sponsors were found to restore the fifth day of the event. Likewise in 2017. Festa menor The Festa menor or the feast of the co-patrons (Sant Bon√≤s and Maximi√†), is traditionally celebrated on the la Nit (Night) de la Caminada Popular in mid-August and has been around for approximately 25 years as of 2012. This is a wholly family-oriented trek which many people walk accompanied by their children, pets etc. It is approximately 8 km long. The reward is a memento and a slice of watermelon. 2008 storm In December 2008 an unusually strong storm struck Blanes' beach. The port of Blanes was hit hardest. The old seawall was not capable of holding off a storm of that magnitude. Many pleasure boats, fishing vessels and tourist ferries were damaged and/or smashed onto the beach. Before the storm, plans had already been made to upgrade the harbor but the repairs were delayed. The poor state of the harbor made it more vulnerable to the storm surges and resulted in the heavy loss in the Boxing Day storm. This storm has been commonly referred to by locals as the worst storm Blanes had seen since the 1950s.

Originally settled as a fishing and whaling community as part of the town of Eastham, Massachusetts, Billingsgate Island was for a long time the site of a lighthouse used as a navigational aid in Cape Cod Bay. Local historians sometimes call it the Atlantis of Cape Cod. The area, which is just south of Great Island at the mouth of Wellfleet Harbor, is now known as Billingsgate Shoal and is visible from mainland Wellfleet at Jeremy Point at low tide. When exposed it is used as a picnic and shellfishing spot; access is by boat. The shoal is frequented by birds, seals, and anglers.  History  The Billingsgate Island lighthouse, 1895 Early European settlers found an abundance of fish in Wellfleet Harbor. They named the area around the harbor Billingsgate after the Billingsgate Fish Market in London. At that time (the 17th century), Billingsgate Island covered an area of . Before that time it was a \\"point\\" or promontory, known as Billingsgate Point, attached to the northern landmass. This point was noted by the Mayflower settlers in Mourt's Relation. Before the end of the 18th century a ditch was dug between the point and the northern landmass and with the action of tidal erosion separated it into its own island. The Punonakanit people, members of the Wampanoag Federation, lived in the area and coexisted peacefully with European settlers. Their population greatly reduced by smallpox, the Punonakanits seem to have died out in the 19th century. At its height in the early 19th century there were over thirty homes on Billingsgate Island; later it even had its own baseball team. The first lighthouse was built in 1822. After an 1855 storm divided the island in half, a second lighthouse was built on higher ground in 1858. The new structure was made of brick with a granite foundation; the foundation stones and a scattering of bricks can still be found on the shoal. The island continued to erode away with heavy flooding of the tower itself in 1873, 1875, and 1882. The lighthouse keeper died in the flooding of 1875. More than 1000 feet of sea wall was built in 1888 to protect the lighthouse, but erosion continued at a fast pace. Early in the 20th century the last families moved off Billingsgate, leaving only the lighthouse keeper and a man who guarded the shellfish beds. Many of the houses on the island were floated across the harbor to Wellfleet on rafts to prevent their loss. (Some are still standing and are known locally as Billingsgate cottages.) The 1858 lighthouse was abandoned in 1915 and destroyed by a storm in December of the same year. The last light tower was torn down in 1922. By the late 1930s or early '40s the island had been torn apart by coastal erosion. What remains is a sand bar south of the end of Jeremy Point in Wellfleet, exposed only at low tide and littered with large granite blocks, a few bricks, and many shells.  In popular culture  The Disappearing Island (2000), a children's book by Corinne Demas, describes a visit to Billingsgate at low tide by a little girl and her grandmother. A number of historical characters in the novel Cape Cod (1991) by William Martin lived on Billingsgate during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. In Billingsgate Shoal (1982), a suspense novel by Rick Boyer, a fishing boat runs aground at Billingsgate and a diver sent to investigate dies mysteriously. Billingsgate Shoal is the first book in Boyer's Doc Adams series; it won an Edgar Award in 1983. Figure Away (1937), a mystery by Phoebe Atwood Taylor, is set in the town of Billingsgate on Cape Cod in 1937. The author mentions the island \\"had for many years rested beneath the waves of Cape Cod Bay\\" in the disclaimer on the copyright page.

He was later promoted to the rank of captain. Like many naval officers, his name was often abbreviated using initials: Pollock. As a young ensign, Pollock served aboard during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After the war, he rose through the ranks, served on several ships, and did important research into wireless communication. In 1917, less than a week before the United States entered World War I, he won a race against a fellow officer to receive the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark, and served as the territory's first acting governor. During the war, he was promoted to captain and a vessel under his command transported 60,000 American soldiers to France, for which he was awarded a Navy Cross. Afterward, he was made the eighth Naval Governor of American Samoa and then the superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory, before retiring in 1927. Early career Originally from Mount Gilead, Ohio, Pollock attended the United States Naval Academy and, as a midshipman, was assigned to and .; He graduated with a rank of ensign in 1893. After graduation, Pollock returned to Ohio and married Beatrice E. Law Hale on December 5. Two weeks later, he was assigned to the cruiser during its initial shake-down. He was subsequently assigned to the gunboat for an expedition to China. He remained in China for two and a half years as part of the Asiatic Squadron, then transferring to before returning home in 1897. On his return home, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War was heating up and he was reassigned to New York, to see service in Cuba and Puerto Rico, eventually taking part in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. In January 1900, he was promoted to lieutenant and assigned to . Over the following year he served on and .; On board Buffalo, he returned to the Asiatic Squadron near China and was finally transferred to , the squadron's flagship. He remained on board Brooklyn, until its return home in May 1902. After a brief leave, Pollock was assigned to the USS Chesapeake (as the watch and division officer), a position he held for more than one year. He was transferred to , serving for another year, and then to Cavite Naval Base.; At Cavite, he was promoted to lieutenant commander in February 1906.; His first duty as a lieutenant commander was on , as the navigator. In 1910, Pollock was reassigned to , where he was promoted to commander in March 1911. On his promotion, Pollock commanded and , before being transferred to the United States Naval Observatory.; During his command of Kearsarge, Pollock briefly commanded for a world-record setting wireless experiment. For this feat, Salem was outfitted with 16 different wireless telegraph technologies and sailed to Gibraltar, with Pollock commanding. On arrival, they tested these technologies and set a world-record for longest wireless telegraph distance, , using a \\"Poulsen Apparatus\\", based on principles by Valdemar Poulsen. Experiments were also conducted to determine wireless characteristics during inclement weather and during both the day and night. In 1916, he was put in command of , the ship on which he had been the navigator. U.S. Virgin Islands St. Thomas, West Indies\\", circa 1900 In the final days before the entrance of the United States into World War I, the US military was concerned that Germany was planning to purchase or seize the Danish West Indies for use as a submarine or zeppelin base. At the time, Charlotte Amalie on Saint Thomas was considered the best port in the Caribbean outside of Cuba, and Coral Bay on Saint John was considered the safest harbor in the area. Although the United States was not yet at war with Germany, the US signed a treaty to purchase the territory from Denmark for 25 million dollars on March 28, 1917. President Woodrow Wilson nominated James Harrison Oliver to be the first military governor. The United States announced plans to build a naval base in the territory to aid in the protection of the Panama Canal. Oliver was unable to travel immediately to the Islands and the honor of being the first Acting Governor of the United States Virgin Islands was decided in an unusual way. Both Pollock, commanding , and B. B. Blerer's were dispatched to the Islands in a race. The commander of the ship that arrived first would officiate at the transfer ceremony and be acting governor. Pollock arrived first and the transfer ceremony took place on March 31, 1917, on Saint Thomas. Blerer officiated at a smaller ceremony on Saint Croix. Present for the handover was the crew of the Danish station cruiser Valkyrien and the former island legislature. The United States declared war on Germany on April 6, less than a week after securing the islands. Oliver was confirmed by Congress on April 20 and relieved Pollock as governor. World War I During the war, Pollock was appointed as captain on , a German cruise liner which was seized by the United States government for use as a military transport ship. She was rechristened George Washington in September 1917 and Pollock was given her command on October 1, 1917. That December, she set out with her first load of troops. During the war, Pollock successfully transported 60,000 American soldiers to France in 18 round trips. In 1918, George Washington was tasked to deliver President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference, though Pollock would not make the trip. He was reassigned on September 29, 1918. While on board George Washington, Pollock and Chaplain Paul F. Bloomhardt edited a daily newspaper. After the war, stories from the paper were assembled and published in 1919 by J. J. Little & Ives co. as Hatchet of the United States Ship \\"George Washington\\". A short review of the work by Outlook magazine called the book \\"readable\\" and \\"admirably illustrated\\". It \\"abounds in clever bits of fun, queer and notable incidents, and sound and patriotic editorials.\\" After the war, he was eventually reassigned to the battleship , to serve in the Pacific fleet. On November 10, 1920, Pollock was awarded a Navy Cross for his services during the war. American Samoa Map of American SamoaOn November 30, 1921, Pollock was transferred from command of Oklahoma to become the Military Governor of American Samoa. Events both personal and political had led to a previous governor, Warren Terhune's, suicide on November 3, 1920, and the appointment of Governor Waldo A. Evans to conduct a court of inquiry into the situation and to restore order. Pollock succeeded Evans, who had successfully restored the government and productivity of the islands after a period of unrest. At this time, American Samoa was administered by a team of twelve officers and a governor, with a total population of approximately 8,000 people. The islands were primarily important due to the excellent harbor at Pago Pago. Beginning in 1920, a Mau movement, from the Samoan word for \\"opposition\\", was forming in American Samoa in protest of several Naval government policies, some of which had been implemented by Terhune but which were not revoked following his death, which natives (and some non-natives) found heavy-handed. The movement itself may have been inspired by a different and older Mau movement in nearby Western Samoa, against the German and then New Zealand colonial powers. Some of the initial grievances of the movement included the quality of roads in the territory, a marriage law which largely forbade natives from marrying non-natives, and a justice system which discriminated against locals in part because laws were not often available in Samoan. In addition, the United States Navy also prohibited an assembly of Samoan chiefs, whom the movement considered the real government of the territory. Surprisingly, the movement had grown to include several prominent officers of former Governor Terhune's staff, including his executive officer. It culminated in a proclamation by Samuel S. Ripley, an American Samoan from an afakasi or mixed-blood Samoan family, with large communal property in the islands, that he was the leader of a legitimate successor government to pre-1899 Samoa. Evans also met with the high chiefs and secured their assent to continued Naval government. Ripley, who had traveled to Washington to meet with Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby, was not permitted by Evans to enter the port at American Samoa and returned to exile in California, where he later became the mayor of Richmond. After being appointed as governor, Pollock's continued the colonization work started by his predecessor. Prior to traveling to the territory, he met with Ripley in San Francisco, California. Although Ripley maintained that American \\"occupation\\" of Samoa was usurpation, he agreed to allow Pollock to govern unfettered and to provide him with copies of his letters. Almost immediately after arriving on the island, Pollock and Secretary of Native Affairs S. D. Hall met with representatives of the Mau, becoming the first governor to do so. Shortly afterwards, some members of the Mau disbanded, though the movement would continue in some form for another 13 years. Pollock's remaining time as governor was less eventful. While exploring Tonga in May 1923, he discovered a turtle which had been branded by Captain Cook on his expedition there in 1773. The turtle was thus known to have lived more than 150 years. He was ordered home on July 26, 1923. United States Naval Observatory Asaph Hall's telescope at the U.S. Naval Observatory Immediately on leaving Samoa, Pollock was appointed superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., replacing outgoing Rear Admiral William D. MacDougal. On August 22, 1924, Mars came within of Earth. The US Naval Observatory made no formal observations of the planet, but Pollock and the son of astronomer Asaph Hall ceremonially re-enacted Hall's 1877 discoveries of the moons Phobos and Deimos with his original telescope. They also made observations to calculate the masses of the two moons. On January 24, 1925, Pollock commanded the dirigible on a flight from Lakehurst, New Jersey, to photograph a solar eclipse from an altitude of . This was the first time an eclipse had been photographed from the air. After retirement Pollock retired from service in 1927 and was replaced as superintendent by Captain Charles F. Freeman. In 1930, Pollock and his wife purchased a summer home in Jamestown, Rhode Island, while continuing to maintain their main residence in Washington, D.C. In 1932, he was made a director of the Jamestown Historical Society. He also became interested in genealogy and published several works on his family's history through the 1930s. He died on June 4, 1943, after a long illness and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on June 7, 1943.

One material (such as AlGaAs) is used for the outer layers (or cladding), and another of smaller band gap (such as GaAs) is used for the inner layer. In this example, there are two AlGaAs-GaAs junctions (or boundaries), one at each side of the inner layer. There must be two boundaries for the device to be a double heterostructure. If there was only one side of cladding material, the device would be a simple heterostructure. The double heterostructure is a very useful structure in optoelectronic devices and has interesting electronic properties. If one of the cladding layers is p-doped, the other cladding layer n-doped and the smaller energy gap semiconductor material undoped, a p-i-n structure is formed. When a current is applied to the ends of the pin structure, electrons and holes are injected into the heterostructure. The smaller energy gap material forms energy discontinuities at the boundaries, confining the electrons and holes to the smaller energy gap semiconductor. The electrons and holes recombine in the intrinsic semiconductor emitting photons. If the width of the intrinsic region is reduced to the order of the de Broglie wavelength, the energies in the intrinsic region no longer become continuous but become discrete. (Actually, they are not continuous but the energy levels are very close together so we think of them as being continuous.) In this situation the double heterostructure becomes a quantum well.

It is based on the 1897 play La Ronde by Arthur Schnitzler (also titled Reigen). It focuses on a series of love affairs among ten characters during the ten different decades of the 20th century. The musical premiered Off- Broadway in 1993, directed and choreographed by Graciela Daniele. Since then it has been performed in London, Sweden, Australia, Germany, and New York.  Adaptation and plot  LaChuisa's musical adaptation follows the structure of Schnitzler's original material closely, often replicating fragments of his dialogue, detailing a daisy chain of sexual encounters and love affairs among ten characters in ten scenes. His innovation, however, was to set each scene of the musical in a different decade of the 20th century and in a non- chronological order, allowing for a huge variety of musical style and pastische ranging from opera to 1970s disco while simultaneously introducing musical and lyrical echoes throughout to tie all the characters and their experiences together.Richards, David. \\"Review/Theater; Would-Be Lovers Find Little but Sex In an Endless Dance\\",The New York Times, January 31, 1994 He also altered the gender of Schnitzler's \\"Little Miss\\" to the sexually ambiguous \\"Young Thing\\" to introduce a homosexual element into his century of sexual congress.

Role in the play Friar Laurence is a friar who plays the part of a wise adviser to Romeo and Juliet, along with aiding in major plot developments. Alone, he foreshadows the later, tragic events of the play with his soliloquy about plants and their similarities to humans. When Romeo requests the Friar marry him to Juliet, he is shocked, because only days before, Romeo had been infatuated with Rosaline, a woman who did not return his love. Nevertheless, Friar Laurence decides to marry Romeo and Juliet in the attempt to stop the civil feud between the Capulets and the Montagues.Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 2.3.26-31, 2.3.98-99 When Romeo is banished for killing Tybalt and flees to Mantua, Friar Laurence attempts to help the two lovers get back together using a potion to fake Juliet's death.Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 4.1.69-77, 4.1.91-122 The friar sends a letter to Romeo explaining the situation, but it does not reach him because the people of Mantua suspect the messenger came from a house infected with the plague,Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 5.2.5-12 and the Friar is unable to arrive at the Capulet's monument in time. Romeo kills Count Paris,Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 5.2.72-73 whom he finds weeping near Juliet's corpse, then commits suicide,Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 5.2.119-120 by drinking poison that he bought from an impoverished apothecary,Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 4.5.66-79 over what he thinks is Juliet's dead body. Friar Laurence arrives just as Juliet awakes from her chemically induced slumber.Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 5.2.148-50 He urges Juliet not to be rash and to join a society of nuns,Shakespeare: Romeo and Juliet; 5.3.156-164 but he hears a noise from outside and then flees from the tomb. Juliet then kills herself with Romeo's dagger, completing the tragedy. The Friar is forced to return to the tomb, where he recounts the entire story to Prince Escalus and all the Montague's and Capulet's. As he finishes, the prince proclaims, \\"We have still known thee for a holy man.\\" Metre Shakespeare uses a variety of poetic forms throughout the play. He begins with a 14-line prologue in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet, spoken by a Chorus. Most of Romeo and Juliet is, however, written in blank verse and much of it in strict iambic pentameter, with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare's later plays.Halio (1998: 51). In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses sermon and sententiae forms and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech.Halio (1998: 51). Portrayals In 1968 the part of Friar Lawrence was played by Milo O'Shea in Romeo and Juliet. In 1996, the role was played by Pete Postlethwaite in Romeo + Juliet.

He has been a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 2001,http://www.nasonline.org/member- directory/members/1759.html and was awarded with the Chilean National Prize for Nature Sciences (Chile) in 1992. Early life Jorge Allende was born in Cartago, Costa Rica, son of Octavio Allende Echeverr√≠a, Chilean Consul in the city of Puntarenas, and Amparo Rivera Ortiz, a Costa Rican artist. Because of his father's job as a diplomat, he spent his childhood years between Costa Rica, Chile and the United States. He finished high school in a Jesuit School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where his father was appointed as the Chilean Consul. Subsequently, he studied at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He obtained the Bachelor of Science in chemistry degree in 1957. Career He carried out his doctoral studies at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, obtaining his Ph.D. in 1961 under the tutorship of Prof. F.M. Richards. He did post doctoral work with Prof. Fritz Lipmann at Rockefeller University and with Marshall Warren Nirenberg at NIH. During the 1960s, his research was focused on protein synthesis, a field in which he made crucial contributions. In the 1970s he was a pioneer in studying the mechanism of hormonal induction of oocyte maturation. His later research is focused in two ubiquitous protein kinases, CK1 and CK2, involved in the phosphorylation of key cellular proteins. He devoted much of his life to organizing activities for the scientific integration in Latin America especially through organizing series of training courses in molecular biology techniques, and through the creation of the Latin American Network of Biological Sciences. In recent years, Doctor Allende has been an promoter of science education through his personal commitment in several projects, like the Science Education Inquiry Based program, funded by the University of Chile, and through his participation in the Allende-Connelly Foundation, founded by him and his wife. Though he retired from active science in 2009, he remains a professor at the Faculty of Medicine. He was also Research Vice President of the University of Chile. He published his autobiography in 2010. Personal life He married Catherine Connelly (also a biochemist) in Holyoke, Massachusetts, On September 16, 1961. He raised a family of four children: Miguel Luis, Juan Ignacio, Jorge Eduardo and Maria Amparo and has 13 grandchildren. With his wife, Catherine Connelly, he was on sabbatical at the University of California at San Diego, when the 1973 coup in Chile took place. He returned to Chile in May 1974 and was one of the main defenders of the University of Chile's autonomy, endangered by the military intervention in academic life. In December 1975 he co-signed, with other academics, a letter entitled \\"University under surveillance\\" opposing military intervention in the University of Chile. The letter was written by philosopher Jorge Millas and published in the newspaper \\"El Mercurio\\". The letter was the first appearance of a public statement by a group of academics who criticized the handling of the University of Chile by the military government.

The observatory was built in 1442 during the Ming dynasty, and expanded during the Qing. It received major reorganization and many new, more accurate instruments from Europeans (Jesuits) in 1644. As one of the oldest observatories in the world, the Beijing Ancient Observatory grounds cover an area of 10,000 square meters. The observatory itself is located on a 40 by 40 wide meter on a 15 meter tall brick tower, an extant portion of the old Ming dynasty era city wall that once encircled Beijing. Several of the bronze astronomical instruments are on the platform, and other armillary spheres, sundials, and other instruments are located nearby at ground level. It is operated as a museum in affiliation with the Beijing Planetarium. History An image of the observatory after reorganization by the Jesuits The layout of the observatory It was said that in 1227, the Jin dynasty transferred the ancient astronomical instruments from Kaifeng to the first observatory in Beijing. In 1279, the succeeding Mongols under Kublai Khan built a new observatory just north of the current observatory. Kublai Khan made his chief adviser of hydraulics, mathematics and astronomy, Guo Shoujing, director of the observatory in 1283 after the death of Guo's friend and predecessor Zhang Wenqian. After the Mongols, Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding Ming Emperor, transferred the instruments from Beijing to Nanjing. When the Yongle Emperor came to power, he had craftsmen make copies of the instruments in Nanjing and sent them to the Beijing observatory. The current observatory was completed in 1442. It assisted the Ming and Qing astronomers in their observation reports for the Emperor. As he was considered the \\"Son of Heaven\\", the movements of the heavenly bodies were an important affair. Another function was to assist sea navigation, with Muslim scholars recruited for their expertise in the area. In the mid-17th century, after winning an astronomy contest, the Jesuit Ferdinand Verbiest was awarded complete charge of the astronomy observatory by the emperor. In 1673, he supervised the rebuilding of some of the instruments. He and other Jesuits helped to further develop the observations of the stars and the planets. During the later stages of the Qing dynasty, members of the Eight-Nation Alliance looted some of the instruments. However, as World War I drew to a close, the instruments were returned to China by the French and German governments. An early seismograph of Zhang Heng's design used to be housed at the observatory. Some of the instruments from the Ming era are now at Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing. Access and nearby attractions The Beijing Ancient Observatory is located just south of Jianguomen in Dongcheng District and can be accessed by Lines 1 and 2 of the Beijing Subway to Jianguomen station (Exit C) and bus routes 25, 39, 43, 44, 52, 122, 434, 637, 638, 750 and Áâπ2 to Jianguomen South (Âª∫ÂõΩÈó®Ê°•Âçó).

The school consolidated St. Cyprian School with St. Martin School in Sunnyvale, CA to form the Catholic Academy of Sunnyvale.  History  In 1966, the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, from Pennsylvania, came to St. Cyprian Parish at the request of Rev. John Gallagher. The IHM community provided the pastor with three sisters to open the school in September 1968, with an enrollment of sixty-two students in Grades 1‚Äì3. Adding a new grade each year, the first graduation was held in 1974. In 1985, a multi-purpose hall was constructed and, in 1986, a library was added to this facility and the Church sacristy was converted for use as a Kindergarten. The Extended Care program was begun in 1990 and in the fall of 1991, the outdoor eating area for the students had concrete padding installed. Art classes with specialists were also begun. A major facilities expansion was completed in 2002, including a new kindergarten room, library, science lab, computer lab, counseling and tutoring rooms, and extended care facility. In addition, a new parish center and a renovated gymnasium complete the major overhaul of the school. Curriculum The school provides a comprehensive curriculum for grades K-8 with an emphasis on core subjects including Religion, Mathematics, Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science. In addition, enrichment courses include Computer Education, Art, Music, Band, and Physical Educations. Students in upper grades experience departmentalized teaching with an emphasis on high school preparation. This includes studying a foreign language and learning how to take lecture notes.

They were normally distinct from light cavalry, who were intended for use in scouting, screening, and skirmishing the enemy.Carey, Allfree and Cairns, pp. 65-66  History of heavy cavalry = Persians  Alexander the Great on horseback Iranian tribes such as the Massagetae were believed to be the originator of the class of heavy cavalry known as cataphract. During the time of Achaemenid Persia cavalry was the elite arm of service (as was the case in most civilizations), and many Persian horsemen such as the bodyguard unit of Cyrus the Younger were rather heavily armoured by the standards of the era. By the time of Alexander's invasion cataphract units with both men and beasts being fully encased in armour were already in use by the Persians. The Parthian Empire of Ancient Iran marks an early recorded utilization of armoured cavalry in warfare, and are specifically believed to have given rise to the tradition of very heavily armoured cataphract lancers. These had a distinct role from ordinary heavy cavalry and were primarily used as an elite assault force, to pummel infantry formations into submission, or even acted in a dual-purpose role as horse archers and cataphracts. Ammianus Marcellinus, a Roman general and historian who served in the army of Constantius II in Gaul and Persia, fought against the Persians under Julian the Apostate and took part in the retreat of his successor, Jovian. He describes the Persian cataphract as: The oldest known relief of a heavily armoured cavalryman, from the Sasanian Empire, at Taq-i Bostan, near Kermanshah, Iran (4th century)  Western Europeans  The Celts of western and central Europe are among the first peoples in the region known to have made use of heavy cavalry. It is generally accepted that the Celts were the originators of mail armour, the earliest find being from a Celtic burial in Ciumesti in modern-day Romania. Mail and occasionally bronze armour were restricted generally to the nobility and chieftains of Celtic society, and the additional cost of maintaining a horse trained for the din and chaos of battle ensured that those men who could afford a full panoply of mail and a good quality warhorse were highly motivated, not merely by their status but by the emphasis that Celtic society placed on personal success and courage. At the Battle of Carrhae, Gallic auxiliary cavalry met with the completely armoured Parthian cataphracts. Despite being outmatched the Gauls fought fiercely and well before being annihilated in a protracted melee. The small size of Celtic horses meant that the Celtic heavy cavalry of north-western and central Europe appear to have been employed as heavy skirmisher cavalry, rather than the shock cavalry of the Middle East and North Africa, the heavy cavalry of Gaul and Celtiberia being widely regarded as some of the finest horsemen of the ancient world. The Gauls were known to be able to hurl their javelins while retreating, and to use a system whereby a cavalryman was supported by two other men with fresh horses who could resupply him with missiles. For close combat the main weapon was the spear, around in length with a leaf-bladed head, and a heavy wooden shield with an iron spindle-type boss. The most prestigious weapon was the sword, a blade ranging anywhere from in length. Celtic swords were typically of good quality, with some being of such quality that archeologists have classed them as being equal to modern, high-quality steel replicas. The heavy cavalry of the Celtiberi, widely employed by the Carthaginians, included men who may have ridden on mail-armoured horses. Known to the Romans as \\"Lanciarii\\" (not to be confused with the spear-armed infantry of the Eastern Roman Empire), they are represented in several Iberian carvings of the period. They may have carried the \\"soliferrum\\", the all-iron javelin unique to Iberia, in addition to a spear and shield and a Celtic-style longsword or an Iberian falcata. Together with the Gallic nobles, it was likely these horsemen who at the Battle of Cannae charged and then broke the Roman and Italian cavalry.  Greeks  The ancient Greeks called armoured cavalry Kataphraktos (pl. Kataphraktoi) which translated means roughly \\"covered, protected\\" or \\"armoured\\". The term was later borrowed by the Romans (the Latin variant in the Roman Empire being Cataphractarii) and until the Middle Ages in Europe, continued to be used to designate armoured cavalry. However, as with other types of cavalry, heavy cavalry was not employed in any significant capacity in wars between the Greek city states until later, mainly due to the prevalence of hoplite warfare as well as the mountainous terrain of Central Greece. The lack of suitable grassland and excess grain supply necessary for the production of good cavalry mounts was also crippling to the establishment of an effective cavalry force, the noted Greek mercenary and writer Xenophon once saying that a horse farm was the most expensive type of establishment to keep running. The exception was in Northern Greece, where large flat areas of grassland made cavalry much more practical. Eventually, encounters with Persian cavalry led the Greeks to create their own cavalry arm, the Hippeis, composed mostly of upper-class citizens who could afford to maintain a horse. While cavalry played an increasingly greater part in Greek warfare, its roles were generally restricted to scouting, skirmishing and pursuit. However, by the end of the Peloponnesian War, heavy cavalry charges had started to play an increasingly important part in Ancient Greek warfare, with the Battle of Delium showing how their intervention could turn the tide of a battle. The city-state of Thebes was particularly famous for its cavalry, with the famed Theban commander Epaminondas using his heavy horse to great effect both at Leuctra as well as Mantineia to rout the Spartan cavalry, and in the process disrupting the legendary Spartan phalanx as well, helping his own hoplites win the battle. The development of the saddle as well as increasingly larger horse breeds led to creation of the Macedonian Companion cavalry developed during the reign of Philip II of Macedon, likely based on the Theban model, as he had spent his youth in the house of Epaminondas as a hostage. This force was later used with great effect by his son, Alexander the Great. In both role and equipment, the Companions was the first cavalry force that was known to represent archetypal heavy cavalry. The Companion cavalry, or Hetairoi, were the elite arm of the Macedonian army, and have been regarded as the best cavalryDiodorus Siculus, Arrian in the ancient world. In the aftermath of the Macedonian Empire, the Diadochi, successor states created by Alexander the Great's generals, continued the usage of heavy cavalry in their own forces. The Seleucids in particular introduced the use of cataphracts into Western warfare, having learned the practice of completely armouring both man and horse from Iranian tribes encountered during the wars of Alexander the Great.  Middle Ages  A recreation of a medieval joust between heavily armoured knights at a modern Renaissance fair = Advent of the stirrup = The stirrup, which gives greater stability to a rider, has been described as one of the most significant inventions in the history of warfare, prior to gunpowder. As a tool allowing expanded use of horses in warfare, the stirrup is often called the third revolutionary step in equipment, after the chariot and the saddle. The basic tactics of mounted warfare were significantly altered by the stirrup. A rider supported by stirrups was less likely to fall off while fighting, and could deliver a blow with a weapon that more fully employed the weight and momentum of horse and rider. Among other advantages, stirrups provided greater balance and support to the rider, which allowed the knight to use a sword more efficiently without falling, especially against infantry adversaries. The metal stirrup was invented in 4th century China,\\"The invention and influences of stirrup\\" and spread to Europe by the late 6th or early 7th century, primarily due to invaders from Central Asia, such as the Avars.See George T. Dennis (ed.), Maurice's Strategikon, p. XVI; for contrary views, Lynn White, Jr., Medieval Technology and Social Change, Oxford University Press, 1964, notes, p. 144. By the 8th century the stirrup was in widespread European use,Curta p.315 and later helped stimulate the creation of early knightly classes in the Carolingian empire. It has controversially been argued that the stirrup was responsible for the development of feudalism, though this is not fully accepted. = Byzantines = Byzantine cataphracts were a much feared force in their heyday. The army of Emperor Nicephorus II, the 'Pale Death of the Saracens' himself, relied on its cataphracts as its nucleus, coupling cataphract archers with cataphract lancers to create a self- perpetuating 'hammer blow' tactic where the cataphract lancers would charge again and again until the enemy broke, all the while supported by cataphract archers. Contemporary depictions however imply that they were not as completely armoured as earlier Roman and Sassanid types‚Äîhorse armour is noticeably absent. Byzantine cataphracts of the 10th century were drawn from the ranks of the middle class landowners through the theme system, providing the Byzantine Empire with a motivated and professional force. An experimental type of cataphract was brought to the fore in the 10th and 11th centuries known as the klibanaphoros, \\"bearer of klibanion\\"‚Äînamed after the clibanarius and a throwback to the very heavily armoured cavalry of earlier days. However, the traditional view is that after the loss of prestige, men and material and the horse-rearing plains of Anatolia after they lost the decisive Battle of Manzikert to lighter Turk cavalry, they slowly dropped out of use. But according to J. Birkenmeier in \\"The development of the Komnenian army: 1081‚Äì1180\\", units of 'Kataphraktoi' (cataphracts) were still being used during the 12th century. The Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine Empire during that century created a new kind of Byzantine army, which is known as the Komnenian army. Yet it seems that the cataphract was eventually superseded by other types of armoured cavalry. The emperor Manuel I Komnenos, for example, re-equipped his elite cavalry in the style of western knights. It is difficult to determine when exactly the cataphract saw his final day. After all, cataphracts and knights both fulfilled a similar role on the medieval battlefield, and the armoured knight survived well into the modern age. The Byzantines called all heavy shock cavalry kataphraktoi. The Byzantine army maintained units of heavily armoured cavalrymen up to its last years, while neighbouring Bulgars, Serbs, Russian states and other eastern European peoples emulated Byzantine military equipment. = Knights = Dipold of Acerra, an early 13th-century knight, when the knight was undisputed master of the battlefield In the early Middle Ages the rank of knight was loosely defined. In late Carolingian France (10th century) persons occupying this role were known by the Latin term miles (plur. milites). This term designated a professional fighting man in the emerging feudal system. Many were as poor as the peasant class. However, over time, as this class of fighter became more prominent in post-Carolingian France, they became wealthier and began to hold and inherit land. Eventually fighting on horseback became synonymous with the elite warrior caste. From the 12th century on, the term became associated to cavalry and nobility in general, and thus to the earlier Roman equestrian class (see esquire) as well as the Greek Hippei class. As the expense of equipping and maintaining a knight's equipment was beyond the ability of the primitive medieval state to support, the feudal system became more important as a means of securing the loyalty of knights to the king. Knighthood was a hereditary title, and was usually passed on by a father to his eldest son. All prospective knights were trained from childhood in the knightly traditions of chivalry as well as war. At the age of six, they first became a servant, or page, in another knight's or lord's household, where they learned etiquette as well as basic combat, and after a few years they became a squire, an apprentice and personal assistant to a fully fledged knight, responsible for maintaining the knight's horse and equipment, as well as arming him for battle. At this point he could choose to remain a squire or become a knight, though many remained a squire due to the restrictions and expense of becoming a knight. A squire was made a knight by his superior lord or king through a ceremony known as \\"dubbing\\", swearing allegiance to his feudal masters, charity, and protection of other Christians, as well as to respect the law of the land. = Africa and Asia = Mongol heavy cavalry in battle (13th‚Äì14th century) Muslim military advances in Sub-Saharan Africa relied heavily on armoured cavalry, playing a similar role to that in medieval Europe. In China, heavy cavalry was developed during the Han dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD), with armoured lancers becoming widespread during the Western Han era. Armoured cavalry, with both soldier and steed clad in complete armour, were employed in the late Han dynasty, and became widespread in the 4th century AD, where it was the main striking force of the armies of the Northern dynasties of China (4th century to 6th century.) During the Tang dynasty (618 to 907) the importance of infantry and lighter-armed cavalry and infantry increased while that of the armoured cavalry decreased, with horse armour seldom used. However, armoured cavalry were again used by the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) and its enemies, including the Jin, Xi Xia, Mongols, and Khitans. In Korea, the earliest evidence of armoured cavalry is a mid-4th century AD mural of the Goguryeo era (37 BC‚Äì668 AD). Lamellar armour was used for both men and horses, with the soldiers carrying lances. Another Goguryeo-era mural shows an armoured cavalryman wielding his lance using both hands, unlike the couched- lance used by medieval European knights. During the Koryo dynasty (918‚Äì1392) barding (horse-armour) was still used, but the number of barded heavy cavalry remains unknown. By the early years of the Chosun dynasty (1392‚Äì1897) barding was no longer used, and the horseman's main weapon was the bow, with lances and other close-combat weapons seldom used. However, starting from the 17th century at least, the Korean cavalry began to carry two-handed flails along with bows.  Renaissance to 20th century  Armoured cavalry, in the form of the gendarme, was at its highest as a proportion of the total number of combatants in many Renaissance armies, especially in France. Other Western European states also used heavy cavalry very often, such as Spain and the Holy Roman Empire in the Italian Wars. North-Central and Eastern Europe saw the emergence of winged hussars that proved a decisive factor in the territorial gains of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and in its wars with Sweden, Muscovy and the Ottoman Turks. Later, the cuirassier was the main form of heavy cavalry, beginning in 1484 with the 100-man strong regiments of Austrian kyrissers for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stratioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian hussars and German mercenary cavalry units. A 1551 Venetian document describes that part of the English cavalry was armed in the Albanian fashion. = Thirty Years' War = Christian the Younger of Brunswick in the armour of a cuirassier A re-enactor dressed as a Winged Hussar, who served as the heavy cavalry of the Polish Commonwealth Cuirassiers played a very large role in the Thirty Years' War and the related Eighty Years' War, particularly under the House of Orange and Duchy of Savoy. They represented the last gasp of full plate armour on the battlefield. They would have worn very distinctive plate armour, which typically featured very long and wide tassets, articulated leg protectors which would extend all the way from the breastplate down to the knees. The head would typically have been protected by a fully enclosed burgonet, of which the \\"Savoyard\\" style was one notable type. This rounded helmet, frequently featuring a stylized or grotesque face mask, was nicknamed \\"Totenkopf\\" or \\"Death's Head\\" by the German soldiers who encountered cuirassiers so equipped. The cuirassier's armour would have been exceptionally heavy and thick‚Äîsometimes up to thirty-six kilogrammes (eighty pounds)‚Äîand would be expected to stop a bullet. A regiment of cuirassiers killed the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus at the 1632 Battle of L√ºtzen. The French introduced their own cuirassiers in 1666. However, the amount of armour worn by the cavalry of the European armies in battle had been substantially reduced, with even the cuirass often worn only to the front. = After the Thirty Years' War = French cuirassiers, 19th century By 1705, the Holy Roman Emperor's personal forces in Austria included twenty cuirassier regiments. Imperial Russia formed its own cuirassier regiments in 1732, including a Leib Guards regiment. The Russian cuirassier units took part in the Russo-Turkish War. Cuirassiers played a prominent role in the armies of Frederick the Great of Prussia and of Napoleon I of France. The latter increased the number of French cuirassier regiments to fourteen by the end of his reign, although they gradually declined in importance as the firepower and accuracy of the muskets and rifles of the infantrymen increased. The cavalry still remained battle-deciders though, with Napoleon maintaining several reserve cavalry corps to be employed at the decisive moment in battle to finally break the enemy formations with a devastating charge. = Apache Wars = From roughly 1650 to 1820, Spanish heavy cavalry fought Apache warriors in North America. Several small battles occurred; most of the time the Spanish lancers were outnumbered severely but still managed to defeat Apache armies, hundreds of men strong. The climax of these conflicts occurred in the region of present-day Tucson, Arizona, in the United States in the late 18th century in Spanish Arizona. = Modern era = The last time cavalry of both sides wore a cuirass in battle was during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. The Imperial German and Russian cuirassiers subsequently discarded this armour for all but parade purposes but the twelve regiments of French heavy cavalry still in existence in 1914 wore their cuirasses on active service during the opening stages of World War I.John Keegan, page 85 The First World War, Although some heavy cavalry regiments have remained into the 21st century, their large mounts are today used solely for ceremonial duties, such as those of the Household Cavalry in the United Kingdom. Today, the main battle tank fills the niche of heavy cavalry.

The mission of RightRides is to build safer communities by ending gender-based harassment and sexual assault. Their goal is to eradicate violence against girls, women, and LGBTQ individuals by mobilizing vulnerable communities through direct service and intervention, safety education, grassroots organizing, and policy advocacy. History RightRides for Women's Safety developed its flagship free, late- night, safe car rides program (called RightRides) in 2004 as a community-based response after founders Oraia Reid and Consuelo Ruybal learned of increasing sexual assaults on women walking home by themselves late at night in Williamsburg and Greenpoint, two North Brooklyn neighborhoods. Outraged by the attacks in their community, Reid and Ruybal mobilized to combat the threat to women‚Äôs safety. Using their own car, the pair began offering cisgender and transgender women a free ride home on Saturday nights. Initially, RightRides operated in just three neighborhoods‚ÄîWilliamsburg, Greenpoint, and the Lower East Side‚Äîbut securing a vehicle sponsorship with Zipcar in 2006 enabled RightRides to expand the program significantly by enlisting community members to volunteer to operate the donated vehicles and implementing a dispatch system to coordinate the cars. RightRides now operates in 45 neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx every Friday and Saturday night from 11:59 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. transporting all female-identified and all LGBTQ people home safely. RightRides motto is: \\"Because Getting Home Safely Shouldn't Be A Luxury.\\" No payment is accepted in the car, not even tips. Nearly 40% of riders work late-night shifts, and 81% earning $35,000 or less per year. Riders represent the diversity of New Yorkers. A volunteer driving team is composed of a Driver and a Navigator. One member of this team must identify as female for the comfort of the riders, and all volunteers must pass a criminal background check. Driving teams wait to make sure riders are safely inside their building before driving away. RightRides has safely ushered over 6,000 riders home, to date. In 2009, RightRides co-founded New Yorkers for Safe Transit, the only coalition in New York City working to end gender-based discrimination, harassment and assault in the city‚Äôs mass transit system. This community organizing effort came as a result of teaming up with Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer to produce Hidden in Plain Sight: Sexual Harassment and Assault in the New York City Subway System,Hidden in Plain Sight: Sexual Harassment and Assault in the New York City Subway System a report on the frequency of gender-based violence in the city‚Äôs mass transit system, which found that 63% of respondents reported having been sexually harassed and 10% sexually assaulted in the New York City Subway system. In 2009, Oraia Reid testified at a joint New York City Council hearing called by Committees on Women's Issues, Public Safety and Transportation to discuss subway safety. In 2010 Mandy Van Deven testified on behalf of RightRides at the first-ever New York City Council hearing on street harassment, called by Council Member Julissa Ferreras and covered by over 200 media outlets worldwide. Awards and recognition For its grassroots efforts, RightRides has been honored with several awards, including a Proclamation from the New York City Mayor's Office announcing December 12, 2005 as \\"RightRides For Women's Safety Day,\\" presented by New York City Human Rights Commissioner Patricia Gatling. In February 2006, RightRides received the Susan B. Anthony award for excellence in furthering women's equality by the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women. In March 2006, New York City Council Member Diana Reyna presented RightRides with the annual Pacesetter Award for capturing the spirit of New York City through their volunteer efforts. In 2007, Oraia Reid and Consuelo Ruybal were named New Yorkers of the Week by NY1 News. In 2010, Oraia Reid was named by Metro News as a NYC Local Hero and was also recognized by the National Association for Female Executives as a Woman of Excellence for her service to NYC. RightRides has been covered by national and international news.

Early life and education Holding was born in Melbourne and educated at Trinity Grammar School, Victoria and the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in law. Early politics Holding joined the Labor Party as a student, and during the Labor Party split of 1954‚Äì55, during which he supported the party's federal leader, Dr H.V. Evatt, he was Secretary of the Young Labor organisation in Victoria. As a young lawyer he was a prominent campaigner against the death penalty and in favour of the rights of indigenous Australians. His law firm, Holding, Ryan and Redlich, became one of the leading industrial law firms in Melbourne. State politics In 1962 Holding was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Richmond, which had previously been held for many years by mostly conservative Catholic Labor Party members, although his immediate predecessor, Frank Crean, was a Presbyterian. Clive Stoneham, who had been ALP leader from 1958 onwards, was no match for the dominant Liberal Premier, Sir Henry Bolte. After Labor suffered its fifth consecutive defeat at the 1967 election, Holding took over from Stoneham as party leader. Although Holding was in some ways a social radical, he was opposed to the left-wing faction which had taken control of the Victorian Labor Party following the 1955 split, which had seen many right- wing members expelled. In particular, he supported government aid for non- government, including Catholic, schools, which the left bitterly opposed. He was a supporter of the reforming federal Labor leader, Gough Whitlam, who was determined to reform the Victorian branch as a precondition of winning a federal election. He was also a close ally of the ACTU president, Bob Hawke. During the 1970 state election campaign, which some commentators suggested Labor could win as a result of voter fatigue with the Liberal government after its 15 years in power, Holding campaigned on the new federal policy of supporting state aid to non-government schools. The week before the election, the left-wing state president, George Crawford and state secretary, Bill Hartley, issued a statement saying that a Victorian Labor government would not support state aid. As a result, Whitlam refused to campaign for Labor in Victoria, and Holding was forced to repudiate his own policy. Ultimately, the Bolte government was re‚Äìelected, but Holding did manage a six-seat swing. This episode led directly to federal intervention in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. In 1971 the left-wing leadership was overturned by the Labor National Executive and allies of Whitlam, Hawke and Holding took control. The left then formed an organised faction, the Socialist Left, to agitate for socialist policies, supported by some unions. Bolte retired in 1972 and was replaced by Dick Hamer, a considerably more progressive Liberal from Melbourne. Hamer represented such a sharp change from his staunchly conservative predecessor that he was able to brand himself as a reformist leader even though the Liberals had been in office for 17 years. Holding was unable to get the better of Hamer, and was roundly defeated at the 1973 and 1976 state elections. The surge in support for federal Labor, which saw Whitlam elected Prime Minister in 1972, was not reflected in Victorian state politics. Federal politics Holding resigned as Opposition Leader after the 1976 election to transfer to federal politics. In 1977 he was elected to the House of Representatives for the comfortably safe seat of Melbourne Ports, which then included Holding's base in Richmond. He defeated Simon Crean, son of Holding's predecessor, Frank Crean, to win Labor pre-selection. After the 1980 election, at which Hawke was elected to federal Parliament, Holding emerged as Hawke's key \\"numbers man\\" in his campaign to become leader of the federal Labor Party. Minister When Hawke was elected Prime Minister at the 1983 election, he insisted that Holding be included in the ministry, and gave him the difficult but symbolically important portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. Holding was a strong supporter of land rights for Indigenous Australians, and his main ambition as minister was to bring in legislation for uniform national land rights, which the 1967 amendment to the Australian Constitution would have permitted. But the Labor Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, strongly objected to such a step, which would have upset the powerful mining and pastoral industries in his state. After heavy lobbying from Burke, Hawke pressured Holding to drop the proposal. In 1987 Holding was shifted to the portfolio of Minister for Employment Services and Youth Affairs. In 1988 he became Minister for Transport and Communications Support. A few months later he was promoted to Cabinet and made Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, but later in the year there was another reshuffle and he was demoted to the Arts and Territories portfolio, outside Cabinet. He held this post until the 1990 election, when he was dropped from the ministry. Backbench Melbourne Ports was significantly altered ahead of the 1990 election. Long one of the safest Labor seats in the nation, it was pushed slightly to the east to take in some wealthier, Liberal-leaning suburbs. This knocked Holding's majority from a reasonably safe 9.9 percent to a marginal 3.9 percent. Nonetheless, Holding was re‚Äìelected with a small swing against him. He remained in the House as a backbencher until his retirement in 1998.

Named for its current owner, it was previously known as the Qwest Building and the Northwestern Bell Telephone Building. Originally standing 346 feet (105 m) tall, the structure grew to 416 feet (127 m) with the addition of a microwave antenna \\"crown\\" in 1958, followed by the addition of a second tier of microwave antennas in 1972. It was the second-tallest building in the city after the slightly older Foshay Tower for many years, and stands slightly taller than the tower of its neighbor, Minneapolis City Hall. The building has many small details on the exterior, including electric bolts and a stylized bird above the main entrance. When under construction, an unusual move was made by stripping a 1920s Northwestern Bell building on the site and the steel frame was incorporated into the new structure. The building was expanded on its west side in the 1940s. History Telephone service in Minneapolis first began in 1878 with a switchboard located in the old city hall, located in the Gateway area, and serving 11 phones. Demand increased rapidly, and in 1885, the central office had 775 lines and was moved to the second floor of the city hall building. In 1890, the office outgrew its quarters in the city hall, with 1700 lines, so it moved to a building on Fourth Street between Nicollet and Marquette Avenues. Demand increased to 3000 subscribers in 1897, so a three- story building was built at Third Avenue South and Fifth Street. In 1908, two five-story wings were built. Additional central office buildings were established outside downtown Minneapolis. By 1920, there were 96,000 telephones in 14 central office buildings. In 1920, a nine-story building was built at Third Avenue South and Fifth Street. That building was planned with the possibility that it would be merged into a larger structure. In 1929, with still more expansion, six floors were leased in an outside building. Finally, the current building was built, after a study of future needs. It was decided to add some space for the Minnesota administrative offices of the phone company, in a decision that was both economical and architecturally pleasing. When built, the building had its business office on the first floor, with space for customers to transact business with the phone company, public telephone booths, and rooms for long-distance calls. The next 12 floors contained telephone equipment, such as long-distance switchboards, other special switchboards, and dial central office equipment for the MAin, ATlantic, and BRidgeport central offices. There were also breakroom facilities and a lunch room for telephone operators who were off duty. The 14th, 25th, and 26th floors were mechanical floors. Finally, a tower on the 15th through 24th floors housed administrative offices of the telephone company. There were also three basement floors with power and heating equipment, along with cable vaults. The building measured above street level, in the basements, and had 26 stories. Many of these stories were somewhat taller than those in office buildings due to the size of central office equipment. The building had of floor space, and housed about 1,000 employees. Minnesota construction materials were used in the building, with a granite exterior from Morton on the first floor and limestone from Kasota on subsequent stories. Cement from Duluth and steel from the Mesabi Range were used for interior construction. The building was designed by Minnesota architects, built by Minneapolis contractors, and supplied with other materials by Minnesota firms.

These algebras were introduced as the first concrete examples of a separable infinite simple C*-algebra, meaning as a Hilbert space, \\\\mathcal{O}_n is isometric to the sequence space > l^2(\\\\mathbb{N}) and it has no nontrivial closed ideals. These algebras are fundamental to the study of simple infinite C*-algebras since any such algebra contains, for any given n, a subalgebra that has \\\\mathcal{O}_n as quotient.  Definitions  Let n ‚â• 2 and \\\\mathcal{H} be a separable Hilbert space. Consider the C*-algebra \\\\mathcal{A} generated by a set :: { S_i }_{i=1}^n of isometries (i.e. S_i^*S_i=1 ) acting on \\\\mathcal{H} satisfying :: \\\\sum_{i=1}^n S_i S_i^* = I. This universal C*-algebra is called the Cuntz algebra, denoted by \\\\mathcal{O}_n . A simple C*-algebra is said to be purely infinite if every hereditary C*-subalgebra of it is infinite. \\\\mathcal{O}_n is a separable, simple, purely infinite C*-algebra. Any simple infinite C*-algebra contains a subalgebra that has \\\\mathcal{O}_n as a quotient.  Properties = Classification  The Cuntz algebras are pairwise non- isomorphic, i.e. \\\\mathcal{O}_n and \\\\mathcal{O}_m are non-isomorphic for n ‚â† m. The K0 group of \\\\mathcal{O}_n is \\\\mathbb{Z}/n, the cyclic group of order n ‚àí 1\\\\. Since K0 is a functor, \\\\mathcal{O}_n and \\\\mathcal{O}_m are non- isomorphic.  Relation between concrete C*-algebras and the universal C*-algebra  Theorem. The concrete C*-algebra \\\\mathcal{A} is isomorphic to the universal C*-algebra \\\\mathcal{L} generated by n generators s1... sn subject to relations si*si = 1 for all i and ‚àë sisi* = 1. The proof of the theorem hinges on the following fact: any C*-algebra generated by n isometries s1... sn with orthogonal ranges contains a copy of the UHF algebra \\\\mathcal{F} type n‚àû. Namely \\\\mathcal{F} is spanned by words of the form :s_{i_1}\\\\cdots s_{i_k}s_{j_1}^* \\\\cdots s_{j_k}^*, k \\\\geq 0. The *-subalgebra \\\\mathcal{F}, being approximately finite-dimensional, has a unique C*-norm. The subalgebra \\\\mathcal{F} plays role of the space of Fourier coefficients for elements of the algebra. A key technical lemma, due to Cuntz, is that an element in the algebra is zero if and only if all its Fourier coefficients vanish. Using this, one can show that the quotient map from \\\\mathcal{L} to \\\\mathcal{A} is injective, which proves the theorem. The UHF algebra \\\\mathcal{F} has a non- unital subalgebra \\\\mathcal{F}' that is canonically isomorphic to \\\\mathcal{F} itself: In the Mn stage of the direct system defining \\\\mathcal{F}, consider the rank-1 projection e11, the matrix that is 1 in the upper left corner and zero elsewhere. Propagate this projection through the direct system. At the Mnk stage of the direct system, one has a rank nk - 1 projection. In the direct limit, this gives a projection P in \\\\mathcal{F}. The corner :P \\\\mathcal{F} P = \\\\mathcal{F'} is isomorphic to \\\\mathcal{F}. The *-endomorphism Œ¶ that maps \\\\mathcal{F} onto \\\\mathcal{F}' is implemented by the isometry s1, i.e. Œ¶(*) = s1(*)s1*. \\\\;\\\\mathcal{O}_n is in fact the crossed product of \\\\mathcal{F} with the endomorphism Œ¶.  Generalisations  Cuntz algebras have been generalised in many ways. Notable amongst which are the Cuntz‚ÄìKrieger algebras, graph C*-algebras and k-graph C*-algebras.  Applied mathematics  In signal processing, a subband filter with exact reconstruction give rise to representations of a Cuntz algebra. The same filter also comes from the multiresolution analysis construction in wavelet theory.

He is a former member of the Black Panther Party and Concerned Citizens for Justice. He was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and has lived in Memphis, Tennessee, since 2010.  Youth and early activism  When he was 12, Ervin joined the NAACP youth group and participated in the sit-in protests that helped end racial segregation in Chattanooga. He was drafted during the Vietnam War and served in the army for two years, where he became an anti-war activist. In 1967 he joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and, a short time later, the Black Panther Party.  Hijacking and incarceration  In February 1969, Ervin hijacked a plane to Cuba to evade prosecution for allegedly trying to kill a Ku Klux Klan leader. While in Cuba, and then Czechoslovakia, Ervin became disillusioned with state socialism. After the US government was unable to obtain his extradition, Ervin was arrested upon voluntarily returning to the U.S. in September 1969. Ervin was charged with two counts of airline hijacking in the US District Court for the State of Georgia. A jury convicted Ervin of both counts, for which presiding Federal District Judge Albert Henderson imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, after the jury declined to recommend the death sentence sought by the prosecutor. Ervin was the first person ever to receive a life sentence for an aircraft hijacking under U.S. law. Previously, the most severe sentence imposed for the offense had been 25 years imprisonment. Ervin first learned about anarchism while in prison in the late 1970s. He read numerous anarchist books, and his case was adopted by the Anarchist Black Cross, a political prisoner support organization. While in prison, Ervin authored several anarchist pamphlets, including Anarchism and the Black Revolution, which has been reprinted many times and is considered his best-known work.\\" Eventually, Ervin's legal challenges and an international campaign led to his release from prison after 15 years.  Post-prison activism  After his release Ervin returned to Chattanooga, where he became involved with a local civil rights group called Concerned Citizens for Justice, fighting police brutality and the Klan. In 1987, Ervin helped file a class action civil rights lawsuit that resulted in the restructuring of the Chattanooga government and the election of several black city council members. On April 26, 2008, Ervin and his wife organized a march and rally in Nashville, Tennessee, to protest the deaths of two youths in Tennessee facilities at the Chad Youth Enhancement Center, and the deaths of a number of prisoners at the Nashville Detention Center, allegedly by guards at that facility. On June 12, 2012, the Ervins and other black activists held a conference called \\"Let's Organize the Hood\\", and there created the Memphis Black Autonomy Federation to fight the high levels of unemployment and poverty in African American communities, rampant police brutality, including the unjustified use of deadly force, and the mass imprisonment of blacks and other peoples of color by the United States government through its War on Drugs, which Ervin and other activists claim are unjustly directed to black/POC communities.

It originally aired on the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon and later Saturday mornings on ABC from 1991 to 1992. Reruns of the series continued to air on The Disney Afternoon until 1995 and again between 1996 and 1997. The series originally aired as a preview-run on The Disney Channel in the spring of 1991 before beginning its main runs in September of that year.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 9, no. 2, March/April 1991: pp. 2, 38, 43.The Disney Channel Magazine, Vol. 9, no. 3, May/June 1991: pp. 28, 46. Episode air dates for this preview-run are not currently available. The series featured an eponymous superhero anthropomorphic duck with the alter ego of Drake Mallard, voiced by Jim Cummings. It is the first of two spin-offs of DuckTales, the other being Quack Pack. A total of 91 episodes were made. Of those, 65 aired in syndication on The Disney Afternoon in the 1991‚Äì1992 season (the first two episodes aired as a combined hour-long broadcast of the pilot episode \\"Darkly Dawns the Duck\\" the weekend before the series began its weekday run), with 13 more simultaneously airing on Saturdays on ABC in the fall of 1991. Another 13 episodes aired on Saturdays on ABC in the fall of 1992. The pilot episode \\"Darkly Dawns the Duck\\" originally aired on the weekend of Friday, September 6, 1991 (the air date varied by market) as part of a larger syndicated TV special called The Darkwing Duck Premiere / Back to School with the Mickey Mouse Club. Afterwards, \\"Darkly Dawns the Duck\\" was edited into a two-part version in which the two parts were treated as two distinct episodes. It is unknown when this two-part version first aired. The Disney Afternoon episodes and the first 13 ABC episodes are listed separately. In fact, they constituted a single production season, but Disney originally kept the ABC episodes separate from the syndicated episodes for distribution purposes. The first ABC season was re-aired on The Disney Afternoon in the fall of 1992. The second ABC season was not aired on The Disney Afternoon until the fall of 1993, after ABC removed the series from its schedule. Since the syndicated and ABC episodes are separated here, episodes are not listed according to their broadcast chronology. In addition, even the broadcast order of the first 78 episodes does not reflect their in-universe chronology ‚Äì for example, Liquidator's origin episode \\"Dry Hard\\" was aired after his appearances in \\"Just Us Justice Ducks\\" and \\"Life, the Negaverse and Everything\\". The series' production order (with the exception of \\"Darkly Dawns the Duck\\") most closely reflects the intended chronological episode order.

Born in Macerata, he spent much of his life in Siena, and was considered a native of the latter city. In his youth, Accarigi had enjoyed the friendship of Bargalio and Benevento, men who had acquired considerable reputation for their knowledge of the law. He received his doctorate from Siena in 1580. In 1581, he was first called to the professorial chair, but was only employed to explain the Institutiones of Justinian. Later, in 1589, his lectures were extended to the Pandects, when he became the first assigned that new professorship, which he held until 1593. While the professorship was intended to teach humanistic jurisprudence, he combined mos italicus and mos gallicus in his lectures. He was then appointed, by the grand duke Ferdinand I, to lecture upon the civil law in general, after the manner of Jacques Cujas. At length, upon the death of Bargalio, Accarigi was promoted to the chair of ordinary professor of law, which he occupied for twenty years. So high was the reputation which he acquired in this office, that very advantageous proposals were repeatedly made him from other Italian universities. His partiality to his alma mater, and his gratitude to his patron, long prevented him from listening to them. However, when Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma added, to the very high salary of 1,300 ducatoni, the proposal of giving him the title of his counselor (ducal councillor), the temptation was irresistible, and Accarigi moved to Parma in 1613. In 1618, Ferdinand I was able to recall him, by giving him the first professorship in law at the University of Pisa, where he was employed until his death in 1622.

Sunye Neto was also president of the Brazilian Chess Confederation from 1988 to 1992. Jaim Sunye Neto, 1980 at the 24th Chess Olympiad In 1979 he was invited to play in his first Interzonal in Rio de Janeiro as a second representative of the host nation. Untitled at the time, he delivered one of the best performances of his career, finishing fifth overall and defeating several grandmasters, including the tournament winner Lajos Portisch. He was joint second place at Havana 1985 and first at Zenica 1986 and won the South American Zonal in 1989. From 1978 to 1986 he was a mainstay on the Brazilian team at the Chess Olympiad. In 1996, Sunye Neto ran for president of FIDE. He assembled a powerful team and won the support of almost all of the chess playing countries of Europe. However the whole congress and the election took place under very suspicious circumstances, including one employee of FIDE, Ignatius Leong from Singapore, who was holding a number of proxies, feeling threatened and asking for protection by the American Embassy. He signed the proxies under obvious pressure in favour of the current president. FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov distributed presents and gifts to the delegates and generally exerted a lot of influence and pressure on the delegates especially from the Latin-American and African federations. After Ilyumzhinov withdrew from an agreement to join the election tickets, he offered members of Sunye Neto's ticket to join his. This offer was accepted by Steven Doyle (USA), Andrei Makarov (Russia) and Tabbane (Tunisia). When the votes were counted, Sunye Neto had lost by 87 votes to 44.

Best known for his song and music video \\"These Days Are old\\", Deil's songwriting and eccentric production techniques often contrast high and low vocals, analogue keyboards, found sounds, sampled beats and stringed instruments such as electric and Spanish guitar. Spookey has released seven full-length solo albums. Early life Due to his father's work as an ESA space engineer Spookey grew up in Germany, the Netherlands, and Washington, D.C. In his childhood, Spookey's parents insisted he take up an instrument and so he chose classical guitar. At age 13 he got his hands on his first electric guitar and spent the remainder of his teenage years playing in an array of hardcore and speed metal bands (most notably Transilience). It was at this time that he received his nickname \\"Spooky\\", a result of his high-school friends teasing him about his appearance with his long hair and Satanic T-shirts. At age 19 he moved to Toronto and enrolled in film school at York University, but kept musical ideas rolling on a four-track recorder. Recording artist Spookey's home recording experiments led to the making of his solo debut album Modes of Transportation Vol. 1 (TVT Records) which was partially engineered and mixed by Gadi Foltys, Don Kerr, Brad Nelson and Mark PlatiModes of Transportation, Vol. 1: Information from. Answers.com (1995-10-03). Retrieved on 2012-01-05. (David Bowie). International critical acclaim followed, hailing the album as the \\"Pet Sounds of the 90s\\" and \\"lo-fi pop masterpiece\\". In 1996, Ruben contributed to the AIDS benefit album Offbeat: A Red Hot Soundtrip produced by the Red Hot Organization. Disputes with TVT resulted in his leaving the label and years of apparent silence. Eventually, Ruben simultaneously released two separate CDs entitled Bed and Breakfast (Hi-Hat/Zomba) that were later repackaged as a double album. Alone at the Zoo, co-produced by John McEntire of Tortoise/The Sea and Cake was released as a special limited album of demos in 2003. On June 16, 2009 his full-length album, Mechanical Royalty, was released in Canada on Hi-Hat/Sonic Unyon. He has since released a new EP, Shackleton and is playing live dates in North America and Europe.

Islamic Republic of Iran [1980] ICJ 1 (also called the Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran) is a public international law case (issued in two decisions) brought to the International Court of Justice by the United States of America against Iran in response to the Iran hostage crisis, where United States diplomatic offices and personnel were seized by militant revolutionaries. Facts On 4 November 1979 there was an armed attack by Iranian students on the United States Embassy in Tehran and they overtook it. The students, belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, did this as an act of support to the Iranian Revolution. More than sixty American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for 444 days (until January 20, 1981). Some of the hostages were released earlier, but 52 hostages were held hostage until the end. Although Iran had promised protection to the U.S. Embassy, the guards disappeared during the takeover and the government of Iran did not attempt to stop it or rescue the hostages. The U.S. arranged to meet with Iranian authorities to discuss the release of the hostages, but Ayatollah Khomeini (the leader of the Iranian Revolution) forbade officials to meet them. The U.S. ceased relations with Iran, stopped U.S. exports, oil imports, and Iranian assets were blocked. Judgments The first decision was an Order of Provisional Measures, issued December 15, 1979. This was the court issuing an opinion not on the merits underlying the case specifically, but rather ordering a preservation of the respective rights and obligations the two countries owed one another pending the final decision of the court. More specifically, the Court unanimously declared Iran should ensure the restoration of the U.S. embassy in Tehran to U.S. possession, release the hostages, and afford diplomatic officials full protections as afforded by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The second decision addressed the actual merits of Iran's actions. Iran took no part in the proceedings. The case was the first real instance of the Court and the Security Council acting together to bring a crisis to an end. The ICJ considered the case in hand in two phases. The first phase referred to the armed attack on the US Embassy in Tehran by militants and students of Iran. The question asked was whether the militants and the students were 'agents' of the Iranian Government and therefore, acting on their behalf. The second phase comprises the whole series of facts which occurred following the completion of the occupation of the US Embassy by militants and the seizure of the Consulates. The Court reached a judgement on 24 May 1980.International Court of Justice, 24 May 1980, Case Concerning United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran For the first question, the ICJ found the militants and students to be 'agents' of the Iranian Government, because the latter had approved and perpetuated their actions, translating occupation of the embassy and detention of the hostages into official acts of the state, of which the perpetrators, while initially acting in private capacities, were rendered agents of the Iranian state.

I. Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development (also known as the \\"Central Institute for Aviation Motor Development named after P. I. Baranov\\" or simply \\"Central Institute of Aviation Motors\\", CIAM or TsIAM, Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya, ) is the only specialized Russian research and engineering facility dealing with advanced aerospace propulsion research, aircraft engine certification and other gas dynamics- related issues. It was founded in 1930. CIAM operates the largest aerospace engine testing facility in Europe, surpassed only by the United States's Arnold Engineering Development Center and Glenn Research Center. It is based in Lefortovo (the southeast okrug of Moscow) with an address of 2 Aviamotornaya street, Moscow, Postcode 111116. CIAM also operates a scientific testing center in Lytkarino, Moscow Oblast.  History  The bases of the institute were formed by such academics as Keldysh, Klimov and Chelomey. Since its foundation in 1930, CIAM designed nearly all Russian aviation motors and gas turbines. In 1933 CIAM was named after the late Soviet Vice-Narkom of Heavy Industry Petr Ionovich Baranov, who was one of the leading theorists of the Soviet aviation industry. Before World War II, all engine-design work was transferred to mass-production motor-building plants and their own design bureaus. CIAM focused on theoretical and experimental research and modernization of prototypes up to the production stage. After the war, CIAM was engaged with reactive (jet) engines for airplanes, successors to the first-generation turbojets. In the early 1950s, the largest test base in Europe was built in Lytkarino. In the 1970s, the institute began work on a ramjet engine using the special hypersonic \\"flying laboratory\\" GLL Holod. This experiment used a liquid hydrogen, actively cooled dual-mode ramjet, which was based on a hydrogen-fueled axisymmetrical engine placed on a Russian SA5 missile during the flight. The first successful test achieved Mach 5.6 in 1991, and the maximum speed achieved was Mach 5.7 in November 1992. A test with a goal of Mach 6.3 failed in March 1995.French-Russian Analysis of Kholod Dual-Mode Ramjet Flight Experiments After the dissolution of the USSR, CIAM lost a large number of emigrating engineers. With the loss of government support and a lack of state aviation strategy, CIAM stayed afloat with contracts with China, French corporations, ABB and by offering logistical services. As of 2011, the situation has stabilized; CIAM leads some Russian programs, including development of the new perspective scramjet GLL Igla.French Support Russian SCRAMJET Tests.

The son of William Carr, gentleman, Julian Carr was born in England around 1824. Nothing is known of his early life, but on 11 May 1846 he married Katherine Agnes Francisco, a cousin of Sir Walter James, at St. George's Church, Bloomsbury, Middlesex. At the time of his marriage, Carr was living in Museum Street in London, and described as a gentlemen. His marriage certificate lists his first name as Julienn. Carr and his wife emigrated to Western Australia, arriving in March 1848 on board the Orient. Carr established himself as a merchant at Perth, and by 1849 was proprietor of the Freemason's Hotel there. The following year he was a director of the Geraldine Mining Company. He was elected Chairman of the Perth Municipal Council in 1861, a position that he would hold until 1869 except for a short break in 1864‚Äì5. He also became heavily involved in the founding of the Perth Building Society; he was a founding trustee in 1862, remaining so until 1873. In 1866 he was appointed a director, and he held its chairmanship from 1867 to 1873. He was also a founding director of the Western Australia Fire Insurance Company in 1870, and a member of the Central Board of Education until 1873. In May 1868, Carr was nominated to the Legislative Council. He held the position until the advent of representative government in 1870. He was then elected to the Legislative Council for the seat of Perth holding it until his resignation around November 1873. During this time he was the Council's Chairman of Committees from December 1870 to July 1873. After resigning his positions, Carr returned permanently to England. Nothing is known of his later life, except that he died at Upper Tooting, London, on 5 February 1886.

Education He graduated in 1962 from Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama. In 1967, he earned a law degree from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law. He practiced law in the New Orleans area for almost a decade before being elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in the first-ever nonpartisan blanket primary held at the state level in the fall of 1975. Politics He served a year (1976) in Louisiana House District 103. In the state House, he was an unabashed supporter of organized labor and was particularly close to Louisiana AFL-CIO leader Victor Bussie. Tonry led the push to kill a right-to-work bill in the 1976 legislative session, but those efforts failed and the bill became law without the signature of Governor Edwin W. Edwards, like Tonry, a strong supporter of organized labor and close friend of Bussie. Thus Louisiana became the last southern state to adopt a right-to-work bill. Shortly after taking his state House seat, Tonry declared his candidacy for the United States Congress from Louisiana's 1st congressional district after the 36-year Democratic incumbent, Felix Edward H√©bert, announced his retirement. In the Democratic primary, Tonry upset New Orleans City Councilman James Moreau, then narrowly defeated Republican Bob Livingston, an assistant state attorney general, in the general election. It was one of the last congressional elections held before Louisiana adopted its nonpartisan blanket primary for Congressional elections in 1978. Allegations Tonry was investigated by the U.S. Attorney Gerald J. Gallinghouse, was accused of allowing subordinates to steal votes by stuffing ballot boxes in St. Bernard Parish, a suburb of New Orleans. He was charged with receiving illegal campaign funds beyond the $1,000 federal limit then imposed per contribution. These allegation ultimately led to his resignation, his guilty pleas of campaign finance irregularities, and a six-months prison sentence at the Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery, Alabama. Resignation When Tonry resigned from Congress after four months in the office, a special election was called in August 1977. Tonry ran in the Democratic primary for that race, but lost to one of his former colleagues in the state legislature, Ron Faucheux, who was defeated by Livingston in the special election. This seat has remained in Republican hands since that time and is currently held by Steve Scalise after formerly being held by David Vitter and Bobby Jindal. In 1983, Tonry tried to return to the Louisiana House in District 103, but finished in fourth (dead last) in the nonpartisan blanket primary with 2,693 votes (17.8 percent). Victory went to the Republican Edward Ripoll, who defeated incumbent Edward S. Bopp in a runoff election. Bopp had succeeded Tonry in the state House in 1977.

The film features an international cast including the American Burt Lancaster, the Frenchman Alain Delon, the Italian Claudia Cardinale (who is dubbed in the Italian version by Solvejg D'Assunta because her native tongue was Sicilian and French) and Terence Hill (Mario Girotti). In the Italian-language 185-minute version, Lancaster's lines are dubbed into Italian by Corrado Gaipa; while in the 161-minute U.S. English-dubbed version, Lancaster's original voice work is heard. Plot In Sicily in 1860, Don Fabrizio Corbera, Prince of Salina enjoys the customary comforts and privileges of an ancient and noble name. War has broken out between the armies of Francis II of the Two Sicilies and the insurgent volunteer redshirts of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Among the rebels is the Prince's remarkably handsome and dashing nephew, Tancredi, with whose romantic politics the Prince shares some whimsical sympathy. Moved by the uprising, the Prince departs for nearby Palermo. Garibaldi's army conquers the city and Sicily from the Bourbons. The Prince muses upon the inevitability of change, with the middle class displacing the hereditary ruling class while on the surface everything remains the same. Refusing to bend to the tide of necessity, the Prince departs for his summer palace at Donnafugata. A new national assembly has called a plebiscite which the nationalists win 512-0, thanks to the corruption of the town's leading citizen, Don Calogero Sedara, who sees his daughter, the exquisitely beautiful Angelica, as a ticket of admittance to the high-class soir√©es of the nobility. Bringing her with him to the villa of the Salinas, he watches as both the Prince and Tancredi fall abjectly in love with her. Realising his chance, he effectively pimps his daughter to the aristocracy, and Tancredi offers his hand. The Prince sees the wisdom of the match because he knows his nephew's vaulting ambition and need for ready cash, which Angelica's father, greedy for familial prestige, will happily make available. With the mutual blessing of the Prince of Salina and Don Calogero, Tancredi and Angelica become engaged. A visitor from the constituent assembly comes to the villa. He begs the great scholar and nobleman to join the senate and help direct the ship of state; he hopes that the Prince's great compassion and wisdom will help alleviate the poverty and ignorance to be seen everywhere on the streets of Sicily. However, the Prince demurs and refuses this invitation, claiming that Sicily prefers its sleep to the agitations of modernity because its people are proud of who they are. He sees a future when the leopards and the lions, along with the sheep and the jackals, will all live according to the same law, but he does not want to be a part of this democratic vision. He notes that Tancredi has shifted allegiances from the insurgent Garibaldi to the king's army, and wistfully recognises that his nephew is the kind of opportunist and time-server who will flourish in the new Italy. A great ball is held at the villa of a neighboring Prince, and the Salinas and Tancredi attend. Afflicted by a combination of melancholia, the ridiculousness of the nouveau riche, and age, the Prince wanders forlornly from chamber to chamber, increasingly disaffected by the entire edifice of the society he so gallantly represents ‚Äì until Angelica approaches and asks him to dance. Stirred and momentarily released from his cares, the Prince accepts, and once more he resembles the elegant and dashing figure of his past. Disenchanted, he leaves the ball alone and asks Tancredi to arrange carriage for his family, and walks with a heavy heart to a dark alley that symbolises Italy's inordinate and fading past, which he inhabits.

In August 1960 the Italian company Titanus announced that they would make a film based on the novel in Sicily the following summer on a budget of at least $2 million. The movie would be an Italian-American co-production, shot in English, with a combination of Italian and American stars.

The Observer 10 Sep 1961: 17. In July 1961 MGM announced they had signed a co-production deal with Titanus to make the movie. Warren Beatty was in discussions with Visconti to play the nephew, while Visconti approached Laurence Olivier and Spencer Tracy to play the lead. When Visconti was told by producers that they needed to cast a star in order to help to ensure that they'd earn enough money to justify the big budget, the director's first choice was one of the Soviet Union's preeminent actors, Nikolai Cherkasov. Learning that Cherkasov was in no condition, the producers stipulated that the star should be either Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, Spencer Tracy or Burt Lancaster. The producers chose Hollywood star Burt Lancaster without consulting Visconti, which insulted the director and caused tension on the set; but Visconti and Lancaster ended up working well together, and their resulting friendship lasted the rest of their lives. In November, Lancaster agreed to play the lead with filming to start in April.NEXT ROSSEN FILM TO BE 'COCO BEACH': Carnival Atmosphere of Cape Canaveral to Be Subject By EUGENE ARCHER.

New York Times 29 July 1962: 69 By May 1963 it was reported the film had cost Titanus $5 million. Versions The Leopard has circulated in at least four different versions. Visconti's first cut was 205 minutes long, but was felt to be excessive in length by both the director and producer, and was shortened to 195 minutes for its Cannes Film Festival premiere. Visconti then cut the film further to 185 minutes for its official release, and considered this version to be his preferred one. The U.S English-dubbed version, in which the Italian and French actors were dubbed over (except for Burt Lancaster, whose original English voice work is heard), was edited down to 161 minutes by its distributor 20th Century Fox. This was done without Visconti's input - the director was unhappy at the American premiere with the cuts, dubbing and print. Visconti threatened to sue Fox, who threatened to counter-sue the director, arguing that Lancaster supervised the American cut. \\"I don't feel it's my film at all,\\" said Visconti of the American cut. Release The film debuted at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Palme d'Or for best picture. Reception=Box office The film was successful in Europe and was the sixth most popular film of the year at the French box office, with admissions of 3,688,024. Despite being cut for US release by Fox, the film didn't perform as well in the United States with theatrical rentals of $1.8 million. Critical At the time of its release in the summer of 1963, the majority of American critics panned the film. According to Newsweek, Lancaster looked \\"as if he's playing Clarence Day's Life with Father in summer stock.\\" Jonathan Miller of The New Yorker derided Lancaster as \\"muzzled by whiskers and clearly stunned by the importance of his role.\\" However, Time Magazine praised the characterisation of the titular Leopard as solid and convincing. Re-release The 185 minute edition was released in the US in 1983. New York magazine called the now-famous ballroom scene \\"almost unbearably moving.\\" The New York Times wrote \\"The reappearance of this enchanting work proves that, under the right circumstances, two decades make no difference whatsoever but 25 minutes can transform a very good film into a possibly great one.\\" The film's reputation continues to rise. Director Martin Scorsese considers the film to be one of the greatest ever made. In the decennial poll made by the British Film Institute, it was named the 57th greatest film of all time selected by critics.https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv- people/sightandsoundpoll2012/critics Review website Rotten Tomatoes reports the film has a 98% \\"Fresh\\" rating, based on 47 reviews.

Breuer, as pictured in the January 1930 issue of Science Wonder Stories Breuer's \\"The Raid from Mars\\" was the cover story in the March 1939 issue of Amazing Stories Miles John Breuer (January 3, 1889 ‚Äì October 14, 1945) was an American physician and science fiction writer. He was part of the first generation of writers to appear regularly in the pulp science fiction magazines, publishing his first story, \\"The Man with the Strange Head\\", in the January 1927 issue of Amazing Stories. His best known works are \\"The Gostak and the Doshes\\" (1930) and two stories written jointly with Jack Williamson, \\"The Girl from Mars\\" (1929) and The Birth of a New Republic (1931). Early life and medical career Breuer was born in Chicago, in 1889, to Charles and Barbara Breuer, Czech immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The family moved to Nebraska in 1893 while Charles pursued a medical degree at Creighton University in Omaha, and Miles grew up in the Czech community of Crete, Nebraska. Miles graduated from Crete High School in 1906, and went on to earn a master's degree from the University of Texas in 1911. After earning a medical degree from Rush Medical College which at the time was at the University of Chicago in 1915, Miles joined his father's medical practice in Nebraska. In 1916 Miles married Julia Strejic and the couple had three children, Rosalie, Stanley, and Mildred. During World War I Miles Breuer served for twenty months in France as a first lieutenant in the Army Medical Corps. Rejoining his father's medical practice after the war, Breuer contributed frequent medical articles to Czech-language newspapers, as well as a monthly health column in the country's largest Czech-language agricultural monthly. In 1925 he published a handbook called Index of Physiotherapeutic Technic, cataloging a variety of methods for physical therapy. Breuer suffered a nervous breakdown in December 1942, and shortly afterwards moved to Los Angeles, where he continued his medical practice until 1945, when he died after a brief illness.Obituary, Lincoln Evening Journal, October 16, 1945. Writing career Breuer's first published work of fiction was a Czech- language story called \\"The Man Without an Appetite\\" that appeared in the monthly Bratrsky Vestnik about 1916. Breuer had long been interested in scientific romances, particularly those by H. G. Wells.Michael R. Page, \\"Introduction\\", The Man With the Strange Head, Miles J. Breuer, 2008, p. xvii. When Hugo Gernsback founded the first science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories, Breuer began writing and submitting stories, publishing his first, \\"The Man with the Strange Head\\", in the January 1927 issue. Over the next fifteen years he went on to write two novels, thirty-six shorter stories, and several other items for the science fiction magazines, including collaborations with Jack Williamson and Clare Winger Harris. A great majority were published in Amazing Stories (a monthly) and Amazing Stories Quarterly. Several of Breuer's stories have been included in anthologies and in 2008 Michael R. Page of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln edited a collection, The Man with the Strange Head and Other Early Science Fiction Stories, comprising ten stories, the novel Paradise and Iron, and Breuer's editorial essay \\"The Future of Scientifiction\\". Jack Williamson called Breuer \\"among the first and best of the amateurs whose work Gernsback began to print.\\"Wonder's Child: My Life in Science Fiction by Jack Williamson, 2nd ed., 2005, pp. 61-62. Walter Gillings stated that Breuer wrote \\"some of the most intriguing tales that appeared in the early volumes of Amazing Stories,\\"\\"Miles J.

It is run by the mother and daughter team of Albina Deriugina, who is the head coach, and Irina Deriugina, who acts as the assistant coach. Irina's daughter, Ireesha Blokhina, works in the school as a senior choreograph. Every year since 1992 the club plays host to the biggest rhythmic gymnastics competition in Ukraine, The Deriugina Cup (–ö—É–±–æ–∫ –î–µ—Ä—é–≥—ñ–Ω–æ—ó). The main training centre of the club is the October Palace. History  In the 1970s Deriugina gymnasts comprised the majority of the Soviet team with the Deriugina gymnasts becoming Soviet, European and World champions. During this era the most notable individual gymnast was, Irina Deriugina ‚Äî the 1977 and 1979 World champion. The school was very strong in the groups discipline during this period with European and World titles for the group, consisting of Viktoria Serykh, Olga Plokhova, Ludmila Yevtushenko, Olga Shchegoleva, Zhanna Vasyura and Irina Deriugina. Ten years after the school's initial success, it had a few more champions to give. Aleksandra Timoshenko become the Bronze medal winner at the 1988 Olympics and the Champion at 1992 Olympics. She became the role model for the √ºber-waif rhythmic gymnast look. Along with Timoshenko, the school produced Oksana Skaldina who went on to claim the bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics, with Timoshenko taking the gold. Throughout the 1990s the Deriugina School produced numerous champions and gymnasts of interest. Gymnasts such as Ekaterina Serebrianskaya and Elena Vitrichenko dominated the mid-1990s. The school had a big emergence of talent in the late 1990s and early 2000s led by the daughter of Viktoria Serykh, Anna Bessonova.

He served as Minister for Environment and Conservation (1972‚Äì1975), the Environment (1975), and the Media (1975). He represented the Division of Maribyrnong in the House of Representatives from 1969 to 1983. Early life Cass was born in Narrogin, Western Australia. He was the son of Jewish parents who had come to Australia to escape antisemitism. His grandfather Moses Cass was born in Bia≈Çystok, Poland, and arrived in Perth in 1906. Cass studied medicine at the University of Sydney, and during the 1950s and 1960s worked as a registrar at hospitals in Sydney, London and Melbourne. He was a research fellow at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital and conducted research into the use of a heart‚Äìlung machine for open-heart surgery. From 1964 to 1969 he was the director of the Trade Union Clinic and Research Centre. He become known as a proponent of abortion law reform, and was the spokesman for the Abortion Reform Association. On a radio broadcast in June 1969, Cass stated \\"I have certainly broken the law on numerous occasions by sending patients to other doctors for the purpose of having abortions induced\\". He stated that he had performed abortions \\"every weekend\\" at Royal North Shore Hospital while undergoing his residency and that he was \\"sure that most doctors are in the same position\\". Politics Cass joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1955. He ran for the Kew City Council in 1961 but lost after the distribution of preferences. He stood in safe Liberal seats at the 1961 and 1963 elections, running against Prime Minister Robert Menzies in Kooyong and John Jess in La Trobe. At the 1969 federal election, Cass defeated incumbent Liberal MP Philip Stokes in the Division of Maribyrnong. He was appointed Minister for Environment and Conservation following the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972. He appointed marine biologist Don McMichael as his departmental secretary. Cass held the second-lowest rank in cabinet, above only science minister Bill Morrison. He was assisted in his environmental protection efforts by Rex Connor, the Minister for Minerals and Energy. Connor used his seniority in the party to overcome opposition to Cass's proposals, notably helping secure the passage of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Cass was unsuccessful in seeking to prevent the flooding of Lake Pedder in Tasmania. Nonetheless he did lay the groundwork for the end of sandmining on Fraser Island and government protection of the Great Barrier Reef. In 1975 he led parliamentarians and ALP branch members in expressing concerns about the effects of uranium mining. A key concern was the adverse effect that uranium mining would have on the northern Aboriginal people. Cass said: \\"nuclear energy creates the most dangerous, insidious and persistent waste products, ever experienced on the planet\\".Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 258. In October 1973, Cass seconded former prime minister John Gorton's motion for the decriminalisation of homosexuality, which was successful although it had no legal effect. He also argued for the decriminalisation of marijuana. In April 1975, Cass's title was changed to just \\"Minister for the Environment\\", at his own request. He said the previous title was too long and redundant. In June 1975, Cass relinquished the environment portfolio and instead was appointed Minister for the Media. He announced plans for a voluntary Australian Press Council, but in September stated that a voluntary council would not be sufficient. He was criticised by Rupert Murdoch, who stated it was \\"sinister\\" and constituted censorship. Cass stated that the proposal had been subjected to \\"bizarre distortion and hysterical over-reaction\\" by some sections of the press. Following the dismissal of the government and Labor's defeat at the 1975 election, Cass was named opposition spokesman for health in Whitlam's shadow cabinet. When Bill Hayden replaced Whitlam as opposition leader in December 1977, Cass was given the portfolio of immigration and ethnic affairs. He supported cutting immigration, stating there were not enough jobs for migrants. In 1978, he stated that there was \\"considerable organisation\\" behind Vietnamese boat people coming to Australia. Cass announced in June 1982 that he would not recontest his seat at the next election. Later life In 1983, Cass chaired a review into the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. In the same year he was appointed by the Hawke Government to the council of the National Museum of Australia. Cass served as chair of the Australian National Biocentre from 2002 to 2003. He was also patron of the Sustainable Living Foundation and an honorary fellow at the Melbourne University School of Land and Environment. In 2007, Cass was a founding member of Independent Australian Jewish Voices, a \\"breakaway group from Australia's main pro-Israel Jewish lobby organisations\\". During the Gaza War of 2009, he signed a statement condemning Israel's \\"grossly disproportionate military assault\\". Quotes Cass is incorrectly believed by some to be the originator of the saying, \\"We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children\\" (although a similar paraphrase was used earlier by the environmental activist Wendell Berry).Quote Investigator, Accessed 30 March 2013. http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/22/borrow-earth/ On 13 November 1974, when Cass was environment minister, he gave a speech in Paris to the meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Borrowing heavily from Native American proverbs and traditions, he said: \\"We rich nations, for that is what we are, have an obligation not only to the poor nations, but to all the grandchildren of the world, rich and poor. We have not inherited this earth from our parents to do with it what we will. We have borrowed it from our children and we must be careful to use it in their interests as well as our own. Anyone who fails to recognise the basic validity of the proposition put in different ways by increasing numbers of writers, from Malthus to The Club of Rome, is either ignorant, a fool, or evil.\\" Cass' version was a longer explanation than the original, traditional proverb. Cass has been cited as the first person to use the term \\"queue jumping\\" in reference to asylum seekers, in a 1978 opinion column in The Australian.

According to another definition the curve of Spee is an anatomic curvature of the occlusal alignment of the teeth, beginning at the tip of the lower incisor, following the buccal cusps of the natural premolars and molars and continuing to the anterior border of the ramus. It is named for the German embryologist Ferdinand Graf von Spee (1855‚Äì1937), who was first to describe the anatomic relations of human teeth in the sagittal plane. Details The pull of the main muscle of mastication, the masseter, is at a perpendicular angle with the curve of Spee to adapt for favorable loading of force on the teeth. The long axis of each lower tooth is aligned nearly parallel to their individual arch of closure. The Curve of Spee is, essentially, a series of sloped contact points. It is of importance to orthodontists as it may contribute to an increased overbite. A flat or mild curve of Spee was essential to an ideal occlusion.Larry Andrews. 1972. Six Keys to Normal Occlusion. The Curve of Spee is distinct from the Curve of Wilson, which is the upward (U-shaped) curvature of the maxillary and mandibular occlusal planes in the coronal plane. The Curve of Spee is basically a part of a circle (8-inch diameter) which has its circumference as the anterior ramus of mandible. Ideally, it is aligned so that a continuation of this arc would extend through the condyles. The curvature of this arc would relate, on average, to part of a circle with a 4-inch radius. It is the only Anteroposterior curve of occlusion.

At no point in her life did she use this name. All documents that she created identify her by the surname Coincoin (or a variant spelling of that name). Only one document during her lifetime assigned her the name Metoyer and that document was created by a Washington, D.C. land office official who had no personal knowledge of her. In 1806, her son Pierre Metoyer, traveled to the U.S. land office at Opelousas, Louisiana, to file a claim on her behalf, calling her \\"his mother, Marie Th√©r√®se, free negresse\\" (no surname). When the paperwork was submitted to Washington, a case label was created for the file, whereon the son's surname was assigned to her. See Claim B2146, Marie Th√©r√®se, free Negresse, 1806 document filed under OPEL: May 1794 (the date of the Spanish patent), Opelousas Notarial Records, Louisiana State Archives, Baton Rouge; and Serial Patent 437,269, Marie Th√©r√®se Metoyer, RG 49, National Archives; Mills, \\"Marie Th√©r√®se Coincoin (1742‚Äì1816): Slave, Slave Owner, and Paradox,\\" discusses these records in greater detail. (August 1742 - 1816) was notable as a free m√©decine, planter, slave owner (https://historycollection.co/10-black-slaveowners-that-will-tear- apart-historical-perception/7/) and businesswoman at the colonial Louisiana outpost of Natchitoches (later Natchitoches Parish). Her freedom was purchased in 1778 by Claude Thomas Pierre M√©toyer, with whom she had a long liaison and ten children. She and her descendants established a historical community of Cr√©oles of color along the Cane River, including what is said to be the first church founded by free people of color for their own use, St. Augustine Parish (Isle Brevelle) Church, Natchez, Louisiana. It is included as a site on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. Life=Early life and family Coincoin was born at the Louisiana French outpost of Natchitoches, the fourth of eleven children. Her parents, Fran√ßois and Marie Fran√ßoise, were enslaved by the post's founder and commandant, Chevalier Louis Juchereau de St. Denis. Their marriage was legitimate and it was recorded in the parish church three weeks after Fran√ßois' baptism in December 1735. This suggests that their marriage, like their religious \\"conversion\\", was dictated by their master. As children, Coincoin and her sister Marie Louise ditteIn this context, ditte can be translated as \\"called\\". In this society, it meant a nickname used in place of a surname.Mills, \\"Which Marie Louise Is Mariotte?\\", provides a four-generation genealogy of the slave and freeborn offspring of Coincoin's sister Mariotte and additional information on Coincoin's parents. were trained in pharmacology and nursing. By these skills the women earned a livelihood after gaining freedom through manumission as adults. Their other nine siblings would remain enslaved at various colonial posts from Natchitoches to Pensacola. Slavery and freedom When still young, Coincoin had five children. Some records show that Coincoin's first five children were of full African blood and others suggest they were partially Native American, fathered by Chatta. About 1765 her mistress granted Coincoin to live with the young French merchant, Claude Thomas Pierre M√©toyer, Coincoin had gained the interest of M√©toyer during his many visits to the St. Denis household. The efforts of a parish priest to break up their union in 1778, by filing charges that threatened her being sold away to New Orleans, prompted M√©toyer to buy and manumit her. Together they moved from the post, to outlying lands, where their liaison continued until 1788. As his mixed-race children matured and married, M√©toyer manumitted the eldest five of the ten children whom he had held in slavery after he purchased Coincoin and their children. Business activity As a free woman, Coincoin exploited a variety of economic enterprises. She manufactured medicine, planted tobacco, and trapped wild bears to the local market and shipping peltry and oil along with indigo that she sourced from the bear skins to New Orleans along with her cured tobacco. She became a landowner and a taxpayer. As a pious Catholic, she volunteered labor for the upkeep of the parish church. Like many other freed slaves in colonial Louisiana, she eventually acquired slaves in order to protect them from others in the parish purchasing them. Most were related to Coincoin or close friends, she labored alongside of them until her own health began to fail. Some accounts say that she held one small farmstead of 67 acres.Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), in cooperation with Cane River National Heritage Area et al., ‚ÄúCoincoin-Prudhomme House (Maison de Marie Therese)‚Äù, HABS No. LA1295, National Park Service, p. 1; the report is undated but its content suggests it was created after 2004. Others portray her as the owner of a plantation empire of 12,000 acres and a hundred slaves.Klier, Betje Black. Pavie in the Borderlands (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2000), p. 15. Surviving records document her ownership of somewhat over one thousand acres.For a detailed delineation of Coincoin's three separate land acquisitions, see Elizabeth Shown Mills, ‚ÄúDemythicizing History: Marie Th√©r√®se Coincoin, Tourism, and the National Historical Landmarks Program.‚Äù Louisiana History 53 (Fall 2012): 402‚Äì37; archived online at Historic Pathways. The liberal land-grant policies of the Spanish Crown provided a stake for her first farmstead on the Grand Coast of Red River (now Cane River), about ten miles below the town. That small tract of 80 arpents (67 acres), alluvial river-bottom land adjacent to Metoyer's plantation, was conceded by the local commandant in January 1787 and patented by the Crown in May 1794. It is identified on modern land maps as sections 18 and 89 of Township 8 North, Range 6 West. On the heels of that patent, Coincoin applied for a significantly larger concession ‚Äî 800 arpents of piney woods on Old River to the west of her farm ‚Äî a tract identified today as section 55, Township 8 North, Range 7 West, where she established a vacherie (cattle range) and hired a Spaniard to operate it for her. In 1807, she bought a third tract of already developed farm land (the northern portion of sections 34 and 98, T8 North, Range 6 West). That third holding, adjacent to her homestead, provided a stake for a younger son who had come of age after the Louisiana Purchase, too late to benefit from the more-liberal land policies of the Spanish regime. Coincoin has been credited with the founding of Cane River's fabled Melrose Plantation. However, this land has been documented as a grant to her son, Louis M√©toyer, who built most of the surviving plantation buildings prior to his death.Mills, Elizabeth Shown. \\"Marie Th√©r√®se Coincoin (1742‚Äì1816): Slave, Slave Owner, and Paradox\\", Chapter 1 in Janet Allred and Judy Gentry, ed., Louisiana Women: Their Lives and Times (Athens, Ga.: University of Georgia Press, 2009)Louis Metoyer Private Land Claim Certificate B1953 (sections 17 and 94, Township 7 North, Range 6 West), Record Group 49, General Land Office, National Archives; Louis Mettoyer claim for , OPEL: May 1796, File B1953, Louis Metoyer, Opelousas Notarial Records, Louisiana State Land Office, Baton Rouge; Boissier et al. v. Metayer, 5 Mart. (O.S.), 678 (1818). Coincoin lived frugally and served others, investing all her income into the purchase of freedom for the children from the slave marriage of her youth. By the time of her death, she had manumitted three of those children and three grandchildren.For the previously unpublished life of one of these, Nicolas \\"Chiquito\\" dit Coincoin, see E. S. Mills, \\"QuickLesson 16: Speculation, Hypothesis, Interpretation, and Proof\\", Evidence Explained. Another daughter and many grandchildren remained enslaved, as their owners refused to manumit or sell them. Legacy Her eldest son Augustin Metoyer donated land for a church at Isle Brevelle, Natchez, Louisiana. In 1829 he commissioned his brother Louis to build the structure, St. Augustine Parish Church. It is believed to be America's first church built by free people of color for their own use.Note: Independent black churches were founded by free blacks in Philadelphia before this date, but the congregations used existing structures. Some writers assert the church was built in 1803 by Augustin Metoyer, son of Coincoin, but the historical evidence dates the construction of the building and its dedication as a chapel in July 1829. In 1856 the diocese designated St. Augustine Chapel as a parish church with a resident priest in its own right. See Mills, Forgotten People, pp. 145‚Äì50, for an analysis of that evidence. For the first recorded service at the chapel, see Elizabeth Shown Mills, Natchitoches Church Marriages, 1818-1850: Translated Abstracts from the Registers of St. Fran√ßois des Natchitoches, Louisiana, vol. 4, Cane River Creole Series (Tuscaloosa, AL: 1985), p. 38, entry 152. Coincoin's grave is no longer marked. A small Creole-style cottage constructed of bousillage (a mixture of retted Spanish moss, animal hair and mud used as infill material in French Creole dwellings) and half-timber still stands on her original 1780s-1816 farmstead, off Cedar Bend Road (Latitude 31.681271/Longitude -93.018800). The house is known as \\"Maison de Marie Therese\\" and \\"Coincoin-Prudhomme House\\". Buildings (some National Historic Landmarks) associated with the heritage of other historically prominent African Americans, such as Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and Frederick Douglass, date to the Reconstruction Era. This was o many decades after Coincoin's lifespan. Coincoin was manumitted (freed from bondage) more than 70 years prior to the Emancipation Proclamation of the Civil War. African origin Tradition holds that Coincoin's African-born parents retained much of their culture, and some evidence supports that. No known document identifies the African birthplace of either parent. Coincoin and four of her siblings carried African names as dits.Mills and Mills, \\"Slaves and Masters,\\" identifies four of these dits; Mills, \\"Marie Th√©r√®se Coincoin (1742‚Äì1816): Slave, Slave Owner, and Paradox,\\" documents the fifth of these African names. One Africanist historian proposed in the 1970s that the African Coincoin (spelled variously in transliterations by French and Spanish scribes) was the name used for \\"second-born daughters\\" among those Ewe of coastal Togo who speak the Glidzi dialect.Jan Vansina of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, as reported in Mills, Forgotten People, pg. 3. Historians Gary B. and Elizabeth Shown Mills found evidence that Coincoin was the second-born daughter in her birth family. Other possible origins of the name Coincoin, together with the names of her siblings as discovered by Elizabeth Shown Mills, are being studied by Africanist Kevin MacDonald at the UCL Institute of Archaeology, University College London.MacDonald to E.

Biography Described as a transient, Reynolds was living with his mother at the time of his online comments. A 1976 graduate of North Salem High School in North Salem, New York, he was also arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and breach of the peace. He was also named on legal documents related to tax liens against him, and outstanding debts he owed. He was convicted of trying to blow up his family's Purdys, New York home in 1978. He was given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree attempted arson. In 1982 he married Tammy Danise, and the couple had three children together. They later divorced, and the children went into their mother's custody. His father-in-law described him as a \\"John Wayne-wannabe\\" Conspiracy Reynolds discussed his wishes to bomb US-based oil pipelines with online acquaintances in October 2005, including in the Yahoo! chat room entitled OBLcrew, where he posted messages stating \\"\\"It is true America has overstepped its bounds in invading Iraq. Those serious enough to do something about it should e-mail... . Contact soon... . We both want something, let's talk.\\" on October 25, and repeating his plea the following day with \\"Still awaiting someone serious about contact. Would be a pity to lose this idea\\". At some point between his online discussions in October, and his arrest in December, Reynolds moved to Pocatello, Idaho and found work with American Microsystems. After becoming unemployed again, Reynolds was arrested in December 2005, after arranging to meet an online acquaintance, secretly FBI informant and controversial vigilante online-terrorist-hunter Shannen Rossmiller, who had promised him $40,000 to help him purchase fuel trucks to help destroy targets. At the time, he had been living in Room 205 at the Thunderbird Motel, and his net worth was only $24.85. Reynolds has since claimed that he was running an independent sting operation, hoping to expose terrorist cells working within the United States. He sent a letter to a local newspaper stating that version of events.wcbstv.com ‚Äì FBI Terror Sting Nets Westchester Man Legal proceedings Reynolds was formally charged with a firearms offence for possessing a hand grenade, though a sealed statement from the FBI also stated that he intended to blow up multiple pipelines in the United States in a bid to help further terrorist causes. His case made further headlines when the Department of Justice subpoenaed both Reynolds and Microsoft Corporation for access to view his Hotmail eMail account, which revealed him discussing the need to leave the country after his attacks, and that he could be sentenced to death for treason. In February 2006, unnamed judicial officials said that it was likely Reynolds was not, in fact, a terrorist, and likely suffered mental illness. Applications for release on bail, acquittal and for the firearms charge to be dismissed, were all denied. On October 2, 2006, Reynolds was additionally charged with \\"providing assistance to Al-Qaeda\\", in addition to \\"seeking to destroy property used in interstate or foreign commerce\\". He waived any dispute to extradition and was extradited to Lackawanna County Prison in Scranton, Pennsylvania where he was incarcerated pending trial, which began July 9, 2007. The judge, having been informed that Reynolds had been held without contact with his mother or any means of financial aid, suggested that the State government might afford the cost to purchase him a suit of clothing for the trial. Reynolds had initially been assigned a public defender but had a dispute with her, and hired Joseph A. O'Brien as his attorney, before announcing he would represent himself and relegated O'Brien to the position of \\"advisor\\".

Generations series. The game was developed by Mitchell Corporation and published by Nintendo, and is based on Mitchell's 1998 arcade game Puzz Loop. The game was first revealed at Nintendo Japan's 2006 Conference. The European version came packaged with the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak. A version for WiiWare, titled in Japan, Magnetica Twist in North America and Actionloop Twist in PAL regions, was released in Japan on April 22, 2008, June 6, 2008 in Europe, and on June 30, 2008 in North America. Gameplay In the game, marbles roll down a twisted path toward the goal and the player must stop them by launching new marbles into the oncoming ones. The DS touchscreen is used to 'flick' the marbles from their launch point to their destination with the stylus. The marbles disappear if player matches three or more marbles of the same type; marbles of the same color are magnetically attracted to each other over any length of wide open space, and allowing for chains of disappearances to occur. The game is over if any marble reaches a specific point, usually near the center of each level, but using the magnetic properties of the marbles can allow one to pull marbles away from this point. Bonus items attached to marbles can, for example, temporarily slow down the rate the marbles advance or cause all marbles of a color to disappear. In addition to the main survival mode of play, the player can take part in a quest mode, where they must clear boards under certain conditions, and a puzzle mode, where a fixed arrangement of marbles around the board must be cleared using only the few marbles made available to the player. WiiWare version The WiiWare version of Magnetica supports up to four players simultaneously in either co-operative or competitive multiplayer modes, in addition to the ability to use the player's own Miis in the game. Control is done by twisting the Wii Remote left or right to turn the marble cannon, and an ability to lob marbles over others has been added. The game features the challenge and quest modes of the DS version, but omits the puzzle mode. Extensive statistics are also kept for each player. Reception Magnetica and Magnetica Twist received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Nintendo Life said that although the DS version fails to impress with its visuals and audio, it is an excellent addition to anyone's Nintendo DS library whether a gamer is casual or hardcore. The Washington Post criticized the same console version's $35 price tag, which it said was a bit too much for a game that has nothing new to add. In Japan, Famitsu gave the same DS version a score of two eights, one seven, and one eight for a total of 31 out of 40.

In the mid-1980s, Catholic education received full funding and all the Catholic junior high schools in Waterloo Region converted to high schools teaching grade 9 - 12 and OAC. The school bears its name after Monsignor E.A. Doyle, who was a much beloved and well-respected pastor of Cambridge. Much of his tenure was at St. Patrick Parish as a Catholic leader in the community. He was a man of religious commitment and in recognition of his many educational contributions, the school was named in his honor. School teams are known as the \\"Doyle\\" Mustangs and are known for their exceptional performance in Badminton, Wrestling, Track & Field, Soccer, and Volleyball. The school has received public attention several times over the years due to an Anti-Bullying initiative run by the school's leadership program which saw the school participate in Family Channels Stand Up Wave. CTV also arrived for the banning, and subsequent un-banning of girls shorts in early fall 2009, caused by female students rolling up and hemming the shorts. In mid-2007 the school saw a lockdown which lasted 2 hours. It is home to a generally large European and Newfoundlander population, and is one of the two Catholic High Schools in Cambridge, drawing students from most of South Galt. In 2006, the school received an addition onto the back of the school, adding fourteen classrooms and a second story, which removed the 12 portables that previously littered the area.

She is also a member of the duo Azure Ray with Orenda Fink. Taylor plays several instruments, including the piano, guitar, and drums, and has collaborated or performed with such artists as Bright Eyes, Moby, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., Joshua Radin, Nik Freitas and more. Biography Taylor started her musical career at the age of fifteen in the band Little Red Rocket with Orenda Fink which released two CDs on Geffen, Who Did You Pay (1997) and It's in the Sound (2000). The group disbanded during the merging of Geffen with Universal Music Group. Taylor later moved to Athens, Georgia along with her musical collaborator, Fink where they formed the band Azure Ray. The pair signed to WARM and released their self-titled debut in 2001. The song \\"Sleep\\" was later featured in the 2006 Academy Award- nominated movie, The Devil Wears Prada featuring Anne Hathaway. In 2015, Taylor Swift included \\"Sleep\\" in a 6-song \\"breakup playlist\\" made for a fan via her official Tumblr. Azure Ray released their second album, Burn and Shiver in 2002. Eric Bachmann (Crooked Fingers and Archers of Loaf) produced both records. After meeting the band in Athens, Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst invited the band on tour and introduced them to Saddle Creek. Saddle Creek released their following records, November EP, and The Drinks We Drank Last Night. In 2002, the duo co-wrote and recorded ‚ÄúThe Great Escape‚Äù (which appeared on Moby's 18) and ‚ÄúLanding‚Äù (which appeared on the XXX soundtrack), and afterwards joined Moby on tour. Following the release of 2003's Hold on Love, Taylor and Fink began a 6-year hiatus. Taylor released her first solo album 11:11 on Saddle Creek Records on May 24, 2005. The album features Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes, Gretta Cohn of Cursive, Andy LeMaster and Mike Mogis as both musicians and producers.

Overlook, Maria's 4th solo album, was released August 16, 2011.

Route description Intersection of SR 150 and US 31 in Hoover. Since the 1980s, many commercial developments have been built along SR 150 in Hoover. Several large retail developments, including the Riverchase Galleria and the Patton Creek shopping center, are located along or adjoining to this route. A strip center featuring a Wal-Mart Supercenter, Stein Mart, and Academy Sports + Outdoors opened in 2002 approximately west of the Riverchase Galleria. Hunter Street Baptist Church, one of the largest churches in Alabama, is located on this highway. The Hoover Metropolitan Stadium, formerly known as Regions Park, is accessible via the highway, as are the Oxmoor Valley course of the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail and the Ross Bridge Golf Resort and Spa. In Hoover, SR 150 has been designated as John Hawkins Parkway, in honor of the late Alabama state legislator who represented the city and southern Jefferson County. In Bessemer, SR 150 is referred to as 14th Street. History Before 1984, SR 150 was a two-lane highway from the Bessemer city limits to Hoover. However, residential, commercial, and institutional growth has led to the city of Hoover widening the highway from US 31 to I-459. Work began in May 2006 to widen SR 150 to five lanes from I-459 to Ross Bridge Parkway, a distance of approximately .

Gameplay Neverwinter Nights was developed with gameplay similar to other games in the Gold Box series. Players begin by creating a character. After creating the character, gameplay takes place on a screen that displays text interactions, the names and current status of one's party of characters, and a window which displays images of geography marked with various pictures of characters or events. When combat occurs, gameplay switches to full-screen combat mode, in which a player's characters and enemies are represented by icons which move around in the course of battle. The game features a hierarchical ranking of players based upon prowess in battle known as a Ladder. The most widely renowned of such Ladders, the World PVP Council (WPC) Ladder (PVP= Player Vs. Player), \\"rated as 'the' ladder to prove your mettle in Neverwinter\\".The Original Neverwinter Nights 1991-1997 Development Neverwinter Nights was a co- development of AOL, Beyond Software, SSI, and TSR. It was the first multiplayer online role-playing game to display graphics.Stormfront Studios Honored At 59th Annual Emmy Technology Awards For Creating First Graphical Online Role-Playing Game MCV, January 10, 2008 Don Daglow and the Beyond Software game design team began working with AOL on original online games in 1987, in both text-based and graphical formats. At the time AOL was a Commodore 64 only online service, known as Quantum Computer Services, with just a few thousand subscribers, and was called Quantum Link. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the need to support modem data transfer rates as slow as 300 bits per second (bit/s). In 1989 the Beyond Software team started working with SSI on Dungeons & Dragons games using the Gold Box engine that had debuted with Pool of Radiance in 1988. Within months they realized that it was technically feasible to combine the Dungeons & Dragons Gold Box engine with the community-focused gameplay of online titles to create an online role-playing video game with graphics although the multiplayer graphical flight combat game Air Warrior (also from Kesmai) had been online since 1987; all prior online RPGs had been based on text. In a series of meetings in San Francisco and Las Vegas with AOL's Steve Case and Kathi McHugh, TSR's Jim Ward and SSI's Chuck Kroegel, Daglow and programmer Cathryn Mataga convinced the other three partners that the project was indeed possible. Case approved funding for NWN and work began with the game going live 18 months later in March 1991. Daglow chose Neverwinter as the game's location because of its magical features (a river of warm water that flowed from a snowy forest into a northern sea), and its location near a wide variety of terrain types. The area also was close enough to the settings of the other Gold Box games to allow subplots to intertwine between the online and the disk-based titles. In late June 1997, America Online announced it would be closing down the online game world on July 19, 1997. The company also said it would start a new games channel called World Play, which would cost two dollars per hour to play. Neverwinter Nights was the only game in the company's roster which did not make the transition to the new service. Reception=Critical reception The game was reviewed in 1992 in Dragon #179 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming World wrote that \\"Fans of the Gold Box series know what to expect ... and the human element makes it that much better\\". According to GameSpy, \\"with hundreds of loyal players all adventuring in the same city between 1991 and 1997 when AOL pulled the plug, politics, guilds, and alliances quickly formed a social community that was far more important than the actual game\\". In 2008 Neverwinter Nights was honored (along with EverQuest and World of Warcraft) at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for advancing the art form of MMORPG games. Don Daglow accepted the award for project partners Beyond Software, AOL and Wizards of the Coast. Commercial performance The capacity of each server grew from 50 players in 1991 to 500 players by 1995. Ultimately, the game became a free part of the AOL subscriber service. Near the end of its run in 1997, the game had 115,000 players and typically hosted 2,000 adventurers during prime evening hours, a 4,000% increase over 1991.Gamers Claim AOL Is Playing Bait-and-Switch Wired, June 24, 1997 Legacy Much of the game's popularity was based on the presence of active and creative player guilds, who staged many special gaming events online for their members. It is this committed fan base that BioWare sought when they licensed the rights to Neverwinter Nights from AOL and TSR as the basis for the later Neverwinter Nights game.Neverwinter Nights Interview FiringSquad, September 17, 1999 NWN gained incidental media attention from AOL tech and marketing staff by appearing in the Don't Copy That Floppy campaign by the Software Publishers Association. In 1998, development work began on a clone of Neverwinter Nights called Forgotten World.12 Forgotten Online Games PCMag.com After the release of BioWare's non-MMO Neverwinter Nights game in 2002, a group of former Neverwinter Nights players used the Aurora toolset included with the new game to reconstruct the content of the original Neverwinter Nights and host it online as a multiplayer game, albeit with limited player capacity. Neverwinter Nights: Resurrection was modestly successful early on in drawing former Neverwinter Nights players, but player numbers dwindled over the years as online gaming options expanded and the underlying game technology aged. A post on IGN from the game's host revealed that Neverwinter Nights: Resurrection shut down its servers on July 31, 2012. nwvault.ign.com In 2012 a single- player conversion of Neverwinter Nights was released for Unlimited Adventures after two years of development.Neverwinter Nights-Offline UA Archive ReferencesExternal links *Neverwinter Nights on MobyGames *The Original Neverwinter Nights *UGO & GameBanshee interview on history of original NWN Category:1991 video games Category:AOL Category:DOS games Category:DOS-only games Category:Gold Box games Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Neverwinter Nights Category:Role-playing video games Category:Stormfront Studios games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Tactical role-playing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with oblique graphics ","title":"Neverwinter Nights (1991 video game)"},{"id":"4463720","text":"CTX is a computer virus created in Spain in 1999. CTX was initially discovered as part of the Cholera worm, with which the author intentionally infected with CTX. Although the Cholera worm had the capability to send itself via email, the CTX worm quickly surpassed it in prevalence. Cholera is now considered obsolete, while CTX remains in the field, albeit with only rare discoveries. In March 2006, CTX was in the news again due to a false positive in the McAfee VirusScan program that caused CTX detections in a range of innocuous files. Simbiosis Project and \\"Biocoding\\" The CTX virus originated as part of the \\"Simbiosis (sic) Project\\". The Simbiosis Project was an early attempt by the 29A virus writers group to combine Windows file infectors with Windows mass- mailing worms. This 'Project' was an attempt to see how successful this previously rare synthesis of malware threats was. Cholera/CTX is the only documented virus involved in the Simbiosis Project. Although CTX did gain some spread in the wild, this was remarkably more related to its file infection functions than the Cholera mass-mailing function. CTX was also a member of the \\"BioCoded\\" string of viruses. The \\"BioCoded\\" string seemed to have little to do with each other beyond being named after biological viruses. Other members of this group include Marburg, Dengue, HPS, the latter of which is a reference to Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. All \\"BioCoded\\" viruses have been listed on the WildList, including CTX. Despite their threatening names, CTX and all BioCoded viruses have no payload beyond graphics and, in some cases, deleting antivirus programs. Function of Cholera Worm By today's standards, Cholera is a fairly unremarkable mass-mailing worm, written in C++. However, Cholera was remarkable at its creation for its use of its own SMTP server. Unlike most worms of the day, which relied on installations of Microsoft Outlook or similar email programs, Cholera was capable of sending its own mails through internal mechanisms. Cholera sends its emails with the attachment SETUP.EXE, of 49,187 bytes in size. Emails are collected from files on the infected computer's hard drive. Cholera only spreads when another Internet-using application is open, to avoid detection in a time when dial-up modems were standard. When SETUP.EXE is executed, Cholera displays the fake error, \\"Cannot open file: it does not appear to be a valid archive. If you downloaded this file, try downloading the file again.\\" Cholera is also a network worm, inserting itself into the Windows folders of computers available through Network Neighborhood. Finally, Cholera will add itself to either WIN.INI (Windows 95 and similar flavours) or the Registry (Windows NT and similar flavours). CTX infection routine Upon execution, whether from an infected file or the Cholera dropper, CTX will check to see if its payload routine should activate (see Payload). If not, CTX will infect EXE files. CTX has a polymorphic nature, which is neither particularly simple or complex in nature. CTX also obscures the entry point of files to avoid detection. The virus avoids infecting more than five files in a given folder to avoid detection. Files infecting with CTX are padded to a multiple of 101 bytes to avoid re- infections. Payload CTX has a non-destructive payload which rarely activates. If a file is executed exactly six months to the hour after infection, and the video requirements are sufficient, CTX will go into an infinite loop of inverting the desktop colours. Prevalence The WildList, an organization tracking computer viruses, included CTX on its list of threats found in the field from November 2001 to May 2005. McAfee false positive On 17 March 2006, McAfee, makers of VirusScan, announced that a false positive had caused the CTX virus to be detected in a number of common, innocent files, including Microsoft Excel.

Early life Estopinal was born in St. Bernard Parish, which is located to the east of New Orleans. He was a son of Joseph Estopinal (1816‚Äì1881) and the former Felicia Gonzales (1821‚Äì1865). Their ancestors came from the Canary Islands, Spain. Settlers in Louisiana from the Canaries are known as Isle√±os. Felicia was Joseph's second wife. Both were natives of St. Bernard Parish. Estopinal attended public and private schools in St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans. Confederate Army service In 1862, at the age of seventeen, Estopinal left school to enlist as a soldier in the St. Bernard Guards of the 28th Louisiana Regiment of the Confederate Army. He began as an orderly sergeant in Company G. He fought in the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou in December 1862, the opening exchange of what became in July 1863 the decisive Battle of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in which he commanded a squad which transported prisoners from Indianola in Sunflower County in northwestern Mississippi, to Libby on the Gulf Coast. On three occasions, Estopinal led the movement of prisoners to the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. After Vicksburg, Estopinal was assigned to the quartermaster's department in Meridan in eastern Mississippi and then to the campaign in Mobile, Alabama, during which he was attached to the 22nd Louisiana Regiment Heavy Artillery. He surrendered and was paroled at Meridian. Throughout the war Estopinal was neither wounded nor taken prisoner. By the time Estopinal went to Congress, his colleagues addressed him as \\"General,\\" but the biographical sketches do not indicate his rank beyond the beginning duty as orderly sergeant. The use of \\"General\\" in this instance may have been honorary. Family and business After the war, Estopinal for five years engaged in merchandising at New Orleans. In 1868, he married the former Eliska Legier (1850‚Äì1925), the daughter of Francis and Octavia Legier of New Orleans. Educated in France, Francis Legier earned his livelihood as a merchant in New Orleans. He was also a former municipal street commissioner in New Orleans before the establishment of the mayor-council government. Albert and Eliska had ten children, including Albert Jr., Fernando, Joseph, Benjamin, Ren√©, Clement, David, Leonidas, Frederick, and Lelia. Albert Estopinal Jr., became a St. Bernard Parish politician too, serving as parish judge and as sheriff at the time of his father's death. Estopinal Jr., was later allied with the political boss Leander Perez, who unsuccessfully fought desegregation in the mid-20th century. By 1870, Estopinal acquired Kenilworth Plantation, built in 1759 and used originally as a military outpost in St. Bernard Parish. Under Estopinal, Kenilworth consisted of 1,600 acres plus another 400 noncontiguous acres. It was located on the route of the New Orleans & Gulf Railroad. Kenilworth was considered at the time to have been one of the best managed properties in St. Bernard Parish, with acreage devoted to vegetables as well as sugar, the principal cash crop. Political career Estopinal's public service began after the Civil War, when he served two two-year terms from 1868 to 1872 as the St. Bernard Parish tax assessor. In 1872 and again in 1874, he was elected sheriff of St. Bernard Parish. From 1876 to 1880, he was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, elected to a single four-year term. In 1879 and 1898, Estopinal was a member of the two Louisiana state constitutional conventions. A third would be held two years after his death. From 1880 to 1900, he served in the Louisiana State Senate, having been elected to five four-year terms. From 1900 to 1904, Estopinal was the Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana under Governor William Wright Heard, a native of Union Parish in north Louisiana who spent the bulk of his career in New Orleans. Estopinal succeeded Robert H. Snyder of Tensas Parish as lieutenant governor. Snyder had served under Wright's predecessor, Murphy James Foster Sr. In 1908, Estopinal was the chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee; a powerful position in a then one-party state. From 1908 to 1919, he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and served until his death in office. Few Louisiana politicians served in as many offices as Estopinal and for as long a period of time. He was in office continuously from 1868 to 1919 except for the period from 1904 to 1908. During his service in the Louisiana House, he was assigned to the Education and Parochial Affairs committees. During his last term in the Louisiana Senate, he was chairman of the committee handling state government audits and oversight functions. Estopinal was elected to Congress upon the death of Adolph Meyer. In the spring of 1919, he died in office, just a few months into his sixth term. His tenure corresponded with the administrations of Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson. He served on the Naval Affairs Committee. In 1912, he was an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which met in Baltimore, Maryland, and nominated the successful Woodrow Wilson- Thomas Marshall ticket, a slate which easily prevailed in heavily Democratic Louisiana and nationwide as well. At the convention, Estopinal was a member on the Committee on Rules and Order of Business. In Congress, Estopinal missed about one-half of all roll call votes between 1908 and 1919. He cast no votes during March 1919, the month preceding his death. In addition to the offices previously cited, Estopinal served on the St. Bernard Parish Police Jury, equivalent to the county commission in other states. The dates of police jury service are not included in the sketch of Estopinal in A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography. Another source, however, indicates that he was the police jury president after 1884 and was still in that position in 1892, when Estopinal was also a state senator. At the time, it was possible to serve simultaneously in the state legislature and a part-time parish office. Such double-dipping continued into the 20th century. Another who served simultaneously in two positions was Earl Williamson, a local politician in Caddo Parish in north Louisiana, who was both a police juror and the mayor of Vivian. Estopinal was also a founding member of Lake Borgne Levee District. Death and legacy Estopinal died at Kenilworth and is interred at St. Louis Cemetery III in New Orleans.The Political Graveyard indicates that Estopinal died in New Orleans, which is eighteen miles to the west of Kenilworth. Perhaps the website used the name \\"New Orleans\\" to refer to the general area, instead of the specific city. While still living in 1892, Estopinal was hailed in a biographical memoir, accordingly: \\"Honorable Mr. Estopinal is well and favorably known throughout the state of Louisiana, as a wide-awake, thoroughgoing man. He has served his parish in a great many responsible positions, and highly deserves the respect and esteem with which he is regarded.\\"Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Louisiana, Vol. I (Chicago, Illinois: Goodspeed Publishing Company, 1892, pp. 403‚Äì404. Estopinal's legislative colleague James Benjamin Aswell of Natchitoches, a former president of Northwestern State University, delivered a moving eulogy on the House floor on behalf of his friend: > General Estopinal's life should be an inspiration to young men everywhere. > He was clean of mind and pure in heart. His ideals were lofty and his > purpose always noble. As a man, he was a prince among men ‚Äì suave, gracious, > courtly, and dignified. No one ever doubted his sincerity or questioned his > integrity. He never quibbled or dodged. High spirited and courageous, he > feared no man; yet considerate and forgiving, he loved his fellow man with a > passionate love. Modest to the point of timidity, his personality commanded > respect and impelled admiration.

A gallant and fearless Confederate soldier of unfaltering bravery > during the Civil War, a trusted public officer for forty-seven years, no man > ever enjoyed more continuous love and confidence than did Albert Estopinal > in Louisiana. We mourn with his bereaved family, but we console them with > the reflection that his long and honorable career leaves behind him for them > a brilliant record of distinguished service of which they and the whole > country may well be proud. Representative Ladislas Lazaro of Ville Platte in Evangeline Parish, described his colleague as: > well-nigh perfect in proportion and build. His features were of finest line, > his bearing was one of gracious dignity and unostentatious knightliness, his > gentlemanish came from the heart out. It was inbred; it was the warp and > woof of his spirit. Intellectually, I think we must justly say that he was > profound. He had a thoroughly disciplined mind.

Other lawmakers offered remarks of sympathy on the passing of Estopinal, including some from outside Louisiana.

Examples Tactical media projects are often a mix between art and activism, which explains why many of its roots can be traced to various art movements. It has been suggested by tactical media theorist Geert Lovink that \\"discourse plus art equals spectacle\\", reflecting its striking and memorable nature. Although there are no strict mediums through which it operates, tactical media can often have very high aesthetic value, adding to its \\"spectacle\\" and reinforcing some of its artistic roots. GWbush.com In 1998, computer programmer and political activist Zack Exley purchased a domain and created a website titled GWbush.com. He invited the group RTMark (pronounced Art Mark) to build a copy of George W. Bush's official website, as they had done for some corporate websites. Later, Zack Exley changed the website to be a more mainstream satire (drawing criticism from RTMark), posting a fake press release from the Bush campaign announcing a promise to \\"pardon all drug prisoners as long as they've learned from their past mistakes\\". In the midst of Bush's campaign for office, the website not only received millions of hits, but also received coverage from such organizations as ABC News, USA Today and Newsweek. This phenomenon can be classified as tactical media because of its conformance to its corresponding criteria. Tactical air force In 2000, Mexico's Zapatista Army of National Liberation social movement decided to launch a \\"tactical air force\\". The Zapatistas' air force consisted of hundreds of paper airplanes. After throwing the planes over the fence of a federal barrack, confused troops were quick to point their rifles at the paper intruders, creating an image that conveyed a very strong message of peace versus war‚Äîthe target ultimately being the government. Comparisons It has often been compared to culture jamming, as both use many of the same techniques in an attempt to occupy the public space controlled by mass media. Where the two practices differ is in their way to obtain this public space; while culture jamming consists of a response to the dominant practices within it, tactical media uses the dominant practices in order to penetrate it and become part of it. Tactical media has also been compared to alternative media. It differs from the latter by its manner in dealing with mass media where alternative media does not seek to infiltrate the dominant by a quick tactic; it attempts to oppose it by proposing what its name suggests: an alternative to the dominant.

It crossed Okanagan Lake, connecting the Westside area to Kelowna on the lake's eastern side. Taller boats such as sailboats were able to pass under the lift span which was located at the east end of the bridge. Completed in 1958, the bridge was the first of its kind in Canada. The bridge was partially funded through tolls, which were collected from its opening until April 1, 1963.Okanagan Map Guides' Okanagan Lake Bridge page Originally the bridge only had 2 lanes, (1 in each direction), but in 1984 the bridge deck was reconfigured and a third lane was added. This new lane became a counter-flow lane, and would allow the lanes to adjust to traffic demand at different times of the day. In 1991 the bridge underwent major electrical repairs and a breakwater was removed. The bridge served as an important regional transportation link in the Okanagan Valley, joining the southward section of Highway 97 on the west side of the lake to the northward section on the east side, and connecting Westbank and other southern points to Lake Country and other northern points. Replacement The floating bridge was replaced as it outlived its usefulness and was incapable of supporting the traffic levels. The construction of the new replacement bridge‚Äîthe William R. Bennett Bridge‚Äîbegan in 2005 and was completed in 2008. The new bridge opened on May 25, 2008, and the old bridge closed May 31, 2008. It was decommissioned in 2009. SNC-Lavlin is the company in charge of construction and maintenance for of the William R. Bennett Bridge for the next 30 years.

He was the race caller for NBC Sports from 1984 through 2010, and served as the announcer for the New York Racing Association from 1990 until his retirement in 2014. For his career-long dedication, he was awarded the Eclipse Award of Merit in January 2015.http://www.nyra.com/aqueduct/tom-durkin-to-receive-eclipse-award- of-merit/ Life and career Durkin was born in Chicago, Illinois. He studied drama at The St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin. In 1971, he was hired as a race caller at Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred races at county fairs in Wisconsin. He did this each summer through 1975, then the following year was employed by the Daily Racing Form as a call taker responsible for documenting the comments and statistics used in the official charts of the races at Cahokia Downs and Thistledown Racecourse. He went on to work as a race caller at Florida Downs in Oldsmar, Florida, Miles Park (race track) in Louisville, Kentucky, Quad City Downs in East Moline, Illinois, Balmoral Park Racetrack in Crete, Illinois, Hialeah Park Race Track in Hialeah, Florida, Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Florida, and in 1990 was hired to call races at the New York Racing Association's Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course. In 1980, Durkin appeared as a contestant on the game show Match Game PM and won $1,000. Durkin served as the Breeders Cup's chief TV voice from its inception through 2005 and was a longtime broadcaster on NBC as part of the network's sportscasting crew for horse races, providing analysis, commentary and features in addition to the descriptions of races. Durkin earned fame in this decade from calling the U.S. Triple Crown races for NBC, which took over the coverage of the events in 2001. Due to his contract with NBC, Durkin no longer called Breeders' Cup races, starting from 2006, as those races moved to ESPN. However, he continued calling the Belmont Stakes, which air on ABC, because of his position as the track announcer at Belmont Park. Like his predecessor, Marshall Cassidy, Durkin was also a TV voice on important stakes races on ESPN beyond the Triple Crown and Breeders' Cup series. At The Meadowlands, Durkin called the match race in the 1989 Hambletonian Stakes harness race between Park Avenue Joe and Probe; the horses finished in a dead heat, becoming the only co-winners of the prestigious race. He made a flub during the 2009 Kentucky Derby when he failed to notice the eventual winner, Mine That Bird, take a three-length lead in the home stretch. Durkin kept calling the names of the horses in second and third place and ignored the front runner until just before the horse crossed the finish line. On April 26, 2011, Durkin announced his decision to not to renew his contract with NBC Sports, citing stress. On May 10, 2014, Durkin announced that he would retire from his announcer position on August 31, near the end of the 2014 Saratoga meet. He owed his \\"inexpressible gratitude\\" to the racing fans and horseplayers in his retirement speech following his final race call.

Background Denman was born in Germiston, Gauteng, South Africa. A part-time jockey and exercise rider, he started as a race caller in his native South Africa in 1971 at age 18. He called two races at Santa Anita Park in 1983 and was hired that year as the announcer of the track's Oak Tree meet. He was named Santa Anita's permanent announcer the following year. He has also called races at Del Mar Racetrack, Pimlico Race Course, Laurel Park Racecourse and Hollywood Park Racetrack. In December 2015, Denman announced that he would be retiring as Santa Anita's race caller after 33 years. He plans to continue calling races at Del Mar, while spending the rest of the time either on his Minnesota farm or traveling. Style He is best known for the phrase \\"And away they go...\\", spoken as the horses emerge from the starting gate. Some other phrases that Denman has coined are popular with racing fans, such as \\"scraping the paint\\", used to describe a horse who is saving ground (running very close to the inner rail). Another is \\"they would need to sprout wings to catch ______ ...\\" when a horse is leading by an insurmountable margin in the stretch. A similar phrase used in the same context is \\"he's [or she's] out here moving like a winner...\\" \\"______ looks like he jumped in at the quarter pole...\\" is used when a horse comes from far back and is running so fast as to give the impression that he has only just started to run. Finally, another well known Denman phrase is, \\"_________ is coming like an express train!\\" This phrase is used when a horse is running right by leading horses in the stretch. He owns a three-year-old filly in South Africa, named Top Twenty, trained by Paul Lafferty. Breeders' Cup Denman was the voice of the Breeders' Cup when it aired on ESPN. He replaced Tom Durkin, who had been the race caller since the inception. During the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic, Denman made perhaps his most famous call when undefeated Zenyatta came from behind to win the race. Denman called, \\"Zenyatta has a lot, a lot of ground to make up.... If she wins this she will be a super horse.\\" Denman delivered this call as Zenyatta took the lead. \\"Zenyatta's come to the outside. Zenyatta coming, flying on the grandstand side... THIS, IS, UN-BELIEVABLE!\\" Other media In the 1989 comedy movie Let It Ride starring Richard Dreyfuss and Terri Garr, Denman is the track announcer that is heard in many of the racetrack scenes that took place at Hialeah Park in Hialeah, Florida. Trevor Denman was also the announcer in the movie Racing Stripes during the race. Denman was the unnamed race announcer in the animated television show The Simpsons episode #239, aired originally in February 2000, entitled Saddlesore Galactica. He had a recurring role in the HBO series Luck, in his real-life job at Santa Anita. Denman also makes an appearance in a Verizon commercial.

Romero, and starring Jan White, Raymond Laine, and Anne Muffly. The film follows a housewife in suburban Pittsburgh who becomes involved in witchcraft after meeting a local witch. Described by Romero himself as a \\"feminist film,\\" Season of the Witch was originally made under the title Jack's Wife, with a small crew, giving Romero the duties of an editor, cinematographer and screenwriter. The film's distributor cut major parts of the film and changed its title to Hungry Wives, marketing it as a softcore pornography film. The film failed to find an audience on its initial release and was re-released years later under the title Season of the Witch. Plot Joan Mitchell (Jan White) is the 39-year- old wife of a businessman, Jack Mitchell (Bill Thunhurst). They live in suburban Pittsburgh with their 19-year-old daughter Nikki (Joedda McClain), a college student. Joan is attractive for her age, but unhappy and discontented with her housewife role. Jack is successful, but busy, domineering, and occasionally violent, embarking on long business trips every week. Joan has been seeing a psychotherapist because of her recurring dreams about her husband controlling her. He makes repeated references to needing to \\"kick some ass\\"‚Äîa colleague's, his own child's, his wife's. Eventually, he strikes Joan in the face. Joan and her friends learn about a new woman in the neighborhood named Marion Hamilton (Virginia Greenwald) who is rumored to practice witchcraft. Prompted by curiosity, Joan and one of her friends, Shirley (Anne Muffley), drive over to Marion's house one night for a Tarot reading. It turns out that Marion is the leader of a local secret witches' coven. Joan and Shirley drive home to Joan's house, where they meet Gregg (Raymond Laine), a student teacher at Nikki's college (with whom Nikki has a very casual sexual relationship). The four drink and talk. Gregg shows an interest in Joan, who rebuffs him. Joan throws Gregg out of her house after he cruelly tricks Shirley into believing that she has smoked pot. After taking Shirley home, Joan returns home to hear Nikki and Gregg having sex. Turned on, she quietly goes to her bedroom and begins touching herself until Nikki walks in on her. The next day, a furious Nikki leaves without telling anybody where she is going, and soon afterward Jack leaves for yet another one-week business trip, with Joan feeling more lonely than ever. Joan buys a book about witchcraft. She conjures a spell to make Gregg attracted to her, and soon they are engaged in an affair. She also has increasingly terrifying nightmares, in which she is attacked by an intruder wearing a Satanic mask. As she explores witchcraft further, practicing rituals and researching spells, Joan's world continues to change. The police tell Joan they have found Nikki in Buffalo, New York and that she will be coming home in three or four days. After one last sexual encounter with Gregg, Joan tells him she does not want to see him again. After another terrifying nightmare involving the masked intruder, Joan shoots and kills her husband, who has unexpectedly returned home early from his trip. Whether this event is accidental or intentional is not revealed. Joan is initiated into Marion's coven in an elaborate and campy ritual. The language used by the women makes reference to treasuring each coven member as part of the sisterhood. Cleared of her husband's death, which was ruled an accident, Joan attends a party with her friends. Prompted by a compliment on her beautiful and youthful appearance, she quietly reveals that she is a witch. She smiles wryly when people around her refer to as \\"Mrs. Mitchell\\", or simply \\"Jack's wife\\". CastProduction The film originally began production under the title of Jack's Wife. Romero got the idea for the film after reading about witchcraft for a different project. While working with public television in Pittsburgh, Romero became aware of the Feminist movement, which also influenced his script. The film was shot with a small crew in 1972 on 16mm film in the North Hills suburbs and Pittsburgh. It suffered from production problems when the original budget of $250,000 was lowered to $100,000. Romero was pressured by the distributor to make two sex scenes between the characters of Joan and Gregg pornographic, but refused. Style In 1973, Romero described the film as \\"not really\\" being a horror film, but as a film that deals with the occult peripherally. Release Romero had trouble finding distributors for the film. In 1973, Romero described that distributors were finding the film \\"too wordy\\". The film was distributed by Jack H. Harris and re-titled Hungry Wives! on its initial release in 1973, with screenings beginning on February 14. Several cuts were made to the film, reducing its original runtime of 130 minutes to 89. The film was promoted as a softcore pornography film and failed to find an audience on its initial release. After the success of Romero's Dawn of the Dead in 1978, the film was re-released under the title Season of the Witch. Home media Both the original film negative and Romero's original cut of the film are lost. Parts of Romero's original version have been found and re-edited into a home video version of the film which currently runs 104 minutes. Anchor Bay released the film under its Season of the Witch title in 2005 on DVD at its partly-restored 104 minute running time. The DVD contains featurettes on the film, other works of Romero and promotional material and Romero's earlier film There's Always Vanilla. In November 2017, the film was released in a restored version by Arrow Films on Blu-ray in a multi-disc set entitled Between Night and Dawn, which also contains the Romero films There's Always Vanilla and The Crazies. Reception In 1980, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote a negative review for Hungry Wives!, stating that the film \\"has the seedy look of a porn film but without any pornographic action. Everything in it, from the actors to the props, looks borrowed and badly used.\\" Kim Newman (the Monthly Film Bulletin) compared to the film to Romero's Martin, stating that the latter \\"managed to exploit the hybrid of tatty realism and vampire lore quite fruitfully, but Jack's Wife is fatally unsure of its approach.\\" Newman noted that the acting varies from the \\"nicely underplayed (Jan White, Virginia Greenwald) through the desperately hammy (Anne Muffly) to the dangerously laid-back (Ray Laine).\\" The review concluded that \\"there is enough evidence here of Romero's quirky talent to maintain interest throughout\\" In a review of the Season Of The Witch home video, The A.V. Club compared the film to Romero's Night of the Living Dead stating that the film \\"looks significantly less impressive [...] Where Night Of The Living Dead sandwiched some undistinguished, talky bits featuring actors of widely varying skill between the zombie horror, Season Of The Witch is nearly all undistinguished talky bits featuring actors of widely varying skill. Frankly, it‚Äôs kind of a slog.\\" Slant Magazine gave the film a four out of five star rating, calling the film Romero's Belle du Jour. Online film database Allmovie gave a mixed review for the film noting poor production quality, \\"wildly uneven acting\\", and that the film is \\"burdened both by its directness and its talkiness\\". The review went on to note that \\"this is as effective a film as the director has made, in many respects years ahead of its time, assuming a position more extreme than The Stepford Wives or even, for the most part, Thelma and Louise.\\" TV Guide gave the film one star out of four, referring to the film as \\"One of the most problematic entries in George Romero's filmography\\", noting cheap production and poor acting. Scholar Bernice Murphy referred to the film as \\"cheaply made and jarringly edited,\\" and noted it as an effort for Romero to distance himself from the supernatural horror themes he had become known for.

It is in the shape of the letter C. Before the completion of Interstate 65 (I-65), SR 149 was the truck route of U.S. Route 31 (US 31) and US 280\\\\. Route description The southern terminus of SR 149 is at a folded diamond-type interchange with US 280 (internally designated as SR 38) just southwest of Mountain Brook. Although signed as a north‚Äìsouth highway, it initially travels to the southwest along Shades Creek Parkway. The highway passes Colonial Brookwood Village, one of the larger shopping malls in the Birmingham metro area and then enters Homewood, whereupon Shades Creek Parkway intersects US 31 (Montgomery Parkway; internally designated as SR 3) at a cloverleaf interchange and the name of the road changes to Lakeshore Drive. Along Lakeshore Drive, SR 149 passes the campus of Samford University. At the intersection of Lakeshore Drive and Green Springs Highway, SR 149 turns to the north-northwest and is routed along Green Springs Highway, continuing in Homewood until the route crosses the crest of Red Mountain, where the route enters the city limits of Birmingham. SR 149 closely parallels I-65 for approximately until it approaches the campus of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Here the state route has an interchange with I-65, although there are no trailblazers on I-65 indicating that the two routes junction. Near this interchange, the name of Green Springs Highway changes to University Boulevard and northbound SR 149 curves to the northeast. After the interchange with I-65, SR 149 passes through the heart of the UAB campus. Bartow Arena, home of the UAB Blazers basketball teams, is located less than north of SR 149\\\\. In addition, Regions Field, the home of the Birmingham Barons minor league baseball team is less than north of the highway. SR 149 also provides direct access to several Birmingham-area hospitals, including UAB Hospital and Children's of Alabama. East of the UAB campus and the hospitals, SR 149 continues approximately until it reaches its northern terminus at a folded-diamond interchange with US 31/US 280 (Elton B. Stephens Expressway). There are no signs on US 31 south/US 280 east to alert motorists that they are meeting SR 149; however, recently installed signs on US 31 north/US 280 west inform motorists of the interchange with the highway.

Perhaps best known as half of the duo Azure Ray, Fink is also a member of Art in Manila, O+S, Harouki Zombi, Closeness, and High Up, and has played with or appeared as a guest on records by Bright Eyes, Conor Oberst, Moby, The Faint, Pete Yorn, and others. She is married to Todd Fink (formerly Todd Baechle) of The Faint. Biography Born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1975, Fink started her musical career at the age of fifteen in the band Little Red Rocket. The band released two CDs, Who Did You Pay (1997, Tim/Kerr) and It's in the Sound (2000, Monolyth Record Group). After the group disbanded, Fink and her bandmate Maria Taylor moved to Athens, Georgia, where they formed Azure Ray. (Drummer Louis Schefano would go on to be a founding member of Remy Zero). The pair signed to Warm Records and released two albums, their self-titled debut in 2001, and Burn and Shiver in 2002, both produced by Eric Bachmann (Archers of Loaf, Crooked Fingers). After meeting Bright Eyes front man Conor Oberst in Athens, he invited the duo on tour and introduced them to Saddle Creek Records. Also in 2002, Fink and Taylor co-wrote and recorded two songs with Moby - \\"The Great Escape\\" (which appeared on his album 18) and ‚ÄúLanding‚Äù (which appeared on the XXX soundtrack) - and afterwards joined him on tour. Saddle Creek released Azure Ray's November EP later in 2002, as well as their third album, Hold On Love, and its single, \\"The Drinks We Drank Last Night\\", in 2003, after which the band went on a six-year hiatus. Fink released her first solo album, Invisible Ones, on August 23, 2005. She said she had a spiritual awakening while in Haiti and her solo music is inspired, in part, by Haitian folk music. In 2006, she formed a new band, Art in Manila (originally called Art Bell), with members of The Good Life, The Anniversary, and others. Saddle Creek released the band's album, Set the Woods On Fire, on August 7, 2007. On November 30, 2008, Azure Ray reformed for a one-off show at Los Angeles's iconic Troubadour. The duo was accompanied by Andy LeMaster of Now It's Overhead and Nick White of Tilly and the Wall. Earlier in 2008, Fink began collaborating with a long-time friend, Remy Zero bassist Cedric LeMoyne, on a project called O+S. Their songs were initially inspired by sounds she had recorded in Haiti, among other places, and loops crafted by LeMoyne out of those recordings. O+S' self-titled debut album was released on March 24, 2009 by Saddle Creek. The following October, Fink released her second solo album, Ask the Night, which Pitchfork called more \\"austere and rustic\\" with \\"intricate soundscapes\\". The single \\"High Ground\\" features guest vocals by Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse; another single, \\"Why Is the Night Sad\\", had been previously played by Azure Ray at their 2008 reunion show. In 2009, Taylor announced on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic that Azure Ray was reforming on a semi-permanent basis to play \\"five or six\\" shows, then beginning work on a new album. Their fourth album, Drawing Down the Moon, was released in September 2010Pitchfork.com. New Release: Azure Ray: Drawing Down the Moon Retrieved 30 Nov 2012. An outtake from those sessions, \\"Silverlake\\", featuring Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, was released as a standalone digital single in 2011. Later in 2011, Fink began another collaborative project, this time with occasional Of Montreal member Nina Barnes; \\"after hanging out together in Athens, Georgia\\", they \\"decided to form a DJing and performance art duo\\" called Harouki Zombi. As part of their performance exploring the \\"dark and the light of the female condition\\", Barnes and Fink incorporated zombies, sword battles, strawberries and whipped cream, paint and glitter, and Asian aesthetic influences into their earlier shows as part of a \\"hedonistic celebration of all life's earthly delights\\". Rolling Stone premiered their track \\"The Swamp Theme\\" on October 28, 2011, and their debut release, a double 7-inch vinyl single called \\"Objet Petit A\\", was released in November 2012. Also in 2012, Fink and a pregnant Taylor entered the studio to record new Azure Ray material in collaboration with Andy LeMaster and Todd Fink. A six-song EP, As Above So Below, was released on September 5, 2012, on Saddle Creek. Fink began recording her third solo album in December 2013, working with her \\"dream team\\" of Ben Brodin, Todd Fink, and Bill Rieflin. She was \\"inspired to write the songs...after her beloved dog of 16 years, Wilson, passed away\\" and she later began \\"writing in a dream journal every day, [when] the ideas of the album came forth\\". The resulting album, Blue Dream, was released by Saddle Creek on August 19, 2014. NPR praised it as a \\"collection of distinctly futuristic love songs\\". In November 2015, Fink underwent emergency heart surgery for an issue she'd been aware of since childhood, but had never dealt withhttps://www.cambridgeday.com/2018/11/22/closeness-celebrates-love-in-its- own-dark-way-after-a-matter-of-the-heart-big-enough-for-two/.

Although she and her husband Todd had talked about starting a band together numerous times since getting married in 2005, they finally began working on a new project in early 2016, eventually taking the name Closeness. Meanwhile, that December, Harouki Zombi reunited for a final performance in Omaha, titled \\"Harouki Zombi: An Aradian Exorcism\\". Personality Therapy, the debut EP by Closeness, was released on February 24, 2017, via Graveface Records. That same year, O+S released their second record, You Were Once the Sun, Now You're the Moon, on Saddle Creek. Fink had also spent 2017 working on a new band with her sister, Christine Fink, called High Up. Their debut album, called You Are Here, was released on Conor Oberst's label, Team Love Records. Atwood Magazine reviewed the album positively, calling it \\"passionate, heartfelt and energetic\\", \\"soulful\\", and \\"a raw, intimate portrait of turmoil and inner strength\\". The previous November, Azure Ray announced that they would once again reunite for a one-off show in Los Angeles on January 20, 2018. On September 26, Stereogum premiered a new Azure Ray single called \\"Palindrome\\", heralding the release of their first new record in six years, the Waves (Azure Ray EP)Waves EP, on October 26, 2018, this time on Maria Taylor's own label, Flower Moon Records.

The smaller muscles around the heart are worked on first before the larger muscles around the body's periphery. The technique requires the exerciser to continuously exercise over a long period of time with no breaks. It is typically performed using multi-muscle exercises such as squats, pulls and presses and follow a specific strategy so that no one muscle is covered in two corresponding exercises.

The Academy was established in 1971 to recognise and champion excellence in the social sciences and to provide evidence-based advice on a range of social policy issues. The Academy consists of an elected Fellowship of almost 700 distinguished Australian social science researchers and professionals who work together to: * Provide advice to governments on issues of national importance; * Promote understanding and awareness of the social sciences; and * Coordinate international cooperation and collaboration in the social sciences.  Origins  ASSA's functions were originally fulfilled through the Social Science Research Council of Australia, which was founded in 1942. A timeline of events leading up to ASSA's formation in 1971 is as follows: * 1942 ‚Äì Members of the Australian National Research Council propose the establishment of a Social Science Research Council. * 1943 ‚Äì The Australian National Research Council considers the proposal and establishes a Social Science Research Committee. * 1952 ‚Äì Nine years later, the Social Science Research Committee resolves to become an autonomous body. A draft constitution for the new body is accepted by the Australian National Research Council and all members of the Committee are invited to become members of the new Social Science Research Council of Australia. * 1953 ‚Äì The new Council holds its first meeting with a membership of 44. * 1957 ‚Äì The Social Science Research Council becomes an incorporated association. * 1970 ‚Äì The Council adopts a recommendation that it become the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia. * 1971 ‚Äì The Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia is incorporated on 7 July 1971. The 96 members of the Council become Fellows of the Academy.  Fellowship  Fellows of the Academy include Australia‚Äôs leading researchers and practitioners across the breadth of social science disciplines, as well as a number of honorary Fellows (those who have made significant contributions to the social sciences beyond research), and overseas Fellows working outside of Australia. To become a Fellow of the Academy individuals must be nominated by three existing Fellows, and have demonstrated an outstanding contribution to one or more fields of social science research or practice in Australia. Nominations are considered by the Academy‚Äôs disciplinary Panels, by independent assessors, then by the Membership Committee before being put to a vote of Academy Fellows in a general ballot. As of 2020, there are over 680 Fellows of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (FASSA). On election, each Fellow is assigned to one of four panels, depending on their discipline: *Panel A: Anthropology, Demography, Geography, Linguistics, Sociology, Management. *Panel B: Accounting, Economics, Economic History, Marketing, Statistics. *Panel C: History, Law, Philosophy, Political Science. *Panel D: Education, Psychology, Social Medicine.  Governance  The Academy is an incorporated association and a registered charity with Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status. It is governed by an elected President and Executive Committee responsible for strategy and direction, and its National Office is led by a CEO responsible for day to day management. Sub-Committees of the Executive include the Finance Committee, the Membership Committee, the Policy and Advocacy Committee, the Public Forums and Communications Committee and the Workshops Committee. The President serves a three-year term with an additional year as President-Elect and two-years as Immediate Past-President. From 1 January 2020, the Committee is composed of *President (Chair): Jane Hall (2019‚Äì2021) *Immediate Past President: Glenn Withers (2019‚Äì2020) *Treasurer: Wai Fong Chua (2019‚Äì2021) *International Secretary: James J.

A small team of staff work closely with the Academy‚Äôs committees and Fellows to manage all aspects of the Academy‚Äôs programs.  Events, Awards, and Workshops  Each year, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia hosts and supports a wide range of social science or policy- focused lectures, forums, roundtables and other events around the country. Many of these events are free of charge and open to the public.  Events  The Annual Symposium is the highlight of the Academy‚Äôs calendar. Convened by one or more Fellows and held over a full day in November , the Annual Symposium is a public forum examining an important issue in the social sciences and/or public policy arena. The Academy also hosts a series of lectures over the year. These include, but are not limited to: * Cunningham Lecture ‚Äî presented by an eminent social scientist as part of the Annual events immediately following the Symposium. The Cunningham Lecture is named in honour of Professor Kenneth Stewart Cunningham, Founding President of the Social Science Resarch Council. * Fay Gale Lecture ‚Äî presented each year by a distinguished female social scientist. * Keith Hancock Lecture ‚Äî presented each year by a distinguished social scientist nominated by the Academy Fellows. * Paul Bourke Lectures ‚Äî presented each year by each recipient of the Paul Bourke Awards for Early Career Research. * Peter Karmel Forum ‚Äî held each year to provoke public discussion on a particular policy of Australian government, the policy making process itself, or comparisons of policies or policy processes found in Australia with those found in other jurisdictions.  Awards  The Paul Bourke Awards for Early Career Research are named in honour of the Academy‚Äôs past president Paul Francis Bourke (1938‚Äì1999) who was a product of the History school at the University of Melbourne and went on to become one of the first Australian historians to obtain American style doctoral training. Whilst at Flinders University, he served as Professor of American Studies and also as Pro-Vice Chancellor. From Flinders University, he went on to become the Director of the RSSS at the Australian National University and also served as the President of The Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (1993‚Äì1997). Amongst scholars, the contribution Paul made to the field of performance measurement is considered to be invaluable. Based on nominations from Fellows, each Panel of the Academy will select one outstanding scholar to receive one of four Paul Bourke Awards. It is the intention of the Academy that the awards are presented to social science researchers who, at the time of nomination, do not yet hold an Associate Professor or Professorial appointment. Such persons are normally within five years of receiving their doctorate, but allowances are made for career interruptions. The awards consist of a Citation and Medallion presented to each of the four winners at the Academy Annual Dinner. With the agreement of the winners‚Äô home university, a jointly-sponsored lecture will be delivered by each of the winners during the year following receipt of the awards. The winners will also prepare a promotional article on their research to be published by the Academy.  Workshops  The Academy‚Äôs long-standing Workshop Program provides small grants to support interdisciplinary meetings discussing contemporary policy or research issues of interest to the social sciences. The workshops usually run for two-days and involve around 20 invited experts; mostly from the research sector, but also where relevant from government, the community sector or industry. It is a condition of funding that workshops are gender balanced in terms of speakers and participants, and include at least two early career researchers. Each workshop supported by the Academy must also produce a report for online or physical publication by the Academy.  Other Academies  There are three other learned Academies in Australia, those of Humanities (Australian Academy of the Humanities), Science (Australian Academy of Science) and Technological Sciences and Engineering (Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering). The four Academies cooperate through the National Academies Forum, formed in 1995.

At Burlington city limit, the North Carolina Railroad/Norfolk Southern tracks cross over the highway along a polygonal Warren truss, built in 1935. History The first NC 100 was established in 1929 as a new primary routing from US 70/NC 10 in Whitsett to US 70/NC 10/NC 62, in Haw River. In 1930, the second NC 100 was established when US 70/NC 10 switched routes, from Whitsett to Burlington. In 1932, NC 100 was decommissioned in favor of NC 10A. The third and current NC 100 was established in late 1934 as a renumbering of NC 10A, traveling from US 70 (Burlington Road) in Whitsett to NC 62/NC 93 in Burlington. Between 1958-1962, NC 87/NC 100 was rerouted in downtown Burlington, from Trollinger, Davis and Maple Streets to Parks and Webb Streets; the old alignment was taken over by the city. In 1981, NC 89/NC 100 was realigned in downtown Burlington, between Fisher-Hoke Street and Lexington Street. In 2007, NC 100 was rerouted in Elon, from along Haggard Avenue onto new bypass routing along University Drive north from the downtown and Elon University. The old alignment was downgraded to a secondary road (SR 1454). In 2014, an elimination of an at-grade intersection at Burlington Avenue and University Drive was made; NC 100 was rerouted on a new connector road from Burlington Avenue/Haggard Avenue to University Drive.

The English translation by CMX began publication in 2004. It has also been translated to Chinese, as Romantic Hero, with 21 volumes; as well as to Thai, with 20 volumes. The series revolves around the adventures of Dorian Red Gloria, Earl of Gloria, an openly gay English lord who is an art thief known as \\"Eroica\\", and Major Klaus Heinz von dem Eberbach, an uptight West German NATO major. The series is driven by frequent inadvertent encounters between Dorian and Klaus, with Dorian often disrupting Klaus's missions. Dorian has developed a fondness for and flirts incessantly with Klaus, who typically reacts with extreme disgust. Other reoccurring characters include Dorian and Klaus's respective subordinates and Klaus's enemies from the Russian KGB.

As such it was the most prestigious formation in Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e. French soldiers often referred to Napoleon's Old Guard as \\"the Immortals\\".Georges Blond, La Grande Arm√©e, trans. Marshall May (New York: Arms and Armor, 1997), 48, 103, 470 It is believed that Napoleon hand-selected members of his Old Guard based on physical traits, most notably above-average height. Their imposing stature was likely impressive to foes and allies alike. Awards as well as veterancy were also taken into consideration when selecting troops for the Old Guard. Old Guard infantry Wearing their distinctive bearskin caps, Napoleon‚Äôs Old Guard was the most celebrated and most feared elite military formation of its day. There were four regiments of Old Guard infantry: 1st and 2nd each of grenadiers and chasseurs. Members of the Old Guard benefitted from a number of different privileges, including considerably increased wages from the Imperial Guard. Requirements for Old Guard candidates * under 35 years of age at entry * at least 10 years of service * at least three campaigns (some had fought in as many as 12 campaigns) * had to have faced enemy fire at the front * had to be for the Chasseurs and for the Grenadiers (no height requirement for those awarded the Legion of Honor) In 1814 the 1st Chasseurs still had many old-timers: for example Sapper Rothier with 21 years of service and two wounds; Private Stoll with 22 years of service and 20 campaigns. Those who were too old, or crippled, were sent to the Company of Veterans in Paris, which was full of soldiers, some lacking an arm, others striped with saber cuts. Each member of the Old Guard was a highly trained and experienced soldier and they formed a formidable sight on the battlefield when mustered into regiments; they were taught to fight unlike any other soldier in the French army. Any cowardly tendencies or otherwise cautious habits would be thoroughly purged through intense training, which often included advanced bayonet and hand-to-hand combat techniques. The Old Guard earned its fearsome reputation through the many military engagements of the Napoleonic Wars, from the Battle of Austerlitz, to the Battle of Dresden, to the famous and final Battle of Waterloo (June 1815). Old Guard cavalry Horse Grenadiers of the Old Guard during the Battle of Eylau by √âdouard Detaille There were four regiments of Old Guard cavalry: the Grenadiers √† Cheval (mounted grenadiers), Chasseurs √† Cheval (mounted chasseurs), Dragons de l'Imp√©ratrice (the Empress's Dragoons), and the 1st Polish Lancers. The Mamelukes of the Imperial Guard squadron was also considered part of the Old Guard cavalry. The Gendarmes d'√©lite (elite Gendarmes) was counted as Old Guard cavalry. It was deployed in detachments as escorts for Napoleon's headquarters and the General Staff of the Guard, and for Imperial Guard field camps. Les Grognards Another privilege reserved only for the members of the Old Guard was the freedom to express their discontent freely: the Old Guard Grenadiers were known as \\"the Grumblers\\" () because they openly complained about the petty troubles of military life. Jean-Roch Coignet, a captain of the Imperial Guard, claimed that this term was coined in the aftermath of severe hardships the unit encountered during the War of the Fourth Coalition.Coignet, Jean-Roch, and J. W. Fortescue. The note-books of Captain Coignet: soldier of the empire, 1799-1816 (London: Greenhill Books, 1998), 131. Some of the officers even did so in the presence of the Emperor, knowing that the Old Guard's reputation commanded enough respect with Napoleon to allow such openness. Such behavior was unique to the Old Guard and would have been severely punished were it engaged in by a member of any other unit. End of the Old Guard Napoleon saying goodbye to the Old Guard at the Palace of Fontainebleau, after his first abdication (1814) The Old Guard was disbanded by the victorious Sixth Coalition in 1814, along with the rest of the Imperial Guard. During Napoleon's 1815 return from exile, the Old Guard was reformed, and fought at the Battle of Waterloo, where the 2e Regiment de Grenadiers-√†-Pied was pivotal in the defense of the village of Plancenoit against the Prussians.Old Guard Grenadiers in Plancenoit (retrieved 2010-08-10) The 1er Regiment, charged with protecting the field position around Napoleon himself, served as a rear guard after the failure of the attack of the Middle Guard on the British center.The Last Squares of the Old Guard (retrieved 2010-08-10) The Old Guard cavalry was involved in the unsuccessful midday charges against the British infantry, and was unavailable at the battle's decisive moments. In August 1815, Louis XVIII ordered the Imperial Guard abolished. By December, all the Old Guard regiments were disbanded. Ex-guardsmen ended up in a variety of places after their units' disbandment. Some re-enlisted into the king's army. Most lived out their lives watched with suspicion by Bourbon police. When Napoleon's body was returned to France in 1840, many of the surviving Old Guard paraded in threadbare uniforms.  Contemporary use  Nowadays, in France, the expression la vieille garde (without uppercase) is used when talking about longtime close followers of a politician and has a mildly pejorative meaning. This expression is particularly popular among political journalists. \\"The old guard\\" can pejoratively refer to any outdated establishment in English as well. Grognard is also a slang term used by the tabletop role playing and wargaming community to refer to older, long term players of such games. The usage started with Napoleonic miniature war gaming, and originally referred to those who would seek out minor details that were wrong with another‚Äôs painting or modeling, mostly in terms of historical accuracy. Various online forums have popularized the usage among the tabletop role playing and war gaming community.

He has been a former Secretary General of International Alert, and an advisor to the Reconciliation programme of the Triple R. Rupesinghe has experience in mediation and conflict resolution work. Biography Rupesinghe obtained his first degree from the London School of Economics and his Ph.D. from the City University London. He has contributed towards building new organizations and networks on human rights and peace. At sixteen he went to London to study philosophy for eight years. His guide and mentor in those formative years was the Hungarian philosopher Alfred Reynolds - Reinhold Alfr√©d, whose insightful and enlightening discussions on philosophy ensured that the young Rupesinghe earned a solid grounding in Western and Indian Philosophy. This timely exposure to the Western culture at a very early age armed him with muchneeded subjectivity of his own Sri Lankan culture. Gaining an insight into different schools of thought allowed him to perceive transparently the shortcomings in his native land. In the meanwhile, he continued his academic growth by obtaining a Degree at the London School of Economics and received his Doctorate from the City University London. Over time, he went on to become a Research Fellow at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute, Colombo, (1971‚Äì1973) and was appointed Director of the National Youth Service Council. It was but natural that one of Rupesinghe‚Äôs core concerns was human dignity, or the lack of it, which he witnessed during the ethnic riots of 1958 in Sri Lanka, where a close Tamil friend and his family were killed brutally. Little did he know that this experience would shape the trajectory of his entire life as his philosophic bent of mind grappled with the injustice and the discrimination of minorities in the north and east of the island. PeaceLoving Revolutionary During 1973-1977, under the patronage of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Dr. Rupesinghe formed two major weekly newspapers, Janavegaya and Janavegam (both meaning 'people's power'), which embodied a social movement for change in Sri Lanka. The Janavegaya social movement had wide popularity and a presence in all parts of the country. One of his unique achievements at that time was to visit prisons where 20,000 political prisoners were held as a result of the abortive 1971 JVP Insurrection. Eventually, through the efforts of Janavegaya, the then Prime Minister was persuaded to release all prisoners held in connection to the insurrection, except for the key figures of the insurgency. Through the newspaper Janavegam, a Tamil weekly, he had access to Tamil opinion in the north and became aware of the deeprooted grievances of Tamil youth. Janavegam agitated for their rights and called for power sharing arrangement for the North and East provinces. One positive outcome of this agitation was that the government established the University of Jaffna. The weekly newspaper predicted that unless there was a clear policy to alleviate the suffering of the people in the North and address the grievances of the youth, civil war would be an eventual reality. University of Peradeniya After the 1977 defeat of the SLFPled United Front government, he served as Lecturer at the Department of Sociology, University of Peradeniya (1977 1981). At this time he was also a member of the Social Scientists Association, a Sri Lankan research body. International Peace Research Institute He was invited to join the International Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) in Norway, as a Research Fellow in 1982. At this juncture, ethnic polarisation in Sri Lanka had increased, and after 1977, relations between the Tamils and the Government of Sri Lanka had deteriorated. Against this backdrop, he singlemindedly dedicated himself to finding solutions to the ethnic conflict and studied means by which further damage could be prevented. This quest led to his early attempt to advocate an early warning system to prevent conflict. He was later appointed Research Director and led PRIO‚Äôs programme on ethnic conflict and conflict resolution. His research programme was now honed and unveiled as an early attempt to warn the international community of impending ethnic and national conflicts and to engage in debate with the international community on the importance of focusing on internal conflicts, early warning and conflict prevention. During his tenure, Dr. Rupesinghe was appointed as the Co¬¨ordinator to the Programme on Governance and Conflict Resolution at the United Nations University, Tokyo, where he edited two volumes and commissioned several monographs on identity conflict. He was also Chair of the Commission on Internal Conflicts of the International Peace Research Association (IPRA), where he concluded his chairmanship by publishing four volumes on ‚ÄòEarly Warning and Conflict Resolution‚Äô. International Alert From 1992-1998 Dr. Rupesinghe was Secretary General of International Alert (IA), an International NonGovernmental Organisation (INGO) dedicated to the prevention and mitigation of violent internal conflict. The organisation was a succession of the world- renowned human rights advocate, the first secretary General of Amnesty International, Martin Ennals, who received the Nobel Prize. During his tenure, Dr. Rupesinghe was in the august company of IA Board members like Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel Laureates and other distinguished citizens of the global human rights community. Under the leadership of Dr. Rupesinghe, International Alert became one of the largest international nongovernmental organisations in the world, with a budget of approximately UK¬£5 million a year, a staff of 80 and field programmes in over 15 countries in conflict. Many organisations adopted International Alert‚Äôs mandate of conflict prevention. In his capacity, Dr. Rupesinghe engaged in capacity building of local organisations and collaborated with over 50 organisations mainly in the regions of conflict. International Alert has been involved in mediation and conflict resolution in Sri Lanka, Philippines Fiji, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Rwanda, the Caucuses region, and the Russian Federation. International Alert made a decisive intervention in the conflict in Sierra Leone, and co-facilitated the mediation process together with the Foreign Minister of C√¥te d'Ivoire, the U.N. the O.A.U and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Their efforts eventually led to the Abidjan Accords. In Liberia, at the request of President Carter, early efforts were made to encourage dialogue between the now President Charles Taylor (Liberia) and President Abacha of Nigeria. In Sri Lanka, International Alert undertook many complementary efforts to contribute towards the resolution of the conflict there, with many problem-solving workshops, including all the parties to the conflicts. Of special interest was a programme to take 20 MPs from all the political parties to learn from the experience from Northern Ireland, South Africa and the Philippines. In the Caucuses, in collaboration with the then Minister of Nationalities, Professor Valery Tishkov, who was also the Director of the Institute of Ethnography, Russian Institute of Sciences, Dr. Rupesinghe initiated a programme to expand an early warning and early response network in the Russian Federation, and inaugurated a citizen- based network for peace building and conflict resolution. International Alert was asked to intervene in several conflicts in the former Soviet Union, which included Chechnya and Dagestan. In Fiji, International Alert was involved in several workshops with decision makers from both sides to work towards constitutional reform. Academic Pursuits Through his capacity as Chairman of the FCE, Dr. Rupesinghe also seeks to provide policy support to each step of the Sri Lankan peace process writing articles and issue papers, and participating in seminars and TV opinion programmes. This role supports continued public discussion of pertinent issues and allows for the sharing of expertise with key decisionmakers, stakeholders and fellow civil society organisations. Since his return to Sri Lanka after the signing of the ceasefire agreement between the government and the LTTE in 2002, he has also initiated the National AntiWar Front (NAWF), with a presence in all the districts of Sri Lanka. It has been engaged in public demonstrations, sitins and vigils, to call for peace and a negotiated solution to the country‚Äôs civil war. While his nationbuilding efforts are invaluable, Dr. Rupesinghe remains open to criticism from political circles and outside, levelled by those critical of his endeavours towards peace. He has encouraged open discussions with such individuals and groups and believes that transparency and dialogue is the only way of reaching a national consensus on the issue. One of his valuable contributions has been his theoretical and conceptual reflections on advancing early warning and conflict resolution; the role of third parties in the mediation of protracted internal conflicts; and an advanced concept of multitrack solutions to civil wars. The advocacy programme, which he created, was to persuade governments and international organisations to develop programmes for early warning, early action and develop coalitions and burden sharing in civil wars. As part of this work in influencing policy, he contributed to the discussion and creating policy instruments on early warning systems with the European Union (EU) and the O.A.U, and sought to influence the policy debate in UK, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Germany and Japan. In Japan, his efforts led to the formation of the Centre for Preventive Diplomacy. International Achievements Dr. Rupesinghe also served as a member of the Board at the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) ‚Äì Project on War Torn Societies. Professional Achievements Apart from his academic pursuits, he has contributed towards building new organisations and networks on human rights and peace. He was Chair of HURIDOCS (Human Rights Documentation Systems Exchange International) and in addition to his role as Secretary General of International Alert, he was appointed the Chair of the programme on Culture and Ethnicity of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation, Japan. This programme will publish over five volumes on Culture and Identity. He has been very closely involved in developing conceptual tools and practical action for the prevention of violent conflict and genocide. In this context, he was the Chair of the Forum for Early Warning and Early Action (FEWER), which is an ongoing initiative to establish an international early warning, early action network. Dr. Rupesinghe was appointed a member of the Council of the International Negotiation Network based in Atlanta, USA, an initiative led by President Carter, and acted as an advisor towards President Carter‚Äôs initiatives on peace. He also happens to be a Council Member and Commissioner on the Commission in Globalisation of the USA-based State of the World Forum headed by President Gorbachev. Publications Dr. Kumar Rupesinghe has edited and written over 40 books and published over 200 articles in academic journals. Some of his writings include ‚ÄòCivil War Civil Peace‚Äô Zed Press, ‚ÄòConflict Transformation‚Äô by McMillan and ‚ÄòEarly Warning, Early Response‚Äô. He has recently released his collected works under the titles of 'Waging Peace 20022008', 'Preventive Diplomacy', 'Early Warning', 'Conflict Resolution and Transformation Vols. I and II', 'Development and Conflict in Sri Lanka', 'Expressions of an Unequivocal Mind' and 'The Voice Vols. I and II' in form of 9 volumes.

Plot  Mr. Jones (Richard Gere) is a man suffering from bipolar disorder, a disease that affords him periods of intense emotional pleasure and expansiveness but which also results in periods of suicidal depression. In one of his manic periods he jumps up onto the stage during a concert performance of Beethoven's ninth and starts conducting, in another he is on top of a construction site claiming he can fly.

Roger Ebert noted that the film would have been better if the romance plot between Jones and Libbie was left out, since it appeared forced and contrived. The movie debuted at No. 7 at the box office. Mr. Jones holds a 46% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale.  Production  To prepare for the film, Richard Gere, Mike Figgis and Eric Roth did a tremendous amount of research and studying on bipolar disorder. Gere met with several people who have the disorder to gain insight and knowledge on what to accurately portray. There is a shorter director's cut that Figgis presented at the Munich film festival in 2006. Michelle Pfeiffer gave up the female lead to take on the part of Catwoman in Batman Returns. Props As in his earlier hit film, An Officer and a Gentleman, Gere's character rides a Triumph Bonneville motorcycle.

The son of Rev. John Anderson and Ann Masson, he was born in 1879. He was educated at Royal High School, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh. In 1908, after five years of work sponsored by the Carnegie Trust, he published Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers, a reasonably comprehensive compilation of sources about Scottish history before 1286 written either in England or by chroniclers born in England. Fourteen years later, he was able to publish the 2-volume work entitled Early Sources of Scottish History, A.D. 500 to 1286, a similar but larger collection of sources, this time taken from non-English (mostly Gaelic) material. To a certain extent, the latter work overlapped with the compilations published by Skene's Chronicles of the Picts and Scots (Edinburgh, 1867), but both of Anderson's compilations differed from Skene's in that all were translated into English. Years of reading difficult manuscripts in dull light were perhaps the cause of Anderson's failing eyesight, and for a large period of time, he relied on his graduate student (subsequently his wife) Marjorie Cunningham to do much of the readings. He died 9 December 1958. Today, most scholars working in early Scottish history regard Anderson's three volumes as among their most essential scholarly possessions. As a result, much of the course of early Scottish historiography was set by what Anderson chose to publish or chose not to publish. In 1990 and 1991, the compilations were reissued by the Stamford-based organisation Paul Watkins Publishing.

It distinguishes itself from other neutron scattering techniques by resolving the change in kinetic energy that occurs when the collision between neutrons and the sample is an inelastic one. Results are generally communicated as the dynamic structure factor (also called inelastic scattering law) S(\\\\mathbf{Q},\\\\omega), sometimes also as the dynamic susceptibility \\\\chi^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(\\\\mathbf{Q},\\\\omega) where the scattering vector \\\\mathbf{Q} is the difference between incoming and outgoing wave vector, and \\\\hbar \\\\omega is the energy change experienced by the sample (negative that of the scattered neutron). When results are plotted as function of \\\\omega, they can often be interpreted in the same way as spectra obtained by conventional spectroscopic techniques; insofar as inelastic neutron scattering can be seen as a special spectroscopy. Inelastic scattering experiments normally require a monochromatization of the incident or outgoing beam and an energy analysis of the scattered neutrons. This can be done either through time-of-flight techniques (neutron time-of-flight scattering) or through Bragg reflection from single crystals (neutron triple-axis spectroscopy, neutron backscattering). Monochromatization is not needed in echo techniques (neutron spin echo, neutron resonance spin echo), which use the quantum mechanical phase of the neutrons in addition to their amplitudes.

Background Sabri was a professor of English literature at Baghdad University, before serving in the press office of Iraq's embassy in London. He was recalled from the embassy in 1980 after two of his brothers were arrested for plotting against Saddam Hussein's regime. Thereafter, Sabri served as editor of an English language newspaper and translated English books into Arabic. During the 1991 Gulf War, Sabri served as the Deputy Information Minister for Iraq. His interactions with CNN producer Robert Wiener were dramatized in the HBO film Live From Baghdad, where his character was listed as Naji Al-Hadithi. CNN became famous after delivering live audio and video footage from within a Baghdad hotel even as the American military was bombing the city.\\"Live from Baghdad\\" (2002) IMDB page In 1998, Sabri was appointed Iraq's ambassador to Austria. In 2001, he was named Foreign Minister of Iraq. His education, almost flawless English, and comfort in diplomatic circles continued to make him one of Iraq's most recognized faces in the West. He is a Sunni Muslim. 2003 invasion of Iraq In the lead-up to the 2003 invasion, Sabri led Iraq's diplomatic efforts to weaken support for a US-led attack on Iraq. He worked to lobby support from Russia, China, India, and even Iraq's former enemy Iran. Sabri was also heavily engaged in talks with UN Secretary- General Kofi Annan and chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix. In September 2002, Sabri officially announced to Annan that Saddam Hussein had agreed to a resumption of weapons inspections in Iraq. In March 2003, while the invasion of Iraq was in its heated initial phase, a fatigued Sabri‚Äîlast seen in Baghdad‚Äîpublicly arrived in Damascus, Syria to the surprise of many. Sabri had managed to secure safe passage out of the country along a hazardous route. Sabri continued onto Cairo, Egypt, where his security was guaranteed by the Egyptian government. The United States also offered the Egyptian authorities a guarantee of Sabri's security while in Egypt. CIA source In March 2006, NBC Nightly News reported that Naji Sabri was, indeed, the \\"source who had direct access to Saddam and his inner circle\\" of which former United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet had once boasted. In April 2006, former CIA officer Tyler Drumheller said in a 60 Minutes interview that a very senior Iraqi official had indeed given the CIA information with regards to Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programs. 60 Minutes verified that the source was Sabri. For a short time before the 2003 invasion, the CIA maintained French-sponsored, third-party contact with Sabri. In exchange for $100,000, Sabri offered the CIA important details on some of Saddam's alleged weapons programs and assurances on the discontinuance of others. Sabri told the CIA that Saddam had stockpiled certain chemical weapons, specifically \\"poison gas\\". Sabri also told the CIA that Saddam did not have an active nuclear or biological weapons program. There were people in the CIA that knew this intelligence, but the CIA reports which continued up to Capitol Hill and the White House ignored this information from Sabri.Bush knew Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction salon.com In the lead-up to the invasion, the CIA pressured Sabri to defect to the United States, but Sabri declined.

The Northern Kentucky edition was known as The Kentucky Times-Star, and a Sunday edition was known as The Sunday Times-Star. The Times-Star was owned by the Taft family and originally edited by Charles Phelps Taft, then, by his nephew, Hulbert Taft, Sr. The Taft family's investments in news media would later grow into Taft Broadcasting, a conglomerate that owned radio, television, and entertainment properties nationwide. History The Star of January 2, 1875 The Times-Star first published on June 15, 1880, after the merger of The Times (founded April 25, 1840, as Spirit of the Times) and The Cincinnati Daily Star (founded in 1872 as The Evening Star). Charles Phelps Taft had purchased both papers the previous year, and named his brother, Peter Rawson Taft II, publisher. The Times-Star strongly supported political boss George B. Cox, to the embarrassment of Charles Phelps Taft's half-brother, progressive reformer and future President William Howard Taft. On November 23, 1895, the Times-Star ran an editorial proposing a contest to choose a flag for the City of Cincinnati, offering a $50 prize. On January 24, 1896, the commission awarded the $50 to influential illustrator Emil Rothengatter for the design that is in use today. The newspaper's offices were originally located on Sixth and Walnut streets. On January 1, 1933, the Times-Star moved into the 16-story Cincinnati Times- Star Building on Broadway. In 1939, the Times-Star purchased WKRC radio from CBS\\"Times-Star buys WKRC, Cincinnati.\\" Broadcasting - Broadcast Advertising, September 1, 1939, pg. 34. \\"WKRC's transfer approved by FCC.\\" Broadcasting - Broadcast Advertising, December 1, 1939, pg. 36. and subsequently became an affiliate and shareholder of the Mutual Broadcasting System through subsidiary Radio Cincinnati. In 1952, Hulbert Taft, Sr., owner and publisher of the Times-Star, attempted to acquire The Cincinnati Enquirer from its owner, a Washington D.C.‚Äìbased trust. A bidding war ensued when Enquirer employees pooled their assets in order to make a counter offer. The offer was accepted by the trust, and the attempted acquisition was unsuccessful. On August 3, 1958, the Times-Star was sold to Scripps-Howard Newspapers, owners of The Cincinnati Post, which by then had also purchased the Enquirer. Hulbert Taft Sr. was reportedly the only family member who opposed the sale. Radio Cincinnati was reorganized as Taft Broadcasting. The Post moved into the Times-Star Building and published under the name The Cincinnati Post and Times-Star until December 31, 1974, when it reverted to The Cincinnati Post.

While in the fully ripened arils, hypoglycin A is at levels of less than 0.1 ppm, in unripe arils it can be over 1000 ppm;Medscape- Toxicity, Plants - Ackee Fruit and cause vomiting and even death. Some countries in the Caribbean and Western Africa experience frequent cases. Presentation Abdominal discomfort begins two to six hours after eating unripe ackee fruit, followed by sudden onset vomiting. In severe cases, profound dehydration, seizures, coma, and death may ensue. Children and those who are malnourished are more susceptible to the disease. Pathophysiology When ingested, hypoglycin A is metabolized to produce methylenecyclopropylacetic acid (MCPA). MCPA acts to inhibit the beta-oxidation of fatty acids in two ways. First, it interferes with the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. Also, it inhibits acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, so that only unsaturated fatty acids can be fully oxidized. Fatty acids accumulate in the liver in a microvesicular pattern that can be seen on biopsy. In the absence of fatty acid metabolism, the body becomes dependent on glucose and glycogen for energy. Octreotide can be used to reduce secretion of insulin by the pancreas, thereby preventing severe hypoglycemia. Inhibition of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, however, also depletes a necessary cofactor for gluconeogenesis. Once the liver glycogen stores are depleted, the body cannot synthesize glucose, and severe hypoglycemia results. A similar outbreak of lethal hypoglycemic encephalopathy has been linked to consumption of lychee fruit in Muzaffarpur, India. Urinalysis of children affected by the disease has shown all affected have elevated levels of hypoglycin suggesting the same underlying pathophysiology as Jamaican vomiting sickness. Diagnosis In popular culture  The disease appears in the ER episode \\"Great Expectations\\", where the symptoms are recognised by Dr Mallucci who, it is later revealed, attended medical school in Grenada.

Early years  Ma was born in 1906 in Shadian village in Gejiu, Yunnan. This was a majority-Hui village that would later be the site of the infamous Shadian incident during China's Cultural Revolution. When Ma was six years old, he was sent to the provincial capital of Kunming, where he would receive his primary and secondary education until the age of 19. Following his graduation, Ma returned to his hometown of Shadian to teach at a Sino-Arabic primary school for two years - an experience which he did not enjoy. This was followed by a stint of study under Hu Songshan in Guyuan, a city in the Hui region of Ningxia. He then went to Shanghai for further education in 1929, where he studied at the Shanghai Islamic Normal School for two years.  Study in Cairo  Following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, Ma was sent by the Chinese government to Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt, to cultivate relations with Arab nations. He was a member of the first group of government-sponsored Chinese students to study there - which included men who would later become leading Chinese scholars of Arabic and Islam, such as Na Zhong.Ciecura. While in Cairo, he contacted the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Salafi Publishing House, which agreed in 1934 to publish one of his works - the first full-length book in Arabic on the history of Islam in China. A year later, Ma translated the Analects into Arabic. Whilst in Cairo, he would also subsequently translate several of Muhammad Abduh's works into Chinese, with the assistance of Rashid Rida,Ciecura. as well as Husayn al-Jisr's The Truth of Islam. To promote Chinese interests in the context of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ma was sent to Mecca in early 1939 as part of a hajj delegation alongside 27 other students - a journey on which they spoke to Ibn Saud about the determination of 'all the Chinese people' to resist the Japanese.  Return to China  Ma returned to China in 1939. There he edited the Arabic-Chinese Dictionary, while translating the Qur'an and works of Islamic philosophy and history. He also became a professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at Peking University in 1946, a role in which he oversaw the introduction of the first Arabic-language courses in the Chinese higher education system. At Peking University, he would train many of the next generation's most prominent Chinese Arabists, such as Zhu Weilie.Ma (2013). His initial translation of the Qur'an's first 8 volumes was completed in 1945, and after being rejected by Beijing publishing houses in 1948, this was published by Peking University Press a year later. Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War and the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, he was also elected as a member of the People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949.Ciecura. In 1952, another edition of his Qur'an translation was published by Shanghai's Commercial Press, and Ma became one of the founders of the Islamic Association of China. As part of this role, Ma also aimed to increase public awareness of Islam - which he did by publishing several articles in newspapers such as the People's Daily and the Guangming Daily. He also published a translation of Tjitze de Boer's History of Philosophy in Islam in 1958.Gao, 74. Due to his linguistic skills, he served as a high-level interpreter for Chinese officials such as Zhou Enlai, whom he enabled to speak to Gamal Abdel Nasser at the Bandung Conference. It was this that allowed him to keep his professorship and post in the PPCC until his death in 1978, despite widespread persecution of Muslims during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. Following his death, Ma's translation of Philip K. Hitti's History of the Arabs was published in 1979 by the Commercial Press. The China Social Sciences Press also posthumously printed, in 1981, his complete translation of the Qur'an, which Ma had worked on up until 1957, and then between 1976 and 1978.  Influence  His translation of the Qur'an remains the most popular in China today, surpassing versions by Wang Jingzhai and Li Tiezheng. It has been lauded for its faithfulness to the original, and has reached an 'almost canonical status'.Spiro, 23-24. The quality of this translation has also been recognised internationally - with the Medina-based King Fahd Holy Qur'an Printing Press opting to use it for their Arabic-Chinese bilingual edition of the Quran, published in 1987.Petersen.

He was one of the pioneers of the study of limnology, and served as acting president of the university from 1900 to 1903 and as president from 1918 to 1925. Birge was born in Troy, New York. He received a bachelor's degree from Williams College in 1873. He moved on to Harvard University, where he studied under Louis Agassiz and was awarded a Ph.D. in zoology in 1878. While still completing his Ph.D., Birge was appointed an instructor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in natural history in 1875. He was later appointed as dean in 1891. Birge became known as a scientist and administrator. Birge served as dean, director of the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, and under President Charles Kendall Adams, unofficial deputy to the president. In 1900, an ailing Adams left the university. Birge was named acting president in Adams' absence. He hoped to be named permanently to the post, but was passed over in favor of Charles R. Van Hise in 1903 after a boardroom battle between university regents William F. Vilas, who favored Birge, and Governor Robert M. La Follette, who favored Van Hise. Birge remained dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Van Hise died unexpectedly in 1918, and Birge was once again asked to serve as president of the university. This time he was formally named to the post, and served as president until 1925. He was regarded as an efficient administrator but was criticized then and later for refusing to make substantial changes to the university to adapt to the increase in students in the wake of World War I. From 1921 through 1922, Birge engaged in a running debate with William Jennings Bryan, who considered evolution a heresy and labeled Birge an atheist in several speeches. Birge, a lifelong Congregationalist who had taught Bible classes for most of his professional life, wrote a pamphlet defending evolution as supported by the Bible. Birge and his close collaborator Chancey Juday were pioneers of North American limnology (the study of inland waters, such as rivers and lakes). Together they founded an influential school of limnology on Lake Mendota, as a component of the University of Wisconsin. Birge retired from the administration in 1925 but continued his limnological research until the early 1940s, primarily in partnership with Juday. In 1950 he shared the Einar Naumann Medal of the International Association of Limnology with Juday.Frey, D.G. (ed.), 1963. Limnology in North America.

He is the head coach of the Brisbane Broncos and formerly the Queensland State of Origin team, as well as a former commentator for Fox League. Walters played for the Australian Kangaroos, Queensland Maroons and at professional club level primarily for the Brisbane Broncos. Along with twin Kerrod and older brother Steve, Kevin Walters started his playing career in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership before joining the NSWRL. He spent some time playing for the Canberra Raiders before moving to the Brisbane Broncos, where he played for the majority of his career and took over the club's captaincy. He has played in premiership-winning teams on six occasions and holds the record for most finals appearances. Walters later coached in the Queensland Cup competition with the Ipswich Jets club before being recruited by Catalans. Following his former coach Wayne Bennett from the Newcastle Knights he joined the Broncos coaching staff ahead of the 2015 season. During his short stint with the Knights, Walters was appointed as Halves coach by Bennett in 2014. Before this, Walters joined the Melbourne Storm where he worked as assistant coach to Craig Bellamy. Walters had also been at French club Catalans Dragons of the Super League where he was head coach. Before that he was head coach of the Ipswich Jets in the Queensland Cup. His coaching career continued as head coach of the Queensland rugby league team from 2016, until 2020 when he became head coach of the Brisbane Broncos. Biography Walters was born in Rockhampton, Queensland on 20 October 1967. He grew up playing football against future Brisbane Broncos (and Queensland) teammate Allan Langer and brothers Steve and Kerrod Walters. This combination of players was known famously as \\"The Ipswich Connection\\". Playing career Walters and his brothers played for the Booval Swifts club before Kevin played in the Brisbane Rugby League Premiership with the Norths club, then followed his brother Steve to the Canberra Raiders of the New South Wales Rugby League Premiership in 1987. =Canberra Raiders= In Canberra Walters was a reserve as a 19-year-old in the club's first grand final in 1987 which was lost to Manly-Warringah. That year he was named the Raiders' Rookie of the Year. Walters made his d√©but for the Queensland Maroons in the 1989 State of Origin series, as a reserve in Game III. Later that year he got his first taste of premiership success, playing from the bench in the 1989 Grand Final win for Canberra. =Brisbane Broncos= Walters returned to Queensland in 1990, signing with the Brisbane Broncos to play alongside his twin brother Kerrod once again. Up until 1990, Wally Lewis was the Broncos' first choice for the position, but coach Wayne Bennett moved Lewis to lock and Walters to five-eighth. This was because of Walters' darting runs and deft passing. That year he won the Broncos' Player of the Year award. Walters played from the reserve bench in all three games of the 1990 State of Origin series. He also made selection for the 1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France with twin brother Kerrod, playing in several tour matches against local sides but no test matches. The following year Walters was again selected to play in all three State of Origin matches for Queensland from the bench. He made his test match d√©but on the 1991 Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea, where he and his brother Kerrod became the first twin brothers to play rugby league for Australia. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, Walters helped Australia retain The Ashes. Later that year he helped the Broncos to victory in the 1992 Grand Final which Brisbane won 28‚Äì8 against the St George Dragons. The Walters brothers had already become the first trio to play for Queensland and Australia in 1992 and they achieved another milestone when all three were selected to tour with the World Cup squad. In England Kevin Walters threw the winning pass for Steve Renouf's try that won the game 10‚Äì6 in Australia's 1992 World Cup Final victory. Indeed, 1992 was a great year for Walters, with further victory in the World Club Challenge against Wigan. The following year Walters again proved a great utility for the Broncos' 1993 grand final victory. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Walters played at five-eighth for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge. At the end of the season, he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour. In 1996 Walters' wife, Kim, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Walters also played in the 1997 Super League Grand Final victory for Brisbane. Although not a consistent player for the Maroons, Walters was part of the winning 1998 State of Origin team, dummying his way over for a try in the decider. That year he played at five-eighth in the 1998 NRL grand final and won yet another premiership with the Broncos. Following his wife's death in 1998, Kevin established the Kim Walters Choices program, a free community service that offers support to people diagnosed with cancer at the Wesley Hospital in Brisbane. In 1999, with the retirement of Allan Langer, Walters was handed the Broncos' captaincy. He also captained Queensland in the second match of the 1999 State of Origin series. Walters' book, Brave Hearts was published in 1999. Walters was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league in 2000. He captained the Broncos at halfback in their 2000 NRL grand final win against the Sydney Roosters, claiming one more premiership ring with the club before moving to England at the request of Allan Langer.Whitiker, Alan ‚Äì History of Rugby League Clubs Published 2004 He played for Warrington briefly and decided it was not for him and his family, so moved back to Australia, playing his final season with the Broncos in 2001.Book ‚Äì Whiticker, Alan ‚Äì The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players (Broncos) In 2003 Walters was one of the first four former players inducted into the Broncos official Hall of Fame. During the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Walters. Coaching career Walters went on to coach the Toowoomba Clydesdales in the Queensland Cup competition and was also assistant coach under Wayne Bennett for the Brisbane Broncos. At the end of the 2005 season, after five successive years without a grand final appearance, Bennett decided to have a cleanout of the coaching staff, removing such long- time allies as Walters, Gary Belcher and Glenn Lazarus. Walters then became head coach of the Ipswich Jets playing in the Queensland Cup before attracting the attention of the Super League. =Catalans Dragons= Walters was appointed as the new coach of Catalans Dragons from the 2009 season. He had been linked with the role of Head Coach at the French Super League team for some time. His first season at Catalans did not start well, with only one win from the club's first 6 matches. However, by the end of his second season with the club, he'd taken them to within one match of the 2009 Super League Grand Final, losing to eventual Champions, Leeds Rhinos. After the 2010 season, Walters returned to Australia as assistant coach to Craig Bellamy at NRL club Melbourne Storm. In 2014, Walters was reunited with the Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett as a halves coach. After Bennett's announcement to return to the Brisbane Broncos as Head Coach for 2015, Walters followed. He was appointed as Assistant Coach, sharing the role with former New Zealand Warriors Head Coach, Stephen Kearney. =Queensland = On 28 December 2015, Walters was appointed as head coach of the Queensland State of Origin team, succeeding Mal Meninga whose elevation to the role as Australian Test coach meant he had to resign as Maroons coach. In his first year in charge of Queensland, Walters guided them to a 2-1 series victory over New South Wales. The following year in 2017, Walters repeated the same feat with Queensland. In the 2018 State of Origin series, New South Wales won the series by 2‚Äì1. Queensland managed to avoid a clean sweep by winning the final game at Suncorp Stadium. Before the start of the 2019 State of Origin series, it was revealed that Walters used the bizarre tactic of fining Queensland players who mentioned New South Wales by name or referred to them as 'blues'. Walters reportedly told Queensland players they were to only refer to the New South Wales team by the names ‚Äòother state‚Äô or ‚Äòsouthern state‚Äô. Queensland would go on to win the first game of the series but suffered a humiliating 38‚Äì6 loss in the second game which was played at Optus Stadium. In the post match press conference, Walters said of the game \\"We were poor in a lot of areas tonight, I am not going to single out one player, even our kick off to start the game was shit. Across the board we just weren't in the game. It was everywhere. The kick-off fucking pissed me off. It didn't go far enough. They beat us up everywhere\\". In game 3 of the series, Queensland lost the match in the final 20 seconds of the game after New South Wales scored a length of the field try through James Tedesco. =Brisbane Broncos= Walters was officially appointed head coach of the Brisbane Broncos on 30 September 2020, resigning as head coach of the Maroons to take the position.

He also went by the Chinese name Ma Fuchu. He used the Arabic name Abd al-Qayyum Ruh al-Din Yusuf (ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÇŸäŸàŸÖ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ). He was also styled as \\"Mawlana al-Hajj Yusuf Ruh al-Din Ma Fujuh\\" (ŸÖŸàŸÑÿßŸÜÿß ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿßÿ¨ ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ŸÖÿß ŸÅŸà ÿ¨ŸàŸá).  Biography  Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar was an ancestor in the 25th generation of Ma Dexin.  Hajj  Ma performed the Hajj in 1841, leaving China by a circuitous route; as ocean travel out of China had been disrupted by the Opium War, he chose instead to leave with a group of Muslim merchants travelling overland. After passing through Xishuangbanna, they went south to Burma, then took a riverboat along the Irrawaddy River from Mandalay to Rangoon. From Rangoon, they were able to board a steamship which took them all the way to the Arabian Peninsula. After his time in Mecca, he stayed in the Middle East for another eight years; he first went to Cairo, where he studied at Al-Azhar University, then travelled throughout the Ottoman Empire, going to Suez, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Istanbul, Cyprus, and Rhodes.  Return to China  As a prominent Muslim in Yunnan, Ma became involved in the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan shortly after he returned from the Hajj. The Panthay Rebellion, which flared up in 1856 as part of a wider series of uprisings by Muslims and other minorities, was led mainly by Du Wenxiu; though Ma disagreed with Du Wenxiu's revolutionary methods, he also encouraged his followers to aid in the uprising; later, he would try to act as a peacemaker between the central government forces and the rebels. Ma Dexin said that Neo-Confucianism was reconcilable with Islam, approved of Ma Rulong defecting to the Qing and he also assisted other Muslims in defecting. However, despite his efforts to bring about peace, the Qing government still regarded him as a rebel and a traitor; he was executed two years after the suppression of the rebellion. Europeans reported that he was either poisoned or executed. Works Sources say that Ma produced the first Chinese translation of the Qur'an, as well as writing numerous books in Arabic and Persian about Islam. His most famous writings compared Islamic culture and the Confucian philosophy in an effort to find a theoretical and theological basis for their coexistence. At the same time, he harshly criticised the absorption of Buddhist and Taoist elements into the practise of Islam in China. As he is generally regarded as an orthodox Islamic thinker, his writings also demonstrated a positive attitude towards Tasawwuf, or Sufi mysticism. In total, he published over 30 books, most of which fall into five categories. * Islamic jurisprudence and philosophy: ÂõõÂÖ∏Ë¶Å‰ºö, Â§ßÂåñÊÄªÂΩí, ÈÅìË°åÁ©∂Á´ü, ÁêÜÂ≠¶ÊäòË°∑, ÊÄßÂëΩÂÆóÊó®, Á§ºÊ≥ïÂêØÁà± ÊçÆÁêÜË¥®ËØÅ, * Islamic calendar and history: ÂØ∞ÂÆáËø∞Ë¶Å (Description of the World), Â§©ÊñπÂéÜÊ∫ê (History of Arabia) * Introduction and analysis of works of other Muslim authors in China, such as Ma Zhu and Liu Zhu: ÁúüËØ†Ë¶ÅÂΩï, ÊåáÂçóË¶ÅË®Ä, Â§©ÊñπÊÄßÁêÜÊ≥®Èáä * Qur'an: the first five volumes of ÂÆùÂëΩÁúüÁªèÁõ¥Ëß£ (True Revealed Scripture), the earliest translation of the meanings of the Qur'an into Chinese * Arabic grammar: Á∫≥Âìà‰∫î (Nahawu), ËµõÂ∞îÂ§´ (Saierfu), ÈòøÁì¶Á±≥Âãí (Awamile) * Other: ÊúùËßêÈÄîËÆ∞ (Diary of a pilgrimage), a description of his time in Mecca; originally in Arabic, translated to Chinese by Ma's disciple Ma Anli English translations of some of his works and a major work on his life are under way by Kristian Petersen.

The 2012‚Äì13 hockey season was Parker's 40th and final season as head coach of the Terriers, and his 47th overall at the school as a player or coach. Playing career Parker graduated from Catholic Memorial School in West Roxbury in 1964. He played for the Terriers from 1965 to 1968. The team was a combined 77‚Äì22‚Äì4 while Parker was a center for the team. Parker played on three Beanpot Championship teams and two teams which played in the NCAA tournament placing fourth in 1966 and second in 1967. Parker was captain of the team during his senior year on the team. Parker played against Boston College's current coach, Jerry York, while York was at BC and in high school. Coaching career Immediately after graduating, Parker was named head coach at Medford High School. After only one year, he returned to BU as an assistant under his former college coach, Jack Kelley, and helped lead the Terriers to two consecutive national championships in 1971 and 1972. After Kelley left the program to become general manager and head coach of the New England Whalers, Parker was promoted to B-team coach under his predecessor, Leon Abbott. Abbott was abruptly fired on December 21, 1973 for withholding information about the eligibility of two Canadian players who had played junior hockey in their native country, even though a judge questioned the constitutionality of the rules allegedly violated. Parker was named his successor.Kaminsky, Arthur. Ousted coach is defended in foreign player dispute. New York Times, 1973-12-30. Parker was named the NCAA Coach of the Year three times, the first after the 1974‚Äì75 season, again after the 1977‚Äì78 season and a third time after 2008-09. Parker was also named the Hockey East Coach of the Year after the 1985‚Äì86, 1991‚Äì92, 1999‚Äì2000, 2004‚Äì05 and 2005-06 seasons. On January 30, 2009, Parker claimed his 800th win in a 3-1 victory over Merrimack College. He was only the third coach to win 800 games, and the first to do so with one team. On April 11, 2009, Parker won his 30th NCAA tournament game and third team national title. Parker retired at the end of the 2012-13 season. He finished with a record of 897‚Äì472‚Äì115. At the time of his retirement, he was the third-winningest coach in NCAA history, behind only Ron Mason and Jerry York. His 897 wins are far and away the most in BU history, and are more than four times the total of runner-up Harry Cleverly. He has had a hand in more than two-thirds of BU's all-time wins. Apart from his one year as Medford High's coach, he spent the first 48 years of his adult life at BU as a player, assistant coach and head coach.

The official name of the game is Monday Night Baseball presented by USAA. The game starts at 7 p.m. ET, following SportsCenter, and usually lasts around three hours leading up to an hour-long Baseball Tonight. The program sometimes airs on ESPN2 rather than ESPN, often due to NBA playoff coverage in April and May, and preseason Monday Night Football coverage in August. Unlike ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball, Monday Night Baseball is not exclusive, but unlike Wednesday Night Baseball, Monday Night Baseball since 2007 co-exists with the local markets' carriers and is not always subject to blackout; ESPN can show teams up to three times a year in local markets alongside the local broadcasts. Current=Features Several things changed to Monday Night Baseball in the eight year television contract that ESPN signed with Major League Baseball on September 14, 2005. Unlike Sunday Night Baseball, the game is non- exclusive, meaning it will co-exist with the teams' local carriers. However, Monday Night Baseball will be allowed to co-exist with local carriers up to three times per club, per year. Beyond that, telecasts will be blacked out in the participating teams' markets (Baseball Tonight is shown in its entirety, beginning at 10:00, with the rest of the nation joining after the game). Beginning in 2007, there was expected to be an afternoon \\"batting practice\\" program generally from the site of the Monday Night Baseball game (similar to the pre-game shows for ESPN's NFL coverage). That program was scheduled to debut on April 9, 2007 at 4 p.m. Eastern time, before the New York Yankees- Minnesota Twins game. However, no batting practice show appeared for reasons that were not explained. Later, ESPN announced that it would also scale back its on-site presence for NFL games. Because ESPN airs Monday Night Football games, beginning with the pre-season games in mid-August, Monday Night Baseball games either move to ESPN2 or, since 2009, ESPN will broadcast a Wednesday doubleheader with the regularly scheduled Wednesday Night Baseball. On some occasions ESPN will have two scheduled games aired simultaneously, with the one game airing on ESPN and the second on ESPN2. Both telecasts are branded with the Wednesday Night Baseball name, but Dave O'Brien, Rick Sutcliffe and Aaron Boone still call one of the two games. In the past, the Monday night team would broadcast on Friday night during the NFL season instead of irony for the Wednesday night doubleheader format.

Controversy On May 10, 2006 after a long day of drinking and golfing with comedian Bill Murray, MNB analyst Rick Sutcliffe attended a night game between the San Diego Padres and Milwaukee Brewers in San Diego. He was invited to the booth with 4SD broadcasters Mark Grant and Matt Vasgersian where he began a rambling and incoherent interview by saying, \\"It ain't that busy, it ain't that busy.\\" He then rambled on about off-the-wall subjects such as George Clooney and his daughter's \\"mission.\\" After he asked Matt Vasgersian what he was still doing in San Diego, his microphone was finally cut off. As a result, he apologized and ESPN suspended Sutcliffe for one game the next week. Past history (1967‚Äì1988)=The NBC years (1966‚Äì1975) Monday Night Baseball was born on October 19, 1966 when NBC signed a three-year contract to televise the game. Under the deal, NBC paid roughly $6 million per year for the 25 Games of the Week, $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and 1967 All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts each season) up to $30.6 million. From 1972-1975 NBC televised Monday games under a contract worth $72 million. In 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts to 15 straight (with a local blackout). September 1, 1975 saw NBC's last Monday Night Baseball game, in which the Montr√©al Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6‚Äì5. Curt Gowdy called the Monday night games with Tony Kubek from 1972 to 1974, the pair being joined in 1973 and 1974 by various guest commentators from both in and out of the baseball world. Jim Simpson and Maury Wills called the secondary backup games. Joe Garagiola hosted NBC's pregame show, The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola, and teamed with Gowdy to call the games in 1975. The ABC years (1976‚Äì1988) ABC would pick up the television rights for Monday Night Baseball games in the following year. Just like with Monday Night Football, ABC brought in the concept of the three-man- booth (originally composed of Bob Prince, Bob Uecker, and Warner Wolf as the primary crew) to their baseball telecasts. Ratings were typically poor for ABC's Monday night games, and by 1986, ABC only televised 13 Monday Night Baseball games. This was a fairly sharp contrast to the 18 games to that were scheduled in 1978. The Sporting News suggested that ABC paid Major League Baseball to not make them televise the regular season, opining that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway. For most of its time on ABC, the Monday night games were held on \\"dead travel days\\" when few games were scheduled. The team owners liked that arrangement, as the ABC games didn't compete against their stadium box offices and local telecasts. The network, on the other hand, found the arrangement far more complicated; ABC often had only one or two games to pick from for each telecast from a schedule designed by Major League Baseball. While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with a surplus of games involving games between either small-market teams and/or teams with losing records. In 1989 (the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball), ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting a leg up against NBC's Cosby Show. The network also aired some late-season games on Sunday afternoons. The FX cable channel aired Monday night games in 1997. The series returned in 2002 as ESPN (which, like ABC by that point, was owned by The Walt Disney Company) created a package under its deal for national cable rights. =ABC's MNB announcersPlay-by-play *Gary Bender (1987-1988) *Don Drysdale (1978-1986) *Keith Jackson (1977-1982, 1986) *Jim Lampley (1977-1979) *Al Michaels (1976-1989) *Bob Prince (1976) *Gary Thorne (1989) *Bob Uecker (1976-1982) Color commentary *Lou Brock (1980) *Norm Cash (1976) *Howard Cosell (1977-1985) *Don Drysdale (1978-1986) *Bob Gibson (1976-1977) *Tim McCarver (1984-1989) *Joe Morgan (1988-1989) *Jim Palmer (1984-1989) *Steve Stone (1982-1983) *Bob Uecker (1976-1982) *Earl Weaver (1983-1984) *Bill White (1976-1979) *Warner Wolf (1976-1977) See also *Sunday Night Baseball *Wednesday Night Baseball *MLB Network Showcase *Fox Major League Baseball *Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio *ESPN Major League Baseball broadcasters *Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio broadcasters *List of current Major League Baseball broadcasters References *Sports Business Daily *Press Release: ESPN‚Äôs Signature MLB Franchises Return - Sunday, Monday and Wednesday Night Baseball External links * * Baseball on ESPN.tv * MLB on ESPN.com * Searchable Network TV Broadcasts Category:1967 American television series debuts Category:1988 American television series endings Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:1970s American television series Category:1980s American television series Category:1990s American television series Category:2010s American television series Category:ESPN original programming Category:Major League Baseball on television Category:Major League Baseball on NBC Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:ABC Sports Category:American television series revived after cancellation ","title":"Monday Night Baseball"},{"id":"4464273","text":"Seleute is a village and former municipality in the district of Porrentruy in the canton of Jura in Switzerland.

It was successful enough on cable television between 1983 and 1985, that it renamed itself Republic Pictures and undertook film production and home video sales as well. History NTA was founded by Ely Landau and Oliver A. Unger in 1954 when Ely Landau, Inc. was reorganized in partnership with Unger and Harold Goldman. NTA was the successor company to U.M. & M. TV Corporation, which it bought out in 1956. In October 1956, NTA launched the NTA Film Network, a syndication service which distributed both film and live programs to television stations not affiliated with NBC, CBS, or ABC (DuMont had recently gone out of business). The ad-hoc network's flagship station was WNTA-TV, channel 13 in New York. The NTA Network was launched as a \\"fourth TV network\\", and trade papers of the time referred to it as a new television network. (dead link) The NTA network launched on October 15, 1956, with over 100 affiliate stations. NTA programming included syndicated programs such as Police Call (1955), How to Marry a Millionaire (1957-1959), The Passerby, Man Without a Gun (1957-1959), and This is Alice (1958). The network also distributed 52 Twentieth Century Fox films in 1956. In November of the same year, it was announced that 50% of the network had been purchased by Fox, which would also produce original content for the network. In January 1959, Ely Landau was succeeded by Charles C. Barry, who took over as president of network operations. Landau continued to chair National Telefilm Associates. Bernard Tabakin became the president of National Telefilms Associates in 1962 and retained that position until 1975. During his tenure, NTA became the largest independent television distributor in the industry and acquired various film libraries, including NBC Films and Republic Pictures.. Despite the 50% ownership of 20th Century Fox, the film network never developed into a major commercial television network on a par with the \\"Big Three\\" television networks; modern TV historians regard the NTA Film Network as a syndication service rather than a major television network. Among NTA's holdings: * Most of the pre-1949 feature films produced by 20th Century Fox (these would later revert to Fox through their own TV division; as NTA held only a license to distribute, while Fox retained ownership) * Most of Paramount's short-subject library, including the Fleischer Studios and pre-October 1950 Famous Studios cartoons (excluding Popeye and Superman), Puppetoons, and the live-action comedies, musicals, and novelties (Burns and Allen, Robert Benchley, Eddie Cantor, Rudy Vallee, Louis Armstrong, Speaking of Animals, Mack Sennett comedies, Hedda Hopper's Hollywood, etc.) * Gulliver's Travels and Mr. Bug Goes to Town, both produced by Fleischer Studios * Part of the pre-1952 United Artists library (those films whose rights did not revert to their original producers) * The Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life by Liberty Films and RKO Radio Pictures * Leo McCarey's Rainbow Productions (The Bells of St. Mary's, Good Sam) * The Enterprise Studios catalog (Body and Soul, Arch of Triumph, Force of Evil, Caught, etc.) * A number of reissued films from Budd Rogers Releasing Corporation (The Dark Mirror, Magic Town, A Double Life, Secret Beyond the Door, and Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid) * The pre-1960 United States Pictures catalog * The Lost Moment - a 1947 film released by Universal Pictures * In the early 1970s, Cary Grant licensed television distribution rights to several of his films, most of them independently produced by his company, to NTA for $2 million including royalties. These films included Penny Serenade, Indiscreet, Operation Petticoat, The Grass is Greener, That Touch of Mink, and Father Goose.Elliot, Mark. Cary Grant: a biography.

Lippert's Regal Films that were released by 20th Century-Fox. * WNTA-AM-FM-TV licensed to Newark, New Jersey. WNTA-TV served the New York City television market, broadcasting on Channel 13 beginning in 1958. The stations were previously WAAT AM 970, WAAT-FM 94.7 and WATV. A notable WNTA-TV production syndicated to other commercial stations was the dramatic anthology series, The Play of the Week. NTA shut down its TV station in late 1961, selling its license in 1962 to Educational Broadcasting Corporation, which reappeared in September 1962 as noncommercial WNDT and eventually WNET, the primary PBS outlet for the greater New York area. The radio stations were sold as well; they currently operate as WNYM AM 970 and WNSH 94.7 FM. In March 1973, NTA bought the library of NBC Films, the syndication arm of the NBC television network since March 1953, after the FCC ruled TV networks could not syndicate their own shows. Notable titles include Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Car 54, Where Are You?, Kimba the White Lion and Get Smart. Like its U.M. & M. predecessor, NTA altered the original negatives to the Paramount black-and-white animated shorts, replacing the front-and-end titles. References to Paramount and Technicolor were blacked out, with the NTA logo replacing the Paramount mountain. At the end of color prints, the NTA logo had a U.M. & M. copyright byline below it, but on black- and-white prints, the U.M. & M. copyright appeared where the original Paramount copyright had been. On some shorts, either the original Paramount copyright line, the original color process line, the \\"Paramount Presents\\" line, or even part of the Paramount logo could still be seen for a few frames before the black bars appear. On two Noveltoons featuring Little Audrey, the \\"spinning star\\" portion of the Paramount opening could still be seen. On the Little Lulu cartoons altered by NTA, they had no choice but to leave in the last part of the Paramount opening, albeit with much of it blacked out, since the \\"Little Lulu by Marge from The Saturday Evening Post\\" title card appeared over the Paramount mountain. In addition, most Betty Boop cartoons made between 1932 and 1934 utilize the Paramount mountain (minus the stars and typeface) as a backdrop for the main titles, with even a select few keeping the original copyright byline. However, when NTA repackaged many of those same cartoons in the 1970's, the original titles were kept without black bars, but the opening and ending Paramount logos were replaced with a contemporary NTA logo. At the same time, the Fleischer Studios feature Gulliver's Travels, as well as a small number of short subjects have circulated with their original Paramount titles. Following Warner Bros.'s example of having their black-and- white cartoons colorized in 1968, NTA also sent the Betty Boop cartoons to South Korea in the early 1970's to be redrawn in color in order to become more marketable in the wake of color TV. In 1983, NTA bought Blackhawk Films. By 1983, NTA had launched a home video division called NTA Home Entertainment to market its holdings. Two labels, Spotlite Video, releasing video cassettes of public domain material and documentaries, and Inspiration Video, which released faith content was also established. By the end of the decade, NTA had bought the name and trademarks of the old Republic studio and renamed itself Republic Pictures and the home video arm was renamed to Republic Pictures Home Video, as well as Spotlite and Inspiration closing in 1986. NTA/Republic changed hands in succeeding years, and distribution of the former NTA holdings is split‚Äîthe theatrical rights are handled by Paramount Pictures, while television rights lie with Trifecta Entertainment & Media (for the theatrical output), and CBS Television Distribution (for the television library). When Republic folded in 2012, Viacom took full control of the former's theatrical library, with Olive Films or Kino Lorber handling home video rights to the theatrical catalog (except It's a Wonderful Life, which Paramount now distributes on DVD, among other selected films), while Paramount Home Entertainment (through CBS DVD) handles the television library for home video. In December 2019, Viacom and CBS Corporation remerged into a single entity under the name ViacomCBS, which reunited the former NTA assets.

It is also found in the Shukla Yajurveda Samhita 30.1-16 and Atharva Veda Samhita 19.6.Griffith, R.T.H. (1899) The Texts of the White Yajurveda. Benares: E.J. Lazarus & Co., pp 260-262Griffith, R.T.H. (1917) The Hymns of the Atharva-Veda, Vol. II (2nd edn). Benares: E.J. Lazarus & Co., pp 262-265 Slightly different versions of the Sukta appear in different Vedas. One version of the suktam has 16 verses, 15 in the meter, and the final one in the meter. Another version of the Sukta consists of 24 verses with the first 18 mantras designated as the Purva-narayana and the later portion termed as the Uttara-narayana probably in honour of Rishi Narayana. Some scholars state that certain verses of Purusha Sukta are later interpolations to the Rigveda. One of the reasons given is that it is the only hymn in all the Vedas that mentions the four varnas by name - although the word \\"var·πáa\\" itself is not mentioned in the hymn.Raghwan (2009), Discovering the Rigveda A Bracing text for our Times, , pp 77-88 Content The Purusha Sukta gives a description of the spiritual unity of the universe. It presents the nature of Purusha, or the cosmic being, as both immanent in the manifested world and yet transcendent to it.The Purusha sukta in Daily Invocations by Swami Krishnananda From this being, the Sukta holds, the original creative will (identified with Viswakarma, Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati) proceeds which causes the projection of the universe in space and time.Krishnananda, Swami. A Short History of Religious and Philosophic Thought in India. Divine Life Society, p. 19 The Purusha Sukta, in the seventh verse, hints at the organic connectedness of the various classes of society. Purusha The Purusha is defined in verses 2 to 5 of the Sukta. He is described as a being who pervades everything conscious and unconscious universally. He is poetically depicted as a being with thousand heads, eyes and legs, enveloping not just the earth, but the entire universe from all sides and transcending it by ten fingers length - or transcending in all 10 dimensions. All manifestations, in past, present and future, is held to be the Purusha alone. It is also proclaimed that he transcends his creation. The immanence of the Purusha in manifestation and yet his transcendence of it is similar to the viewpoint held by panentheists. Finally, his glory is held to be even greater than the portrayal in this Sukta. Creation  Verses 5-15 hold the creation of the Rig Veda. Creation is described to have started with the origination of Virat, or the cosmic body from the Purusha. In Virat, omnipresent intelligence manifests itself which causes the appearance of diversity. In the verses following, it is held that Purusha through a sacrifice of himself, brings forth the avian, forest- dwelling and domestic animals, the three Vedas, the metres (of the mantras). Then follows a verse which states that from his mouth, arms, thighs, feet the four varnas (categories) are born. This four varna-related verse is controversial and is believed by many scholars, such as Max M√ºller, to be a corruption and a medieval or modern era insertion into the text. After the verse, the Sukta states that the moon takes birth from the Purusha's mind and the sun from his eyes. Indra and Agni descend from his mouth and from his vital breath, air is born. The firmament comes from his navel, the heavens from his head, the earth from his feet and quarters of space from his ears. Through this creation, underlying unity of human, cosmic and divine realities is espoused, for all are seen arising out of same original reality, the Purusha. Yajna The Purusha Sukta holds that the world is created by and out of a Yajna or exchange of the Purusha. All forms of existence are held to be grounded in this primordial yajna. In the seventeenth verse, the concept of Yajna itself is held to have arisen out of this original sacrifice. In the final verses, yajna is extolled as the primordial energy ground for all existence. Context The Sukta gives an expression to immanence of radical unity in diversity and is therefore, seen as the foundation of the Vaishnava thought, Bhedabheda school of philosophy and Bhagavata theology.Haberman, David L. River of Love in an Age of Pollution: The Yamuna River of Northern India. University of California Press; 1 edition (September 10, 2006). P. 34. . The concept of the Purusha is from the Samkhya Philosophy which is traced to the Indus Valley period. It seems to be an interpolation into the Rigveda since it is out of character with the other hymns dedicated to nature gods.S. Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, Vol. 1. The Purusha Sukta is repeated with some variations in the Atharva Veda (19.6). Sections of it also occur in the Panchavimsha Brahmana, Vajasaneyi Samhita and the Taittiriya Aranyaka. Among Puranic texts, the Sukta has been elaborated in the Bhagavata Purana (2.5.35 to 2.6.1-29) and in the Mahabharata (Mokshadharma Parva 351 and 352). The Purusha Sukta is mirrored directly in the ancient Zoroastrian texts, found in the Avesta Yasna and the Pahlavi Denkard. There, it is said that the body of man is in the likeness of the four estates, with priesthood at the head, warriorship in the hands, husbandry in the belly, and artisanship at the foot. Nevertheless, it remains to be established that the Indian and Pahlavi texts reflect inherited common beliefs, rather than independent developments. Hence, making a later insertion unlikely. Authenticity  Many 19th and early 20th century scholars questioned as to when parts or all of Purusha Sukta were composed, and whether some of these verses were present in the ancient version of Rigveda. They suggest it was interpolated in post-Vedic era and is a relatively modern origin of Purusha Sukta. B. V. Kamesvara Aiyar, another 19th-century scholar, on the other hand, disputed this idea: Scholarship on this and other Vedic topics has moved on decisively since the end of the twentieth century, especially since the major publications of Brereton & Jamison and many others, and views such as the above are nowadays of interest only as part of the history of indology, and not as contributions to contemporary scholarship. Modern scholarship The verses about social estates in the Purusha Sukta are considered to belong to the latest layer of the Rigveda by scholars such as V. Nagarajan, Jamison and Brereton. V. Nagarajan believes that it was an \\"interpolation\\" to give \\"divine sanction\\" to an unequal division in society that was in existence at the time of its composition. He states \\"The Vedic Hymns had been composed before the Varna scheme was implemented. The Vedic society was not organized on the basis of varnas. The Purush Sukta might have been a later interpolation to secure Vedic sanction for that scheme\\". Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, \\"there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system\\", and \\"the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality\\".

By origin, an anu·π£·π≠ubh stanza is a quatrain of four lines. Each line, called a pƒÅda (lit. \\"foot\\"), has eight syllables. In Vedic texts Arnold distinguishes three varieties of anu·π£·π≠ubh in the Vedic corpus: an early free form, with very few restrictions except a general iambic (u ‚Äì u x) tendency in the cadence (v·πõtta) of each of the four pƒÅdas; e.g. : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì  :  ‚Äñ ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äñ : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u  u ‚Äì u u  :  ‚Äñ ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚ÄñMacdonell (1916), p. 438. Next came a mildly trochaic development in the opening of each pƒÅda; and finally the development of the \\"epic anu·π£·π≠ubh\\" (mostly in the Atharvaveda) prefiguring the classical ≈õloka form. Although in these hymns the iambic cadence of the first verse is still the most frequent (25%) of all varieties, it is already very nearly equalled (23%) by the normal and characteristic cadence of the first verse in the epic anu·π£·π≠hubh (≈õloka), where the iambic cadence in the first verse has entirely disappeared. In Classical Sanskrit: the ≈õloka right In classical Sanskrit the anu·π£·π≠ubh developed into its specific epic form known as ≈õloka, as described above, which may be considered the Indian verse par excellence, occurring, as it does, far more frequently than any other meter in classical Sanskrit poetry.Macdonell (1927), p. 232. By the 5th century CE, in the poetry of Kalidasa, the ≈õloka had the restricted form shown in the table above. Each half-verse of 16 syllables can take either a pathyƒÅ (\\"normal\\") form or one of several vipulƒÅ (\\"extended\\") forms. The pathyƒÅ and vipulƒÅ half-verses are arranged in the table above in order of frequency of occurrence. The most common is the pathyƒÅ. Out of 2579 half- verses taken from Kalidasa, Bharavi, Magha, and Bilhana, each of the four admissible forms of shloka in this order claims the following share: 2289, 116, 89, 85;Macdonell (1927), p. 233. that is, 89% of the half-verses have the regular pathyƒÅ form. In earlier epic, such as the Mahabharata, a fourth vipula is found, namely: : x x x ‚Äì,  ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  Two rules that apply in every ≈õloka are: :1. In both pƒÅdas, in syllables 2‚Äì3, u u is not allowed. :2. In the second pƒÅda, in syllables 2‚Äì4, ‚Äì u ‚Äì is not allowed. NotesBibliography * Arnold, E. V.

Little London Green is the largest area of common land in the parish of Oakley. History The earliest known records of Little London are from the 16th century. Little London is clearly visible on the New College, Oxford map of Bernwood Forest of 1590. Originally the boundary between Brill and Oakley followed the stream in Oakley, meaning that Oakley parish church, 'the Nap' and 'Little London Green' would have been in Little London. Little London has several 17th-century cottages. A Congregational chapel was built there in 1847. In 1934 Buckinghamshire County Council revised parish council boundaries and made Little London part of Oakley. Until the 1960s the hamlet had its own shop. Toponymy The Toponymy (naming) of Little London is not clear. Some locals thought it was founded during the Black Death in the 14th century by Londoners fleeing the capital. The fact that the hamlet is one field distant from the rest of Oakley may support this theory. Little London may have been established by Welsh cattle drovers. Cattle drovers established at least 70 communities established in England and Wales, many of which still exist. They were temporary homes for long distance drovers, driving their cattle to the great fairs and markets of London and other centres in England. They were on common land, separated from local communities. The drovers had a licence to travel, granted by Elizabeth I, and were regarded as \\"foreigners\\" by the local parishioners who could not travel without a \\"settlement certificate\\". One of the Old English words for \\"foreigners\\" was utlenden (\\"outlanders\\"), which could be corrupted to \\"Little London\\".

It is classified as a Samanya Upanishad and attached to the Rigveda. The Mudgala Upanishad, along with Subala Upanishad, is one of the two Upanishads that discuss the Purusha Sukta of Rigveda. It is notable for asserting that Narayana (Vishnu) is the Brahman (Highest reality, Supreme being), that he created the universe from a fourth part of himself, then became himself the Atman (soul) in individual living beings. The text asserts that Narayana is Moksha (liberation), representing the state of union between the Atman and the Brahman. The text is notable in that it presents only the first nine verses of the Purusha Sukta, and the absence of last seven verses that describe the creation of living beings and varna (social classes) considered by scholars to be a later addition. History The author or composition date of Mudgala Upanishad is unknown. Jan Gonda ‚Äì a professor of Sanskrit and Dutch Indologist, states it is a late Upanishad. The style and structure of Sanskrit words used by the text suggest it to be a medieval text. The text, states Klaus Witz, is a post-Vedic but early Vaishnava Upanishad. The Upanishad reflects an integration and a harmony of Vedic doctrines with those of Vaishnava doctrines. The text is titled after Vedic sage Mudgala, who is credited to be the author of Rigvedic hymn 10.102, where his wife wins a metaphorical competitive race against others, despite the handicaps placed against her, because she and Mudgala held on to truth and reality during the competition, while others behaved falsely. The Vedic sage Mudgala is celebrated in the Hindu epic Mahabharata as the one who refused to go to heaven with a celestial messenger, because he prefers his meditative monk life and his human life in the state of moksha. The discussions on virtues and ethics for a happy, content life found in the Mahabharata reappear in the text of the Mudgala Upanishad. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Mudgalopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 521-522 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 57. Contents The Mudgala Upanisad is structured into four chapters. The first part opens with nine slokas which references and presents the Purusasukta from the Rigveda chapter 10.90, stating it to be the foundation of Vaishnavism and asserting that Vishnu is the Purusha, or primordial person. The second part of the text is structured in prose form, presenting it as a discourse from Vasudeva (Vishnu) to Indra who represents the inhabitants of the universe seeking moksha (liberation). The teachings in the text, states Gonda, resonate with the main tenets found in the Hindu epics and post-epic, especially pancharatra literature. The text opens with the Purusha Sukta found in Rig veda hymn 10.90, but just the first nine of the sixteen verses that are found in the modern surviving version of Rigveda manuscript. The Purusha is identified to be Vishnu (Narayana, Hari). The Adi-purusha, primordial cosmic reality, is identified by the text as nothing but Brahman, who is asserted to be Vishnu, then declared as the cause of All. Vishnu's soul is the primordial sacrifice that becomes the unchanging and the evolving reality, according to the text. The first two verses of chapter 1 of the Mudgala Upanishad assert Vishnu to be omnipresent in space and time. The text thereafter asserts that Vishnu (Hari) to be the grantor of liberation, from whom all of Prakriti and Purusha were born. Vishnu, states the text using the words of the Purusha sukta, sacrificed himself and thus became Brahman and Atman (individual soul). Thus arose the world of living beings, asserts the text. Chapter 2 opens as a discourse of Vasudeva to Indra, wherein Vasudeva teaches Bhagavatism. Purusha Narayana is asserted by the text to be \\"what has been, what is, and what will be\\", who divided himself into four, wherein the first three remained in the heavens, and the last fourth became all of living beings include humanity, as well as non-living nature. He, that is Vishnu, is the soul within each living being (jiva), identical everywhere and with the universal soul (atman). Chapter 3 asserts that everything is manifestation of Vishnu, from Asuras to Gandharvas, from men to gods, and regardless of how one worships him, they become him. One must seek, states the text, to realize through meditation the identity of his own I (aham iti) with Brahman. The Upanishad in chapter 4 discusses virtues in the context of self-knowledge, and asserts that the six inner enemies of man are anger, covetousness, infatuation, conceit, desire and jealousy. The six waves of inner reminder are hunger, thirst, sorrow, craving, old age and dying, while the six embarrassments, states the text, are race, family, social class (varna), stage in life (ashrama) and favorable circumstances. One overcomes these with Yoga, asserts the text, and by meditating on one's soul, and realizing it being one with Vishnu.

A proposed feeder service was rejected and the municipal council instead asked that the state grants be used to help fund a land airport.Reitan: 15 An inter-municipal commission was established in 1954, which in November 1956 recommended that Utvik in Avaldsnes in today's Karm√∏y be selected as a site for a regional airport with a runway. This led to Haugesund Municipality spending NOK 1.1 million in 1959 to buy a suitable lot there.Reitan: 16 The 1962 state commission led by Preben Munthe recommended in a 1965 white paper that Haugesund receive an airport. It prioritized Haugesund second‚Äîafter the completion of Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget‚Äîand parallel with proposed airports in Leknes and Sandnessj√∏en. This led to a new debate about the location of an airport for Haugesund. The main concern with Utvik was that it would occupy agricultural land. Twenty- three other locations were considered by a local commission, including sites in Sveio, Tysv√¶r and southern Karm√∏y. They found Utvik and S√∏r-Karm√∏yheia to be the most suitable. The Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) considered those places and also looked into Kongsheiene. These sites limited the runway length to , respectively. Karm√∏y Municipal Council rejected the Utvik alternative in May 1966 of concern to farmland.Reitan: 17 At this time Helganes was launched as a proposal by its land-owner. This proposal was followed up and ultimately chosen by the authorities. Parliament approved the airport on 2 June 1972.Reitan: 23 Prior to this the inter-municipal commission had bought the land and built water, power and sewer lines to the site, costing NOK 20 million. Construction commenced in 1973 and took thirteen months, costing . The small lake Tyviktj√∏nn was drained in the process,Reitan: 24 and the airport received a runway measuring .Reitan: 107 The first landing was a Convair Metropolitan on 22 November 1974 operated by the CAA to test the navigational aids.Reitan: 25 The official opening took place on 8 April 1975.Reitan: 27 Early operations The route concessions were split between Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE. The former was allowed to fly the route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, while the latter was permitted to fly to Bergen and Stavanger. Braathens chose to not operate this concession.Reitan: 60 Two airlines were established at the airport in 1975: Coast Aero Center and Nordsj√∏fly. These both started various air taxi services. Haugaland Flyklubb was established as an aviation club.Reitan: 39 Nordsj√∏fly commenced a services between Stavanger, Haugesund and Bergen in 1976.Melling: 142 They flew three times daily to Bergen and twice daily to Stavanger, while SAS flew twice daily to Oslo.Reitan: 41 From 1979 this increased to three daily flights.Reitan: 45 In the first years the opening hours were a contended issue as the airport was closed in the middle of the day and late evenings.Reitan: 40 From 27 December 1976 a third shift was introduced, significantly increasing the airport's operational hours.Reitan: 42 The general aviation and mostly helicopter operator Fonnafly established an office at the airport the following year. The airport opened with an instrument landing system, but only runway 13 had a localizer. This was changed in 1978, when a localizer from runway 31 was also installed.Reitan: 46 There was a political discussion about Helilift establishing an offshore helicopter terminal at Haugesund Airport, to compete with Helikopter Service which at the time was operating out of Stavanger Airport, Forus. However, the government found that there was no need for such a base.Reitan: 51 By 1981 all the airlines at the airport were losing money. The third departure to Oslo did not generate sufficient patronage, and after threatening to terminate the extra flight, SAS introduced a surcharge on all Haugesund tickets to covers its NOK 3 million per year deficit on the route.Reitan: 57 Also Nordsj√∏fly was struggling, and was bought by Norving in 1981.Melling: 181 It made an interlining agreement with KLM which allowed passengers to fly from Haugesund via Stavanger to Amsterdam for the same prices as from Stavanger.Reitan: 61 Similar agreements were soon struck with other international airlines operating out of Stavanger. After only being allowed to carry a maximum of nine passengers, Norsj√∏fly was from then allowed to operate the larger 19-passenger Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner.Reitan: 65 Fokker 50 at Haugesund Airport Nordsj√∏fly operated with a loss every year. The airline was therefore liquidated in 1982 and the assets transferred to Norving and the Haugesund base was taken over by Norving.Melling: 197 By then patronage was sufficient that SAS replaced its smaller Douglas DC-9-21s with the larger, 122 passenger DC-9-41s.Melling: 63 Braathens SAFE, through its regional affiliate Busy Bee, started operated a route from Stavanger via Haugesund to Bergen in 1984, using a 44-passenger Fokker F-27 in competition with Norving.Melling: 223 Statoil contracted Helicopter Service to operate helicopter flights to a platform on Statpipe from Karm√∏y. SAS introduced a fourth service in 1984, using a F-27.Reitan: 75 The airport expanded its opening hours from 1985 when a fourth shift was hired. Coast Aero Center established the first scheduled international service in 1986, with a direct service to Aberdeen Airport using a 15-passenger Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante.Reitan: 81 The route was soon terminated as it used a full crew shift and aircraft to make only one round trip per day.Reitan: 82 Norving closed its base at Haugesund in November, as it gradually terminated its operations in Southern Norway due to financial difficulties.Melling: 282 Coast Aero Center went bankrupt in 1988, but the assets were used to establish a new airline, Coast Air.Reitan: 84 It commenced services to Stavanger with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters from 1989.Reitan: 90 The airport started work on a new international terminal in 1987,Reitan: 83 allowing it to open on 18 July 1988. It included a duty-free shop and was built to serve one weekly, seasonal inclusive tour flight to Palma de Mallorca Airport.Reitan: 87 The following year the tour operators canceled all charter services from Haugesund.Reitan: 89 Air Stord was established at Haugesund Airport in 1990. They bought Norving's former hangar, but after a buy-out instead chose to operate out of near-by Stord Airport, S√∏rstokken instead.Reitan: 94 Busy Bee went bankrupt in 1992 and Braathens' regional routes were allocated to Norwegian Air Shuttle, who operated with Fokker 50s. Coast Air commenced two scheduled services from Haugesund in 1994. The one was to Bergen and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik, the other was flew to Fagernes Airport, Leirin and onwards to Oslo.Reitan: 102 From 9 to 13 July 1995 the runway was re-asphalted, during which time the airport was closed.Reitan: 105‚Äì107 Competition and runway extension A monument at the airport The aviation club shut down in 1996 after financial difficulties for many years.Reitan: 113 The Fagernes route was terminated the same year when Coast Air lost the tender to operate it. Instead they opened a service to Aberdeen from 1997. The aviation market in Norway was deregulated from 1 April 1994, but not until the 1998 opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen were there sufficient slots available at the capital airport for Braathens to introduce routes to Haugesund. This took place on 25 October 1998 with five daily services. SAS increased their daily services from five to six. On top of this, Coast Air commenced flights to Sandefjord Airport, Torp a few days a week.Reitan: 123 From November Sun-Air followed up with three weekly services to Billund Airport in Denmark. SAS established two daily services to Copenhagen Airport from early 1999 with a Fokker 50.Reitan: 125 However, without a morning departure it had little patronage as it was faster to reach the Danish capital via Oslo. SAS thus terminated the service after a year, as did Sun-Air to Billund.Reitan: 130 A committee was established in 1995 to look into the possibility of lengthening the runway. The initial reasoning was to serve long-haul fish export aircraft.Reitan: 109 With the introduction of McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft, SAS oftentimes could not operate them at their maximum take-off weight. This sometimes meant that not all seats could be sold. Therefore, SAS continued to use DC-9s on as many departures as possible out of Haugesund.Reitan: 115 The main concern was not the cost incurred by lengthening the runway per ce, but rather that building past a decarled distance of would cause the shoulders to have to be expanded from .Reitan: 117 Three investment groups offered to buy the airport and make it a \\"gateway\\" to Western Norway. The CAA had meetings with Wiggins, but stated that no Norwegian airports were for sale.Reitan: 119 Wiggins instead proposed a lease where they would invest NOK 630 million in the aerodrome, including a hotel complex. The increased number of flights caused expansion of the terminal, which opened in September 1999. However, after failing to make money on the new route, Braathens pulled out of the Oslo service in November 1999. Braathens reduced its services to Bergen in January 2000, after which Coast Air responded by increasing its services. However, the airline closed the Aberdeen route the following year. Coast Air started its first head-on competition with Scandinavian Airlines on 2 June 2003. Using the ATR 42, it introduced two daily services from Haugesund to Oslo. By September this had increased to three, and tickets were selling as low as NOK 500. SAS responded with a 22-percent cut in ticket prices. Coast Air lost NOK 11 million on the price war during 2003, and was ultimately forced to withdraw from the route in May 2004. The case was investigated by the Norwegian Competition Authority based on accusations of SAS carrying out illegal price dumping on the route. They issued a fine of NOK 20 million, but the case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was acquitted. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it took place immediately the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine. SAS Commuter took over Norwegian Air Shuttle's services from 1 April 2003. Inclusive tour charters commenced again in 2004, after a fourteen-year drought.Reitan: 141 Braathens and SAS merged to create SAS Braathens in May 2004, with the new airline taking over the Oslo route. It passed on the Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. Parliament decided that five Avinor airports would be allowed to issue ninety percent discount on take-off charges on international routes. This accounted in 2004 to NOK 4,800 per flight for a Boeing 737‚Äì200. However, they still had to pay full terminal, security and air navigation service charges. This allowed Haugesund to establish itself as a \\"low-cost\\" airport for low-cost carriers.Reitan: 138 Ryanair started looking at Haugesund as a destination in 2002, hoping to serve both Rogaland and Hordaland from one airport. However, they demanded that the runway be lengthened if they were to use Karm√∏y.Reitan: 135 It launched its inaugural daily route to London Stansted Airport on 30 April 2003. By using the smaller Boeing 737‚Äì200 aircraft the airline could as an interim solution get by with the short runway‚Äîthe shortest of any airport served by the airline.Reitan: 136 To finance the longer runway, the inter-municipal power company Haugaland Kraft established Lufthavnutvikling to finance the construction. In exchange, they were given a portion of the revenue from increased traffic. Clearing started in 2002 and construction began in mid-2003. The runway was lengthened by to a length of and declared lengths of . This allowed both Ryanair and SAS, as well as any charter operators, to operate a fully loaded Boeing 737‚Äì800. The expansion cost NOK 90 million and the agreement had a duration for fifteen years, during which time the company received a percentage of revenue from duty-free and parking generated from international services. Lufthavnutvikling was privatized in 2006 and by 2014 there was a controversy regarding the legality of the agreement, following changes to European Union regulations regarding airport subsidies. Further extension of the runway is difficult since the shoreline is at the northwest end of the runway while the flight path to the southeast passes over a water tower that is currently just clear the required safety margins. Ryanair introduced its second service, to Bremen Airport in Germany, on 4 June 2007. Meanwhile, Coast Air introduced direct services from Haugesund to Copenhagen. The company filed for bankruptcy on 23 January 2008. In the wake, Wider√∏e commenced a twice-daily service to Copenhagen starting on 30 March 2008. Patronage was too low and the route was terminated by the end of the year. Norwegian returned to Haugesund on 19 August 2009 with three daily services to Oslo. SAS Commuter's route to Bergen was taken over by Wider√∏e in 2010, but closed in October 2016 due to fee rises and lack of demand. The airline resumed the Copenhagen route on 30 October 2011, operating a single daily round trip. Ryanair expanded its portfolio from 27 March 2012 with seasonal routes to Palma de Mallorca, Alicante Airport and Pisa Airport. Wizz Air introduced services to Gda≈Ñsk Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa Airport from 4 April. Facilities The airport is situated on the peninsula of Helganes in Karm√∏y. The airport features a terminal building with a domestic and international departure hall, residing at a reference elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 13/31 with an asphalt surface measuring . It has a takeoff run available (TORA) of and a landing distance available (LDA) of . The airport is equipped with an instrument landing system and category 7 fire and rescue service. Airlines and destinations Scandinavian Airlines and Norwegian Air Shuttle both operate daily services to Oslo using Boeing 737 aircraft. Wizz Air operates four weekly services to Gda≈Ñsk and in 2020 will start operate a new route to Krak√≥w. Operation of the airport ran at a deficit of in 2012. Haugesund Airport served 694,005 passengers, 10,265 aircraft movements and handled 234 tonnes of cargo. This makes Haugesund the eleventh-busiest airport in the country. Ground transport The airport is situated at the terminus of European Road E134, between fifteen and twenty minutes drive from the town center of Haugesund. There is parking for 1,200 cars at the airport; taxis and car rental is also available. Tide Buss operates an airport coach service to the town center. NOR-WAY Bussekspress runs its Bergen to Stavanger coach service, Kystbussen, via Haugesund Airport in connection with Ryanair's flights.Reitan: 139 Travel time to Stavanger is 1:40 hours and to Bergen 3:00 hours. Both involve a ferry ride.

Established in 1911 by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, the College has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 680 students, from Years 3 to 10, with 120 at the junior campus and 480 at the senior campus. St Virgil's is affiliated with the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), and is a member of the Sports Association of Tasmanian Independent Schools (SATIS).  History  St Virgil's College, 1911 St Virgil's College was formally opened on 22 January 1911 by The Christian Brothers. Leo Doyle was the first student admitted to the College. At is foundation the College was a boarding school for boys located in Barrack Street, Hobart. The boarding section of the College was closed in 1970 and since then St Virgil's College has been a day school only. In 1962, another campus was opened in Austins Ferry, offering junior secondary grades (Grades 7‚Äì9) on a riverside property of 30 hectares. In 1991, three Grade 10 streams were also added. 2012 marks the 50 year celebrations for the campus. The Barrack Street campus then expanded for students from Grades 7‚Äì12 until 1994 when, under the Southern Secondary Schools Restructuring Plan, the campus no longer accepted enrolments for Grade 7. At the end of 1994, Grades 8, 11 and 12 ceased to run at the Barrack Street campus, and all secondary grades were moved to the Austins Ferry campus. This allowed Guilford Young College (Grades 11 and 12) to be established on the Barrack Street site. Grades 9 and 10 still ran in 1995, and only Grade 10 was offered in 1996. After 1996, St Virgil's College ceased to operate any of its classes on the Barrack Street campus. From then on, Grades 7‚Äì10 were all taught at the Austins Ferry campus, and because of the discontinuation of Grades 11‚Äì12, many students moved on to the newly formed Guilford Young College for their pre- tertiary years. In August 1995, permission was granted for St Peter's School to become the St Virgil's College Junior School from 1996 onwards. The Junior School now accommodates boys from Grades 3‚Äì6 and operates on the old St Peter's School site in Patrick Street. The current Principal of St Virgil's College is Damian Messer, who was appointed in 2010. In 2009, Christopher D. Smith left the college to carry out higher duties. Messer is now the full-time principal, with Heidi Senior as the Vice-Principal, a former teacher of the college, who replaced Terry Blizzard in 2019. In 2019, it was announced that St Virgil's College would expand from a year 3-10 school to a kinder to year 12 school. Works are currently underway to develop both the Hobart and Austins Ferry sites in order for the school to cater for the new students by 2021.  Facilities  The College's buildings consist of superior science, music, art, sporting, computer, woodwork and metalwork, food technology and learning support facilities. Expansions to the library began construction in May 2009 and were completed in November 2009. Recent changes to the College's facilities include: *The Joyce Performance Centre (2000) for stage shows and assemblies *The Br Jack Higgins' Wing (2004) for more classrooms *The alterations/expansion of the Edmund Rice Hall (2005‚Äì2006) to play sports *The naming of \\"Our Lady of Perpetual Help\\" Chapel (2006) to pray *St Virgils College Library (2009) for a wider selection of reading material for the students *Centenary Centre (2011) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the school *Redevelopment and refurbishment of the Science Wing (2013/4) *Redevelopment of classrooms on both sides of the college (2016) *The installation of the quadrangle roof (2016)  Curriculum  St Virgil's College offers a broad curriculum, with the areas of literacy and numeracy of high importance. Emphasis is also placed on the languages, science, social sciences and physical education. The College places the most emphasis on its teaching of religious education, which is central to every student's studies. Co-curriculum= Sport  Much importance is placed on sport at St Virgil's College. All students are encouraged to participate in at least one sport during their time at the College. The College has had much success on the sporting field throughout its history. Most recent is the College's domination of the Tasmanian State and Southern School's Athletics. The College's athletics team have won the SATIS (Sports Association of Tasmanian Independent Schools) Boy's junior title 10 years in a row, and the Southern SATIS title 10 years in a row as well. Other sports on offer at St Virgil's include canoe polo, cross-country, cricket, football, hockey, rowing, soccer, swimming, tennis, touch football, water polo, basketball, rugby, badminton, squash, sailing and athletics.  Music  The College has two teacher- coordinated stage bands accommodating players of different skill levels. St Virgil's also offers individual and small group instrumental tuition for those wishing to acquire the skills to excel further than a band setting can allow them. The College also has the facilities to accommodate students wishing to start their own rock band. The St Virgil's College Senior Stage Band has won numerous awards for its efforts at various eisteddfods around Hobart. The Senior Band specialises in the areas of contemporary rock, jazz, blues and Latin music. The band often performs at school fairs, school productions and masses. In late 2005, the Senior Band, along with the jazz quartet, toured Melbourne, performing at various schools and other venues. It is currently organizing and arranging plans to go on a similar tour of Melbourne in 2007. The Senior Stage band has also taken part in many St Virgil's school musicals. The band currently has between 10 and 15 members, and mainly features the trumpet, trombone and saxophone (alto, tenor and baritone), with a rhythm backing (drums, guitar and keyboard).  House system  As with most Australian schools, St Virgil's utilises a house system. The school houses are: *Doyle ‚Äî Blue *Dwyer ‚Äî Green *Hessian (formerly Virgilian House) ‚Äî Red *Joyce (formerly College House) ‚Äî Yellow  Notable alumni  An Alumnus of St Virgil's College is known as an 'Old Virgilian' and may elect to join the school's alumni association, the Old Virgilians' Association. The Association was established in 1916 as a way for Old Virgilians to meet regularly and keep in touch with news about the College.

History Built in conjunction with the Dworshak Dam by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the early 1970s, this bridge provides local access over the flooded river, now Dworshak Reservoir. It replaced a smaller bridge which crossed the river prior to the flooding by the reservoir. Without the bridge, vehicle access from Ahsahka to the small community of Elk River would be blocked off. The Corps of Engineers carefully weighed the possibilities for getting traffic to Elk River from the Orofino side of the Clearwater River. Building a new road all the way around the long reservoir would not only be expensive, cutting into miles and miles of extremely rocky terrain, but would also be a painful inconvenience for travelers. The only reasonable answer was a bridge somewhere in the middle of the future reservoir. The exact location was based on the topography most suitable for road access as well as for the bridge construction itself. The bridge takes its name from Charles and Katherine Dent, who in 1895 owned land on the western side of where the bridge now stands. The settlement of Dent was razed prior to being flooded by the reservoir.

Incumbent Republican Governor Rick Perry, who had ascended to the governorship after the resignation of George W. Bush to become President of the United States, was elected to his first full term in office, winning 58% of the vote to Democrat Tony Sanchez's 40%. Perry carried 218 out of 254 counties, while Sanchez only carried 36. Exit polls showed Perry easily won Anglos (72% to 28%) while Sanchez won African Americans (85% to 15%) and Latinos (65% to 35%). His second inauguration for a first full four-year term began on January 21, 2003, on the Texas State Capitol South Grounds. As of , this is the last time the Republican candidate carried Dallas County. Primaries=RepublicanDemocratic=Campaign=Perry Incumbent Rick Perry ascended to the governorship of Texas on December 21, 2000, following the resignation of then-Gov. George W. Bush, who had been elected President of the United States. Perry had been elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1998 and previously elected Texas Commissioner of Agriculture in 1990 and 1994 including three terms in the Texas House of Representatives in 1984, 1986 and 1988. He successfully ran for a full four- year term in 2002. Perry had an ongoing political feud with Democratic Speaker Pete Laney during the 2001 legislative session, and vetoed several pieces of legislation brought forward by several Democratic state lawmakers. However, rumors about fellow Republican U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison launching a primary challenge against Perry had been swirling for weeks, but Hutchison chose not to run for governor, choosing instead to serve as Vice Chair of the Senate Republican Conference to avoid a nasty primary battle that would have divided the Texas Republican Party in time for the general election of 2002. Perry's campaign received the endorsement of former State Attorney General Dan Morales, who lost the Democratic primary nomination, and he also received endorsements from the Dallas Morning News, Abilene Reporter-News, Midland Reporter-Telegram, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, and the Galveston County Daily News. Public opinion polls from Zogby International, Survey USA, and Scripps- Howard showed Perry leading by double digits, and the Perry campaign was outspent by Sanchez by a margin of 12-to-1, with Perry spending $27 million to Sanchez's $76 million. Sanchez Laredo multimillionaire businessman Tony Sanchez, had served as a regent of the University of Texas at Austin, having been appointed to the University of Texas Board of Regents by then-Governor Bush in 1997, and he also served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1985 to 1991-having been appointed by then-Governor Mark Wells White in 1985. Sanchez was best known for getting involved in successful battles such as: challenging the architectural plan for a new art museum and to consider a Hispanic candidate for President of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. Sanchez started making waves on running for governor back in late 2000, when he was helped by Kelly Fero, who served as a consultant on Jim Mattox's unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1990 and John Sharp's 1998 unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor, and also had discussions with George Shipley, a longtime Democratic strategist and consultant. In the Democratic primary, Sanchez easily defeated Morales by a landslide margin of 60 percent to 32 percent in the March 12, 2002 primary elections. However, the bitter primary campaign between Sanchez and Morales resulted in negative campaign attacks including Morales criticizing Sanchez for connections between a failed Sanchez-owned savings and loan and Mexican drug lords. Sanchez pummeled Morales by picking up the questions on the tobacco settlement and suggested the former Texas Attorney General was only running for office to protect himself from federal indictments. Sanchez managed to get the endorsements from the Austin Chronicle, Corpus Christi Caller Times, and the Waco Tribune Herald during the general election campaign.

It was acquired by John Bowes, the museum's founder, from a Parisian jeweler in 1872. The swan, which is life-sized, is a clockwork-driven device that includes a music box. The swan sits in a \\"stream\\" made of glass rods and surrounded by silver leaves. Small silver fish can be seen \\"swimming\\" in the stream. A small silver fish may just be seen in the foreground When the clockwork is wound, the music box plays and the glass rods rotate giving the illusion of flowing water. The swan turns its head from side to side and also preens itself. After a few moments the swan notices the swimming fish and bends down to catch and eat one. The swan's head then returns to the upright position and the performance, which lasts about 32 seconds, is over. To help preserve the mechanism, the swan is only operated once each day at 2pm. The mechanism was designed and built by the Low Countries inventor John Joseph Merlin (1735‚Äì1803) in conjunction with the London inventor James Cox (1723‚Äì1800) in 1773. The swan was described in a 1773 Act of Parliament as being 3 feet (0.91 m) in diameter and 18 feet (5.49 m) high.13 Geo III cap XLI James Cox Enabling Act contains an inventory of the pieces in Cox's museum, with descriptions: \\"A ∆íwan, large as life formed of ∆íilver‚Ä¶the whole eighteen feet high\\" This would seem to indicate that at one time there was more to the swan than remains today as it is no longer that high. It is said that there was originally a waterfall behind the swan, which was stolen while it was on tour ‚Äì this could possibly explain the height which is now 'missing'. It is known that the swan was sold several times and was shown at the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle (1867)) held in Paris, France. The American novelist Mark Twain observed the swan and recorded his observation in a chapter of the Innocents Abroad, writing that the swan \\"had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes.\\" The Bowes Museum believes that the Swan is their best-known artefact, and it is the basis of the museum's logo.

The highest point is Cerro de Las Tetas at 3630 meters, followed by Cerro Irapa at 3540 m., Serran√≠a de Macuira at 864 m., and Cerro Aceite at 853 m.  Peoples  The range is 58% in Venezuela, and 42% in Colombia. Venezuela has set aside a substantial part of the central part of the range as a national park (Sierra de Perij√° National Park), and Colombia has a smaller one. In the Venezuelan portion there are Amerindian reservations for the Yucpa and Bar√≠ people, and in Colombia for the Iroko and Sokorpa people. Venezuela has started a colonialization border plan building new communities along the border in the Perij√°. The town of Cojoro was the first one completed, followed by communities for the Wayuu and Goajira peoples.  Economy and politics  The climate is mostly tropical humid forests, with cultivation of coffee and papaver flowers. It is also a hot spot in the Colombian Conflict serving as home to parts of two FARC blocs called the Caribbean Bloc of the FARC-EP and the Middle Magdalena Bloc of the FARC-EP., and an ELN guerrilla column, that have also strayed into Venezuelan territory.

The bridge is the only vehicular connection from the Maine mainland to Little Deer Isle, one of the segments that make up the island. The span was completed in March 1939 with a main span of 329 meters (1,088 ft). The bridge was designed by Holton Duncan Robinson and David Bernard Steinman. It encountered wind stability problems that were similar to those of the Whitestone Bridge and the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed shortly after it opened. The problems led to modifications which included numerous cable stays connecting cables to the tower and tower to the deck. The span today carries two narrow lanes of State Route 15. A re-decking project was completed in May 2008. Repainting started in mid-2010 has been completed. History The Deer Isle-Sedgwick Bridge, named for the two townships it connects, was the first bridge built between Deer Isle and the mainland, replacing an inadequate ferry crossing system and effectively opening the island to tourism opportunities. It is notable for the innovation of its designers and contractors in creating a durable, long-span, high-level structure across a navigable arm of the Atlantic at minimal cost. Unprecedented use of prefabricated and previously used materials simplified construction and minimized costs, and much of the outdoor work was completed under poor weather conditions. The challenges facing David B. Steinman, his firm, and their contractors were numerous. The popularity of Eggemoggin Reach as a yachting area called for a wide channel at midspan with a minimum underclearance, placing the roadway at above mean water level. At the same time, the depth required for foundations at this location called for minimizing the length of the approach spans. This height problem was solved by employing steep 6.5% approach grades and a fairly short vertical curve at the center of the main span. In this manner, the needed height was attained and the approach viaducts were kept to a minimum length. The project was also complicated by its required early-summer completion date, meaning that much of the work had to be done during the winter and early spring months when weather conditions posed a significant challenge. Robinson and Steinman and their contractors solved this difficulty by prefabricating many of the components offsite and completing the bulk of the assembly quickly, working between high tides. Site-specific innovations in prefabrication and construction methods minimized outdoor work at the site and departed from conventional bridge- building practice. This careful consideration and planning resulted in a project completed on schedule and at low cost, despite the extreme conditions. The substructure, in particular, employed prefabrication at an unprecedented level. Instead of assembling the steel sheet-pile cofferdams and the metal forms for the main tower pedestals on site, Merritt-Chapman & Scott had them prefabricated at their yard on Staten Island and brought to Maine by barge. Their use of secondhand steel materials for the dams, along with the prefabrication and careful timing of the construction schedule, saved a great deal of money. The prefabricated dams were assembled for use on barges near the work site. After mud was removed from the bottom and the rock foundation carefully sounded, the dam bases were torch-cut to fit the profile of the irregular bedrock on which they were to be set. Finally, the dams were filled with concrete. On the superstructure, pre-stressed twisted-strand cables invented by the designer were used to advantage on both the main strands and the suspenders, meaning the time-consuming and expensive field adjustments were unnecessary. These cables debuted in the U.S. in 1931 on Steinman and Robinson‚Äôs Waldo-Hancock Bridge near Bucksport, Maine, and their St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon. A new connection method, which used sleeve nuts to connect each main strand socket to its anchorage rod, was also used. These connections, invented by Robinson and first used on the Thousand Islands Bridge the previous year, made small adjustments to the main strands very easy. Before the bridge was finished, unexpected wind-induced motion in the relatively lightweight deck indicated the need for greater stability. Diagonal stays running from the main cables to the stiffening girders on both towers were added to stabilize the bridge. However, the bridge‚Äôs motion during unusually severe storms in the winter of 1942‚Äì1943 caused extensive damage and destroyed some of the stays. With the recent collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in everyone‚Äôs mind, stronger and more extensive longitudinal and transverse diagonal stays were added.

Many neurodegenerative diseases ‚Äì including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, fatal familial insomnia, and Huntington's disease ‚Äì occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Such diseases are incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neurons. As research progresses, many similarities appear that relate these diseases to one another on a sub- cellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death. Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic. Specific disorders=Alzheimer's disease Comparison of brain tissue between healthy individual and Alzheimer's disease patient, demonstrating extent of neuronal death Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical structures, resulting in gross atrophy of the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. AD pathology is primarily characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaques are made up of small peptides, typically 39‚Äì43 amino acids in length, called beta-amyloid (also written as A-beta or AŒ≤). Beta-amyloid is a fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP appears to play roles in normal neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. APP is cleaved into smaller fragments by enzymes such as gamma secretase and beta secretase. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of beta-amyloid which can self-assemble into the dense extracellular deposits known as senile plaques or amyloid plaques. Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. It typically manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. PD is primarily characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. The cause of this selective cell death is unknown. Notably, alpha-synuclein- ubiquitin complexes and aggregates are observed to accumulate in Lewy bodies within affected neurons. It is thought that defects in protein transport machinery and regulation, such as RAB1, may play a role in this disease mechanism.\\"Parkinson's Disease Mechanism Discovered,\\" HHMI Research News June 22, 2006. Impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein may also lead to its accumulation in Lewy bodies. Experiments have revealed reduced transport rates of both wild-type and two familial Parkinson's disease-associated mutant alpha-synucleins through axons of cultured neurons. Membrane damage by alpha- synuclein could be another Parkinson's disease mechanism. The main known risk factor is age. Mutations in genes such as Œ±-synuclein (SNCA), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), glucocerebrosidase (GBA), and tau protein (MAPT) can also cause hereditary PD or increase PD risk. Huntington's disease Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the huntingtin gene. HD is characterized by loss of medium spiny neurons and astrogliosis. The first brain region to be substantially affected is the striatum, followed by degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices. The striatum's subthalamic nuclei send control signals to the globus pallidus, which initiates and modulates motion. The weaker signals from subthalamic nuclei thus cause reduced initiation and modulation of movement, resulting in the characteristic movements of the disorder, notably chorea. HD is caused by polyglutamine tract expansion in the huntingtin gene, resulting in the aggregation-prone mutant huntingtin (mHtt). mHtt aggregates may be directly toxic. Additionally, they may damage molecular motors and microtubules to interfere with normal retrograde transport along the axon, leading to impaired transport of important cargoes such as BDNF. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) is a disease in which motor neurons are selectively targeted for degeneration. In 1993, missense mutations in the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were discovered in a subsets of patients with familial ALS. This discovery led researchers to focus on unlocking the mechanisms for SOD1-mediated diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying SOD1 mutant toxicity has yet to be resolved. More recently, TDP-43 and FUS protein aggregates have been implicated in some cases of the disease, and a mutation in chromosome 9 (C9orf72) is thought to be the most common known cause of sporadic ALS. Recent independent research by Nagai et al. and Di Giorgio et al. provide in vitro evidence that the primary cellular sites where SOD1 mutations act are located on astrocytes. Astrocytes then cause the toxic effects on the motor neurons. The specific mechanism of toxicity still needs to be investigated, but the findings are significant because they implicate cells other than neuron cells in neurodegeneration. Batten disease Batten disease is a rare and fatal recessive neurodegenerative disorder that begins at birth. Risk factor The greatest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is aging. Mitochondrial DNA mutations as well as oxidative stress both contribute to aging. Many of these diseases are late-onset, meaning there is some factor that changes as a person ages for each disease. One constant factor is that in each disease, neurons gradually lose function as the disease progresses with age. It has been proposed that DNA damage accumulation provides the underlying causative link between aging and neurodegenerative disease.Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair. pages 121-139, Academic Press, San Diego. About 20-40% of healthy people between 60 and 78 years old experience discernable decrements in cognitive performance in several domains including working, spatial, and episodic memory, and processing speed.Camandola, S., & Mattson, M. P. (2017). Brain metabolism in health, aging, and neurodegeneration. The EMBO Journal, 36(11), 1474-1492. Mechanisms=Genetics Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by genetic mutations, most of which are located in completely unrelated genes. In many of the different diseases, the mutated gene has a common feature: a repeat of the CAG nucleotide triplet. CAG codes for the amino acid glutamine. A repeat of CAG results in a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. Diseases associated with such mutations are known as trinucleotide repeat disorders. Polyglutamine repeats typically cause dominant pathogenesis. Extra glutamine residues can acquire toxic properties through a variety of ways, including irregular protein folding and degradation pathways, altered subcellular localization, and abnormal interactions with other cellular proteins. PolyQ studies often use a variety of animal models because there is such a clearly defined trigger ‚Äì repeat expansion. Extensive research has been done using the models of nematode (C. elegans), and fruit fly (Drosophila), mice, and non-human primates. Nine inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the expansion of the CAG trinucleotide and polyQ tract, including Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias. Protein misfolding Several neurodegenerative diseases are classified as proteopathies as they are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins. *alpha-synuclein: can aggregate to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Alpha- synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. In addition, an alpha-synuclein fragment, known as the non-Abeta component (NAC), is found in amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. *tau: hyperphosphorylated tau protein is the main component of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. *beta amyloid: the major component of senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. *prion: main component of prion diseases and transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Intracellular mechanismsProtein degradation pathways= Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are both late-onset and associated with the accumulation of intracellular toxic proteins. Diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins are known as proteinopathies, and they are primarily caused by aggregates in the following structures: * cytosol, e.g. Parkinson's & Huntington's * nucleus, e.g. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) * endoplasmic reticulum (ER), (as seen with neuroserpin mutations that cause familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies) * extracellularly excreted proteins, amyloid-Œ≤ in Alzheimer's disease There are two main avenues eukaryotic cells use to remove troublesome proteins or organelles: *ubiquitin‚Äìproteasome: protein ubiquitin along with enzymes is key for the degradation of many proteins that cause proteinopathies including polyQ expansions and alpha-synucleins. Research indicates proteasome enzymes may not be able to correctly cleave these irregular proteins, which could possibly result in a more toxic species. This is the primary route cells use to degrade proteins. ** Decreased proteasome activity is consistent with models in which intracellular protein aggregates form. It is still unknown whether or not these aggregates are a cause or a result of neurodegeneration. *autophagy‚Äìlysosome pathways: a form of programmed cell death (PCD), this becomes the favorable route when a protein is aggregate-prone meaning it is a poor proteasome substrate. This can be split into two forms of autophagy: macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). **macroautophagy is involved with nutrient recycling of macromolecules under conditions of starvation, certain apoptotic pathways, and if absent, leads to the formation of ubiquinated inclusions. Experiments in mice with neuronally confined macroautophagy-gene knockouts develop intraneuronal aggregates leading to neurodegeneration. **chaperone-mediated autophagy defects may also lead to neurodegeneration. Research has shown that mutant proteins bind to the CMA- pathway receptors on lysosomal membrane and in doing so block their own degradation as well as the degradation of other substrates. =Membrane damage= Damage to the membranes of organelles by monomeric or oligomeric proteins could also contribute to these diseases. Alpha-synuclein can damage membranes by inducing membrane curvature, and cause extensive tubulation and vesiculation when incubated with artificial phospholipid vesicles. The tubes formed from these lipid vesicles consist of both micellar as well as bilayer tubes. Extensive induction of membrane curvature is deleterious to the cell and would eventually lead to cell death.Apart from tubular structures, alpha- synuclein can also form lipoprotein nanoparticles similar to apolipoproteins. =Mitochondrial dysfunction= The most common form of cell death in neurodegeneration is through the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This pathway controls the activation of caspase-9 by regulating the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are normal byproducts of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. ROS concentration is mediated by mitochondrial antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase. Over production of ROS (oxidative stress) is a central feature of all neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to the generation of ROS, mitochondria are also involved with life-sustaining functions including calcium homeostasis, PCD, mitochondrial fission and fusion, lipid concentration of the mitochondrial membranes, and the mitochondrial permeability transition. Mitochondrial disease leading to neurodegeneration is likely, at least on some level, to involve all of these functions. There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a causal role in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis, including in four of the more well known diseases Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Neurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to their strong metabolic activity associated with high transcription levels, high oxygen consumption, and weak antioxidant defense. =DNA damage= The brain metabolizes as much as a fifth of consumed oxygen, and reactive oxygen species produced by oxidative metabolism are a major source of DNA damage in the brain. Damage to a cell‚Äôs DNA is particularly harmful because DNA is the blueprint for protein production and unlike other molecules it cannot simply be replaced by re-synthesis. The vulnerability of post-mitotic neurons to DNA damage (such as oxidative lesions or certain types of DNA strand breaks), coupled with a gradual decline in the activities of repair mechanisms, could lead to accumulation of DNA damage with age and contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration. DNA single-strand breaks are common and are associated with the neurodegenerative disease ataxia-oculomotor apraxia. Increased oxidative DNA damage in the brain is associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Defective DNA repair has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia telangiectasia, Cockayne syndrome, Parkinson‚Äôs disease and xeroderma pigmentosum. =Axonal transport= Axonal swelling, and axonal spheroids have been observed in many different neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that defective axons are not only present in diseased neurons, but also that they may cause certain pathological insult due to accumulation of organelles. Axonal transport can be disrupted by a variety of mechanisms including damage to: kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein, microtubules, cargoes, and mitochondria. When axonal transport is severely disrupted a degenerative pathway known as Wallerian-like degeneration is often triggered.Coleman MP & Freeman MF 'Wallerian degeneration, WldS and Nmnat' Annual Review of Neuroscience 2010, 33: 245-67 Programmed cell death Programmed cell death (PCD) is death of a cell in any form, mediated by an intracellular program. This process can be activated in neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, amytrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. PCD observed in neurodegenerative diseases may be directly pathogenic; alternatively, PCD may occur in response to other injury or disease processes. =Apoptosis (type I)= Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of programmed cell death (PCD) and involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death. *Extrinsic apoptotic pathways: Occur when factors outside the cell activate cell surface death receptors (e.g., Fas) that result in the activation of caspases-8 or -10. *Intrinsic apoptotic pathways: Result from mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or endoplasmic reticulum malfunctions, each leading to the activation of caspase-9. The nucleus and Golgi apparatus are other organelles that have damage sensors, which can lead the cells down apoptotic pathways. Caspases (cysteine-aspartic acid proteases) cleave at very specific amino acid residues. There are two types of caspases: initiators and effectors. Initiator caspases cleave inactive forms of effector caspases. This activates the effectors that in turn cleave other proteins resulting in apoptotic initiation. =Autophagic (type II)= Autophagy is a form of intracellular phagocytosis in which a cell actively consumes damaged organelles or misfolded proteins by encapsulating them into an autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome to destroy the contents of the autophagosome. Because many neurodegenerative diseases show unusual protein aggregates, it is hypothesized that defects in autophagy could be a common mechanism of neurodegeneration. =Cytoplasmic (type III)= PCD can also occur via non- apoptotic processes, also known as Type III or cytoplasmic cell death. For example, type III PCD might be caused by trophotoxicity, or hyperactivation of trophic factor receptors. Cytotoxins that induce PCD can cause necrosis at low concentrations, or aponecrosis (combination of apoptosis and necrosis) at higher concentrations. It is still unclear exactly what combination of apoptosis, non-apoptosis, and necrosis causes different kinds of aponecrosis. Transglutaminase Transglutaminases are human enzymes ubiquitously present in the human body and in the brain in particular. The main function of transglutaminases is bind proteins and peptides intra- and intermolecularly, by a type of covalent bonds termed isopeptide bonds, in a reaction termed transamidation or crosslinking. Transglutaminase binding of these proteins and peptides make them clump together. The resulting structures are turned extremely resistant to chemical and mechanical disruption. Most relevant human neurodegenerative diseases share the property of having abnormal structures made up of proteins and peptides. Each of these neurodegenerative disesases have one (or several) specific main protein or peptide. In Alzheimer's disease, these are amyloid-beta and tau. In Parkinson‚Äôs disease, it is alpha- synuclein. In Huntington‚Äôs disease, it is huntingtin. Transglutaminase substrates: Amyloid-beta, tau, alpha-synuclein and huntingtin have been proved to be substrates of transglutaminases in vitro or in vivo, that is, they can be bonded by trasglutaminases by covalent bonds to each other and potentially to any other transglutaminase substrate in the brain. Transglutaminase augmented expression: It has been proved that in these neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and Huntington‚Äôs disease) the expression of the transglutaminase enzyme is increased. Presence of isopeptide bonds in these structures: The presence of isopeptide bonds (the result of the transglutaminase reaction) have been detected in the abnormal structures that are characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases. Co- localization: Co-localization of transglutaminase mediated isopeptide bonds with these abnormal structures has been detected in the autopsy of brains of patients with these diseases. Management The process of neurodegeneration is not well understood, so the diseases that stem from it have, as yet, no cures. Animal models in research In the search for effective treatments (as opposed to palliative care), investigators employ animal models of disease to test potential therapeutic agents. Model organisms provide an inexpensive and relatively quick means to perform two main functions: target identification and target validation. Together, these help show the value of any specific therapeutic strategies and drugs when attempting to ameliorate disease severity. An example is the drug Dimebon by Medivation, Inc. In 2009 this drug was in phase III clinical trials for use in Alzheimer's disease, and also phase II clinical trials for use in Huntington's disease. In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug Dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease. Dimebon Disappoints in Phase 3 Trial With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for Dimebon (latrepirdine) in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine. Negative results. Pharm Med 2012;26(2):113-115 In another experiment using a rat model of Alzheimer's disease, it was demonstrated that systemic administration of hypothalamic proline-rich peptide (PRP)-1 offers neuroprotective effects and can prevent neurodegeneration in hippocampus amyloid-beta 25‚Äì35. This suggests that there could be therapeutic value to PRP-1. Other avenues of investigation Protein degradation offers therapeutic options both in preventing the synthesis and degradation of irregular proteins. There is also interest in upregulating autophagy to help clear protein aggregates implicated in neurodegeneration. Both of these options involve very complex pathways that we are only beginning to understand. The goal of immunotherapy is to enhance aspects of the immune system. Both active and passive vaccinations have been proposed for Alzheimer's disease and other conditions; however, more research must be done to prove safety and efficacy in humans. A current therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is the protease Œ≤-secretase, which is involved in the amyloidogenic processing pathway that leads to the pathological accumulation of proteins in the brain. When the gene that encodes for amyloid precursor protein (APP) is spliced by Œ±-secretase rather than Œ≤-secretase, the toxic protein Œ≤ amyloid is not produced. Targeted inhibition of Œ≤-secretase can potentially prevent the neuronal death that is responsible for the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
