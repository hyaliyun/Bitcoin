It was released on DVD on August 30, 2011. It stars Kacey Barnfield, Oliver James, Diarmuid Noyes and Stephen Rea. The film was shot on location in Ireland. It is the 24th film of the Maneater Series. Plot Kate (Kacey Barnfield) is traveling around Ireland in an R.V. with her ex-boyfriend Ryan (Oliver James), brother Joel (Colin Maher) and friends Hailey (Eliza Bennett), Chuck (Diarmuid Noyes), Tommy (Kobna Holdbrook-Smith) and Anita (Róisín Murphy). After driving into the countryside, the group stop off at a small shop, where they encounter Luca (Ned Dennehy) who attempts to scam them from buying a medallion, and warns them it is dangerous before Chuck steals the medallion and the group attempt to make a quick get-away. However, as they drive away in their R.V. they hit an old woman, who puts a curse on the group, telling them the mythical bird the roc will take vengeance on them, before dying. The group quickly drive away in their R.V. but hit a patch of thick fog and become lost, as fears of the curse heighten. Stopping the R.V. they encounter a young boy in the road. Anita leaves the R.V. to talk to the boy, but he runs away before the roc grabs Anita and drags her into the air. Her body is dropped in front of the R.V., with half of her face mauled off before the roc returns and flies away with her. Ryan continues to drive down the road, as the group begin to panic as they have no way of contacting help. The roc attacks the R.V. and causes a tire to be blown. Armed with a road flare, Tommy goes to change the tires. As he finishes, the roc returns. The group hears the road flare set off and rush outside, to find Tommy with his face mauled off. The roc swoops down grabs Tommy, flies off and decapitates Tommy, while the others retreat into the R.V. The group begin to argue, but the roc reappears, chasing after the R.V., however it flies away when the R.V. reaches a secluded house. The group enter the house and find a family, including Drina (Eve Macklin), who are willing to let them use their phone. However, Luca arrives and takes them outside at gun point. Drina takes Kate to retrieve the medallion from the R.V., however Kate instead knocks her out and escapes, having already put the medallion on, while Luca ties the others to wooden poles so the roc can get them. As the roc arrives, Kate manages to free her friends before the roc flies away after seeing the medallion. However Luca shoots Hailey in the stomach, killing her and forcing the others to flee into the surrounding forest. Luca chases them throughout the forest, but they manage to escape back to the R.V. where they find Drina once more, who begs for the medallion. Kate discovers the medallion is protection against the roc, so escapes with it, leaving Drina to be killed by the roc. After driving down the road farther, the group pass a service station. Ryan leaves the R.V. after reconciling with Kate, to call for help, while the others continue to drive down the road to create a distraction. The roc briefly follows the R.V. but soon circles around to go back for Ryan. As Ryan is about to be attacked, the others distract the roc and manage to harm it with fire. They leave the R.V. to find Ryan missing and the phone broken. They hide in a restroom before they hear a policeman, Seamus (Stephen Rea) arrive, however he begins to tie them up for the roc, but they overpower him and knock him unconscious. While escaping, Joel is carried away by the roc. As Kate and Chuck are leaving they run over Seamus, killing him. After driving down the road, Kate receives a call from Ryan, however the line is cut dead. Kate manages to get a signal and phones Ryan back. Hearing the cell-phone ring, Kate rushes out into the forest only to find Luca, who shows Kate the rocs nest, filled with her dead friends. Chuck arrives and sends Luca away at gunpoint before Kate takes the gun and sends Chuck back to the R.V. to escape, while she remains mourning in the nest with the bodies of her friends, including Ryan, to be killed by the roc. Chuck, the sole survivor of the group, reaches a gas station and stops for gas, but Luca is already there and forces Chuck to give him the medallion. The roc arrives, but Chuck manages to ignite some spilt gas, blowing up the R.V. and Luca with the roc. The roc however, somehow manages to survive and attacks Chuck as he is walking away, completing the old woman's revenge.

While it suffers from some of the shortcomings we’re used to seeing with these films, there are enough pleasant surprises to keep it interesting.

The decision extended the doctrine of natural justice (procedural fairness in judicial hearings) into the realm of administrative decision making. As a result, the case has been described as \\"the landmark case\\" that opened up decisions taken by the UK executive to judicial review in English law. Facts The Brighton police authority dismissed its Chief Constable (Charles Ridge) without offering him an opportunity to defend his actions. The Chief Constable appealed, arguing that the Brighton Watch Committee (headed by George Baldwin) had acted unlawfully (ultra vires) in terminating his appointment in 1958 following criminal proceedings against him. Ridge also sought financial reparation from the police authority; having declined to seek reappointment, he sought a reinstatement of his pension, to which he would have been entitled with effect from 1960 had he not been dismissed, plus damages, or salary backdated to his dismissal. and this principle of natural justice appears in many judgment by judges of higher authority. Judgment The House of Lords held that Baldwin's committee had violated the doctrine of natural justice, overturning the principle outlined by the Donoughmore Committee thirty years before that the doctrine of natural justice could not be applied to administrative decisions. Significance \\"Natural justice\\" is a legal doctrine which requires an absence of bias (nemo iudex in causa sua) and the right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem). Ridge was the first time that the doctrine had been used to overturn a non-judicial (or quasi- judicial) decision.

Jackson was elected to Greenwich Borough Council as a Progressive Party councillor, representing the South Ward. He was mayor of Greenwich in 1902–1903. Member of parliament At the general election of 1906 Jackson again stood at Greenwich in opposition to Lord Hugh Cecil. The Conservative vote was split between Cecil, who advocated free trade and Ion Hamilton Benn who stood as an advocate of Tariff Reform. Jackson won the seat for the Liberals with a majority over Benn 1,341 votes. Cecil finished a poor third. Jackson only served one term in parliament, and was defeated by Benn at the next election in January 1910. Later life Jackson resumed his legal practice. He eventually retired to Blackheath, where he died in June 1938, aged 88. Following a funeral at St Alfege Church, Greenwich, he was buried in Shooters Hill Cemetery.

Plot Three robbers, Lylle Corbett (Mitchell), Dolph Kostis (Salter), and Darlene (Mansfield), steal one-million dollars from a shipment on its way to the United States. But, instead of sharing the dough with Lylle, Dolph, decides to kill him, without Darlene (who likes them both), knowing it. When returning to Darlene (his wife), at the Hotel Americano's, Dolph, informs her that Lylle is out of the picture and that she should forget about him. Before Dolph had returned, Darlene, had been visited by the hotel's manager Livio Morelli (Braun), who was there to request her to turn down the volume on her radio. Livio sees a one-thousand dollar bill under the edge of the bed, and quickly knows that they are the robbers; that he had recently heard about on the radio; and that they call themselves \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smithopolis\\". As a break away, to not getting caught, Dolph and Darlene, make a get-a-way on a rental boat. However, they unaware that the owner of the hotel's innocent-looking sister, Sandra (Heath), is in the back of the boat and has planted a bomb, to kill the pair, and take off with the million for she and her brother...Lylle, who is supposed to be dead, is also in the boat; who later holds them hostage. Arriving on an \\"deserted\\" island, Lylle, ensures everyone that he is in charge.

But what Dolph, Lylle, and Darlene, don't know is; everyone else there on the island knows they're the robbers of the one-million dollars, and that they want the money. After a while on the island, people are starting to be killed, with the killer being unknown. Lylle, suspects the killer to be the holder of the one-million dollars or a person looking for it. After Dolph dies, with Livio and Jannis following after, Lylle goes insane searching for the million. In the end, Lylle, finds out that Sandra, the so innocent-looking girl is the killer and the holder of the dough.

However, in the film's opening credits, Mansfield is billed last; as: \\"and Jayne Mansfield as Darlene\\"; she was also billed this way in most of the film's movie trailers. Even though Mansfield was capitalized as the movie's star, she was more of a supporting character. Background Jayne Mansfield called the film: \\"The best role of my career.\\" American audiences wanted to know were this role was, for Einer frisst den anderen was not released to American theaters until two years after its official German release, in 1964. When released in the U.S.. it was released as Dog Eat Dog!, and flopped as it did everywhere else. Today the feature carries on a cult gathering, as a forever \\"gold-digging\\" classic.

Oliveira is a double-below-the-knee amputee, classifying him in the Paralympic T43 class; athletes in this class run in T44 event. Biography Oliveira was born in Marabá, in the state of Pará. He had both legs amputated at the age of 21 days, after an intestinal infection led to sepsis. By the age of eight, he was competing in athletics. Oliveira began running with wooden prostheses, and started competing in races in Brazil at age 13. He began running on carbon- fibre blades at the age of 15, shortly before competing in his first Paralympics in Beijing. Competing at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, Oliveira won a silver medal in the T42–T46 4 × 100 metres relay as part of the Brazilian team, after failing to win a medal in the T44 200m. At the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London he won gold in the T44 200m, ahead of Oscar Pistorius who was a favorite to win. Immediately after the race Pistorius caused controversy by criticising the blades Oliveira had used, claiming they were too long and artificially increased his stride length, giving him an unfair advantage. Pistorius' complaint was denied at that time by the International Paralympic Committee, which stated all athletes were measured prior to the race by a classifier and all blade lengths were approved for competition. The IPC also confirmed that Pistorius had raised the issue of prosthetic lengths in personal contacts about six weeks prior to the race. SASCOC issued a statement declaring their full support and promising to assist in discussions with the IPC about the issue of blade lengths after the Games. The IPC expressed willingness to discuss the issue. Australian runner Jack Swift and USA runner Jerome Singleton, among other athletes, also expressed support for Pistorius' position regarding a possible competitive advantage. In July 2013 at the Paralympic Anniversary Games in London Oliveira became world's fastest double amputee athlete when he completed the T43 100m race in a time of 10.57 beating his previous record of 10.77 which he had set in Berlin in June 2013. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics, held in Rio de Janeiro in his home country of Brazil, Oliveira failed to reach the final of either the 100m or 200m races in the T43 class.http://www.athleticsweekly.com/featured/richard-whitehead-defends- paralympic-200m-title-51369 He did however win a silver medal in the T42-T47 4x100m relay as part of the Brazil team.

Career 1972 the state-approved optometrist opened his first shop in Cuxhaven. In 1981 he revolutionised the German spectacle market by offering 90 fashionable frames for the allowance of the statutory health insurance funds (initial tariff). Because previously only 6 models were available in exchange for the insurance allowance, Fielmann thus removed the social stigma of having to wear glasses. This liberalisation, favourable media coverage (\\"Robin Hood of spectacle wearers\\") and aggressive marketing allowed his business to grow rapidly. In 1982 a new shop was opened in Kiel offering more than 7,000 frames to choose from. In 1994 the Fielmann KG was transformed into Fielmann AG and went public. In 2002, Fielmann bought Plön Castle from the state of Schleswig-Holstein and had it renovated extensively. Since 2003 he trains his optometrists in the castle. From 2005/06 onwards bachelor's and master's degrees in optometry are being offered in cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences Lübeck. Personal life Fielmann has two children with Heike Fielmann from whom he is divorced. His son, Marc Fielmann, is said to take over the company one day.

It is located in Richard's town in Bangalore, Karnataka, India and is for day scholars. It has classes from the preparatory level until the 12th grade and is in the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education syllabus.  History  Clarence High School was founded in 1914 by the Redwood brothers, Alfred and Walter, two Englishmen, who named it after their own school in Somerset, United Kingdom. The Redwoods left Bangalore in the 1960s and were no longer involved in the institution’s management. The school’s alumni raised money to construct the Flack Memorial Auditorium, named after one of the school’s former principals, A C Flack, who came from Australia in 1946. In 2014, Clarence High School became the fourth Anglo-Indian origin school in Bangalore to reach the 100-year milestone, after St Joseph’s (1858), Bishop Cotton (1865) and Baldwin (1880) schools. Fr Jose Aikara CM, chairman of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), inaugurated the centenary celebrations. = School heads = Some of the former school principals are Mr. A. C. Flack, Dr David Coates, Mr. M. T. Thomas, and Mr. Benny Joseph.  Campus  The Flack Auditorium entrance, adjacent to the Christmas Tree. For a while the school was located in a bungalow on Palm Road (now M. M. Road, near the Fraser Town Mosque). This building now houses the Fraser Town Post Office. The school is now located on Pottery Road, at a junction near Richard's Park. It lends its name to a bus stop for buses moving towards and from M. S. Nagar, Lingarajpuram, Banaswadi, Kammanahalli, Kalyannagar and Hennur. While the main gate faces Pottery Road, the side gates face Viviani Road and Mosque Road Extension. The fourth side faces apartments that line John Armstrong Road. The school has a number of buildings, one of the newest among them being the William Carey block. This block has several of the classrooms, the laboratories, the physical education department, the music room and faces the playground field. The Coates library houses 9 000 books. There are a number of laboratories for the various science subjects (Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Computers). The Flack Memorial Assembly Hall can house around a thousand people. The kindergarten students have a separate block (KG Block) and playground. The Stewards Block, a building for the Special Needs Department, has a large clock on top which is visible from the roads adjacent to the school campus. The campus has several trees, the most prominent among them being a Christmas tree and a Peepal tree.  School motto  The school motto is \\"Our Utmost For The Highest\\". The philosophy of the founders is also summed up in a verse from the Bible - \\"The Reverence of The Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom.\\" This is taken from the book of Proverbs (chapter 9, verse 10).  School song  The Clarence High School (Bangalore, India) Flack Auditorium Hall The school hymn, composed by Mr.G.C. Rogers, begins with the words: \\"We thank Thee now O Father\\"  Academics  Part of the Clarence High School (Bangalore, India) Playground, behind the old Chemistry Lab. The school practises a five-day week schedule. The day begins at 8:00 a.m. (formerly at 8:35 a.m.) with a daily assembly which is normally twenty-five minutes long and is conducted within the school hall. The lunch break is between 12:30 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. (formerly between 12:35 p.m. and 1:05 p.m). The day ends at 3:00 p.m for students from class 3 onwards and 2:30 pm for the kindergarten students. It used to end at 3:10 for the junior pupils (until 6th Std.) and at 3:45 for the senior pupils. The entry level is at the Preparatory class, equivalent to the Upper Kindergarten (UKG) class, meant for five-year-old children. The Preparatory, First and Second Standards are called the Kindergarten with classrooms in the KG block along with a separate library and playground (called the KG Lane). The rest of the school use the school field and the school library which houses several thousands of books. A basketball court and a few more buildings also form part of the school premises. The first language is English, the second language was formerly Hindi or French but now Kannada is made the second language for pupils from prep onwards from 2018 as the state government has made a rule urging schools to do so. The tenth standard examinations are conducted in the ICSE (Indian Council for Secondary Examinations) format. The eleventh and the twelfth standards are divided into Science, Commerce and Arts streams. The twelfth standard examinations are conducted in the ISC format (Indian School Certificate). Both public examinations are conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations Board.  Sports  The Basketball court and the Wilcox Block, Clarence High School (Bangalore, India) The school has a separate playground, called Assaye Field, beside Assaye Road. The school organises and conducts the Clarencian shield, the prestigious inter-school Basketball tournament, every year around the months of October and November. Football, cricket and throw-ball are some of the other team events that the students of Clarence High play.  Houses  The house system is a feature common to Public schools in India (based on an equivalent system in England). The Houses distribute a school community into smaller, more personal units, and thereby build a sense of loyalty and competition. Traditionally there were three houses: Barton, Redwood and Theobald. Their team colours are green, red and blue respectively. Wilcox, a new fourth house was made with the team colour yellow. Their mottoes are: \\"Never Despair\\" for the Barton house, \\"Ad Astra\\" for the Redwood house (Aim for the stars in Latin), \\"Never Give In\\" for the Theobald house and \\"Press Onward\\" for the Wilcox house. The Kindergarten children also belong to one of the above houses.  New initiatives  The school opened a special needs department in 2004.

Margaret and George had a posthumous child, a girl named Georgia. Georgia went with her mother to Anhalt, but returned to Pomerania when she was eight years old. Margaret succeeded in tough negotiations with her stepson, Philip I, to delay her return until May 1543.Dirk Schleinert: Georgia von Pommern (1531-1573). Studien zum Leben einer Fürstin des 16.

Her marriage to John soon proved unhappy. Margaret fled from her husband to her wittum, Roßlau Castle. Martin Luther tried to mediate between John and Margaret. He visited her at Roßlau Castle and blamed her for leaving her husband cheekily. This started a fierce war of words. Luther later reported: I must have told her clearly enough, until I was attracting her wrath. John eventually accused Margaret of marital infidelity and imprisoned her in 1550. John's personal physician was tortured to make him confess a relationship with the princess, but he did not budge. She managed to escape from her prison and after a number of adventures arrived half-naked and robbed at the court of her cousin King Christian III of Denmark in Copenhagen. Later, she lived for a while with her sister Elisabeth, who advised her to protect herself by marrying for a third time. Elisabeth held her sister to be unreliable and unstable and warned her son-in-law Albert not to take in Margaret.Martina Schattkowsky: Witwenschaft in der frühen Neuzeit, Leipziger Universitätsverlag, Leipzig, 2003, p. 101 Albert took her in anyway, and after his death George Frederick I, the administrator of Prussia, took care of her, because her own children refused to support her.

The Zimbabwean communities are localized, between other places, in California and Texas.  History  The first great wave of immigration from Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) took place during and after the Rhodesian Bush War in the 1970s, a time when many White Rhodesian families emigrated due to political and economic conditions. Although initially they emigrated to neighboring South Africa, because they shared English language and heritage, and the United Kingdom, the former colonial power, subsequently they increasingly emigrated to the United States and Australia, countries that, like the above, shared language and heritage. Following the independence of Zimbabwe from the UK in 1980, these immigrants identified themselves as Rhodesians, united by their shared struggles experienced during the Bush War. In the 1980s, a second group of people from Zimbabwe came to the United States, mostly students that returned to their country after completing their studies. This emigration of students was increased in the 1990s and included both White and Black people. Due to their limited and extremely competitive university system, many Zimbabwean students emigrated to other countries seeking educational opportunities, especially in business and technology. Unlike earlier Zimbabwean students, many in the 1990s decided to remain in the United States after completing their studies, given the negative economic situation in Zimbabwe and the job opportunities that they could find in the United States. Thus, the majority of Zimbabweans who migrate to the United States are students and young professionals.Encyclopedia of Chicago: Zimbabweans in Chicago . Tracy Steffes. Retrieved September 4, 2012. Demographics In 2014, the Zimbabwean population in the U.S. was noted as one of \\"a strong skilled and non-skilled diaspora population\\" that is also focused in South Africa, the UK and Australia. Thus, Zimbabweans in the U.S. make up just a small part of the Zimbabwean diaspora compared to the larger communities in South Africa and the United Kingdom. However, of Zimbabweans who have not yet emigrated but are considering it, a somewhat higher proportion state that the United States, rather than the United Kingdom, is their preferred destination; this may be due to harassment and discrimination which Zimbabweans have faced in the UK. There are various conflicting unofficial figures about the number of Zimbabweans in the U.S. The RAND Corporation estimated in 2000 that there were 59,000 in the state of New York alone. In contrast, a 2008 estimate from the Association of Zimbabweans Based Abroad put the population of Zimbabweans in the whole U.S. at just 75,000. There is a small community of Zimbabweans in Chicago consisting primarily of former students at area universities. Other cities with Zimbabwean communities include: Washington, D.C., New York City, Indianapolis, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Detroit.  Organizations  There is an important organization in Indianapolis of Zimbabwean having annual celebrations of Independence Day (April 18) and other events, such as the first Annual Convention and Business Expo Zimbabwe in 2002. Due to the limited success of the Zimbabwean living in Chicago to create organizations (because their community is dispersed through the city), they have formed ties with the organization of Zimbabwe in Indianapolis. Other Zimbabwean association is the Zimbabwe-United States of America Alumni Association (ZUSAA).Embassy of the United States: Harare Zimbabwe  Notable people  * Farai Chideya * Jabulani Dhliwayo * Sean Fletcher * Alexandra Govere * Danai Gurira * Philemon Hanneck * Nyasha Hatendi * Paul Maritz * Julian Mavunga * Masasa * Charles Mudede * Kristine Musademba * Takudzwa Ngwenya * Andrew Pattison * James Thindwa * Tinashe * Tererai Trent * Billy Woods (rapper) See also * Zimbabwean diaspora * Zimbabwean Australians * Southern Africans in the United States * Kutsinhira Cultural Arts Center References Category:Southern Africans in the United States ","title":"Zimbabwean Americans"},{"id":"32978387","text":"The John Ford Home (also known as Ford Stockade or Ford's Fort) National Register of Historic Places (website); Mississippi, Marion County is a historic landmark located in Marion County, Mississippi, approximately 20 miles south of the city of Columbia, near the community of Sandy Hook.

(27 December 1894 – 16 November 1956) was a major Maltese philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were chiefly epistemology and metaphysics.Mark Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, pp. 50-51. Life =The early years= Pirotta was born at Naxxar, Malta.All biographical information is reproduced from Mark Montebello’s Angelo Pirotta: A Maltese philosopher of the first water, Maltese Dominican Province, Malta, 2006, with full permission of the copyright holders. Even if his family lived hand to mouth, he was the first of thirteen children, three of whom died in infancy. Pirotta was first privately schooled by Canon Fortunato De Bono. Later, he eventually enrolled on a regular course at the government-owned high school for boys (the Lyceum) at Valletta. He completed the course at the Lyceum up till the age of sixteen. Thereafter, he joined the Dominicans almost immediately, on 30 April 1911. =Initial formation= At Rabat, together with his companions, Pirotta began his novitiate, and then, a year later, made his simple (three-year) profession on 12 May 1912. Thereafter, he began his institutional studies; three years of philosophy (1912–15), and four of theology (1915–19), of course all according to the [Thomist] tradition. He made his religious profession on 11 May 1915. After completing his second year of theology (1916/17), Pirotta was chosen to continue his theological studies at Pontifical International Angelicum College in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. In the meantime, he was ordained a priest by on 22 September 1917, at the St. John’s Co-Cathedral, Valletta, Malta. In Rome Pirotta resided at the Angelicum College itself. After his two years of theology (1917–19), on 1 July 1919, he successfully set for his Lectorate exams with a dissertation entitled De Reali Distinctione inter Essentiam et Esse in Creatis (The Real Distinction between Essence and Existence in Created Being). Thereafter, he proceeded with his post-graduate studies in philosophy (1919–21). Meanwhile, he also prepared his doctorate thesis, entitled De Supposto et Persona, which he successfully defended on, 1 July 1921. =The Italy years= At Viterbo Pirotta’s first academic assignment was at Viterbo. Here he spent five academic years (1921–26), teaching history of philosophy, natural science (also called ‘physics’), and theodicy (theologia fundamentalis; now called natural theology). Here he was frequently invited to address the Circulus Philosophicus (Philosophical Discussion Group), and was also asked to contribute to prestigious Thomistic periodicals, read sermons, and give speeches. At Viterbo, Pirotta also prepared his first major publication, and frankly his most successful composition to date: an exposition of Aquinas’ commentary on Aristotle’s De Anima (On the Soul). At Rome After Viterbo, Pirotta returned to Rome to assume a teaching post at the Angelicum College. Here Pirotta remained for just two years (1926-28), teaching philosophy, theodicy, logic, and ontology. In terms of literary production, Pirotta’s Roman years correspond to a very prolific and industrious period. He wrote reviews, scientific articles, and even prepared and published his second major work: another exposition on Aquinas’ commentaries on Aristotle’s De Sensu et Sensato (On Sense and Sensibility) and De Memoria et Reminiscientia (On Memory and Remembrance). Interlude in Malta In 1928, Pirotta had to retire momentarily to his homeland since his family was in dire straits. One of his brothers became seriously ill, and his mother was ill and dying. She succumbed on 5 July 1929. In Malta Pirotta spent two academic years (1928–30), residing and lecturing at Rabat, Malta. More or less as usual, Pirotta read philosophy, the history of philosophy, and apologetics. He also continued to publish steadily, especially scientific reviews and articles. At Fiesole Back in Italy, Pirotta was sent to College of Fiesole, near Florence, Italy. The college here was not a public one, but the academic institution that prepared Dominican students for the priesthood. Pirotta stayed here for just one academic year (1930/31), reading the history of philosophy, and the treatise on divine revelation. Here he also worked upon the first of his six-volumed Summa Philosophæ (The Sum of Philosophy), which he published in 1931. He also prepared for his Masters. The final exam was successfully held on 7 May 1931, in Rome at the Angelicum College, which by that time had been upgraded to the status of an international university. As was the usual practice, the title was conferred four years later. The official investiture was held at the Dominican Priory at Rabat, Malta on 24 November 1935. At Naples After Tuscany came Naples. Here, at the Aquinas College of the Dominicans, Pirotta did not go simply as a lecturer, but as a Rector (‘Lectorem Primarium’). He stayed here for three consecutive academic years (1931–34). At Naples, Pirotta may be considered to have been at the peak of his academic career. At the beginning of his experience there he published the first of his planned six-volumed Summa Philosophæ: a study about Aristotelico-Thomistic logic, called the Philosophia Rationalis (Rational Philosophy). Later, he proceeded to publish his third exposition: this time of Aquinas’ commentary on Aristotle’s Ethicorum ad Nichomachum (Nichomachean Ethics). =In Malta= In 1934, Pirotta was recalled to Malta, at Rabat, Malta. During the first academic year (1934/35) he was just a lecturer of philosophy. In the following year, however, he was chosen to be the Rector of the college. He retained this office for nine years, up till 1944, which included the worst of the World War II years in Malta. At the beginning of the 1935/36 academic year, Pirotta was officially conferred with his Masters. A few months later, he issued his second volume of the Summa Philosophiæ, the one dealing with natural philosophy, and called Philosophia Naturalis. In 1938, Pirotta applied for the Deanship of philosophy at the Royal University of Malta. Though unmatched or much less unsurpassed by any other contender, he lost the competition nonetheless. Though he took the rebuff most gracefully, Pirotta decided to make some drastic changes to his life. Thus, from 1939 onwards, right up to his death, he lived the larger part of his days at Naxxar, staying at his convent at Rabat, Malta only as little as possible. At Rabat, Malta Pirotta was still the Rector, and still read philosophy at the college there. Also from 1939 onwards, he acted as supplementary examiner at the Royal University of Malta. He further continued to deliver sermons here and there, and even to hear confessions on a regular basis. =Retirement and death= Before the war was over, at the end of the academic year of 1943/44, Pirotta – now almost fifty years of age – was relieved of the post of Rector at Rabat, Malta. During these years he assiduously worked on his next publication, which eventually had to be his last. This was his fourth exposition, the one on Aquinas’ eight books of commentaries on Aristotle’s De Physico Auditu (Physics). It was published in 1953. One fatal day in the latter part of 1955, Pirotta became victim of acute cerebral vascular insufficiency due to diabetes and chronic smoking. As a result, his memory had become seriously impaired, and so was his reasoning powers. He died at his parents’ home at Naxxar on 16 November 1956, a month short of his sixty-second birthday, and buried in the Dominican church of Our Lady of the Grotto at Rabat, Malta. Works =Opus magnum= * The ''''' (The Sum of Aritotelico-Thomistic Philosophy) – Pirotta planned to publish six volumes to complete this work. Unfortunately, he succeeded in publishing only the first two. The other four volumes remained manuscripts in different phases of preparation. Undoubtedly, the works of this large-scale project represent Pirotta’s philosophical prowess at its very best. ** VOL. I – ''''' (Rational Philosophy; 1931) – This book in Latin, containing 267 pages (and twelve preliminary pages with Roman enumeration), was published by Marietti of Turin, Italy. It is the first volume of Pirotta’s incomplete ' project. The volume opens with a preface and a general introduction to philosophy; and closes with a chart that shows the classification of the philosophical sciences according to the Aristotelico-Thomistic school of thought. All paragraphs contained in the book are numbered. Essentially, Pirotta’s Rational Philosophy is a study about logic. **VOL. II – ''''' (Natural Philosophy; 1936) – The second volume of the incomplete Summa project took five years to finalize. This book is also in Latin, as most of Pirotta’s writings, and contains 820 pages, excluding the eight preliminary pages with Roman enumeration. Like the other volume, it was published with Marietti of Turin, Italy. The book opens with a foreword to the reader, and an introduction; and concludes with an appendix. All paragraphs contained in the book are numbered. Obviously, the writing deals with natural philosophy. **VOL. III – ''''' (General Demonstrative Metaphysics or Ontology; c.1935-40)ADR, MSS. A164##1 u 2. – This volume in the series should have begun to present Pirotta’s work on metaphysics. Unfortunately it was never published, though its manuscript shows that it was in an advanced state of composition. **VOL. IV – ''''' (Specific Demonstrative Metaphysics: the Metaphysics of Created Being; c.1935-40)ADR, MSS. A165##1 and 2. – Again, this writing, intended to be the fourth volume in a series of six forming the ', was never completed. In its present form of preparation it is difficult to say what the complete final product would have been. The extant manuscript has parts that are compete and others that aren't. Certainly, whole parts that would have been part of the final version have never been written. The whole manuscript is made up of 580 large folios. **VOL. V – ''''' (Specific Demonstrative Metaphysics: the Metaphysics of Uncreated Being otherwise Natural Theology or Theodicy; c.1935-40)ADR, MS. A166.– Surprisingly, amongst the four incomplete manuscripts of Pirotta’s Summa Philosophiæ Aristotelico- Thomisticæ, this is the most complete. In fact, though it had to be the fifth volume of the series, the ' is practically all ready to go to the printers. It is a matter of speculation whether Pirotta actually intended to publish this fifth volume before the third and fourth. The manuscript is made up of 569 folios. **VOL. VI – ''''' (Explicative Metaphysics or Criteriology; c.1935-40)ADR, MS. A167#1, #2 u #3. – This is most incomplete of Pirotta’s series of manuscripts related to his '. The philosopher worked very little on it as a whole, though then segments of it are actually finalized. The entirety of the extant manuscript comprises a staggering 1260 large folios. However, due to its undeveloped state of composition it is practically impossible to imagine what the final shape of the work would have taken. =Commentaries= The commentaries would represent the main output for a Thomistic intellectual with which he really shows his mettle. Apart of Pirotta’s two published volumes that were part of his Summa Philosophiæ Aristotelico-Thomisticæ, published in 1931 and 1936 respectively, these commentaries―especially the first on the '―were in fact the intellectual productions that effectively brought Pirotta most renown. * ''''' ([Aquinas’] Commentary on [Aristotle’s] ‘On the Soul’; 1925) – This book in Latin, which contains 307 pages (excluding the thirteen preliminary pages enumerated with Roman numerals), was published with Marietti of Turin, Italy. Its whole title is: ' (The Commentary of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor of the Order of Preachers, on Aristotle’s Book On the Soul). The volume is dedicated to Mons. Angelo Portelli O.P., Malta’s then Auxiliary Bishop. The Dominican archive at Rabat, Malta, possesses the galley proofs for a new edition of the work,ADR, MS. A168. which, incidentally, was never published. Essentially, Pirotta’s work is a commentary on Aquinas’ exposition of Aristotle’s On the Soul. * ''''' ([Aquinas’ Commentary on Aristotle’s] ‘On Sense and Sensibility’ [and] ‘On Memory and Remembrance’; 1928) – A book in Latin published with Marietti of Turin, Italy, that comprises nine preliminary pages with Roman enumeration, and a further 158 pages. Its whole title is: ' (The Commentary of St. Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor of the Order of Preachers, on Aristotle’s Books On Sense and Sensibility [and] On Memory and Remembrance). The book is dedicated to a certain Fortunato De Bono, a Maltese early teacher of Pirotta. Essentially, the writing is an interpretation of Aquinas’ exposition of Aristotle’s two works. * ''''' ([Aquinas’ Exposition of] Aristotle’s ‘Nicomachean Ethics’; 1934) – This publication follows on the warm reception given to Pirotta’s two commentaries on Aquinas’s exposition of Aristotle’s On the Soul, and On Sense and On Memory. In the intervening years, Pirotta had also published his first volume of his Sum of Philosophy. This volume of 696 pages, excluding the twenty-four preliminary pages with Romon enumeration, was also published with Marietti of Turin, Italy. Its whole title reads: ' (The Exposition of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelic Doctor of the Order of Preachers, on the Ten Books of Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics). The book is dedicated to Fr. M. S. Gillet O.P., the Master General of the Dominicans. * ''''' ([Aquinas’] Eight Books on [Aristotle’s] ‘Physics’ or [Aquinas’] Commentary of Aristotle’s ‘Physics’; 1953) – This is the last of Pirotta’s major contributions to scholastic philosophy, published barely three years before his death. The study, obviously in Latin, is made up of 658 pages, and was published by M. D’Auria Pontificius Editor of Naples, Italy. The book is divided into eight books, and then into lectures ('). The first and second Books contain fifteen lectures each; the third, two less; the fourth, twenty- three; the fifth, ten; the sixth, another thirteen; the seventh, just nine; and the eighth, twenty-three. Basically, Pirotta’s work is a commentary on Aquinas’ exposition of Aritotle’s Physics. =Articles= Unlike the commentaries, these articles take up some point or aspect of a particular theme on which Pirotta expands upon. With the exception of the very early ones, published by Pirotta when still at the beginning of his career, the rest are master works that would have been minutely scrutinized by the editorial boards concerned before publication, and furthermore exposed Pirotta’s intellect to a wide readership within international Thomistic academic circles. After publication, almost all of these articles had been subsequently distributed as separate extracts. * ‘L’Arma taghna’ (Our weapon; 1918; signed only as Fr.

What they do attest to is the standing Pirotta enjoyed with the various editors of the respective scientific journals who had valued Pirotta’s proficiency enough so as to consider him an academic and intellectual worthy of passing authoritative judgement on the writings of other reputed Thomists. Pirotta does not disappoint. He showers praise when earned, but certainly does not shy away from lashing out when warranted. * The 1923 editions of Filosofia Neo-Scolastica – Milan (1923)Divus Thomas (Fribourg), 3, 2, 1, 125-126. * Mons.

Most of the following texts are incomplete, as Pirotta had not as yet given them their final finishing. To some he surely intended to add on other material. Nonetheless, even as they stand, these documents can be taken as reliable attestations to Pirotta’s proficiency of labour, and intensity of thought. * De Persona seu Supposito (On the Person or the [Whole] Subject; 1921)ADR, MS.

None of them have ever been published. * Circulus Philosophicus – Realismus Aristotelico-Thomisticus (Philosophical Circle – Aristotelian-Thomistic Realism; probably at Viterbo, Italy; 1922)ADR, MS.

Roughly speaking, the Italian orations would have been read to diocesan priests or members of religious orders, and the Maltese ones to the general faithful. Though most of them do not contain any philosophical interest, some of them do bear witness to Pirotta’s philosophical type of mind, even when treating spiritual or religious matters. In Italian Pirotta’s extant sermons in Italian are all collected at the Dominican archives at Rabat, Malta. Most of the titles are Pirotta’s own. * Domenica Ia d’Avvento – Conoscere Gesù Christo (1st Sunday of Advent – Knowing Jesus Christ; 1937)ADR, MS.

Established in 1887, it was at one time the largest hospital in New Zealand. The patients ranged from those with psychotic illnesses, to the senile, or alcoholics. History Land was acquired in 1884 for a hospital farm that would offer 'work therapy' to relieve overcrowding at Wellington's Mount View Lunatic Asylum. Construction of a one storied building containing 24 apartments, H Ward, began in 1886. Porirua Lunatic Asylum, as it was originally named, was opened in the following year and Dr. Thomas Radford King was appointed as its medical superintendent, though in less than a year, he was replaced by Dr. Gray Hassell. By 1905, Porirua Hospital had 700 beds. In the early 1900s, the facility had 2000 staff and patients, affording a major effect on the Wellington Region's development. By 1928, nurses moved into their own two-store, 100 room building. The resident population was 1,500 in the 1940s. After the 1942 Wairarapa earthquakes, 800 patients had to be moved to other hospitals. Subsequently the main building was demolished and eleven new villas were constructed. Most patients were released into community-based care in the late 1980s after the release of the Wellington Hospital Board White Paper on psychiatric care. The first built ward, F Ward, was closed in 1977, considered unfit and uneconomical. In 1980, the Puketiro Centre operated as a regional base for children with developmental problems. In 1987, the hospital celebrated its 100-year anniversary, opening the Porirua Hospital Museum in F Ward.

Early life and career Carlo Siliotto was born in Rome in 1950. He began playing guitar and violin at an early age, and pursued formal studies in composition at the Conservatory of Frosinone under the direction of Maestro Daniele Paris. He was among the founders of the popular folk band Canzoniere del Lazio (1973-1980). The group released six albums, revisiting traditional songs and music from Southern Italy and mixing musical styles, particularly combining rock, jazz and classical music with Mediterranean and ethnic music. Over the course of its lifespan Canzoniere del Lazio went on several national and international tours, performing across Europe and in several African countries, such as Somalia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya. After the dissolution of Canzoniere, Siliotto released a concept album Ondina (Polygram), and took a leading role as violinist and composer for Carnascialia, a project involving several prominent artists in the Italian folk scene of the period. In 1980 he founded a new ensemble, Gramigna, performing on tour in Greece, Italy, Hungary, Germany, Nigeria and Mozambique. Between 1980 and 1984 Siliotto worked as violinist, composer and arranger on many albums by artists such as Domenico Modugno, Antonello Venditti, Francesco De Gregori and others. Film scoring In 1984 Siliotto decided to dedicate his career on writing music for film and television. Since the early '80s, he has worked on more than a hundred scores including theatrical features, documentaries and television series. Carlo collaborated with directors such as Patricia Riggen, Eugenio Derbez, Carlo Lizzani, Jonathan Hensleigh, Maurizio Nichetti, Robert Markowitz, Ricky Tognazzi, Carlos Saura-Medrano, Clive Donner, Sergei Bodrov, Ivan Passer, Carlo Carlei, Joseph Sargent, Roger Young, Uli Edel, Stefano Rulli, Sergio Sanchez Suarez, Robert Allan Ackermann, Gabriela Tagliavini and many others. In 2007 he received a Golden Globe nomination for his work on Nomad: The Warrior (Bodrov-Passer), and in 2011 he was nominated by the Italian critics for the “Nastro d’Argento” for the music of Il Padre e lo Straniero (Tognazzi). In 2004 was nominated for Best Music by the International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA) for The Punisher. In 2014 was nominated for Best Music for comedy by the IFMCA, and won the “Colonne Sonore” award for Best Original Score for a foreign film, both for his work on Instruction Not Included (No Se Aceptan Devoluciones) by Eugenio Derbez. Carlo's latest work, Miracles From Heaven (Riggen), was released on March 16 Sony/Columbia Pictures. Carlo is also a prolific composer of stage theater music. Through the years, he has collaborated with directors like Otello Sarzi, Marco Parodi, Carlo Cecchi to name a few. His music has also been used by several choreographers including Fiorenza D'Alessandro and Adriana Borriello. Carlo currently lives and works in Los Angeles, California.

It was co-founded by Toby Young and opened in 2011.The West London Free School has crossed the Rubicon The TelegraphThe Free School The Independent article It is located in Hammersmith in west London and was the first free school of its type in England to sign a Funding Agreement with the Secretary of State for Education.School information London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham The West London Free School offers children a classical liberal education and is a music specialist school, with more than half the pupils learning a musical instrument. Its production of Sweeney Todd in the summer of 2015 enjoyed a short, sell-out run at the Bush Theatre.http://www.westlondonfreeschool.co.uk/overview/our-vision.html History The school was formally opened by Mayor of London Boris Johnson in September 2011 and is currently home to 600 pupils. It received over 1,000 applicants for its last 120 places, making it one of the most oversubscribed taxpayer-funded schools in England. The school's first headteacher was Thomas Packer, who served in post from September 2011 to January 2013, before becoming Education Director of the charitable trust that set up the school. Sam Naismith, a former England hockey coach, was then Headteacher from January 2013 until May 2014. Dame Sally Coates, ex-principal of Burlington Danes Academy, looked after the school, alongside David Stanton, while a permanent head was chosen. Hywel Jones was appointed as headteacher from September 2014 to December 2017. Jones was formerly an assistant headteacher at St. Mary's Catholic School in Bishop’s Stortford. In January 2018, Clare Wagner became the school's headteacher. The school was inspected by Ofsted in 2013 and 2017 and judged to be good. In 2013 it was reported that \\"the school's traditional, academic focus is popular with parents\\", despite the issues with leadership turnover and with school buildings. All pupils studied Latin until age 14, and were entered for eight academic GCSEs. In 2013 the West London Free School Primary was opened, starting with two Reception classes of 30 pupils each. In 2014, the West London Free School Academy Trust opened the Earls Court Free School Primary, which is currently co-located with the West London Free School Primary, but will move to Earls Court in 2020. In 2016, the Trust opened the Kensington Primary Academy. The secondary school is based at Palingswick House on King Street in Hammersmith. In May 2014 the Trust purchased an office block on nearby Bridge Avenue for £9.25 million. This building is now Franklin House, the school's sixth form. Initially, the secondary school was based in Cambridge Grove, Hammersmith, before moving to its current location, with the West London Free School Primary and Earls Court Primary Free School also sharing the Cambridge Grove site. GCSE Results The school posted its first set of GCSE results in August, 2016. Seventy-seven per cent of the pupils obtained five GCSEs marked A* to C, including English and Mathematics. Thirty- eight per cent of all the GCSEs taken were marked A* or A, with 63% marked A* to B. In Mathematics, 85% of pupils achieved A* to C, with 37% getting A* or A. In English Literature, 79% of pupils achieved A* to C, with 44% getting A* or A. One hundred per cent of pupils who took all three sciences achieved A* to C, with 75% getting an average grade of A* or A. One hundred per cent of pupils who took Music achieved A* to C, with 57% getting A* or A. One hundred per cent of pupils who took Art achieved A* to C, with 33% getting A* or A. Ninety-five per cent of pupils who took RE achieved A* to C, with 67% getting A* or A. The Best Eight score for the cohort is 5.9. Criticism In addition to criticism of the free school concept generally, the West London Free School was criticised in The Guardian for planning to make its permanent site Palingswick House in Hammersmith, a building then occupied by a number of community groups. Hammersmith MP Andy Slaughter added his voice to the criticism, arguing that \\"local people are against the plans\\", and stating that the school was \\"ousting 22 charities and a school for severely disabled children in its rush to open\\".www.andyslaughter.co.uk, February 16th, 2011 Retrieved March 2012 In response, Toby Young pointed out that Palingswick House was listed for disposal by Hammersmith and Fulham Borough Council long before the West London Free School came into existence and, had the school not subsequently bought it, it would likely have been sold off to a property developer and possibly demolished. There hasn't been a school for disabled children in Palingswick House for at least 50 years. Opponents of free schools have also challenged perceived shortcomings in freedom of information access related to the development of free schools including the West London Free School. Peter Winter, the ex-headmaster of Latymer Upper School, criticised the proposal to base the West London Free School at Palingswick House, a neighbouring property, on the grounds that increased traffic to the area might threaten pupil safety. The school has been accused of being unrepresentative of the local community, but these charges have been denied by Young, saying that approximately 25 per cent of the pupils are on free school meals.September 4th, 2014 Retrieved September 2014 2012 A YouTube video by ‘TheRichest’ which has received millions of views labels The West London Free School as one of the strictest schools in the world.

The church building at 84 Oxford Terrace, Christchurch, is registered as Category I by Heritage New Zealand. Its freestanding belfry is registered separately. History Interior looking towards the altar The structure stands on the site of the first church built by the Canterbury Association settlers in 1851. Henry Jacobs preached the sermon and conducted the service at the opening of the church in July 1851.The Very Reverend Henry Jacobs The Cyclopedia Of New Zealand St Michael & All Angels served as the pro-cathedral until the completion of ChristChurch Cathedral in 1881. Belfry dating from 1861 The architect of the current church was William Fitzjohn Crisp (1846–1924). He had come out from England in 1864 as the pupil of Robert Speechly who had been appointed by George Gilbert Scott to supervise the building of ChristChurch Cathedral. The cornerstone of the church was laid in a ceremony on the Feast of St Michael & All Angels, 29 September 1870. However, problems with the construction of the building led to Crisp returning to Britain in 1871 and Frederick Strouts (1834–1919) was appointed as supervising architect in June of that year. The building was completed in 1872. The contractor's name was James Schoolbraid (or Schoolbred) (1840-1924) and according to Frederick Strouts, he was a very obliging worker. The church was opened on 2 May 1872. Because of a lack of money the chancel was not completed until 1875, and the planned bell tower and spire were never constructed. The church is constructed mostly of matai timber on rubble stone foundations. It is one of the largest timber Gothic Revival churches in the Southern Hemisphere. The only alteration to the church structure has been the removal of a tie-beam and secondary arch to give a better view of the east window in 1896. The separate belfry is a survival of the previous church building. It was designed by Benjamin Mountfort and constructed in 1861. The bell it houses was brought out with the First Four Ships in 1850 and was rung every hour of daylight to indicate time to the first settlers.S. Michael and All Angels, Oxford Terrace on http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/ Alfred Averill came to New Zealand in 1894 to be vicar of St Michael and All Angels and rose to be Archbishop of New Zealand. Associated with the church is St Michael's Church School. Heritage registration The Church from the north The church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage building on 2 April 1985 with registration number 294. It is significant as it was the first church on the Canterbury Plains and was the pro-cathedral for some years. Architecturally, it is notable as a timber Gothic building. The belfry of the church is also recognised as a Category I structure. It was registered under number 295 on the same day. Earthquakes  The wooden building survived three major earthquakes in 2010/11 almost unscathed and is the only Anglican church that remained in use in the central city. The plans had been drawn with regard to the threat of tremors. At a meeting of parishioners held on 14 December 1869, the general concept for the new church was agreed on, including the building material: \\"Owing to the late severe shocks of earthquake the vestry came to the conclusion that it would be useless to attempt building any part of stone. Therefore it was decided that wood should be the material.\\" The earthquake referred to was the one that hit Christchurch on 5 June 1869, with Julius von Haast giving some scientific commentary. St John's Church in Hereford Street, the first Anglican church in Christchurch built of permanent materials in 1864–1865, was damaged in that earthquake. The earthquake, centred under Addington or Spreydon, had an estimated magnitude of 5 and a ground shaking intensity of MMI 7. In March 2011, a Lenten service at St Michael's and All Angels Church was attended by Victoria Matthews, Bishop of Christchurch, and Kevin Rudd, Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs. As part of the service, Rudd lit a candle in memory of those who died in the 22 February 2011 earthquake. The organ The present fine Henry Bevington and Sons pipe organ was installed in 1873. It was enlarged in 1895/6 by Fincham and Hobday. The organ was damaged in the 22 February 2011 earthquake and subsequently removed for repairs. A temporary replacement was an organ built from parts of instruments damaged during World War II bombing raids on Britain. The church is fund-raising to help meet the last of the NZ$500,000 organ restoration costs. The Bevington organ was reinstalled with improvements by the South Island Organ Company in 2013.

She was also among the earliest identified women writers of France.She is sometimes referred to as Saint Marguerite, but there is no evidence that she was ever canonised.  Life  Marguerite was born into the locally powerful family of the seigneurs of Oingt in Beaujolais, who became extinct in 1382 for want of male heirs. She joined the Carthusian Order as a nun, and in 1288 became the fourth prioress of Poletains Charterhouse,of which only one building now remains near Mionnay in the Dombes, founded in 1238 by Marguerite de Bâgéwife of Humbert V of Beaujeu, aka Humbert I des Dombes for nuns who wished to live according to the custom of the Carthusians as far as was then thought possible for women. Marguerite d'Oingt was also a well-known mystic of her day, contemporary with Philippe le Bel and Pope Clement V.  Works  Along with Marie de France, Marguerite is one of the first women writers in France of whom any record survives. She habitually wrote in Latin, of which her knowledge was comparable with that of the (male) clerics of the age. Her first work, in Latin, was Pagina meditationum (\\"Meditations\\") of 1286. She also wrote two long texts in Franco-Provençal, the first surviving works in that language: Li Via seiti Biatrix, virgina de Ornaciu, the vita of Blessed Beatrice of Ornacieux, also a Carthusian nun; and Speculum (\\"The Mirror\\"). Pope Benedict XVI discussed Marguerite's spirituality and quoted from her writings at the general audience of 3 November 2010.

It was built in 1845, with a late 19th-early 20th century addition. It replaced a mill that operated on the site as early as 1766. It is a 2 1/2-story, \\"T\\"-shaped, frame building. General William McCoy (1768-1835), owned an earlier mill on the site. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. McCoy's Mill, located along U.S. 220 three miles south of Franklin, is one of West Virginia's oldest landmarks. Framed by the rugged mountains of Pendleton County, the mill employed generations of millers, drawing its water power from Thorn Creek just before the creek empties into the South Branch of the Potomac River. The first mill on this site was built about the time of the French and Indian War by Ulrich Conrad Sr., who came as a pioneer settler from Switzerland. In 1753. From Augusta Co, VA Court records: Page 462.--18 March 1777. Ulrick Conrad, Sr., to Ulrick Conrad, Jr., his son, at mouth of Black Thorn on South Branch of Potomac, 6 acres with mill seat thereon erected, patented to Ulrick (Sr) 12 May 1770. (The mill property was later acquired by a General William McCoy, merchant of Franklin, who also purchased the Peninger and Conrad estates which extended from Franklin to the mouth of the Thorn.) According to Elsie Byrd Boggs's History of Franklin, Conrad supplied the soldiers in Lord Dunmore's War with flour and meal in 1774. Conrad's son inherited the mill from his father in 1777, and Gen. William McCoy, a Franklin merchant, later acquired the property. General McCoy died in 1835, and the mill was acquired by his nephew, William McCoy. This McCoy found the business so lucrative that he decided to replace the old mill with a modern one. Construction of the new mill began in 1845. The 1845 mill is the present four-story mill building, its large hand- hewn beams supported by a thick stone foundation. This new mill originally had the familiar overshot mill wheel, but this was replaced by a more efficient underwater turbine in the early 20th century. Grain was milled here until the mid-1900s, and the mill and connecting residence were adapted late in the century as a furniture workshop and bed and breakfast inn. McCoy's Mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The future of the mill is uncertain. The bed and breakfast ceased operation and the property was offered for sale in 2010.

In 1911, the Central South African Railways placed nine Mallet articulated compound steam locomotives with a wheel arrangement in service. In 1912, when they were assimilated into the South African Railways, they were renumbered and designated Class MF. Five more of these locomotives were delivered in November 1911 and were numbered directly onto the South African Railways roster.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways. South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, April 1945. pp. 275-276.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer’s Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 9, 12, 16, 47 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) Manufacturer Mallet Nine Mallet articulated compound steam locomotives which were delivered to the Central South African Railways (CSAR) in 1911 were built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1910 and 1911. They were erected at the Durban workshops in March 1911 and were very similar to the experimental Class MD which had been delivered in 1910, except that the new locomotives were equipped with Schmidt superheaters. These engines had Walschaerts valve gear and Type XS tenders with a coal capacity of and a water capacity of . They were numbered in the range from 1015 to 1023. Compound expansion In a compound locomotive, steam is expanded in phases. After being expanded in a high-pressure cylinder and having then lost pressure and given up part of its heat, it is exhausted into a larger-volume low-pressure cylinder for secondary expansion, after which it is exhausted through the smokebox. By comparison, in the more usual arrangement of simple expansion (simplex), steam is expanded just once in any one cylinder before being exhausted through the smokebox.Compounding Steam Engines In the compound Mallet locomotive, the rear set of coupled wheels are driven by the smaller high-pressure cylinders which are fed steam from the steam dome via the superheater. Their spent steam is then fed to the larger low-pressure cylinders which drive the front set of coupled wheels. Characteristics The most noticeable external difference from the experimental Class MD engine was the altered arrangement of the main steam pipes necessitated by the superheater. Instead of being led vertically down from the dome directly to the high-pressure cylinders, an internal pipe was taken from the regulator valve in the dome to the superheater in the smokebox, from where it was brought back to the high-pressure cylinders by external steam pipes arranged under the running boards. South African Railways When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (Cape Government Railways, Natal Government Railways and CSAR) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union. Although the South African Railways and Harbours came into existence in 1910, with Sir William Hoy appointed as its first General Manager, the actual classification and renumbering of all the rolling stock of the three constituent railways were only implemented with effect from 1 January 1912.The South African Railways - Historical Survey. Editor George Hart, Publisher Bill Hart, Sponsored by Dorbyl Ltd., Published c. 1978, p. 25. In 1912, these locomotives were renumbered in the range from 1619 to 1627 and designated Class MF on the South African Railways (SAR). Five more of the type had been delivered from ALCO in November 1911, but these were numbered directly onto the SAR roster in the range from 1629 to 1633, marking the introduction of the SAR renumbering scheme under the Union programme. These locomotives were delivered with smaller Type XM4 tenders which had the same coal capacity as the Type XS tenders of the first nine engines, but a smaller water capacity of .Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, May 1945. p. 347. The new locomotives were erected in the workshops in Pretoria rather than Durban. The erection of engines away from ports was an innovation which was probably the outcome of experience gained with the Class MD, which had been erected at Durban. While the locomotive was brought to the Transvaal, difficulty was experienced at Drummond and Laing's Nek where the drain angles on the cab roof struck the sides of the tunnels. Service The Class MF joined the experimental Class MD on the coal traffic line between Witbank and Germiston. They were acquired to improve the traffic flow on this line with its ruling gradient of one in one hundred (1%), where the increase of traffic and the resultant congestion was causing considerable delays en route which led to excessive hours of duty being imposed on crews. When the Mallets replaced the existing Class 11 locomotives on this line, train loads could be increased from to .Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 21: Witbank Line by Les Pivnic, Eugene Armer, Peter Stow and Peter Micenko. Captions 1, 2. (Accessed on 4 May 2017) The Mallets proved to be capable of handling the heavy coal loads. In May 1914, Class MF no. 1620 was used in a test run from Witbank to Germiston, hauling 55 bogie wagons with an all-up weight of . The journey was accomplished in seven hours, which included several stops. Modification to simplex In 1923, engine no. 1620 was converted to a simple expansion locomotive in the Salvokop shops in Pretoria by replacing the two slide-valved low-pressure cylinders with piston-valved high-pressure cylinders. Five more, numbers 1621 to 1623, 1631 and 1632, were also converted to simple expansion locomotives in 1925. Three of these, numbers 1620, 1631 and 1632, were then transferred to East London where more powerful locomotives were needed since the mainline had a heavy gradient of one in forty (2½%) which started right at the end of the East London departing platform, making it an extremely difficult section. They appear to have not been up to the task in the Eastern Cape, however, since by 1926 they were observed there staged out of service.Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 26: Braamfontein West to Klerksdorp (home signal) by Les Pivnic, Part 1.

Background  The character of Brisco County, Jr. exists in a fictional Old West of 1893. It is partly a traditional Hollywood depiction of the frontier, with settlers, gunfighters, outlaws, and cowboys. In the world of Brisco County, Jr., however, there is also steampunk technology, such as zeppelins and rockets, and Weird West elements, such as time travel and supernatural powers. Robber barons direct the financial and industrial workings of this west from the boardrooms of the Westerfield Club in San Francisco, California. An outlaw named John Bly is disrupting the industrialists' businesses and they are desperate to capture Bly and his gang. Bly himself is intently searching for a supernatural object called The Orb, a bronze-colored device unearthed in a California mine.David Simkins (writer) & Bryan Spicer (director), \\"Pilot\\". The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Fox. Episode 1. Aired on August 27, 1993. It is into this setting that Brisco County, Jr., a Harvard-educated lawyer-turned-bounty hunter, enters the search for John Bly.  Arc  When the story of the television show begins, famous U.S. Marshal Brisco County, Sr., has captured notorious outlaw John Bly and his gang. Bly and his gang manage to escape, murdering Brisco County, Sr. in the process. His son is Brisco County, Jr., who vows to avenge his father's death and bring John Bly to justice. Brisco is hired by the robber barons of the Westerfield Club to track and capture Bly and his gang. Brisco is assigned a liaison to the industrialists, a lawyer named Socrates Poole. Socrates relays financial support and information to Brisco, and the two men often work together. A rival bounty hunter, Lord Bowler, tries to beat Brisco to the Bly gang. Although the two bounty hunters begin their relationship as archrivals, they often find themselves helping each other, and as the series develops, they become partners. While tracking John Bly's second-in-command, Big Smith, Brisco stumbles on to the existence of the Orb, and the powers that it possesses. Brisco learns that one of the robber barons who hired him is also in league with John Bly to acquire the Orb. Several times throughout the series, Brisco encounters the Orb. In one encounter, Bly mortally wounds Brisco with a gunshot, but Brisco uses the Orb's power to heal himself.Carlton Cuse (writer) & Andy Tennant (director), \\"The Orb Scholar\\". The Adventures of Brisco County Jr., Fox. Episode 3. Aired on September 3, 1993. At another encounter, Brisco uses the Orb to travel through time and save the life of Bowler. When Brisco finally defeats Bly midway through the series, the Orb is recovered by a time traveler from the future.Carlton Cuse (writer) & Kim Manners (director), \\"Bye Bly\\". The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., Fox. Episode 20. Aired on February 18, 1994. Throughout his travels and missions, Brisco frequently meets with Dixie Cousins, a saloon singer who was once romantically involved with two members of John Bly's gang. Brisco and Dixie begin a brief romantic encounter in the pilot episode, but subsequent episodes deepen their relationship. Dixie's life is endangered occasionally when her plans intersect with Brisco's missions, and Brisco often saves her from trouble. Later in the series, Brisco and Dixie fall in love, but their lifestyles continue to keep them apart. Concept and creation The character of Brisco County, Jr. was conceived by Boam and Cuse when they were approached by Fox to create a television show. Cuse had the idea to combine the science fiction and westerns genres. He invented the character of Brisco, who would be on a mission to track down the outlaws who murdered his father.Cuse, The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series: \\"Pilot\\" commentary Brisco was originally conceived to be a womanizing character, with a different girl in every episode. The producers later decided to make him a \\"one-woman man\\", due to Kelly Rutherford's well-received performance as Dixie. Cuse and Boam wanted Brisco to be a hero who could think his way out of tough situations, rather than resorting to violence. Brisco has a gun, but rarely uses it, and never to kill. Cuse said, \\"he'll shoot a sign and have it crash down on somebody's head. He just finds a clever way out of a jam.\\"  Reception  Writing in Variety, Todd Everett compared Brisco to Indiana Jones, saying that Brisco is also a \\"university-educated adventurer, only more skilled and less humble. Dashing in his own way but a bit bland, Campbell is no Harrison Ford.\\" Mark Schwed and Todd Holland praised The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. in TV Guide, calling Brisco \\"an Ivy League cowboy hero\\" who is \\"smart, hunky, and funny...a hero for the '90s – an old-fashioned Lone Ranger type with contemporary wit.\\"  References  Category:Fictional bounty hunters Category:Fictional characters from San Francisco Category:Television characters introduced in 1993 Category:Science fiction television characters Category:Steampunk Category:Western (genre) characters Category:Fictional Harvard University people ","title":"Brisco County, Jr. (character)"},{"id":"32978656","text":"Antunović may refer to: * Adrian Antunović, Croatian footballer * Darko Antunovic HAOK Mladost (born 1972), Croatian volleyball player * Davor Antunović (born 1979), popular German author and psychotherapist * Duško Antunović, Croatian water polo player * Ivan Antunović, Croatian writer * Saša Antunović, Serbian footballer * Željka Antunović, Croatian politician Category:Croatian-language surnames ","title":"Antunović"},{"id":"32978665","text":"Demos is a 1921 silent British drama film directed by Denison Clift.

By this time the 8th Air Army was part of Southern Front and included the 2nd Mixed Aviation Corps (201st Fighter Aviation Division, 214th Assault Aviation Division), 10th Mixed Aviation Corps (206th, 287th Fighter Aviation Divisions, 289th Assault Aviation Division), 270th Bomber Aviation Division (270 бад), 2nd Guards Night Bomber Aviation Division, 6th Guards Fighter Aviation Division, 8th Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment, 406th Light Bomber Aviation Regiment, and the 678th Transport Aviation Regiment.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 April 1943 Organization in May 1945 (Ketrzyn, Poland): *74th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment with Il-2 *75th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment with Il-10 *76th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment with Il-2 *136th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment with Il-2 The division headquarters were moved from Ketrzyn to Lida, Grodno Region, in the Belorussian SSR, in July 1945.

His name was wholly Babylonian and not uncommon, as for example the later Assyrian King Esarhaddon (681–669 BC) had a personal exorcist, or ašipu, with the same name who was unlikely to have been related. He is best known for his rude letter to Aššur-nirari III, the most complete part of which is quoted below, and was enthroned following a revolt in the south of Mesopotamia when the north was still occupied by the forces of Assyria, and he may not have assumed authority throughout the country until around the 25th year of his 30-year reign, although the exact sequence of events and chronology remains disputed. Biography There is surprisingly little contemporary evidence for this king considering the purported length of his reign, which was the longest recorded in the Kassite dynasty. The tablet known as King List AKing List A, BM 33332, column 2, lines 8-11. shows him following Adad-šuma-iddina and his predecessor-but-one, Enlil-nadin-šumi, but in Chronicle PChronicle P, (ABC 22), BM 92701, column 4, lines 8 and 9. he makes his appearance in the narrative before them. Brinkman argues that this is for stylistic purposes but the Walker ChronicleWalker Chronicle, ABC 25, BM 27796, lines 2-4. suggests a simpler explanation. Adad-šuma-uṣur was elevated to the position of king in the south of the country years before he conquered Babylon and made himself its king. The early part of his reign may well have been concurrent with that of the three kings preceding him on King List A, but it is quite probable that he followed them in ascending the throne of the city of Babylon. It is a characteristic trait of this tablet that concurrent kings and dynasties are presented successively as if one followed another. =Contemporary evidence= A late copy of an inscription on a bronze statue from Ur,BM 36042. begins “When Anu and Enlil looked with steady favour on Adad-šuma-uṣur, the shepherd who pleased their heart, at that time Marduk, the great lord, named his name as ruler of (all) land[s],” supporting the theory that he reigned in Uruk and Nippur before being appointed by Marduk in Babylon. The brevity of his reign over Babylon proper also explains the minimal contemporary inscriptions found. Only sixteen dated economic or legal texts attest to his reign, with just two of them from Babylon, bearing the curious double-dating formula adopted by Adad-šuma-uṣur and his immediate successors. These are inscribed 7 KAM 3 KAMB. 69 formerly Div. 304. and 9 KAM 3 KAM,B. 70 formerly Div. 305. speculated to represent his 27th and 29th years. Twelve of the extant tablets have provenance from excavation at Ur. The earliest of these is datedTablet Museum reference IM 85543 excavation reference U 7787d, Certificate of sheep plucking. to his 3rd year and records that Šamaš-zēra-šubši had inspected and “plucked” 103 sheep. Much of the remainder concern cattle, their sale and the legal actions taken to secure recompense for their theft. The determination of innocence or guilt was often arbitrated by “river ordeal,” a process still poorly understood. In two documents,Tablet Museum reference IM 85482, excavation reference U 7787e, and UET V 259, terms of reference for trial by ordeal. the judge was Adad-šuma- uṣur, the šakkanakku, “appointee, governor,” a role similarly adopted by his predecessor Šagarakti-ŠuriašCBS 4579. and two other textsIM 85515, three cases of cattle theft, and IM 85514, a second document relating to case 1. feature the same group of miscreants, Abu-ṭābu, Zēru-kīnu and Sîn-pūtu, suspects in three separate cases of cattle rustling. texts 72, 11, 73, 43, 44. The cities of Nippur, Dur, Isin and Marad had been sacked by the marauding Elamites under their king, Kidin-Hutran III, and two of these, Nippur and Isin were the subjects of construction work by Adad-šuma-uṣur. Bricks from Isin were excavated in 1975/76 with a Sumerian inscription recording his work on the Egalmaḫ and also earlier from Nippur recording work on the Ekur (example text pictured). He had been credited with rebuilding the walls of Nippur in the Walker Chronicle. =Under Tukulti-Ninurta I’s reign= Tukulti-Ninurta I, the king of Assyria, had captured Adad-šuma-uṣur's predecessor, Kaštiliašu IV, on one of his two campaigns and conquered Babylon during the second one, perhaps around 1225 BC. He had taken the Babylonian kingship and then ruled there probably through governors, for seven years. There is an economic textTablet Ni. 65, dated: ˹ITI˺.ŠE ˹U47˺.KAM, ˹MU˺.SAG.NAM.LUGAL.LA, TUKUL-ti-dMAŠ, “Month of Addaru, seventh day, accession year (of) Tukulti-Ninurta.” from Nippur dated to his accession year. When exactly the three native kings, Enlil-nādin-šumi, Kadašman-Ḫarbe II and Adad-šuma-iddina succeeded one another is still uncertain, but their short reigns totalled around nine years. Yamada, for example, argues that Tukulti-Ninurta only ascended the Babylonian throne after their reigns. Others place his rule before them, or propose the first two ruled in the two-year period between Tukulti-Ninurta's two campaigns. Walker suggest that after them, it seems likely that Tukulti-Ninurta's successors appointed governors over Babylon until they fled in the face of Adad-šuma-uṣur's triumph over the Assyrian king Enlil-kudurri-usur fifteen years or so after Tukulti-Ninurta died at the hand of assassins in his eponymous city. Adad-šuma-uṣur had been “put on his father’s throne” by a rebellion against Tukulti-Ninurta among the Akkadian officers. Most of the contemporary economic texts dated to his reign come from Ur, suggesting the location of his investiture. The identity of his father is never explicitly stated in the chronicle but it was assumed in antiquity to have been Kaštiliašu IV. A Luristan bronze dagger in the Foroughi Collection is inscribed with his filiation to this king, and this claim may have helped reinforce his legitimacy. It reads: ša dIŠKUR-MU-URÙ, LUGAL KIŠ, DUMU Kaš-til- ia-šu, LUGAL KÁ.DINGIR.RAki, “(property) of Adad-šuma-uṣur, king of the world, son of Kaštiliašu, king of Babylon.” Tukulti-Ninurta wrote a letter to the Hittite king, thought to be Suppiluliuma II, four fragmentsLetter from Tukulti-Ninurta to Suppiluliuma II, Kbo 28.61–64. of which were discovered at the site of excavations of Ḫattuša in the 1930s. It was dated to the limmu year of Ilī-padâ, in the latter part of Tukulti-Ninurta's reign. In it, he recaps the genealogy of the recent Kassite dynasty, mentioning Kurigalzu II, Kadašman-Enlil II and Kudur-Enlil then apparently castigating Šagarakti- Šuriaš, the “non-son of Kudur-Enlil”, and his sons, one of whom, Kaštiliašu, had provoked the war by his dastardly pre-emptive strike against Assyria. In one place, the sons of Šagarakti-Šuriaš have been killed, almost certainly by none other than Tukulti-Ninurta himself. He then makes reference to a “servant of Suhi”, where Suhu is a region of northeast Syria, and Itamar Singer proposes this individual to be Adad-šuma-uṣur, the implication being he was a foreigner, not of the royal stock and consequently unqualified for office. A letter from an Elamite king,Literary letter from Elamite King to Kassite court, tablet VAT 17020. thought to be Shutruk-Nahhunte, to the Kassite elders demanding the right to the Babylonian throne through blood, describes Adad- šuma-uṣur as “son of Dunna-Sah, from the region by the bank of the Euphrates”, in his criticism of their choice of regent. Unfortunately the Tukulti-Ninurta tablet is fragmentary and the text barely readable so a variety of restorations are possible. The letter ends with a plea for military aid and a moving, “If I am alive, [I will send(?)] a message of/about my life, but if I am dead, the message of/about my death [will be sent to you(?)]”, “one hundred years, my brother[...” and “you have loved me with all your heart.” =Letter to Aššur-nirari III= Tukulti-Ninurta, who “carried criminal designs against Babylon,” was succeeded by his son and possible assassin Aššur-nadin-apli, but whose brief reign was succeeded in turn by his son, Aššur-nirari III. He was the recipient of an extremely offensive letter from Adad-šuma-uṣur, which he addressed to “the Assyrian kings,” putting Aššur-nirari on an equal footing with his subordinate for added insult, a fragment of which has fortuitously survived: The Ilī-ḫaddâ mentioned is none other than Ilī-padā, the viceroy of Hanigalbat, Ashur-nirari's distant relative (sharing a common ancestor in Eriba-Adad I) and the official for whose limmu year Tukulti-Ninurta's letter to the Hittite king had been dated. The letter was carefully copied and preserved in the library at Nineveh. Grayson speculates it was kept to “goad” the Assyrians to vengeance. =Battle with Enlil-kudurri-uṣur= Ashur- nirari's rule proved to be fairly transitory and he was probably swept aside by his uncle, Enlil-kudurri-usur, another son of Tukulti-Ninurta. Adad-šuma- uṣur “muster]ed [his army] and attacked and defeated him” and then Following this famous victory, a “son of a nobody, whose name is not mentioned” exploited the chance to enthrone himself in Babylon, so a revolt was propagated and Adad-šuma-uṣur took the city and his place in the Kassite dynastic list. The events were captured for posterity in the Adad-šuma-uṣur Epic,Adad-šuma-uṣur Epic, BM 34104+. a late Babylonian historical literary work where a rebellion of officers and nobles is caused by the neglect of Marduk and Babylon. The penitent king confesses his sins to the god and restores his temple, Esagila. The end of Enlil-kudurri-usur's reign is dated 1193 or 1183 depending on uncertainty about the duration of his successor's, Ninurta-apal-Ekur’s, rule, three or thirteen years. As a son of Ilī-padā, Ninurta-apal-Ekur had exploited Enlil-kudurri-usur’s demise to seize power in Aššur.Synchronistic History, ABC 21, tablet K.4401b, lines 5 to 8. He had “(come) up from Karduniaš\\",According to the Assyrian King List, 82nd king listed entry. where he may conceivably have been the last Assyrian governor of Babylon, as his brother, Mardukīia, was governor of Katmuḫi. The length of his reign does rather crucially determine the likely date range for the beginning of Adad-šuma-uṣur's thirty-year reign, because there is no datable event that takes place at the beginning, such as the passing of a preceding monarch. The interregnum between Babylon's fall to Tukulti-Ninurta and its conquering by Adad-šuma-uṣur had been at least twenty two years and perhaps even more than thirty years. He was succeeded by his son, Meli-Šipak, who was curiously reluctant to mention his filiation to Adad-šuma-uṣur in his own inscriptions.

Diamond Mine was reissued by Blue Ribbon in 1985 and ported to other systems in 1985 and 1986. Blue Ribbon released a sequel, Diamond Mine II, at the same time. Both games are similar to the 1983 game Oil's Well, which itself is a re-themed version of the 1982 Anteater arcade game. Gameplay Diamond Mine (Electron version)Diamond Mine II (Plus/4 enhanced version) The aim of the game is to guide a pipe through a maze-like mine to collect diamonds while avoiding hitting the walls or the patrolling monsters. The player has a set length of pipe for each level. Once the pipe has started moving, it cannot stop and if it is retracted, that section of pipe is lost. If the pipe is hit by a monster or hits a wall, twice the amount of pipe is lost. Diamonds are placed sporadically in the maze and there is no way to kill the monsters. The sequel is similar but with fundamental changes in the game play. The pipe can pause, can be retracted at any time without penalty and the walls cannot be hit.

Plot Produced in reaction to the Protests of 1968, it describes the mid-life crisis of a businessman who decides to drop out of mainstream capitalist life and takes up with couple living a marginal existence on the fringe of society. Meanwhile his daughter has been caught up in a wave of student protest. According to Alison Smith, the Swiss director Tanner translated the May 1968 events in France to Switzerland, hoping for a similar upheaval in his own country, and in the film creating an imaginary student revolt in a society that in reality did not experience the turmoil or revolutionary possibility facing France in May 1968.

It was released by British-born singer Jeanette in 1971, and was her debut solo single. It has been re-recorded by Jeanette in English, French, and Japanese, and has inspired cover versions in diverse genres from flamenco to punk rock and rap. Development Following the dissolution of her former band Pic-Nic in 1969, Jeanette remained with the Hispavox label and moved to Barcelona the next year. Songwriter Manuel Alejandro wrote the song for a Mexican singer, Sola, but offered it to Jeanette, who is half Spanish. Jeanette originally did not like the song; in an interview posted in Cha Cha Charming magazine, Jeanette said, \\"My style of music was folk music . . . but Hispavox wanted me to sing this romantic music that I could not relate to.\\" They recorded the song that summer. Composition \\"Soy rebelde\\" is a quintessential sad song. The song uses a melody based on piano, wind instruments and violins that surrounds Jeanette's soft vocals. The song begins with a combination of piano and violin. The lyrics describe a solitary person, relating a life marked by pain, and focusing on a search for happiness, friendship and love. Jeanette's voice was an angelic whisper; Alejandro remarked it was \\"the tiniest voice I have ever heard\\", and that it would have been just another Mexican song if she did not sing it. The song is one of the greatest exponents of the \\"Torrelaguna Sound\\", named after the Torrelaguna Street in Madrid, where Hispavox Studios was based. This production style was influenced by Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, and experimented with the layering of instruments and reverb. Release When \\"Soy rebelde\\" was released, the record label misspelled her name (Janette) as \\"Jeanette\\", but after the single became a \\"runaway hit\\", the label decided to retain the latter spelling as her stage name. The single was played in Spain, but also extended to other countries, including: France, Belgium, England, Mexico, Italy, Argentina, and Venezuela. The B-side was \\"Oye Mama, Oya Papa\\" (Listen Mama, Listen Papa). In May 1972, Jeanette released the single in Japan as \\"\\", under Nippon Columbia records. She sang it in Japanese; the lyrics and arrangement were done by J. Hamada, with Waldo de Los Rios and his orchestra providing supporting music. The B-side was still the Spanish version of \\"\\". In 1976, Jeanette released the album Porque te vas, which consisted of French versions of her singles. \\"Soy rebelde\\" became \\"L'inconnu Qui M'aimera\\" (The Stranger Who Loves Me). She also released the song as a B-side to her single Je suis triste. Jeanette's English version, \\"I Am a Rebel\\", was released in the United Kingdom as a B-side to her Spanish single. Reception \\"Soy rebelde\\" was a commercial success and redefined Jeanette's career to that of a romantic balladist. The hit single topped the charts in Spain, staying on the charts for ten weeks. It also charted in the Top 10 of Latin American countries such as Argentina, Colombia and Peru. The song became a popular teen anthem throughout the Spanish-speaking world. This generation \\"adopted Jeanette as a symbol of a desire installed like a scalpel in the subconscious of the collective memory.\\"  Track listing  = Spanish version = The Spanish version was released in 1971 by Hispavox, catalog #: HS-764. = Japanese version = The Japanese version was released in May 1972 by Nippon Columbia, catalog #: LL-2543-H = French version = The French version was released as a B-side to the single, \\"Je suis triste\\", Hispavox catalog #: 2022 014 = English version =  Cover-versions/multiple-renditions  \\"Soy rebelde\\" has inspired cover versions and renditions: * In 1978, the Brazilian singer Lilian Knapp recorded a Portuguese version of the song titled \\"Sou Rebelde\\" (on the B-side, another version of a Jeanette song, \\"Porque te vas\\").http://www.discogs.com/Lilian-Sou-Rebelde-Eu-Sem- Voc%C3%AA/release/4348447 * In 1997, Albert Pla, a Catalan singer-songwriter, sang \\"Soy rebelde\\", and released it on his album Veintegenarios En Alburquerque.

Charlie Duke about to pick up Big Muley on the rim of Plum crater Lunar Sample 61016, better known as \\"Big Muley\\", is a lunar sample discovered and collected on the Apollo 16 mission in 1972 in the Descartes Highlands, on the rim of Plum crater, near Flag crater (Station 1). It is the largest sample returned from the Moon as part of the Apollo program. The rock, an breccia consisting mainly of shocked anorthosite attached to a fragment of troctolitic \\"melt rock\\", is named after Bill Muehlberger, the Apollo 16 field geology team leader. Big Muley is currently stored at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. Description TV camera still of Big Muley prior to collection. Big Muley was discovered on the eastern rim of Plum crater (Station 1) in the Descartes highlands of the Moon. The rock's cosmic ray exposure age was discovered to be about 1.8 million years, linking it to ejecta, or debris, from the impact that formed South Ray crater, to the south of the Apollo 16 landing site. The rock's age has been estimated since 1980 to be approximately 3.97 ± 0.25 billion years. The rock was highly shocked at some point in its history, as indicated by the fact that most of the rock's plagioclase content was converted to maskelynite and/or plagioclase glass. Bill Muehlberger, from a 1996 letter and a 1997 e-mail message, said :Big Muley was a problem from the moment we saw it on TV (from the TV camera on the LRV). The crew had been told to pick up nothing larger than their fist – the lab types could analyze remarkably small pieces and get reproducible results. So, when we spotted Big Muley with the television camera and saw what looked like a large rectangle flashing at us, we jumped to the conclusion that it was a crystal – or cleavage – face of plagioclase feldspar. That made the rock an anorthosite which, according to our pre-mission interpretations, should not be present at this landing site. Further, there was a small crater on our side (between the Rover and Big Muley) that we thought could be a bounce crater caused by this rock on landing. The direction suggested that this could have been from Theophilus, a large, relatively young crater that had been proposed as a source for some material that might be scattered across the landing area. So, I put in a request for the crew to pick it up as they returned to the LRV. We had no idea of size – it was the first sampling stop on the mission – but, once the crew got close, we realized that it was bigger than the max size suggested for return from the Moon and then Charlie started complaining about it(s size) and about his struggle to pick it up. It turned out to be the largest rock returned from the Moon! And it turned out to be a useful rock for the researchers.

Supply chain engineering draws heavily from, and overlaps with other engineering disciplines such as industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, systems engineering, information engineering, and software engineering. Although it has the same goals as supply chain management, supply chain engineering is focused on a mathematical model based approach, whereas supply chain management is focused on a more traditional management and business based one. Supply chain engineering can be considered to include supply chain optimization, although the latter could also be done using more qualitative management-based approaches, which is less of a focus in supply chain engineering.

Life Mark W. Dunham was the son of Solomon Dunham (1791–1856). The elder Dunham had emigrated from New York State in a covered wagon to settle on 400 acres of land in Illinois, where he strategically built roads, an inn, a general store, and a house in order to prosper from the construction of new railroad lines passing through the area. Solomon, a Democrat, was the first County Commissioner and the first Assessor in Kane County, Illinois. Solomon died in 1865, bequeathing 300 acres to his youngest son Mark. Mark W. Dunham and his brother Daniel Dunham, the oldest of the siblings, were pioneers in the introduction of the French coach horse, and especially well known as importers of the Percheron breed of draft horses into the United States. In 1875 Mark Wentworth Dunham purchased the Percheron horse \\"Success\\" for $3,300, an impressive sum at the time, and launched the horse breeding business. These large French draft horses proved to be excellent in pulling farm equipment before the invention of the power tractor and other farm machinery. To sell the horses, Dunham issued a catalog to prospective clients, some with illustrations by Rosa Bonheur. Through Dunham's legendary business acumen the size of the farm eventually expanded to 2,000 acres and the breeding business flourished until the early decades of the 20th century, earning Dunham vast sums of money and the gratitude of both the French and American people. By 1888 an estimated one-fifth of all imported French horses lived at Oaklawn. By 1883, the Dunham Castle, which was patterned after the Normandy chateaus he had seen while on stock buying trips in France, was completed and served as the family residence. During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair a train from Chicago to Wayne brought guests to see the Percheron horses. Those that made the trip included Cyrus McCormick, George Pullman, the Duke of Veragua, Daniel Burnham, Marshall Field, and Carter Harrison, Sr. In the early 20th century, the residence served as a retreat for such politicians as Adlai Stevenson and Everett Dirksen. Death and legacy Mark W. Dunham died in 1899, reportedly of blood poisoning after inspecting an infected hoof. His New York Times Obituary on February 12, 1899 named Dunham as “the most extensive breeder of pure-bred horses in the world… he [Dunham] collected in France a lot of mares and stallions that as a whole is conceded to be superior to any similar collection in France. He won with his horses more champion prizes in the show ring than any other breeder has ever won in the history of the show yard in America.” After his death, the then 2000 acre Oaklawn estate was bequeathed to Dunham's son Wirth Stewart Dunham, who was 21 years old at the time and finishing law school at Harvard. Wirth Dunham married Mary Louise Ward, whose father, Dennis Ward, was the President of City National Bank. During the first World War, Wirth was a Captain in the remount section, quartermaster corps, and afterward was a major in the reserve corps. Wirth Dunham was the President of the Horse Association of America and was made a Chevalier Merite Agricole by the French Government. In the early 20th century, farm machinery dramatically reduced the need for draft horses and Oaklawn ceased operations in 1929. The Dunham Woods Riding Club was established in 1934. Parts of the original property were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Other Notables In 1910, Louise Powis Clark (1887–1965) (a granddaughter of Solomon Dunham's eldest son Daniel), and her husband Elwood Brown traveled to Manila, Philippines with the Y.M.C.A. While there, Mrs. Brown became impressed by the beautiful embroidery done by the native women. As an experiment, she designed an embroidery pattern for a nightgown and commissioned local artisans to produce it. With the help of her mother, Mrs. Julia Dunham Powis of Wayne, the production of this attire eventually developed into a million dollar business, and moved its headquarters from the family home, \\"Grove Place,\\" to New York City. The mother-daughter team sold their interest in the company after Mr. Brown's death in 1929. Some years later Louise married Owen D. Young, chairman of General Electric.

Designed to be used in naval combat aircraft to deploy as part of the ejection sequence, only one was built and it did not enter service. It was the first jet-powered gyroplane. Design and development The United States Navy Air Development Center awarded a number of contracts to aerospace companies to find a method for ejected aircrew to escape from the scene of the crash. Kaman proposed a turbofan powered gyroplane it called the Stowable Aircrew Vehicle Escape Rotorseat or SAVER, it was a gyroplane with an unpowered rotor, the blades being telescopic and along with the turbofan engine would fold into the aircraft seat during normal use. When the pilot ejected the seat would leave the aircraft and a drogue parachute would slow the seat and deploy the blades within four seconds. After an additional two seconds, the turbofan would run up to full power and the seat would become a gyroplane. Kaman made over 1500 air drops to test the self-deploying rotor system and a full-scale unpowered SAVER was tested by NASA in the Ames Research Laboraatory wind tunnel in 1970. The SAVER was equipped with a ground handling frame for tests, which was a tricycle landing gear and support frame, also fitted with basic flight instruments. The SAVER first flew in a towed flight on 28 December 1971 and the following day made a free flight, although it was fitted with a 16 ft non- telescoping rotor. Fitted with the 14 ft telescopic rotor, it first flew 10 January 1972. The SAVER was fitted with a Williams WRC-19 turbofan which was too powerful for the seat but was available \\"off the shelf.\\" The program was to test the seat unmanned in an air launch but the program was cancelled as the military did not think the idea was a viable proposition. The SAVER was an aircraft ejection seat with a Williams WRC-19 turbofan engine and a two-bladed non-powered rotor attached to the seat structure. It had a parachute in the headrest assembly and a seat back fitted with a life raft and survival gear.

Stanley Moss, a British soldier, writer and traveller. It describes an operation in Crete during the Second World War to capture German general Heinrich Kreipe. Moss kept a diary during the war years and based his book on it. The 2014 edition includes an introduction by one of Moss's children and an afterword by Patrick Leigh Fermor. The story was made into a 1957 film with the same title starring Dirk Bogarde by the British writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Development & publication The book recounts Moss's service, alongside Patrick Leigh Fermor, as an agent of Special Operations Executive (SOE), including their kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe, commander of 22. Luftlande- Division (22nd Air Landing Division) on German-occupied Crete, and Kreipe's removal to Cairo for intelligence and propaganda purposes. While the manuscript was completed in early 1945, its publication was initially blocked by the head of SOE, Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins, an instruction relayed by Colin Mackenzie (BB100), commander of Force 136. It was first published in 1950, when it was selected by W. Somerset Maugham as one of the best three books of that year: \\"more thrilling than any detective story I can remember, and written in a modest and most engaging manner\\".Sunday Times , 24 December 1950London Mystery Magazine #10 , June - July 1951, p. 9 The book was chosen to lead the BBC radio series Now it can be told of 1950. It has been republished many times since and remains in print. The book has been translated into Spanish, Italian and Greek. The title is a quotation from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 60). Moss's second book, A War of Shadows, describes the aftermath of Ill Met by Moonlight, a subsequent raid on Crete and operations in mainland Greece and Thailand (against Japanese forces). Summary In May 1941, German forces attacked and occupied Crete. Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The Special Operations Executive (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local resistance in harrying German occupying forces. On 4 February 1944, Major Patrick Leigh Fermor and Captain William Stanley Moss and two Cretan SOE agents left Egypt by plane for Crete. Their intention was to parachute into Crete but after arriving at the drop zone, only Leigh Fermor was able to parachute successfully. The others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to Egypt. On landing Leigh Fermor was met by a group from the Cretan resistance, with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the SOE team. After three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two-month period, Moss and the other two arrived by Motor Launch ML 842 on 4 April 1944. They were met on the beach by Leigh Fermor and another SOE agent, Sandy Rendel. Their target General Müller was replaced by General Kreipe just before they arrived. The team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the German commanding officer. The SOE team included a number of Cretans; 'Anthony' (Antonis Papaleonidas), 'Micky' (Michalis Akoumianakis) and Grigorios Chnarakis. Micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite Kreipe's residence, the Villa Ariadne, in the village of Knossos. The team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction. Dressed as a Cretan shepherd, Leigh Fermor travelled on the local bus to check Knossos and the area around the German headquarters. He decided that the German headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate. After a few days of alternately observing the actions of the General, they finalized the details of the abduction. The plan was for the two British officers, dressed as corporals in the Feldgendarmerie (German military police), to stop the general's car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point. On the night of 26 April 1944, the two British officers stopped the General's car before the Villa Ariadne. When the car stopped, Leigh Fermor took care of Kreipe and Moss knocked the driver out with his cosh.Macintyre, Ben, The Times, 11 June 2011, pp. 18-19Moss's cosh held by Imperial War Museum London, Catalogue ref WEA 4182 Moss drove the team and the General in the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in Heraklion before leaving Leigh Fermor to abandon the car. When Leigh Fermor left the car, he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by British Commandos so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population. With his Cretan escorts, Moss set off with the General across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British motor launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. On 14 May 1944, the SOE team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near Rodakino, possibly Peristeres beach, on the southern side of the island. They were transported to safety, landing at Mersa Matruh in Egypt. After the war, a member of Kreipe’s staff reported how, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by, “Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.”Cooper, Artemis, Cairo in the War 1939–1945, Hamish Hamilton, 1989, p. 300 Post War correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the General’s car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.Beutin, Dr Ludwig, Letter to W. Stanley Moss, 27 September 1950 The book was due to be published in Germany in 1950. Kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to escape to Moss and Leigh Fermor as described by Moss in the book. Kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in Germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue.Taylor, Oliver, Ill Met by Moonlight:The Post-War Cultural Narrative of the Abduction of General Kreipe in Crete, 1944, 2018, pp. 11-12 Leigh Fermor's report after the operationLeigh Fermor, Patrick, Short Report on Capture of General Kreipe\\", TNA File HS5/418 1944, p3. and the publication of his account of the abduction published in 2015 both corroborated Moss's version of events.

The village is over 450 years old and lies north-east of Churu and from Churu town. Bordering villages include Ranwa Ki Dhani, Lalasar, Ginadi Taal, Inderpura, Thalori and Bhamasi. The 43 bigha village has an overall population of 998.http://churu.nic.in/pages/gpcensus/pschuru.pdf Pre-Indian Independence One view is that some 450 years ago, there was a jagayat centre (authorised resting place for travellers on payment) on the way (sub trade route Taranagar (RINI) - Churu). The jagayti (contractor owner of the place) had to pay 1 gini (a gold coin equal to 1/2 of a mohar). The centre, therefore, was called Giniwala. During the war between Rai Sigh Rathore (a son of the Bika Rathore of then newly established state Bikaner) and the Poonia chief Kanha Deo of Jhansal (near Hissar) many Poonia families were displaced. One Ramkishan Poonia family migrated from the village Binjawas (Rajgadh) to adjoining area of Shekhawati region Neema ki dhani. The Poonia family along with the families of ancestors of Deepa Karel, ancestors of Roopdas Swami and ancestors of Balaram Meghwal further displaced reached the Giniwala Jagayat - centre and established their dhani (residence) there. =Relics= The \\"Theh\\" (remains of earthen pots) at Rathion Ki Dhani and south of the village site at farmlands of Kanaram Kulhari and Richhpal Poonia. The Babal Kunds and the Chhatri there, the Bodia Kua and the memorial chabutra of Meghrajot Singh near or under the house of Ramnarayan. =Village administration= The village along with 24 others was under the jagir of Rajpura Thakur. Poonia, Udaram and his ancestors, were village Choudhary and Meghwal the village Kotwal. The Choudhary collected land revenue (Rakam) and arbitrated the village disputes. The Kotwal functioned as Ahalkar (messenger-cum-attendant) of the Thakur and Choudhary. Due to untimely death of Choudhary Rajuram and his ailing son Surjaram Poonia, Chimnaram Tetarwal was appointed as co-choudhary of the village 20 years before abolition of the jagirdari system. =Housing and construction= Matka in the Village In the past there were huts and Saals (room built with clay and limestone and with thatched ceiling). The first pakka room (built with chuna (baked limestone) and khor (nodules of clay) used with Dhandhla stone) was built by Motaram Poonia followed by Bhinwam chamar, Chimnaram Tetarwal & Udaram Poonia. The four rooms, kua, johra, three kunds (Babal kunds along with the Babal chhatri and the memorial chabutra) were the only pakka structures before independence. After independence =Village government= The village is governed by Panchayati Raj System. In the first panchayat election, the village along with 14 others, was under Sehjusar gram PANCHYAT. Later on it became part of Inderpura panchayat and now it is a part of Lalasr Banirotan. Presently out of total 9 members of the panchayat 3 panchas are elected from Ginadi. The panchayat is under Vikas Samiti Churu. It is part of the Churu MLA constituency. During first two panchayats, Nyay Samitis at panchayat levels were also constituted. Ch. Magaram Poonia of the village was elected member of the nyay Samiti. Secretary Panchayat, Patwari, Gram Sewak, Vyavsthapak cooperative society, waterman, lineman & Sathin Aanganbari Kendra are village-level government functionaries. The village is under Dudhwakhara police station. =Village economy= Almost all the families of the village are engaged in farming. However, some members of the families are engaged in services & other activities. There are three male government teachers, two female government teachers, five private school teachers, five nurses, one railway, one in the RAC, three state policemen, six in army, three in water Works department, five retired Havildars, 22 work in Arab countries, there are two accountants, one retired government PG college principal, one private college lecturer, two engineers, three (MBA) managers, two lawyers & twenty persons working in factories outside the village. As can be seen from these figures, out of the 220 families (houses) more than 85 villagers are employed in occupations other than agriculture. There are four private schools established and operated by the villagers, two in the village and two at Jodhpur. Apart from agriculture, live-stock activities are also carried on in the village, almost every household has some sort of animals with it. There are ten 'Rewads'(a herd of sheep and goats), 30 camels, 60 cows with one village bull, 160 buffaloes with a common \\"Jhota\\" (he buffalo), two mares and four donkeys. The village is counted as one of the best villages in the tehsil. Almost every household has a pakka room with pakki boundaries & there are good havelis. But as compared with the position of the village some 50 years ago, in general, the financial position has worsened. Then, out of 125 households only 25 houses were indebted, but now out of 220 households more than 160 are indebted. Thus indebtedness has risen from 20% to more than 75%. Reasons of rise in indebtedness are many. On one hand are positive changes in lifestyle, raising of living standards, now people eat better, wear better clothes, use amenities and facilities seen in towns. Villagers spend on education, transportation, and medication. But the biggest setback has been the adverse farming conditions. In the past, every member of the family earned: children raised livestock, ghee was sold to arrange for groceries, every bye-product of farming - woods, fodder etc. - fetched a hefty income. The costs in farming were little, medical expenses almost non-existent, no expense on water-electricity, no education expense, no transportation expense; no expense on detergents & cosmetics. The expenses were very few since the living standards were low and even little income led to an economy of surplus & self-reliance. In addition, farmers do not know where their interests lie. They support rallies that seek to curb prices of farm produce in guise of controlling inflation. As a matter of fact such rallies are to benefit other sections of society at the cost of the farmer. =Transportation= Ginadi is connected by a two lane asphalt road to Churu. Churu Railway station, from Ginari is the nearest railway station, which is well connected to Jaipur, Delhi and other cities. Asphalt roads connect the village to surrounding villages. The first village road connecting it to Churu - Taranagar road was built 1n 2006 with the efforts of the villagers under the leadership of Prof. Shivram poonia and his cousin 'sarpanch' (Gram Panchayat head) sh. Chokharam poonia. Camel carts and bullock carts were formerly the chief means of transportation and are being replaced by cycles and other automobiles. In the rainy season, womenfolk can be seen bringing grass on their heads for cows and buffaloes. =Academics= Primary school was established by the government in 1961-62. The school started in a (a room with mud walls and grass roof). Two pakka rooms were constructed by the villagers in 1963. Now the school has been upgraded to middle level with 8 rooms and 300 students on its roll. Two private primary schools are also operating in the village. Religion All the villagers follow the Hindu religion. =Local deities= * Thakurji: the oldest temple in the village; The Swami clan as its priest; owning a \\"Dohli\\" (tax-free farm-land allotted by the state for sustenance of the priest family); actually it is a Krishna temple but called Thakurji perhaps due to influence of erstwhile Thakurs (jagirdars); the priest daily in the morning takes a ferry to each house and says \\"jai thakurji\\" and in turn gets some floor. The villagers go to the temple on the occasions of birth, marriage and death. The temple was housed in a mud-walled room till 1980 when the employees of the village, under leadership of prof. Shiv Ram Poonia, got constructed full 'pakka' temple with installation of statues('Pran pratistha'). * Gogaji is a Chauhan chieftain born in nearby Jodi village to mata (mother) Bachhal with the blessing of Guru Gorakh Nath and blessed by him to be lord of snakes> He owned the famous magical mere Keshar Kalvi and fought against the plunders to protect cows, and was exiled by his mother due to his killing of his cousins Arjan-Sharjan. He prayed \\"Kalma\\" (a religious mantra of the Muslims) and took \\"Jinwat Smadhi\\" (lively going in the earth) and therefore called Goga peer, perhaps the only deity worshiped by both the Hindus and the Muslims, his \\"smadhi-sathal\\" (death place) Gogamedi near Bhadra tehsil is an India level pilgrim centre. * In Ginadi there was only a \\"than\\" (a small triangular structure symbolic of a \\"medi\\" (full temple) till 2007 when a'pakki' medi was constructed by the villagers under the leadership of haveldar Ishar ram Ishran..In the months of Shrawan-Bhadwa, village girls go to it and offer water while singing and praying for protection from snakes. snake-bites in the area are most common in the months of Shrawan-Bhadwa; snake-bitten person is brought to the medi and a tanti (a thread embedded with the feather of peacock) is tied to him as an antidote. If not, a \\"thali of Kansi\\" (plate of alloy) is applied to his back by an expert and the poison is sucked by it. Eighth day of the month of Bhadwa is observed as Goga-day; a \\"prashad\\" (blessed offering) of (a piece of coconut) and kheer (a liquid preparation of milk-rice) is offered on this day. The Bhakat (devotee priest) prays for landing of \\"Jewdees\\" (rope like poison -less snakes) and if not obliged, punishes himself with a \\"Shankal\\" (a ring with iron spokes). The moment is surcharged with emotions for the onlookers. * Mawliaji, also called MahamayaJi, is goddess mother of children; there is a 'than' of the deity two km south of the village, along with a pasture land of some 30 bighas attached to it. The place of the deity is one of its kind in the area and devotees from hundreds of km come to it for worship and to pray for the well being of their newborn babies. One time worship of the goddess is considered mandatory for every newborn baby. * Gudganvwali Mata for the clan of Harjans, Karni Mata for the clan of Rajputs, Sedh Mata, Malasi ka Mamliaji, Khetarpalji, Bhomiaji and Peerji () and Netji are village deities; Netji and Harsh are also clan deities for Poonia while Gossainji for Ishrans. Water resources Underground water is saline. Underground wells and johdas were main source of water for animals and domestic requirements. Drinking water was fetched from the nearby village Inderpura. A Kui कुई (a narrow vertical tunnel dug to the underground water level) on the west of bodia kua बोड़िया कुआ was built 200 years ago. During the severe drought of Vikram Samvat 1995 to 1996, under the inspiration of ch. Chimnaram Tetarwal, a 'pakka kua’ was built by Seth Jaydyalji Goenka of Churu. Later a 60x60x15 (feet cube) size pakka johda along with a 30x15x10 ft size Gaughat were built. There were 4 community kuis of Poonia, Sunda, Thakur, and Tetarwal. The well was operated through a bid system. Livestock heads were counted and per head bidding rates invited. Water was drawn with the help of bullocks. The well was operated daily in the morning and evening. The echo of the sweet songs by the \\"kuadias\\" कुआडिया( two men operating the well) at 4 AM were used to be very refreshing and enlightening. In the evening, operating time of the well was very lively and entertaining. Both of the elders and the youth would gather in the \\"Guaad\\" गुआड़(courtyard in the common land); overtly gossiping and discussing village news. But their main attraction would be the \\"Paniharins\\" पनिहारीं (the newly wed brides in a flock along with their young sisters-in-law going to fetch water from the well). They used to dress themselves in the best of their decorated traditional attires and ornaments. The elders stealthily glancing and the youths openly and closely; but the moments would be exotic to both. During the month of Falgun, the \\"Rasiyas\\"(the men in a group dancing, singing and playing on 'Damphs'- circular drums- on the eve of Holi festival) performing with all the vigour and gusto at the time of 'panghat'( the system of fetching water from the village well), the occasion becomes frenetic, memorable to any body to the extent of envy. There were only three Kunds of Poonia, Tetarwal & Meghwal. They were underground tanks with tomb shaped \\"Dhoala\\" & pakka catchment area to store rain water, the tanks were cylindrical shaped to withstand pressure of water & their inner sides were coated with a Sunla of Singraj powder to stop leakage of water. The tanks were main source of precious drinkable water and were cleaned of dirt annually and occasionally sprayed with \\"Gangajal\\" to prevent pollution. In 1974-75, Under the inspiration of Prof. Shiv Ram Poonia, a new well was constructed by Seth Kanhailal Dugar of Sardarshahr and handed over to Public Health Engineering Department PHED. Almost every house of the village was connected to the storage tanks through pipelines. Recently the village has been connected to German water supply system. =Electrification= The village was electrified in 1980 due to personal efforts by the villagers under the leadership of late ch. Rikhuram Poonia. The villagers bought Rural Electrification Bonds of Rs.5,000 (then five thousand!) in order to get electric connectivity; the bonds are still pending redemption due to negligence of the descendants of the buyers. Johda जोह्ड़ा (Common grazing land) The johdas are earthen ponds with large catchment areas meant for storage of rain water inside Charagah (grazing) lands for animals. The Johdas include Kalra कालरा (biggest and best with kalar clays famous for preserving water up to 9 months a year and connected to village with Goha गोहा (a wide strip of land meant for animal transit). Kesana (best pasture land) was connected to village with a Goha. Sujania सुजानिया, Mawliaji ki johadi मावलिआजी की जोहड़ी are located at village kankad कांकड़(border). Others are- Ram talai राम तलाई, Gangania गंगानिया, Khatayani खातायानी, dumani डुमानी, Pichparani पिचपरानी, Johadia जोहडिया and village Beed बीड़. The total area under these johra जोह्ड़ा was roughly 500 bigha but due to negligence of the villagers and carelessness of the administration, nearly 100 bigha land of common village pastureland stands encroached for farming. The Johria जोहडिया, village beed बीड़, and the gohas गोहा are completely encroached while others are only peripherally encroached. Society and culture Village society is governed solely by Hindu rituals although the younger generation has been affected by western cultural influences. Parda, the practice of using veils to cover the face and other parts of the body is discouraged. =Festivals= Villagers celebrate all major Hindu festivals. Some of the major festivals are Holi, Deepawali, Makar Sankranti, Raksha Bandhan, Sawan, Teej, and Gauga Peer, Gangaur. The saying 'तीज त्योंहरा बावड़ी हाड़ो ले डूबी गंगोर' (festivals begin with Teej and end with Gangor) speaks chronology of Hindu festivals. Each of the festival has its own peculiarity and logic regarding time of observance, motive, celebration and usefulness. Teej *The 3rd day of the Shrawan month, the day of 'surangi' (colorful) Teej; middle of rainy season; greenery all around; rows and columns of dark clouds disbursing rains everywhere. The festival celebrates the youthfulness of the nature and humanity. The newlywed daughters are brought to their parental homes. They, singing folk songs on the theme of love and nature, go to village ponds and take bath. Young ladies in pairs can be seen taking ride on \\"Jhula\\" (swing made from grass rope, two ropes suspended from a branch of a tree and tied to a foot board to stand on). Kheer is cooked in every home. Dipawali The 15th day of Kartik-month at the beginning of winter season, Khareef crops are ready for harvesting, local fruits are ready in plenty, sisters are brought to parental home from their in-laws place, all the members working away from home in foreign lands return home. The festival is observed to worship Goddess Laxmi- seeking wealth, prosperity and peace; celebrations begin from \\"Dhan Teras\\" followed by Kanti Dipawali. On the night of 15th, every house is illuminated with \\"Diya\\" (small earthen lamps lighted with ghee/oil). Worship is performed by hanging pictures of Laxmi along with Lord Ganesha and putting jewelry and cash interspersed with 'roli', incense, 'prasad' (of cooked rice with ghee and 'shakkar'- powdered gur), dipak of ghee and an ember. The family members dressed in best attires assemble, head lady offers ghee on the ember, if the emerging flame is connected to the flame of the dipak goddess is supposed to be attentive for worship. The lady calls the family members one by one, ties a \\"Suha naal\\" (auspicious coloured thread) on the wrist and applies \\"Tilak\\" (spot of liquid vermilion/roli on the fore head) or \\"vibhuti\\" (burnt ash of the auspicious ember) on the fore head) and the member prays for prosperity/ individual aspirations. *\\"Dhan Teras\\" - (13th, the auspicious day for wealth), people buy precious metals, new utensils, vehicles etc. *Kanti Dipawali- 14th is day for Kanti Dipawali (dipawali without lights). *Govardhan-The next day to Dipawali is for \\"Govardhan\\" ( Lord of the most useful animal- cow) worship and \\"Raam-rumi\\" (greeting in the name of lord Rama). A heap of cow dung along with local fruits is put at the gate of every house. The villagers take ferry to each other's house, say raam-rumi and accept sweets. *The last of the celebrations is \\"Bhaiya-dooj\\"(the 2nd day of dipawali for brothers); sisters oblige brothers for remembering and bringing them to parental home to participate in the celebrations. *The boys of the village start playing of \\"Hidda-lighting\\" (tied beams of straws) 15 days before dipawali. In the early night, they gather at the outskirts of the village; light their , dance, race and sing folk songs. Nice opportunity to prove one's efficiency, making friends and entertaining. How colorful, attractive and purposeful the festival! Children used to count months and days ahead of Dipawali. Interesting to note that in contrast to the cities, no crackers were exploded in the villages during diwali celebrations. Holi The end of Falgun month; lively fauna and flora; spring season spreads its smell all around; villagers having harvested their crops in leisure ready to enjoy the season. The occasion is Holi festival; the festival of revelries for toiling masses in contrast to Dipawali for affluent ones. *According to mythology Holika, sister of mighty demon Hiranyakashipu, had a magical (a decorated coloured cloth for woman to cover head and wrap around the body) with a boon that anything covered with it would be immune to fire. She tried to burn child \\"Bhakat\\" (devotee and worshipper of any god) Prahalad by covering herself with the and taking the child in her lap and setting fire on but the child remained unscathed while Holika burnt to ashes. The victory of truth (Prahalad) over evil (holika) is legend of celebrating Holi. Victory of Prahalad but celebration in the name of Holika, perhaps due to feudal influence in latter stage. *Holi celebrations start from \\"fullariya-dooj\\"(the 2nd day of Falgun when flowers are in full bloom), playing on chang or \\"Daph\\" (a drum of round circular frame of wood covered with skin of sheep) starts from this day. The Daph is held on shoulder near the ear and beaten/struck with the flap of the palm of hand/fingers. Every evening, a group of people (called 'Rasiya') play on daph while dancing on knees and singing folk ballads in a rhythm at different pitches. The saga is called \\"Dhamal\\". Young girls play \\"Loor\\" (a dance with measured steps and stanza of a song by each participant). On the day of Holi, a small tree of khejri is planted in the midst of \\"Bhintka\\" (a heap of straws of a thorny bush) on the outskirts of the village. In the evening, the villagers gather at the spot; the girls throw 'Badkulia' बड्कुलिया (a garland of cow dung pieces) on the Holika, the village head offers a coconut, the 'rasiyas' play on daph, the children explode crackers and Holi is set on fire. Meanwhile, unmarried youth, aspirant of marriage at the earliest, takes out the planted tree (Prahalad) and 'holika' is burnt to ashes. The wise farmers read omens from the direction of the flames of burning 'Holika' and voice of birds etc.; others symbolically plough their farms and throw their 'Matira' (a fruit of watermelon category) through the flames and thus the celebration is over. The sweet diet is rice with ghee- shakar. *At night all the villagers gather in the village courtyard to play \\"Gindhad\\"(Dandya dance in circle around the 'Nagara' - a big drum). The next day is observed as 'Dhulandi'. All the villagers along with 'rasiyas' take a ferry (procession called 'Gehar') to each house demanding sweats and wine on this or that count. Thus Holi, the most important festival of the villagers, is a good forum for entertainment and strengthening brotherhood. Makar Sankranti In the month of Magh, every year fixed on 14 January, when the sun has entered the zodiac sign of Capricorn, signaling end of winter in the northern hemisphere, the festival of makar-sankranti is observed to propitiate the sun god to protect us from the evil effects of astral bodies. Oil based foods - , , , , , etc. are cooked. But the craze for kite-flying prevalent in the cities on this occasion is, however, virtually non-existent in the villages. Gangaur The last of the village festivals in a calendar year; the 21st day of Chaitra month; spring season at the end of its full bloom, aura of smell and greenery; festive atmosphere at the time of equinox; villagers in leisure ; the occasion is festival of Gangaur, predominantly a function of females like 'Teej'. Literally \\"gangaur\\" means goddess Parvati mother of 9 'Gans' (nine basic traits of human conscience-owned by lord ganesha son of parvati). According to mythology, Parvati had worshiped lord Shiva to have him her husband. Therefore, all the aspirant brides worship goddess mother Parvati praying for providing them with husband of their choice. Some 15 days ahead of the festival, each day early in the morning the girls go to outskirts of the village, collect green branches of the local bush 'Fog' full of smell with its flower 'Ghintal'( by the way ' the smell of the 'ghital' of the then densely found bush in the desert areas in the month of 'Chaitra-maas' used to be all pervasive making the surroundings lively and festive. but, alas!, with fast disappearing of the bush it is no more there!); offer water to the branches and worship Parvati. On the day of the festival in the evening, competitions of wrestling, kabadi, horse and camel race are organised. The youths of the village participate enthusiastically. The idols of the Gaur are thrown in the village well to get them submerged in the fresh water of the well. A legend also goes that a Rajput lady Gangaur while at her parental home jumped in the village well followed by her husband Hada and therefore since then the festival is observed. But it might have been added during feudal period just to give the festival a touch of the authority of the ruling class. The special diet on the occasion is 'Dhokla'(berry like pieces of the dough of millet cooked in the steam of water) along with 'Kheer'. It's also note worthy that the girl who worshiped 'Gangaur' is considered duty bound to do 'Gaur-ujna' after her marriage as an offering for fulfilment of her prayers before marriage. =Music and entertainment= Folk songs are sung by women during weddings and on other social occasions. Menfolk sing dhamaal ( traditional Holi songs). Many villagers own TV's as well as radios and satellite dishes. The sound of popular Hindi music emanating from stereos and other devices is heard from different houses during the afternoon and evening. =Games and sports= Nowadays most of the children play cricket. Some villagers also play volleyball and football. Villagers can be seen playing cards in chaupal (village common area) and \\"chausar\\" (choppad-pasa) in some houses. Some of the traditional games & sports are also prevalent. *Folk games : **'Kabadi'(played between two teams, each team having 7 players, one team operates as raiders and the other catchers, if the raider is caught he is out but if he manages to over power the catchers and comes to the central line, all the catchers touching him are out. **'Ghoda- kabadi (a variation of kabadi) is also popular. **'Peewani'( a variation of hockey, played at night during 'holi- dipawali' days). **'Hardada'(a variation of cricket, played during 'Holi' days. **'Guntha'(a variation of golf) **'Dharsunda'(seven players in a ring and seven outside it, each of the outside players raids the ring and tries to throw out as many opponents as possible but the opponents are free to hit/catch/fell him and if he is unable to come out of the ring he is out). **'Lala-liter'( players sitting in a circle, one of them with a concealed shoe with him and chanting 'Lala- liter 'lewun ke dewun' takes round of them and puts stealthily the shoe behind any of them, if the person comes to know of it he can beat the raider with the shoe otherwise he is beaten with the shoe and given out to function as next raider). The games were played by children/ youths either at night or during slack season; apart from providing recreation, they also provided fine opportunity to prove one's superiority, make friends and get training for teamwork. But now they are on the wane - occasional glimpses is the most we can hope for.

Location and topography  The peak is located at a junction of three ridges: * from the east from Jarząbczy Wierch / Hrubý Vrch and Łopata / Lopata * from the south from Ostrý Roháč / Rohacz Ostry and Plačlivé / Rohacz Placzliwy (towards Roháče) * from the north from Rákon / Rakoń and Grześ (towards Bobrovec) Volovec lies on the Main Ridge of Western Tatras between Ostrý Roháč and mountain Deravá, close to mountain Rákoň. Starting from Volovec, the Main Ridge acts as the border between Poland and Slovakia.  Description  The mountain consists of metamorphic rock (Alaskite and Mylonite). Local fauna include the Tatra chamois and Alpine marmot.  Access  There are two marked hiking trails which lead to the summit of Volovec, red and blue. A third, green one, connects with the blue one at the saddle beneath the mountain. All routes pose no technical difficulty and when taking into account the relatively large distance and altitude difference involved, the summit is one of the most challenging climbs in Western Tatras accessible even to children. An exception to this is trying to access Volovec through Ostrý Roháč and Jamnícke saddle, which is one of the most exposed climbs on the main ridge of Western Tatras. * Red trail from Jarząbczy Wierch / Hrubý Vrch (2:10 h) * Blue trail from village Oravice through Jamnícka valley * Green trail from Polana Chochołowska through Dolina Chochołowska Wyżnia, it connects with the blue trail at the saddle between Rákoň and Volovec (2:40 h, ↓ 2:05 h) Hiking off-trails is forbidden in Polish Western Tatras and allowed only at certain areas in Slovak Western Tatras and only when accompanied by a mountain guide or when holding a UIAA license.

It was built during the reign of King Kavan Tissa, Prince of Ruhuna, (2nd century BC) containing the Lalata Dathun Wahanse (sacred forehead bone) of Lord Buddha. It can be reached by land and sea. The sea route begins at Trincomalee to Muttur on boat and another 16 km by roads and the land route is via Kantale, to Allai which is approximately 45 km through dense forest. According to the late Dr. R. L. Brohier, the Seruwila region was a vast swamp or villu where the flood waters of the Mahaweli Ganga collected. This villu was the home of large flocks of teals (seru) during migratory period. That perhaps was how the place came to be known as Seruwawila.Seeing Ceylon by R. L. Brohier History and development It is believed that three viharas existed at this particular spot built during the periods of three former Buddhas named Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana and Kassapa with their relics enshrined. Gautama Buddha, who was the last Buddha in this eon, had personally visited this place and offered eight handfuls of 'sapu' flowers, then wished that the temple which constructing in future should be named as Mangala viharaya. Later the Kingdom of Ruhuna was threatened by South Indian Chola and Pandya invaders during the reign of King Kavantissa (2nd century BC) then the king had to evolve a strategy to prevent the disaster. Over the years, the stupa fell into decay under the pressure of the Tamil invasions from the north. But there are evidences in the literature that this area was under the purview of the Kandyan territory during the 17th century and the existence of this stupa. During the Western Colonial occupation, priority was given to fertile western part of the island then as a result the arid dry zone neglected and left into wilderness.  Present state of conservation It was only in 1922 that the dagaba was re-discovered by Ven. Dambagasare Sumedhankara Thero and, assisted by the Archeological Department, he restored the stupa using remains of ancient structures around the stupa to conjecture the conservation work. The conservation was completed in 1931. The stupa and its environs covering approximately 85 acres was declared as an Archaeological Reserve in 1962. After this the Department of Archaeology was carrying out conservation work by stages. In view of the importance of this sacred shrine and to attract more pilgrims to the area, the Department of Town and Country Planning drew up a plan for the development of a new town complete with pilgrim rests, market areas, etc. during the 1970s. On June 2009, it was refurbished and ceremonially opened for the veneration of a large number of devotees at a cost of nearly Rs. 25 million by the National Physical Planning Department under the guidance of Urban Development and Sacred Area Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardane.

The central goal of community policing is for the police to build relationships with the community through interactions with local agencies and members of the public, creating partnerships and strategies for reducing crime and disorder.Brown, L. and Wycoff, M.D., \\"Policing Houston: reducing fear and improving services\\", Crime and Delinquency (Jun. 1987): 71–89.Goldstein, H., Problem Oriented Policing, McGraw-Hill Publishing, New York, 1990.Ankony, Robert C., \\"The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement\\".

Although community policing mostly targets low-level crime and disorder, the broken windows theory proposes that this can reduce more serious crime as well. Community policing is related to problem-oriented policing and intelligence- led policing, and contrasts with reactive policing strategies which were predominant in the late 20th century. It does not eliminate the need for reactive policing, although successful prevention can reduce the need for the latter. Many police forces have teams that focus specifically on community policing, such as Neighbourhood Policing Teams in the United Kingdom, which are separate from the more centralized units that respond to emergencies. The overall assessment of community-oriented policing is positive, as both officers and community members attest to its effectiveness in reducing crime and raising the sense of security in a community. History Robert Peel's ideas about policing are sometimes considered a precursor to modern community policing. Some authors have traced the core values of community policing to certain original 1829 Peelian Principles, most notably John Alderson, the former Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police. These included the ideas that the police needed to seek \\"the co-operation of the public\\" and prioritize crime prevention. The term \\"community policing\\" came into use in the late 20th century and, then, only as a response to a preceding philosophy of police organization.Karpiak, Kevin G., \\"Community Policing\\" in Encyclopedia of Criminal Justice Ethics, SAGE Publications, , 2014 In the early 20th century, the rise of automobiles, telecommunications and suburbanization transformed how the police operated. Police forces moved to using a reactive strategy versus a proactive approach, focusing on answering emergency calls as quickly as possible and relying on motor vehicle patrols to deter crime. Some police forces such as the Chicago Police Department began rotating officers between different neighborhoods as a measure to prevent corruption, and, as a result, foot patrols became rare. These changes significantly altered the nature of police presence in many neighborhoods. By the 1960s, many countries such as the United States were looking for ways to repair relations between police forces and racial minorities. For example, in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a Blue Ribbon committee to study the apparent distrust with the police by many community members, especially along racial lines. The resulting report, the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice suggested the development of a new type of police officer which would act as a community liaison and work to build bridges between law enforcement and minority populations. Furthermore, the Kansas City preventive patrol experiment provided evidence that aimless motor patrols were not an effective deterrent to crime. Similarly, by 1981, a study by the US- based Police Foundation suggested that police officers spent so much time on response duties and in cars that they had become isolated from their communities. In response to some of these problems, many police departments in the United States began experimenting with what would become known as \\"community policing\\". Research by Michigan criminal justice academics and practitioners started being published as early as the 1980s. As a professor of criminal justice, Bob Trajanowcz in the late 1990s influenced many future law enforcement leaders on how to implement elements of community policing One experiment in Flint, Michigan, involved foot patrol officers be assigned to a specific geographic area to help reduce crime in hot spots. Community-oriented policing was promoted by the Clinton Administration. The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act established the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) within the Justice Department and provided funding to promote community policing. Kenneth Peak has argued that community policing in the United States has evolved through three generations: innovation (1979 to 1986), diffusion (1987 to 1994) and institutionalization (1995 to present day). The innovation period occurred following the civil unrest of the 1960s, in large part as an attempt to identify alternatives to the reactive methods developed in mid-century. This era was also saw the development of such programs as the broken windows theory and problem-oriented policing. The diffusion era followed, in which larger departments began to integrate aspects of community policing, often through grants that initiated specialized units. Lastly, the institutionalization era introduced mass application of community policing programs, in not only large departments but also smaller and more rural ones. Method PCSOs of West Midlands Police prepare to go on cycle patrol. Community meetings were used to decide which areas needed patrolling the most. Police in Strasbourg, France. Community policing movements have led to a revival of foot patrols. Many community-oriented police structures focus on assigning officers to a specific area called a “beat”, those officers become familiar with that area through a process of “beat profiling.” The officers are then taught how to design specific patrol strategies to deal with the types of crime that are experienced in that beat.Watson, Elizabeth M, Alfred R Stone and Stuart M DeLuca. Strategies for Community Policing. Print. Upper Saddle River: Prentice-Hall Inc, 1998. These ideas are implemented in a multi-pronged approach using a variety of aspects, such as broadening the duties of the police officer and individualizing the practices to the community they're policing; refocusing police efforts to face-to-face interactions in smaller patrol areas with an emphasized goal of preventing criminal activity instead of responding to it; solving problems using input from the community they're policing; and, finally, making an effort to increase service-oriented positive interactions with police.Cordner, G. W. (2010). Community Policing Elements and Effects. In R. G. Dunham, & G. P. Alpert, Critical Issues in Policing (pp. 432-449). Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press Inc. Common methods of community-policing include: * Encouraging the community to help prevent crime by providing advice, giving talks at schools, encouraging neighborhood watch groups, and a variety of other techniques. * Increased use of foot or bicycle patrols. * Increased officer accountability to the communities they are supposed to serve. * Creating teams of officers to carry out community policing in designated neighborhoods. * Clear communication between the police and the communities about their objectives and strategies. * Partnerships with other organizations such as government agencies, community members, nonprofit service providers, private businesses and the media. * Decentralizing the police authority, allowing more discretion amongst lower-ranking officers, and more initiative expected from them. =Comparison with traditional policing= Although all societies incorporate some mechanisms of social control, \\"policing\\" as we understand it today is a very particular mechanism of control. \\"Traditional policing\\" is used to describe policing styles that were predominant before modern community policing movements, or in police forces which have not adopted them. The response-centred style has also been called \\"fire brigade policing\\" in the UK. In countries with a tradition of policing by consent, the term \\"traditional policing\\" can be misleading. In those cases, community policing could be seen as a restoration of an earlier ideology, which had been overshadowed by reactive policing after the rise of automobiles and telecommunications. The goal of traditional policing is to protect law-abiding citizens from criminals. As Jauregui argues, it reflects a \\"popular desire for justice and order through any means necessary.\\" They do this by identifying and apprehending criminals while gathering enough evidence to convict them. Traditional beat officers' focus on duty is to respond to incidents swiftly, and clear emergency calls as quickly as possible. Many officers working busy shifts only have time to respond to and clear emergency calls. This type of policing does not stop or reduce crime significantly; it is simply a temporary fix to a chronic problem where officers are often called to return to the same issue and individuals.More, Harry W. Special Topics in Policing. Cincinnati, OH: Anderson Pub., 1992. Print. In contrast, community policing's main goal is to assist the public in establishing and maintaining a safe, orderly social environment. While apprehending criminals is one important goal of community policing, it is not necessarily the most important goal. Community policing is concerned with solving the crimes that the community is concerned about by working with and gaining support from the community. The most effective solutions include dialogue between police, government resources, citizens, and local business to address the problems affecting the community.Bertus, Ferreira. The Use and Effectiveness of Community Policing in a Democracy. Prod. National Institute of Justice. Washington, D.C., 1996. Police communicate with the community in variety of ways, including polls or surveys, town meetings, call-in programs, and meetings with interest groups. They use these connections to understand what the community wants out of its police officers and what the community is willing to do to solve its crime problem. The structure of the community policing organization differs in that police assets are refocused with the goals of specific, written rules to give more creative problem-solving techniques to the police officer to provide alternatives to traditional law enforcement. = In Nordic countries and Camden, NJ = Journalist Ryan Cooper. described law enforcement in Nordic countries in terms that seem consistent with community policing. In 2013 the city of Camden, NJ, with support from the New Jersey state government, disbanded their city police and hired some of the officers back at lower pay into new Camden County Police Department, following examples in Nordic countries.. Camden had previously had appallingly high crime rates, which have reportedly declined dramatically since the change, presumably because more people are more likely to report crime and cooperate with law enforcement. = In high conflict zones like Afghanistan = D. Scott Mann,. retired U.S. Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel, claims that his troops made substantial progress against insurgents in places like Afghanistan and Columbia by embedding themselves in local, remote communities and working hard to actually protect the locals from insurgents. They were not resisted when they initially arrive, but they were also not initially welcomed. After locals saw Mann's special forces working to understand their concerns and bleeding with them during attacks by insurgents, the locals begin to trust Mann's special forces and provide information about the insurgents that helped reduce the level of violence and make law enforcement easier.. Community alienation The experience of community alienation among police officers is closely tied to the experience of mastery, the state of mind in which an individual feels autonomous and experiences confidence in their ability, skill, and knowledge to control or influence external events.Wilson, Leon, \\"Family structure and dynamics in the Caribbean,\\" Doctoral Dissertation, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor(1989): 1-187. Community policing requires departments to flatten their organizational pyramid and place even more decision-making and discretion in the hands of line officers. As the level of community alienation or isolation that officers experience increases, there will be a corresponding decrease in officers' sense of mastery in carrying out their expanded discretionary role. Second, a strong sense of community integration for police officers would seem to be vital to the core community policing focus of proactive law enforcement. Proactive enforcement is usually defined as the predisposition of police officers to be actively committed to crime prevention, community problem- solving, and a more open, dynamic quality-oriented law enforcement-community partnership.Taylor, R. and E. Fritsch, \\"Core challenges facing community policing: the emperor has no clothes,\\" Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences Today, May/June (1998): 1-5. A lack of community support resulted in an increased sense of alienation and a greater degree of apathy among police officers.Berg, Bruce, Marc Gertz, and Edmond True, \\"Police-community relations and alienation,\\" Police Chief, (Nov. 1984): 20-23King, Barbara, \\"Cops and compliance-gaining: A study of the organizational realities of two cities,\\" Doctoral Dissertation, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, (1995): 1-294Mottaz, Clifford, \\"Alienation among police officers,\\" Journal of Police Science and Administration, (Mar. 1983):23-30 A lack of community support and working in a larger populated community was associated with an increased sense of alienation and a greater degree of inactivity among police officers.Pogrebin, Mark, \\"Alienation among veteran police officers,\\" Police Chief (Feb. 1987): 38-42 An increased sense of alienation resulted in a greater degree of negative feelings and lethargy among police officers. The more police officers felt socially isolated from the community they served, the more they withdrew and the more negative they felt towards its citizens.Shernock, Stan, \\"An empirical examination of the relationship between police solidarity and community orientation,\\" Journal of Police Science and Administration (1988): 182-94, Evaluation Traditionally, determining whether police or policies are effective or not can be done by evaluating the crime rate for a geographic area. A crime rate in the United States is determined using the FBI's \\"Uniform Crime Reports\\" (UCR) or \\"National Incident-Based Reporting System\\" (NIBRS) as well as the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ \\"National Crime Victimization Survey\\" (NCVS). Community policing is more complicated than simply comparing crime rates and there is no universally-accepted criteria for evaluating community policing. However, there are some structures that are commonly used. One possible way to determine whether or not community policing is effective in an area is for officers and key members of the community to set a specific mission and goals when starting out. Once specific goals are set, participation at every level is essential in obtaining commitment and achieving goals. Street-level officers, supervisors, executives, and the entire community should feel the goals represent what they want their police department to accomplish. The U.S. federal government continues to provide support for incorporating community policing into local law enforcement practices through funding of research such as through the National Center for Community Policing at Michigan State University, small COPS grants to local agencies, and technical assistance. The Center For Evidence-Based Crime Policy in George Mason University identifies the following randomized controlled trials on community policing as very rigorous.  Criticisms  Criminologists have raised several concerns vis-a- vis community policing and its implementation. On the broadest conceptual level, many legal scholars have highlighted that the term \\"community,\\" at the heart of \\"community policing,\\" is in itself ambiguous. Without a universal definition of the word, it is difficult to define what \\"community policing\\" should look like. Others have remained skeptical of the political ambition behind community policing initiatives. For example, in 1984 Peter Waddington cautioned that the \\"largely uncritical acceptance with which [the notion of community policing] has been welcomed is itself a danger. Any proposal, however attractive, should be subjected to careful and skeptical scrutiny.\\" In particular, Waddington voiced concern that community policing was merely a restoration of the \\"bobby on the beat\\" concept, which had nostalgic appeal because it was less impersonal than the officer \\"flashing past\\" in a police car. He said that the former was a \\"romantic delusion\\", because \\"there was never a time when the police officer was everyone's friend, and there will never be such a time in the future.\\" He also believed that order could only be maintained by the community itself, and not by the police alone. Similarly, C. B. Klockars and David Bayley both argue that community policing is unlikely to bring fundamental change to how police officers work, with Klockars calling it \\"mainly a rhetorical device\\". Unlike Klockars, Steven Herbert believe that community policing is proposing a fundamental change to policing, but argues that it would be a difficult one to achieve. He argues the progressive and democratic ethos of shared governance inherent in community policing runs counter to central elements in police culture and more widespread understandings of crime and punishment. Charles P. McDowell argued in 1993 that because community policing was a radical departure from existing ideology, implementing it would take time. Yet another set of criticisms revolves around the potential efficacy of community policing. David Bayley has argued that enacting community policing policies may lead to a reduction in crime control effectiveness, maintenance of order in the face of violence, increase in bureaucratic and governmental power over community affairs, increases in unequal treatment, and an erosion of constitutional rights. According to Stenson, there is a major dilemma within community policing: when practicing community policing, police officers have the tendency of getting too involved with trying to institute \\"particularistic community normative standards\\". This in turn could be problematic, in that it could entice corruption or vigilantism.

He was sentenced to one year's probation and ordered to complete a mental health program for aggressive people, though there is no indication that he ever did so.Mass murderer was 'nut' who threatened to kill, The Union Democrat (November 10, 1992) In May 1992 Drake was evicted from his rental home by his landlord, Andrew Zatko, for not paying his rent for several months, whereupon his common-law wife left him, together with their infant daughter.Gunman kills six, wounds one, before turning gun on self, The Nevada Daily Mail (November 10, 1992) In a suicide note later found in his pocket Drake identified himself as Jesse Cole Younger, apparently in allusion to the outlaw and member of the Jesse James gang Cole Younger, and blamed those, who had become his first victims, for the estrangement from his girlfriend and daughter, writing \\"I Jesse Cole Younger killed 3 men because they took my wife, family and daughter from me.\\" Furthermore, he harshly criticized his parents and sister, holding them responsible for his troubles and stated that \\"I have been persecuted my whole life by people.\\" Drake ended his note with the words: \\"They refused to help.

Drake afterwards went to the home of another of Zatko's former tenants, 37-year-old Norman Metcalfe, who had testified against him at the court proceeding for his eviction and had further helped Zatko by removing Drake from his property. At 6:24 p.m., when Metcalfe came home accompanied by two other men, Drake killed him with a shot between the eyes. He also killed 32-year-old Danny Cizek and wounded Jeffrey Sidlin, 27, in the arm, during a struggle over his gun. About five hours later, Drake, having armed himself with a 12-gauge shotgun, drove to Oak's Card Parlor in Paso Robles where he had lost several hundred dollars and had been barred for troublemaking and cheating. He killed dealers David Law, 47, and Joe Garcia, 60, and also fatally wounded a customer, 31-year-old Kris Staub, while sparing others who begged for their lives. Finally he made his way to the home of 60-year-old Joanne Morrow - also a former landlord of his - in San Miguel, and, beating her with a blackjack and threatening to kill her, he took her hostage. At approximately 5 a.m. on November 8, the house being surrounded by police, Drake committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with his .32-caliber six-shot revolver.Gunman kills 6, self during rampage in 2 California towns, Houston Chronicle (November 9, 1992)Rampage ends with 7 deaths in Morro Bay, The Press-Courier (November 9, 1992) According to police, Drake had planned to kill two other people that day, his pastor and the day-care worker, an intent that was hampered by problems with his car. =Victims= * Danny Cizek, 32 * Joe Garcia, 60 * David Law, 47 * Norman Metcalfe, 37 * Kris Staub, 30 * Andrew Zatko, 80 See also * List of rampage killers in the United States References External links *Gunman Kills 6, Himself in Rampage, Los Angeles Times (November 9, 1992) *Killer of 6 Threatened Violence but Wasn't Believed, Police Say, Los Angeles Times (November 10, 1992) *Man Who Gunned Down 6 Had Troubled Background, Los Angeles Times (November 11, 1992) *A Story That Has No Moral, Los Angeles Times (November 15, 1992) *GUNMAN LEAVES 6 DEAD BEFORE TAKING OWN LIFE WELL-PLANNED SPREE CUTS SWATH IN 3 TOWNS, San Jose Mercury News (November 9, 1992) *Drake the Flake *Mother charged in death of 3-year-old daughter / Relatives say father's '92 slaying traumatized her, San Francisco Chronicle (April 11, 2002) Category:1949 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Actors from Norfolk, Virginia Category:American spree killers Category:American mass murderers Category:Murderers who committed suicide Category:Suicides by firearm in California Category:Murder–suicides in the United States Category:1992 in California Category:Mass murder in 1992 Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:1992 murders in the United States Category:Murder in California Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:Crimes in California Category:Attacks in the United States in 1992 ","title":"Lynwood Drake"},{"id":"32979418","text":"The Lives of Animals (1999) is a metafictional novella about animal rights by the South African novelist J. M. Coetzee, recipient of the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature.J. M. Coetzee, The Lives of Animals, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1999. The work is introduced by Amy Gutmann and followed by a collection of responses by Marjorie Garber, Peter Singer, Wendy Doniger and Barbara Smuts.Bernard E. Morris, Review of The Lives of Animals by J. M. Coetzee, Harvard Review, 18, Spring 2000, pp. 181–183. It was published by Princeton University Press as part of its Human Values series. The Lives of Animals consists of two chapters, \\"The Philosophers and the Animals\\" and \\"The Poets and the Animals,\\" first delivered by Coetzee as guest lectures at Princeton on 15 and 16 October 1997, part of the Tanner Lectures on Human Values.J. M. Coetzee, \\"The Lives of Animals\\" , The Tanner Lectures on Human Values, Princeton University, 15 and 16 October 1997. The Princeton lectures consisted of two short stories (the chapters of the book) featuring a recurring character, the Australian novelist Elizabeth Costello, Coetzee's alter ego. Costello is invited to give a guest lecture to the fictional Appleton College in Massachusetts, just as Coetzee is invited to Princeton, and chooses to discuss not literature, but animal rights, just as Coetzee does.Harold Fromm, \\"Review: Coetzee's Postmodern Animals\\", The Hudson Review, 52(2), Summer 2000 (pp. 336–344), p. 339. In having Costello deliver the arguments within his lectures, Coetzee plays with form and content, and leaves ambiguous to what extent the views are his own. The Lives of Animals appears again in Coetzee's novel Elizabeth Costello (2003).David Lodge, \\"Disturbing the Peace\\", The New York Review of Books, 20 November 2003. Coetzee's novella discusses the foundations of morality, the need of human beings to imitate one another, to want what others want, leading to violence and a parallel need to scapegoat non-humans. He appeals to an ethic of sympathy, not rationality, in our treatment of animals, to literature and the poets, not philosophy.Andy Lamey, \\"Sympathy and Scapegoating,\\" in Anton Leist, Peter Singer (eds.), J. M. Coetzee and Ethics: Philosophical Perspectives on Literature, Columbia University Press, 2013 (pp. 171–196), pp. 172–173, 179, 182. Costello tells her audience: \\"Sympathy has everything to do with the subject and little to do with the object ... There are people who have the capacity to imagine themselves as someone else, there are people who have no such capacity ... and there are people who have the capacity but choose not to exercise it. ... There are no bounds to the sympathetic imagination.\\"Coetzee 1997 , p. 133; Coetzee 1999, pp. 34–35. Synopsis =The Lives of Animals= Elizabeth Costello is invited to Appleton College's annual literary seminar as a guest lecturer, much as Coetzee was invited to Princeton. Despite her stature as a celebrated novelist (much like Coetzee), she opts not to give lectures on literature or writing, but on animal cruelty.John Rees Moore, \\"Review: Coetzee and the Precarious Lives of People and Animals\\", The Sewanee Review, 109(3), Summer 2001 (pp. 462–474), p. 470. Much like Coetzee, Costello is a vegetarian and abhors industries that experiment on and slaughter animals.Coetzee 1999, pp. 15-69. The story is framed by a narrative involving Costello and her son, John Bernard, who happens to be a junior professor at Appleton. Costello's relationship with Bernard is strained, and her relationship with John’s wife, Norma, even more so. Bernard was not instrumental in bringing his mother to campus. In fact, the university's leaders were unaware of Bernard's relationship with Costello when they issued the invitation. Bernard’s fears that his mother’s presence and opinions will be polarizing and controversial are entirely prophetic. In his private thoughts, he more than once wishes she had not accepted Appleton’s invitation.Coetzee 1999, pp. 16, 36-37, 38. Costello gives two lectures, then contributes to a debate with Appleton philosophy professor Thomas O’Hearne. \\"The Philosophers and the Animals\\" J. M. Coetzee received the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature and the 1983 and 1999 Booker Prize. Costello's first lecture begins with an analogy between the Holocaust and the exploitation of animals. Costello makes the point that, just as residents in the neighborhoods of the death camps knew what was happening at the camps, but chose to turn a blind eye, so it is common practice today for otherwise respectable members of society to turn a blind eye to industries that bring pain and death to animals. This turns out to be the most controversial thing that Costello says during her visit, and it causes a Jewish professor of the college to boycott the dinner held in her honor. In her first lecture, Costello also moves to reject reason as the preeminent quality that separates humans from animals and allows humans to treat animals as less than the equals of humans. She proposes that reason might simply be a species specific trait, \\"the specialism of a rather narrow self-regenerating intellectual tradition ... which for its own motives it tries to install at the center of the universe.\\"Coetzee 1999, p. 25. At the same time that Costello rejects reason as the premier human distinction, she also challenges the assumption that animals do not possess reason. Her argument rests on the fact that, while science cannot prove that animals do abstract thinking, it also cannot prove that they do not. In support of this argument, Costello summarizes an ape experiment that was conducted in the 1920s by Wolfgang Kohler. The principal player in the experiment was an ape named Sultan who was variously deprived of his bananas until he reasoned his way into obtaining them. Faced with the challenge of stacking several crates into a makeshift ladder, in order to reach the bananas that have been suspended above his reach, Sultan succeeds in demonstrating this elementary form of reasoning. What Costello objects to, however, is the basic inanity of the exercise which in no way explores any higher intellectual functions that Sultan might be capable of. The experiment, Costello objects, ignores any emotional hurt or confusion that the ape might be experiencing in favor of concentrating on what is, after all, a very elemental task. The ape might be thinking about the human who has constructed these tests: \\"What is wrong with him, what misconception does he have of me, that leads him to believe it is easier for me to reach a banana hanging from a wire than to pick up a banana from the floor?\\" Animal experiments, Costello concludes, fail to measure anything of real interest, because they ask the wrong questions and ignore the more interesting ones: \\"a carefully plotted psychological regimen conducts him [Sultan] away from ethics and metaphysics toward the humbler reaches of practical reason.\\"Coetzee 1999, pp. 28–29. \\"The Poets and the Animals\\" In her second lecture, Costello suggests that humans can come to understand or \\"think their way into\\" the nature of animals through poetic imagination. As examples, she invokes Rilke's \\"The Panther\\" and Ted Hughes's \\"The Jaguar\\" and \\"Second Glance at a Jaguar.\\"Moore 2001, p. 471. \\"By bodying forth the jaguar,\\" Costello says, \\"Hughes shows us that we too can embody animals – by the process called poetic invention that mingles breath and sense in a way that no one has explained and no one ever will.\\" Costello also takes issue with what she calls the \\"ecological vision\\" harbored by most environmental scientists, which values biological diversity and the overall health of an ecosystem above the individual animal. This is not a point of view shared by individual animals, all of whom will fight for their individual survival, she argues. \\"Every living creature fights for its own, individual life, refuses, by fighting, to accede to the idea that the salmon or the gnat is of a lower order of importance than the idea of the salmon or the idea of the gnat,\\" Costello explains.Coetzee 1999, pp. 53-54. The third organized event of Costello's visit is a debate of sorts with Appleton philosophy professor Thomas O'Hearne. O'Hearne begins the debate by proposing that the animal rights movement is a specifically \\"Western crusade\\" which arose in nineteenth- century Britain. Non-western cultures can, with justice, argue that their cultural and moral values are different and do not require them to observe the same respect for animals mandated by Western animals rights activists. To this assertion, Costello responds that \\"kindness to animals ... has been more widespread than you imply.\\" As an example of kindness to animals, she offers the keeping of pets, which is universal. And she notes that children enjoy a particular closeness to animals: \\"they have to be taught it is all right to kill and eat them.\\"Coetzee 1999, p. 61. Costello also proposes that industries that have been enacting animal cruelty for profit should have the greater role in atoning for that cruelty.Coetzee 1999, pp. 60-61. O'Hearne next puts forward the argument that animals do not perform abstract reasoning, as demonstrated by the failure of apes to acquire more than a basic level of language, and are therefore not entitled to the same rights as humans. In response, Costello more or less restates her skepticism about the value of animal experiments. She refers to such experiments as \\"profoundly anthropocentric\\" and \\"imbecile.\\" O'Hearne then proposes that animals do not understand death with the full consciousness of self with which humans regard death; therefore, to kill an animal quickly and painlessly is ethical.Coetzee 1999, pp. 62-64. O'Hearne's final point is that people cannot be friends with animals because we do not understand them. As an example, he uses the bat. \\"You can be friends neither with a Martian nor with a bat, for the simple reason that you have too little in common with them.\\"Coetzee 1999, p. 65. In her response, Costello equates the belief that animals are not entitled to equal rights, because they do not reason abstractly, with racism. Then she, once again, rejects reason as a valid basis for the animal rights argument, concluding that, if reason is all she shares with her philosophical opponents, then she has no use for it.Coetzee 1999, p. 67. =\\"Reflections\\"= Peter Singer Peter Singer MIT Veritas In responding to Coetzee's novella, the philosopher Peter Singer, author of Animal Liberation (1975), writes a somewhat mocking short story featuring himself as \\"Peter\\" in a conversation with his daughter Naomi over the breakfast table. The fictionalized Peter complains to Naomi that Coetzee hasn't really delivered a lecture on animals rights. Instead, Coetzee has, Peter asserts, hidden behind the veil of fiction and the alter ego of Elizabeth Costello and so has not fully committed himself to any particular animal rights platform.Coetzee 1999, p. 91. Singer uses his imagined narrative to take issue with Costello's equation of a human life with a bat life. The human life is clearly more important, Peter argues, because the human invests so fully in the future and because of the human's superior intelligence and what he can accomplish. Peter also says that Costello provides no valid argument against the painless killing of an animals, especially those of lower intelligence, like chickens and fish \\"who can feel pain but don't have any self-awareness or capacity for thinking about the future.\\" Coetzee 1999, pp. 89-90. Peter's most adamant complaint is the character's belief that she can \\"think [her] way into the existence of any being\\" using the same imaginative powers that she uses to create fictional characters.Coetzee 1999, p. 90. Naomi more or less ridicules that idea, claiming that it is relatively easy to imagine a fictional character, and that doing so has no real application to understanding animals. \\"If that's the best argument Coetzee can put up for his radical egalitarianism, you won't have any trouble showing how weak it is,\\" Naomi concludes. She goes on to suggest that Peter use the same fictional narrative device to respond to the Costello lecture. \\"Me? When have I ever written fiction?\\" Peter asks, concluding the reflection. Marjorie Garber, Wendy Doniger Marjorie Garber reflects on how Coetzee's novella relates to her study of academic disciplines. Wendy Doniger takes as her starting point O'Hearne's contention that compassion for animals is a Western invention originating in the nineteenth century. She talks about the Hindu prohibition on harming animals and argues that compassion for animals can be found in many non-Western cultures throughout history. Barbara Smuts Anthropologist and University of Michigan professor Barbara Smuts takes as her starting point the near absence of any loving relationships between people and animals in Coetzee's novella. Smuts starts her reflection noting that, as a lonely old woman, Costello is likely to live with cats. But Costello never mentions any personal relationship with animals.Coetzee, 1999, pp. 107-108. As a scientist, Smuts, at one point in her work, followed a group of baboons with whom she effectively lived as an equal. What she found was that she learned a great deal from the specialized knowledge of the animals. Specifically, they taught her how to find her way through the jungle without running amok of \\"poisonous snakes, irascible buffalo, aggressive bees, and leg-breaking pig-holes.\\"Coetzee 1999, p. 109. She found that, in general, apes lead rich social and even emotional lives. As an example, she tells the story of visiting gorilla scientist Dian Fossey, and being hugged by a teenage gorilla. When she returned to civilization, Smuts adopted a rescue dog whom she named Safi. As an experiment, Smuts refrained from any traditional training of her animals, preferring to talk to her dog and make accommodations. She allows her dog the free use of its own toys, and her dog guards her when she takes a nap in the woods. In this way, Smuts tactfully builds on Costello's assertion that animals might be capable of more than we have traditionally assumed: \\"treating members of other species as persons, as beings with potential far beyond our normal expectations, will bring out the best in them, and ... each animal's best includes unforeseeable gifts.\\"Coetzee 1999, p. 120. Smuts' gentle contention is that people can learn more about animals from entering into real, personal relationships with them than from poeticizing or philosophizing about them. Genre The Lives of Animals straddles the boundary between essay and fiction. Bernard Morris, writing in the Harvard Review, called it \\"part fiction, part philosophical discourse, wholly human and absorbing.\\" Though the novella centers on the character Elizabeth Costello, much of the narrative is taken up with her lectures about cruelty to animals. Also making the book difficult to classify is its mixture of fiction, science and essay writing. While the contributions of Coetzee and Singer could be called short stories, Garber's contribution would more properly be called a scholarly article and Smuts' article, while grounded in her scientific studies, is mostly autobiographical and anecdotal.

Confucius himself and some of his disciples are buried there, as well as many thousands of his descendants. Since 1994, the Cemetery of Confucius has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Temple and Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu\\". The two other components of the site are the Temple of Confucius dedicated to the memory of the philosopher and the Kong Family Mansion, where his descendants lived. The three sites are collectively known in Qufu as San Kong (), i.e. \\"The Three Confucian [sites]\\". History In 1331 construction work began on the wall and gate of the cemetery. In total, the cemetery has undergone 13 renovations and extensions. Eventually, by the late 18th century, the perimeter wall reached a length of , enclosing an area of . In this space, the tombs of more than 100,000 descendants of Confucius, who have been buried there over a period of about 2,000 years, can be found. The oldest graves date back to the Zhou Dynasty, the most recent of which belong to descendants in the 76th and 78th generation. The cemetery suffered serious damage in November 1966, during the Cultural Revolution, when it was visited and vandalized by a team of Red Guards from Beijing Normal University, led by Tan Houlan.Asiaweek, Volume 10 The corpse of the 76th-generation Duke Yansheng was removed from its grave and hung naked from a tree in front of the palace during the desecration of the cemetery in the Cultural Revolution. Layout Spirit way of Kong Yanjin (59th generation Duke Yansheng) Spirit way of Kong Chengqing (60th generation) Spirit way of Kong Hongxu (61st generation) Spirit way of Kong Hongtai (61st generation) The Cemetery of Confucius is located north of the historic walled city of Qufu, about two kilometers north of the Temple and Mansion of Confucius (which are in the south-central part of the walled city), and 1.5 km north of the Temple of Yan Hui, dedicated to the sage's favorite student (which is just inside the northern gates of the city wall). The main north-central axis of the walled city, Gulou Jie (\\"Drum Tower Avenue\\"), becomes Beiguan Jie (\\"North Gate Avenue\\") after passing through the north gate of the city wall. The avenue runs north for 1266 m as a wide boulevard decorated with the Wan gu chang chun () memorial arch and lined by cypresses and pine trees, finally arriving at the main (southern) gates of the cemetery.第三十二篇文物名胜 - 第一章孔孟古迹 - 第三节林墓 - 孔林 The cemetery occupies 183.33 hectares, and is surrounded by a perimeter wall 5,591 m long. The oldest graves found in this location date back to the Zhou Dynasty. The original tomb erected here in memory of Confucius on the bank of the Sishui River had the shape of an axe. In addition, it had a brick platform for sacrifices. The present-day tomb is a cone-shaped hill. Tombs for the descendants of Confucius and additional stelae to commemorate him were soon added around Confucius' tomb. Since Confucius' descendants were conferred noble titles (Duke Yansheng) and were given imperial princesses as wives, many of the tombs in the cemetery show the status symbols of noblemen. Tombstones came in use during the Han Dynasty. Today, there are over three thousand stone tablets (mostly, tombstones) dating from China's imperial period still standing in the cemetery. According to an official count, among them there are 22 tablets from the Song Dynasty, six from Jin, 45 from Yuan, 506 from Ming and 2626 from Qing still standing in the cemetery. There are also 568 tablets from the Republic of China period and 50 modern (PRC-era) tablets, as well as 180 tablets whose age cannot be determined; this brings the total to 4003.孔林 - 石刻 (Kong Lin - sculptures) The Ming burials are primarily found in the western part of the cemetery, and those from the Qing era, in the eastern part. In the Ming section, particularly notable is a comparatively small area located about 1 km to the northwest of the Tomb of Confucius, where about a dozen of Dukes of Yansheng, from the 55th to the 64th generation, have been buried. The dukes' tomb sites in this area are arranged more or less chronologically in rows from the south to the north, and, within each row, from the east of the west. Each duke has his own spirit way, oriented from the south to the north, which typically includes (in the south-to-north order) the following sculptures: three pairs of animals (felines, sometimes winged; rams; horses); a memorial arch; a bixi with a stele; two guardian figures (a warrior on the west side of the path, and a civil official on the east side); and a stele in front of the small tumulus under which the duke is buried.孔林 - 墓葬 - 第二辑 嫡孙墓 (Kong Lin - Burials - [Confucius'] Main-line descendants), and the entries about individual graves.

He is primarily known for his defense and pitch-calling; he won a Gold Glove Award in 2017. Professional career =Anaheim/Los Angeles Angels= Maldonado was drafted by the Anaheim Angels in the 27th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. He played his first professional season for the rookie-level Arizona League Angels that season, and batted .217/.277/.233. In 2005, he again played for Arizona and the rookie-level Orem Owlz. After he played one more season for the Arizona Angels in 2006, in which he batted .222/.329/.270, he was released. =Milwaukee Brewers= In 2007, Maldonado signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers and played for the West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic League, and batted .221/.309/.288.

Biography Rogers was born at Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1903. His father was Elmer J. Rogers Sr., the president of the Standard Piston Ring Company, and his mother was Matilda Martell Rogers, a housewife. General Rogers was the oldest of three children, followed by a brother, Emeric, who became a firefighter in Quincy, Massachusetts, and a sister, Barbara, who graduated from the Brigham & Women's Hospital nursing program and then became a home care nurse in Connecticut. After graduating as class valedictorian from high school in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1920, he attended the Emerson Institute and later studied at Harvard University. He was fluent in French and German at this time. Appointed a flying cadet in March 1924, Rogers entered Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, graduated from Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, Texas, on March 14, 1925, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Service Reserve. On June 30, 1926, he received his regular commission as a second lieutenant of Air Corps. With permission from the U.S. Army-Air Force, Rogers flew a plane for stunt shots in Wings (1927 film). The scene called for him to do some loops, and then pose after a crash as if dying, complete with blood dripping down his face, from his nose and mouth. Assigned as a squadron adjutant, a year later Rogers became a flying instructor at Brooks and Kelly fields, successively. Entering the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field, Ill., in September 1932. He graduated the following June. He acquired the moniker of \\"Rod\\" due to the rod- shaped control stick of the planes he learned to fly. It had nothing to do with his surname, which had no \\"d\\" in it. Going to Hawaii, Rogers served with the Fourth Observation Squadron at Luke Field, and in June 1935 was transferred to the 18th Composite Ting at Fort Shafter. The following April he went to Barksdale Field, Louisiana, for duty with the Third Attack Group. Graduating from the Air Corps Tactical School in 1939, Rogers was assigned as an instructor with the Georgia National Guard. Joining the War Department General Staff in August 1941, he was appointed a courier of the Combined Subject Section of the Strategy and Policy Group, War Plans Division, later becoming chief of the section. In January 1943, he moved to Tampa, Florida, as deputy chief of staff of the Third Air Force. The following August, Rogers assumed command of the 465th Bomb Group at McCook Field, Neb., taking it to the Mediterranean Theater in February 1944. On March 2, he was wounded in action and hospitalized. Released from the hospital on May 14, 1944, the general was named commanding officer of the 97th Bomb Group in that theater. In August, he became deputy assistant chief of staff for operations of the l5th Air Force, and two months later was appointed assistant chief of staff for operations of the Mediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force. This latter assignment was in addition to a corresponding position he already occupied in the 15th Air Force. In June 1945, Rogers became the chief of Staff of the 15th Air force and assumed command of that organization September 1, 1945. During World War II, his fluency in French and German was of great use to him, as he fought in the European Theater of Operations. He would get up at 3 a.m., hear Hitler screaming on the radio that the Nazis would “get that Colonel Rogers” (Hitler actually knew his name!), and then fly off to bomb the Ploiești oil field in Romania, which supplied the Nazi Panzerwaffe tanks. It was on the return from one of these bombing runs that he and his crew of 9 plus an engineer were shot down over the east coast of Italy. A British motorboat picked them up - and he was the last person to be fished out of the water. Then-Colonel Rogers's right foot had been shot through, but he recovered and continued to fight. Returning to the United States, Rogers joined the Air Force headquarters at Washington, D.C., in December 1945 as chief of the Policy Division in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Plans. Entering the National War College at Washington, D.C., in August 1947, he graduated the next June and was assigned to the Alaskan Command at Fort Richardson, Alaska, to become director of plans and operations. Hospitalized in November 1948, Rogers returned the following May to the Alaskan Command in the same capacity, remaining there until December 1950. In December, the general became the Air Force member on the Joint Strategic Survey Committee, Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington, D.C. In September 1953, Rogers was appointed operations officer of the Far East Command at Tokyo, Japan, and on July 15, 1954, was named deputy chief of staff for plans of the Far East Command. He was designated chief of staff, Far East Command, and United Nations Command, on April 26, 1955. Following that assignment, Rogers was appointed Inspector General of the Air Force, Washington, D.C., in July 1956. His next post was as the United States representative to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) in Turkey, from 1959 until his retirement in 1962. His decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, and European Theater Medal with eight battle stars. His foreign decorations include the Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, Croix de Guerre with Palm (French), Pilots Citation, Royal Yugoslavian Air Force, the Order of the White Elephant, 2nd Class (Thailand), the Ulchi Distinguished Military Service Medal with Gold Star (Republic of Korea), the Order of the Rising Sun (Japan), and the Military Order of Taeguk (Korea). These later two decorations are still subject to Congressional approval. He was rated a command pilot, combat and aircraft observer. Personal life General Rogers was married twice. He had two daughters, Gloria and Judith, with his first wife, Dorothy, and the couple divorced. Gloria married Gene Davies. They had seven daughters and three sons. The couple worked in real estate. Judith was a member of the ballet company at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City for several years before marrying Richard Hauser and having 4 daughters with him. His second wife, Wilma Rebecca Hague, was a colonel in the Women's Army Corps. They were stationed together in Japan, where they met Kazuko Sawaji, who became their ward when their time in Japan was up. Later, when the couple retired and lived in Falls Church, Virginia, they put Kazuko through the interior design program at Marymount University.

The employee badges were from a little-known security company named Special Interventions Group (SIG) which is owned by and mostly staffed by Norwegians .

During a raid on French and Moland's apartment, authorities also confiscated at least one rifle and a camera containing images of French and Moland on their recent travels in Africa. In one image, believed to have been taken by French, Moland is seen smiling as he washes what is alleged to be the blood of Abedi Kasongo from the inside of their car. French and Moland have said that Kasongo was murdered by gunmen who attacked them on a road. Two witnesses, Gina Kepo Aila and Kasimu Aradjabo, said they were both present during the killing. Both told the court that Moland shot Abedi Kasongo, while French threw himself over Gina Kepo Aila, whom he tried to kill. According to both witnesses, several shots were fired, most probably three. Verdict On September 8, 2009, French and Moland were found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death. Along with the death sentence for both, the tribunal ordered the Norwegian government to pay a US$1 compensation to each Congolese citizen, an amount Judge Claude Disimo, head of the military tribunal, said totals more than US$60 million.Norwegians to die for Congo spying, The Daily Nation, September 8, 2009.

Initially the Congolese claims of compensation had amounted to more than US$500 billion. The men appealed their conviction on September 9, 2009. According to Judge Claude Disimo, they will not be extradited back to Norway. On April 22, 2010, the BBC reported that the convictions of French and Moland were overturned on the basis of flawed procedures at their military tribunal. A new trial with different judges found them guilty of murder and espionage on June 10, 2010. They were again sentenced to death and the Norwegian State was ordered to pay $65m. Although it remains on the statute books, the death penalty is currently not applied in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported a former political advisor to the UN peace mission to the Congo (MONUC) as saying that it appeared evidence existed for the charges and that the trial was procedurally correct. However, she was also quoted as saying that since the rule of law in the country leaves much to be desired, the verdict should be \\"taken with a grain of salt\\".\\"Rättsprocessen mot norrmännen gick rätt till\\", Dagens Nyheter, September 9, 2009.

Second expedition Following the fall of Khartoum, Graham led a second expedition in March 1885. This expedition is sometimes referred to as the Suakin Field Force. Its purpose was to clear Mahdist forces under Osman Digna from the region, and to supervise and protect the construction of the Suakin-Berber Railway.

The force was later joined by the New South Wales Contingent, which arrived at Suakin on 29 March. However, within two months the Gladstone government decided to abandon both the railway and its military campaign in Sudan. General Graham and his Suakin Field Force were evacuated from the port city on 17 May 1885.

It is an adaptation of the 1962 novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac. The story is based on the time Kerouac spent in Big Sur, California, and his three brief sojourns to his friend Lawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in Bixby Canyon. These trips were taken by Kerouac in an attempt to recuperate from his mental and physical deterioration due to his alcoholism and the pressures of his sudden success. The film debuted on January 23, 2013, at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it received generally positive reviews. The film received a limited theatrical release in the United States on November 1, 2013. Plot Jack Kerouac, coming off the recent success of On the Road, is unable to cope with a suddenly demanding public and his rise in popularity, and begins battling with advanced alcoholism as a result. He seeks respite first in solitude in the Big Sur cabin, then in a relationship with Billie, the mistress of his long-time friend Neal Cassady. Kerouac finds respite in the Big Sur wilderness, but is driven by loneliness to return to the city, and resumes drinking heavily. Across Kerouac's subsequent trips to Big Sur and interleaved lifestyle in San Francisco, he drunkenly embarrasses Cassady by introducing Billie to Cassady's wife Carolyn, cannot emotionally provide for the increasingly demanding Billie, and finds himself increasingly unable to integrate into suburban life. Kerouac's inner turmoil culminates in his nervous breakdown during his third journey to Big Sur. Cast Unlike the novel, which uses pseudonyms for every major character, the film uses their real names (with the exception of Billie, whose real name is Jackie Gibson Mercer). Also, a few major characters from the novel, such as Allen Ginsberg, Robert LaVigne, Albert Saijo, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, were cut from the film. * Jean-Marc Barr as Jack Kerouac * Josh Lucas as Neal Cassady * Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Cassady * Anthony Edwards as Lawrence Ferlinghetti * Stana Katic as Lenore Kandel * Balthazar Getty as Michael McClure * Kate Bosworth as Willamine \\"Billie\\" Dabney * Henry Thomas as Philip Whalen * Patrick Fischler as Lew Welch * Jason W.

A history of the British sea-anemones and corals. Retrieved 2011-09-04. Description The base of S. ichthystoma is usually found adhering to rocks or shells and is no wider than the column. This is cylindrical, purplish-red, and about as long as it is wide, covered with corrugations but without warts. It can retract into a nipple-shaped button. The disc is fawn and is slightly concave with an enlarged margin and clearly marked, black radii. The tentacles are translucent white with black and grey bands. They are small and conical and set in three rows which are positioned very close to the margin. The mouth is on a raised mound and the scarlet lips are wrinkled and swollen. Distribution and habitat S. ichthystoma is found in the English Channel. The two specimens first described by Philip Henry Gosse in 1858 were found at Weymouth and Torquay, England, the first one growing on an oyster shell. Biology Like other sea anemones, S. ichthystoma is carnivorous and feeds on small invertebrates which it catches with its tentacles and channels into its mouth. If disturbed, it can emit sticky threads called acontia, armed with nematocysts, as a defence mechanism.

Women's rights were expanded through constitutional and legal changes during the 1990s. Cultural attitudes towards many areas of women's lives are also changing. Yet Paraguayan women still face many challenges in trying to attain social equality and their status in society. The legal and government institutions that currently exist in Paraguay were developed in part through the efforts of feminist organizations in the country that held significant awareness-raising campaigns during the 1990s to formalize the guarantees of women's rights. The 1992 Constitution of Paraguay upholds the principle of equality for all individuals and prohibits discrimination. However, socio-cultural practices still support discrimination against women in some areas. Education Illiteracy rates for women in Paraguay are higher than those of men, although this is a much more pronounced difference for older generations. The gender gap in education has decreased in recent years. Among youth aged 15 to 24 years, the literacy rate is 99% for both males and females. Young people of both sexes begin dropping out of the education system at significant rates following primary levels, however, and are unlikely to pursue education beyond the secondary level. As of 2010, of the population 15 and over, 92.9% of women and 94.8% of men were literate.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/fields/2103.html Employment A woman shopkeeper in Paraguay. Women's salaries in relation to men's are the second-lowest in Latin America. This is despite the fact that women make up 74% of Paraguay's labour force. Discrimination against women in the workplace, as well as sexual harassment on the job, are common in Paraguay. The Labor Code prohibits, but does not criminalize, discrimination or harassment on the basis of sex. Complaints are generally settled privately. The Secretariat of Women's Affairs occasionally operates programs supporting women's access to employment, social security, housing, land ownership and business opportunities. Marriage Early marriage is common in Paraguay. A 2004 United Nations report estimated that 17 percent of girls between 15 and 19 years of age were married, divorced or widowed. The legal age for marriage in Paraguay is 16. Divorce Divorce was legalized in Paraguay in 1991.Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies, by Mala Htun, pp 102 Paraguay was one of the last countries to legalize divorce, both in the world and in Latin America: divorce was also legalized in 1991 in Colombia;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-19390164 across Latin America it was only Chile that had not legalized it by that time, subsequently doing so in 2004.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4021427.stm The legalization of divorce in Paraguay had been strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church, a powerful force in Paraguayan society since European colonization. Divorce rates in Paraguay remain well below worldwide averages, and are the lowest in Latin America. Maternity An indigenous woman and child. Fertility rates are higher in rural areas and among indigenous women. Fertility rates in Paraguay were historically high relative to other countries in the Latin American region. This has changed since the 1990s, and fertility has recently declined significantly. In 2004 the fertility rate was estimated at 2.9. Research has found that births before marriage are common in Paraguay, although like the fertility rate overall, this phenomenon is decreasing. One study established that birth rates before a first marriage were 23, 24, and 21 percent, based on 2004, 1998, and 1995–96 data. The maternal mortality rate in Paraguay is 99 deaths/100,000 live births (as of 2010).https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/rankorder/2223rank.html Sexuality and birth control As the cultural influence of the Roman Catholic Church declines in Paraguay, attitudes towards women's sexuality and the use of birth control are changing. The use of modern contraceptive methods, such as birth control pills, condoms and IUDs, increased from a rate of 43% in 1996 to more than 60% by 2004. Adultery was decriminalized in 1990.http://www.ultimahora.com/nuevo-codigo- elimino-delitos-machistas-y-discriminatorios-n212137.html The HIV/AIDS rate is 0.3% for adults (aged 15–49), as of 2012 estimates.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html Abortion remains illegal in Paraguay, with exceptional cases where it can be demonstrated that the life of the mother is in danger. Financial matters Agriculture is a significant component of Paraguay's economy and an important source of income, with approximately 45% of Paraguay's workforce being employed in agriculture. Access to land ownership has been problematic for women in Paraguay, however. There are no legal restrictions on female land ownership, yet women are half as likely as men to be approved for loans to buy land. The 2002 Agrarian Act includes provisions intended to strengthen women's rights in this regard. Politics Gloria Rubìn, Paraguay's Minister of the Women's Secretariat, supports reforms that improve women's rights. Women in Paraguay have no legal restrictions on holding political office. Women have served in the government as members of the Congress (as National Deputies and as Senators), as governors, as heads of ministries, and there has been one female Supreme Court judge. They are underrepresented in comparison to male members of the government, however, and even relative to the rates of female representation in the governments of other countries of Latin America. Indeed, Paraguay has one of the lowest percentage of women in parliament in Latin America, significantly lower than neighboring Argentina and Bolivia, although higher than Brazil.http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm Violence against women =Domestic violence= Domestic abuse is very common in Paraguay. The legal response of Paraguay to domestic violence has been very weak, even by The Latin American standards. Although Paraguay enacted in 2000 Law No. 1,600 Against Domestic Violence (Ley No 1.600 contra la Violencia Doméstica), this law - while having a broad definition of domestic violence (including physical, psychological and sexual abuse \\"lesiones, maltratos físicos, psíquicos o sexuales\\" http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/paraguay.dv.00.htm) - is civil in nature, and as such does not provide for any sanctions against the perpetrators. While the Criminal Code provides for a crime of domestic violence, this crime has a very narrow definition, as physical violence that is carried out habitually, and is punishable only by a fine.http://www.refworld.org/docid/42df61652.htmlhttp://www.eurasiareview.com/07072011-paraguay- makes-step-forward-for-women%E2%80%99s-and-indigenous-rights-analysis/ As of 2014, there have been increasing calls, from both inside and outside of the country, for the enactment of a comprehensive law against violence against women.http://www.decidamos.org.py/www/index.php?option=com_k2&view;=item&id;=1705:10-razones- por-las-que-paraguay-necesita-una-ley-integral-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las- mujeres&Itemid;=1http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/136-secretaria-de- genero/609http://noticias.lainformacion.com/politica/derechos- humanos/paraguay-requiere-ley-contra-violencia-de-genero-dice-representante- de-onu_StZtbOZvhADLnLJA5rcFN6/http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/a-paraguay-le- urge-una-ley-contra-violencia-de- generohttp://www.paraguay.com/nacionales/reclaman-ley-integral-contra-la- violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-99037http://www.abc.com.py/especiales/fin-de- semana/un-salto-legal-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-1303660.html =Human trafficking= Human trafficking for the purposes of forcing young women into prostitution is an entrenched problem. In recent years, human trafficking networks organized by Taiwanese and Chinese nationals have been broken up by Paraguayan law enforcement, with Paraguayan women being trafficked to Brazil, Argentina, or Spain to work in brothels. There are no precise estimates of the number of women who are victims of human trafficking, but anecdotal estimates are that several hundred Paraguayan women are smuggled out of the country annually. Underage girls are also trafficked within Paraguay and to neighbouring countries to be forced to work as domestic servants. Women's rights history in Paraguay The movement to expand women's rights in Paraguay grew significantly in the 1920s, in large part through the work of María Felicidad González, who represented her country at a feminist conference in Baltimore, in 1922. One year earlier, on April 26, 1921, she opened the Centro Femenino del Paraguay (CFP) (Women's Centre of Paraguay). Influenced by women's rights movements in North America and Europe, Paraguayan women also began to mobilize and claim their rights. During this period, feminism was associated with the Revolutionary Febrerista Party. = Paraguayan Women's Union = In 1936, during the Revolution of February 17, 1936, the Unión Femenina del Paraguay (UFP) (Paraguayan Women's Union) was created. It was founded on April 26, 15 years after the founding of the Women's Centre of Paraguay, at a meeting that took place at the Colegio Nacional de la Capital, in Asunción. The first president of the Union was Maria F. de Casati. The Union, in addition to its feminist cause, was openly socialist and part of the wider changes resulting from the Revolution of February 17, 1936. In fact, María F. de Casati stated: Among the participants in the Union were Elena Freis de Barthe, Lorenza C. de Gaona, and Luisa vda. de Felip. The Union published a periodical called Por la Mujer (For Women), which was the first feminist periodical in Paraguay. Among other causes, it promoted women's suffrage and equality of the sexes. The Union held meetings in the capitol and throughout Paraguay to raise awareness among women about their rights. Ties were strengthened with other feminist groups in the Americas, including: Asociación Argentina Pro-Sufragio Femenino, the Confederación Femenina de la Paz Americana, Liga Femenina Pro-Union Americana, the Asociación Argentina Pro Paz, and the Asociación Cristiana Femenina. In 1937, with the fall of the government that came into power following the Revolution of February 17, 1936, the Union was forced to disband, leaving the women's rights movement without an organization. = Women's Democratic Union = After passing several years between 1940 and 1945 without a women's rights organization, the Unión Democrática de Mujeres (UDM) (Women's Democratic Union) was founded on December 19, 1946. It grew out of the Agrupación de Mujeres Febrerista Residentes en Montevideo (AMFRM) (Association of Febrerista Women Living in Montevideo), which was connected to the Concentración Revolucionaria Febrerista, a Febrerista exile group based out of Montevideo, Uruguay. The founders of this group included Carmen Soler, Esther Ballestrino, Lilia Freis, and several others. This group was forced to disband following the Paraguayan Civil War in 1947. = Febrerista Women's Emancipation Movement = The Movimiento Femenino Febrerista de Emancipación (MFFE) (Febrerista Women's Emancipation Movement) was founded in 1949, and it was the successor organization to the Agrupación de Mujeres Febreristas Residentes en Montevideo. It published a periodical, Correspondencia. The MFFE remained associated with the Concentración Revolucionaria Febrerista group. In 1951, the Febrerista Revolutionary Party was founded, and the MFFE was integrated with it. Women's suffrage was gained in Paraguay in 1961, primarily because the strongarm president, Alfredo Stroessner, lacking the approval of his male constituents, sought to bolster his support through women voters. = Current feminist organizations = In recent years, almost all major political parties in Paraguay have included groups focussed on women's rights issues. Many members of these groups were part of the Mujeres por la Alianza (Women for the Alliance) movement that supported the candidacy of Fernando Lugo, on April 20, 2008.Mujeres por la Alianza  Bibliography  Juan Speratti: Feminismo, Editorial Litocolor, Asunción, 1989  References   External links  *Characteristics of typical Paraguayan woman Paraguay ","title":"Women in Paraguay"},{"id":"32979900","text":"Location of Wayne County in West Virginia This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Wayne County, West Virginia.

At its centre is a building called Attenborough Nature Centre, comprising visitor services and educational facilities. History The site was used as gravel pits between 1929 and 1967, and is still owned by CEMEX, the gravel extraction company, who continue to extract sand and gravel from neighbouring areas. Working gravel barges still pass through the site. As sections of the site are worked out they are restored as wetland. In 2010 an area known as Thrumpton's Land was restored in this way.Cemex communities website: Thrumpton's Land accessed 18 Mar 2012 The reserve was established at the completion of an earlier phase of workings in 1966 and was opened by the naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. In late 2019, the owners announced their desire to sell the site, and an appeal backed by Sir David Attenborough, whose family traditionally hail from the area, was launched to raise one million pounds needed to enable transfer of ownership to Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, which had helped to maintain the site with the owners for 60 years.Sir David Attenborough backs £1m nature reserve appeal BBC News Nottingham, 25 November 2019.

He was deputy commander in chief, U.S. Readiness Command, with headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. Biography Born on July 6, 1919 in Detroit, Michigan, Marshall began his military career as an aviation cadet in 1942. He completed flight training at Yuma Army Air Base, Arizona, and received his pilot wings and commission as a second lieutenant in April 1943. Assigned to Las Vegas Army Air Field, Nevada, now Nellis Air Force Base, he began as a pilot with the 326th Fighter Gunnery Training Group before becoming chief of the P-39 Training Section there. In February 1945 he went to the Panama Canal Zone as a pilot with the 28th Fighter Squadron and as operations officer of the 32rd Fighter Squadron, later redesignated the 23rd Fighter Squadron, 36th Fighter Group. In July 1947, he was transferred to Dow Field, Maine, as operations officer of the 48th Fighter Squadron, 14th Fighter Group, the first squadron to be assigned the F-84 Thunderjet, and participated in service testing the F-84 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. He entered the Air Tactical School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, in August 1948 and four months later became operations officer of the 84th Fighter Squadron at Hamilton Air Force Base, Calif. In May 1951, Marshall went to Korea as commander of the 335th Fighter Squadron, flying the F-86 Sabre jet fighter. He became the fifth jet ace of the Korean War, credited with 6 1/2 enemy aircraft destroyed, seven probable, and six damaged. In January 1952, he returned to the United States to command the 93d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. He was assigned as commander of the 15th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, in July 1953. There he was credited with saving a Strategic Air Command B-47 bomber which was on fire at the end of a runway. Seeing no crash or fire-fighting equipment coming, and noting that the crew had escaped, he taxied his F-86 to the burning aircraft and blew out the fire with his jet exhaust. For this action, he was named to the Strategic Air Command's Heads-Up Club. He flew in the 1953 Bendix transcontinental air race and captained the Central Air Defense Force Team in the 1953 and 1954 Air Defense Command Weapons Meet. In July 1954, Marshall became chief of the Central Air Defense Force Tactical Evaluation Board at Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base, Missouri, where he established the first tactical evaluation system in the Air Defense Command; developed the first wind-driven tow reel target system; and headed a team of military and civilian technicians that extended radar search capability (later known as the Marshall fix) of fighter-interceptor aircraft from 30 to 200 miles. In 1957, he was chief of the Central Air Defense Force Bendix Trophy Race Team flying the F-102 Delta Dagger, with his team taking first and second place. He entered the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, in 1958, and on graduation was assigned to the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing in France as deputy commander for operations. The wing was transferred to Spangdahlem, Germany, where he was instrumental in getting the first strobe light landing system on an operational military base in Europe. In January 1961, he assumed command of NATO's Allied Defense Sector in the 86th Air Division at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. There he was credited with the development of an open-loop combat air defense communications network providing an immediate reaction system to cope with the East German and Czechoslovakian MiG threat. He also played a key role in the programming and installation of the 412-L Semi-automatic Air Defense System linking the 86th Air Division and the U.S. Army surface-to-air missile system. In June 1964, Marshall went to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., to serve in the Directorate of Operations successively as deputy chief and chief of the Air Defense Division, and as deputy director for forces. In June 1966, he moved to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director of operations, J-3, in the National Military Command Center, and in July 1967 became chief of the European Division, Directorate of Plans, J-5. In May 1968, he was assigned as chief of staff, Allied Air Forces Southern Europe in Naples, Italy, and in September 1969 became director of plans, J-5, U.S. European Command, at Vaihingen, Germany. He went from there to Vietnam in September 1971 as vice commander of the Seventh Air Force at Tan Son Nhut Airfield. The following September, he moved to Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, as deputy chief of staff, plans, and in December 1973 became deputy chief of staff, plans and operations. He was appointed vice commander in chief, Pacific Air Forces, in September 1974, transferring to his present assignment in June 1975.

It started from the mouth of the Bojana, the Skadar port, (alternatively Bar then Cetinje) along the Drin Valley to Prizren, then to Lipljan, then through Novo Brdo to Vranje and Niš. The Republic of Venice and Ragusa used the road for trade with Serbia and Bulgaria. From Niš, the ancient Roman road of Via Militaris continued all the way to Constantinople. The road ended its use with the Ottoman conquest of this part of Serbia by 1392, after the earlier Ottoman conquest of the southern provinces of Macedonia (1371), the Ottomans having begun their European conquest at Gallipoli (1354). The Venetian traders, who were the most frequent users of the road, used it for export of wheat, animals, silver and grape from Serbia and Bulgaria to Italy. It was among the most important communication links of Ragusa and its hinterland. The other road connecting hinterland Serbia with the Adriatic was that from Niš, through the mining province of Kopaonik, to Via Drine. Two other [smaller] roads went through Bosnia to the northeast: one was Via Narenta, traversing the canyons of the Neretva, and the other was Via Argentaria, that connected Split with the silver mines of Ilidža and Srebrenica and in turn Sremska Mitrovica in the north. It had an important cultural role as in connecting the hinterlands with the Adriatic cities which also had a Latin population, and Venice.

It was also released as a single as the B-side of \\"Surrender\\". Since its original release, it has also been released by Cheap Trick on several live and compilation albums, including Budokan II; Sex, America, Cheap Trick; The Essential Cheap Trick, and the 30th Anniversary Edition of Cheap Trick at Budokan, which also includes a DVD with a video performance of the song. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as one of the peaks of Heaven Tonight and as one of Cheap Trick's \\"stone- cold classics.\\" It has often been used by the band to close their concerts. Since its original release, it has been covered by Anthrax, Cell, John Easdale, and Steel Pole Bath Tub. The subject of the song is suicide and is one of two suicide themed songs on Heaven Tonight, the other being the title track. However, different commentators have different views of the Cheap Trick's attitude towards the subject matter. Mitchell Schneider of Rolling Stone finds some of the lyrics \\"compellingly moronic,\\" making the song an example of Andy Warhol's philosophy that \\"We should really stay babies for much longer than we do, now that we're living so much longer.\\" Dennis Cooper of Spin considers the song as virtually extolling the virtue of suicide. Critic Bryan Wawzenek also remarked that the song makes suicide seem fun. Billboard considered \\"Auf Wiedersehen\\" to be a powerful anti-suicide song. Music critic Robert Christgau described the song as \\"a sarcastic ditty about suicide.\\" Ira Robbins of Trouser Press describes it as a \\"cynical\\" song that \\"turns farewells fatal,\\" Tom Beaujour of Rolling Stone described it as \\"a sneering look at those who chose to end their lives prematurely.\\" Like \\"Surrender,\\" \\"Auf Wiedersehen\\" was one of the earlier songs in Cheap Trick's repertory, and a version was originally recorded for the band's eponymous debut album. It is a powerful, vital song. Beaujour describes it as \\"a furious hard rocker.\\" Music critic John Serba describes it as one of his favorite Cheap Trick songs, being \\"one of their heaviest tunes, dark, gritty, punky, but still catchy as hell.\\" Some of the music quotes lines from Bob Dylan's \\"All Along the Watchtower\\". Wawzenek comments that the song requires a \\"Broadway caliber performance\\" from Cheap Trick lead singer Robin Zander to pull it off, and the song is one of Zander's favorites. Wawzenek praised Zander's \\"murderous howl\\" on the \\"most blood-curdling\\" moments of the song such as at the words \\"No Hope!\\" Press and Sun-Bulletin critic Chris Carson acknowledges that the lyrics are silly but claims that doesn't matter because the \\"musical power\\" bowls listeners over. Nielsen sometimes plays part of the song on a 5-neck guitar. Heaven Tonight producer Tom Werman feels that despite his slick production, the subject matter of \\"Auf Wiedersehen\\" validated the band's new wave credentials. Bradley Bambarger of Billboard described the song as being \\"punkier than thou.\\" But Gary Graff wrote for MusicHound that \\"Auf Wiedersehen\\" is an \\"overbearing rocker.\\" Anthrax covered \\"Auf Wiedersehen\\" as a bonus track on their 1993 album Sound of White Noise. Cell, John Easdale, and Steel Pole Bath Tub also covered the song.

He was born in Lavenham, Suffolk, England on 4 October 1925. He had a love of drawing from an early age which continued as a driving force throughout his life. His lifelong motto (which he inscribed on the fly leaf of many a volume of his childhood library) was \\"ars longa, vita brevis\\" \\"art is never ending, life is short\\" which he may have first seen in the bell tower of Lavenham Church, and following his wish was also carved on his tombstone in Lavenham Churchyard. He had a picture exhibited at Bury St Edmunds while still at school and his drawings were currency for him at school when he swapped them with class mates for cigarette cards and other items. He had his first One Man Exhibition in 1948 at the Guildhall, Lavenham. He left school at 14 years of age but continued to spend his spare time drawing and painting. He worked in a local electrical shop and during the war Durrant joined the Suffolk Regiment (1944 to 1947). After the war he secured a place at Camberwell College of Arts where he was taught by amongst others by Edward Ardizzone Michael Rothenstein Keith Vaughan and John Buckland Wright. and was a contemporary of Theodore Mendez. Whilst at Camberwell he was already exhibiting his paintings in London galleries. His work moved from early landscape and architectural interest to abstraction but with a great variety of style and technique. In 1963 he moved to Cambridge to take up the post of Art Gallery Manager at Heffers at the time a well known local artists' materials and book sellers. He continued his vocation of painting in his days off, spending his evenings reading (mainly 19th- and 20th-century literature, theological works and poetry) or listening to the radio (especially classical music, radio plays and religious programmes on Radio 3 or 4). Durrant published a book of poetry \\"A Rag Book of Love\\" in 1960 A self-portrait of the artist is included in the Tate Gallery Archive Collection TGA 8214.26 (1953 poster paint on paper, exhibited at Artists' International Association Gallery in 1950s) He exhibited frequently throughout his life, holding numerous one man exhibitions not only in London but also nationally. He frequently had works included in the annual Royal Academy London Summer Exhibitions. His works have been collected by public galleries, universities and colleges worldwide and interest in his work both in Britain and overseas has continued since his death in 1998. There have been several retrospective exhibitions of Durrant's work since his death, including a one- man show at the Fine Art Society in New Bond Street London in May 2008. A book about Durrant (\\"Roy Turner Durrant (1925–1998)\\" ) was published in September 2011. The first in a series of major survey catalogues looking at the artists oeuvre and featuring works from the artists' estate was published by Mark Barrow Fine Art in Jan 2015 and is available at http://www.modernbritishartists.co.uk/catalogues/Durrant1950-55/.

Ohio House of Representatives =2010 Campaign and Election= Dr. Terry Johnson first considered running for State Representative in 2009. At the time, he was the Scioto County Coroner and serving in Iraq as a member of the Ohio National Guard. Johnson described his thought process in an interview with the Community Common, saying: \\"I have considered running for state representative because it's the right thing to do. We need someone with a good education, a good personality, someone that comes from our area to represent the 89th District. When you set back and look at all the wonderful people we have that do not step up, and you think they should step up, you have to look in the mirror. So, I looked in the mirror.\\" Dr. Terry Johnson to consider running for State Rep Johnson received positive feedback and officially launched his campaign later that year. Shortly after Johnson entered the race, the only other declared candidate—Democrat Bob Walton, Jr. -- withdrew, saying it was \\"not the right time\\" for him to run.OH-89: Democratic candidate drops out in key house district Two new candidates, businessman Ron Hadsell and Scioto County Commissioner Mike Crabtree, later competed for the Democratic nomination.

Immediately after the results came in, he vowed to set his sights on southern Ohio's problem of prescription drug abuse, saying \\"We know what our priority is here in Scioto County. It’s what is killing us. It’s prescription drug abuse.\\" Johnson tops Hadsell in state rep race =First Term= Immediately after being sworn into office, Johnson began drafting legislation to address the issue of prescription drug abuse. Just a few months into his first term, Johnson had completed the legislation and introduced it as House Bill 93.Scioto County Lawmaker Fights Pill Problem The bill put limitations on in-office dispensing of controlled drugs, put licensing requirements on pain clinics and contained a take-back program to help people safely dispose of unused medications. On May 20, House Bill 93 was signed into law by Ohio Governor John Kasich. HB93 was signed just two months after it had first been introduced, leading the Ohio News Network to remark that Johnson's bill had gone from concept to law in \\"record speed.\\" Gov. Kasich Signs House Bill 93 In addition to pushing through new laws to combat the problem, Johnson also managed to bring a higher awareness to the damage caused by \\"pill mills\\" and prescription drug abuse.

Nelson, in which at low levels of per capita income people are too poor to save and invest much, and this low level of investment results in low rate of growth in national income. As per capita income rises above a certain minimum level at which there is zero saving, a rising proportion of income will be saved and invested and this will lead to higher rate of growth in income.  Theory  The theory developed by Richard R. Nelson in his article A Theory of the Low-Level Equilibrium Trap published in 1956. According to Nelson the malady of underdeveloped economies can be diagnosed as a stable equilibrium level of per capita income at or close to subsistence requirements. At this low stable equilibrium level, both the rate of investment and saving are low. If per capita income is increased above the minimum subsistence level, it encourages growth in population. The population growth, in turn pushes down per capita income again to subsistence level. Thus the economy is caught in low level equilibrium trap. Getting out of the trap requires increasing the rate of growth of income to the levels higher than the rate of increase in population. In Nelson's opinion following four conditions are conducive to trapping: # A high correlation between the level of per-capita income and the rate of population growth # A low propensity to direct additional per-capita income to increasing per-capita investment # Scarcity of uncultivated arable land # Inefficient production methods  Model  Nelson uses a model with three equations. First, there is an income determination equation. Income depends on the stock of capital, the size of the population, and the level of technique. Second, net investment consists of saving-created capital plus additions to the amount of land under cultivation. Third, there is the population growth equation according to which in areas with low per-capita incomes short-run changes in the rate of population growth are caused by changes in the death rate, and changes in the death are caused by changes in the level of per-capita income. Yet once per capita income reaches a level well above subsistence requirements, further increases in per-capita income have a negligible effect on death rate. With these three sets of relationships, it is easy to see that an underdeveloped economy is caught in a low level trap. = Income determination equation = In first case the economy is at minimum subsistence level of per capita income. When per capita is less than that of the minimum subsistence level the population decreases. After a stationary point when per capita income increases then the subsistence level population increases until it reaches a physical limit. Population growth increases till it reaches its upper physical limit after which it declines. The declines occurs because at high per-capita income levels, people become conscious about their living standards and try to adopt a small family norm. = New investment is equal to capital created out of savings = In this case there is a certain level of income in the economy with no savings as all the income is spent on consumption. Also the level of investment is zero. There is negative investment in the economy when savings are negative implying a situation where consumption is greater than income i.e. people live on past capital. However, when per capita income rises then savings also rises from zero level which leads to rise in the investment level in the economy. As there is continuous increase in the per capita income there is a rising proportion of total income saved and invested. = Population growth equation = Whenever the per capita income reaches a level above the subsistence level any further increase in it will have a negligible effect on death rates. Moreover, changes in death rate are due to changes in per capita income.  Conclusion  Starting from this low-level equilibrium trap, any small increase in per capita income will not be able to sustain itself or lead to further increase in per capita income because the rate of growth in population is higher than the rate of growth in total income. Consequently, per capita income will fall to previous low equilibrium level. This happens till the time rate of growth in population is greater than the rate in growth of total income. It is only when the level of per capita income is increased by a discontinuous jump that the country can hope to come out of the low level equilibrium trap, because the rate of growth exceeds the rate of growth of population. Nelson's thesis advocates that if the country is to break the shackles of low level equilibrium trap, its rate of growth of total income must be higher than 3 percent per year. This can be done only when, to use Leibenstein's terminology, that amount of minimum effort is undertaken which pushes up the level of per capita income.  Critical appraisal  The phrases 'low level equilibrium trap' and 'vicious circle of poverty' have become popular in economic literature and so have the perceptions of getting out of these states like Big Push, Critical Minimum effort etc.. Most of the economists agree with Leibenstein that if the underdeveloped countries have to get out of low level equilibrium trap they must undertake investment programmes of such magnitude that the growth of per capita income breaks the population barrier. However, H. Myint points out two sets of difficulties in applying this theory to underdeveloped countries: First, it is not always possible to draw a rigid functional relation between the level of per capita and the rate of growth of population and rate of growth in total income. Main causes of growth in population in most of the underdeveloped countries in recent decades have been reduction in death rates due to improvements in public health and the control of epidemics and endemics, which were not closely related to prior rise in per capita income level. The functional level of per capita income and the level of growth in total income is still more complex and, according to Myint takes place in two steps. The relation between the level of per capita income and the rate of saving and investment is modified by number of factors such as pattern of distribution of income and effectiveness of financial institution in mobilizing savings. The relation between investment and the resultant output is also not given by stable capital-output ratio, but depends on how far the productive organization of the country can be improved and how far land- savings innovations can be adopted to overcome the tendency to diminishing returns on additional investment which will continue even after the population growth has levelled off at 3 percent per annum. Second introduction of the time element creates some complications. Myint argues that it illustrates a set of timeless functional relationship rather than the time series of growth and population and income. The stable and the unstable equilibrium has been taken from the Trade Cycle Theory which deals with turning points in the level of short run economic activities in the developed countries. We therefore may question how far this type of analysis originally designed to illustrate the gear shifts in short run economic activity of a fully developed countries is useful for the study of the problem of long term economic development of the underdeveloped countries which is concerned with the construction of the engine of growth itself.

The Headless Horseman is traditionally depicted as a man upon horseback who is missing his head. Depending on the legend, the Horseman is either carrying his head, or is missing his head altogether, and is searching for it. Examples include the dullahan from Ireland, who is a demonic fairy usually depicted riding a horse and carrying his head under his arm; the titular knight from the English tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\\" a short story written in 1820 by American Washington Irving, which has been adapted into several other works of literature and film including the 1949 Disney cartoon \\"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\\" and the 1999 Tim Burton film Sleepy Hollow.  In American folklore  Cover page to Mayne Reid's version of the legend, published in 1865 The Headless Horseman is a fictional character from the 1820 short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" by American author Washington Irving. The story, from Irving's collection of short stories entitled The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., has worked itself into known American folklore/legend through literature and film, including the 1999 Tim Burton film Sleepy Hollow. The legend of the Headless Horseman (also known as \\"the Headless Hessian of the Hollow\\") begins in Sleepy Hollow, New York, during the American Revolutionary War. Traditional folklore holds that the Horseman was a Hessian trooper who was killed during the Battle of White Plains in 1776. He was decapitated by an American cannonball, and the shattered remains of his head were left on the battlefield while his comrades hastily carried his body away. Eventually they buried him in the cemetery of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, from which he rises as a malevolent ghost, furiously seeking his lost head and wielding a Jack-o'-Lantern as a temporary replacement and/or weapon. Modern versions of the story refer his rides to Halloween, around which time the battle took place. The Headless Horseman is also a novel by Mayne Reid, first published in monthly serialized form during 1865 and 1866, and subsequently published as a book in 1866, based on the author's adventures in the United States. \\"The Headless Horseman\\" or \\"A Strange Tale of Texas\\" was set in Texas and based on a south Texas folk tale.  In Irish folklore  The dullahan or dulachán (\\"dark man\\") is a headless, demonic fairy, usually riding a horse and carrying his head under his arm. He wields a whip made from a human corpse's spine. When the dullahan stops riding, a death occurs. The dullahan calls out a name, at which point the named person immediately dies.The Dullahan – Ireland's Headless Horseman at Scary For Kids In another version, he is the headless driver of a black carriage, the Cóiste Bodhar.The Dullahan at Shee-eire.com A similar figure, the gan ceann (\\"without a head\\"), can be frightened away by wearing a gold object or putting one in his path.McKillop, James A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology, 2004, cited at gan ceann, encyclopedia.com In Scottish folklore The most prominent Scots tale of the headless horseman concerns a man named Ewen decapitated in a clan battle at Glen Cainnir on the Isle of Mull. The battle denied him any chance to be a chieftain, and both he and his horse are headless in accounts of his haunting of the area.Fox, David The Headless Horseman at Federated Caledonian Societies South Africa In English folklore The 14th century poem Gawain and the Green Knight features a headless horseman, the titular giant knight. After he is beheaded by Gawain, the Green Knight lifts his head up with one hand and rides from the hall, challenging Gawain to meet him again one year later.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sir_Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight_(Neilson_translation) In popular culture US postage stamp, 1974 =Comics= The comic book series Chopper, written by Martin Shapiro, is a modern-day reimagining of the Headless Horseman. It features a headless outlaw biker on a motorcycle who collects the souls of sinners. The only people who can see him are those who have consumed a strange new Ecstasy-like drug that triggers their sixth sense and opens a gateway to the afterlife. During the hallucinogenic high, any characters who have committed significant sins are hunted by the headless ghost. Once the drug wears off the victim is safe and beyond the Headless Horseman's ghostly reach. =Television= The Kolchak: The Night Stalker episode \\"Chopper\\" (initially broadcast on January 31, 1975) features a headless motorcyclist who enacts revenge for the loss of his head on a rival biker gang, 20 years after his murder.

In evolutionary biology, the term is also applied to females who are investing parental effort in offspring that are not genetically their own. Similar prying within a family is called wittoldry.Amussen, Susan D. \\"The Contradictions of Patriarchy in Early Modern England.\\" (2018). The term is derived from Early Modern English dating back to 1562 AD. Cuckqueanry as a fetish A cuckquean fetishist is aware of her spouse's activity, sometimes actively encouraging it, and derives sexual pleasure from it. Among some fetishists, the cuckquean's humiliation or victimization is a major element of the paraphilia. In the fetish cuckqueaning subculture, the male takes on the role of being sexually dominant, while the female takes on a submissive role. The wife usually only becomes involved with the man or his lover when he permits it—sometimes remaining altogether celibate. When the fetish is simply androphilic or heterosexual, the wife has sex only with her husband; when it is bi-sexual, the wife has sex with both her husband and the other woman, or exclusively only with the other woman. The fetish specifics can range wildly. Sometimes the husband and his lovers can treat the cuckquean lovingly; sometimes it involves nothing but swinging, swapping husbands or sharing a lover. But when it goes beyond this, the fetish can require that the cuckquean be humiliated or debased. Sometimes this may be accidental or incidental (e.g., the parties involved are too aroused to stop); but at other times the humiliation may be intentional, and the husband and his lovers act out a story or perform a ritual in which they force the cuckquean to perform humiliating acts, or enter into circumstances that debase her.

He was styled as Vicomte Lepic until his father's death in 1875, when he succeeded to the title of Comte Lepic. He is best remembered today as a friend of Edgar Degas, who included him in some eleven paintings and pastels. He was among the original Impressionist group and later became a recognised marine painter. Life and career Lepic was the grandson of the Napoleonic general Louis Lepic, from whom the comital title had descended. His father was Louis-Joseph-Napoléon Lepic (1810–1875), who had a distinguished military career and was a close supporter of Napoléon III. Destined for a similar career, Ludovic persuaded his father to allow him to train as a painter instead, originally with Gustave Wappers, the official painter of the Belgian king, and later with the animal painter Charles Verlat, who encouraged him to take up etching. Much of Lepic's early work was in this genre, and he joined the Société des aquafortistes in 1862. The following year, he gained notability for his sentimental etching For the poor,Wikimedia after which he undertook further training from Charles Gleyre and the academic artist Alexandre Cabanel. Photo of Lepic by Nadar During the next few years, he took up archaeology and between 1869-76 was a member of the Société d'anthropologie de Paris. In 1872, he founded a museum at Aix-les-Bains and published a ground-breaking illustrated work on prehistoric tools, Les armes et les outils préhistoriques reconstitués. His experiments with etching during this time were equally innovative, and he developed the technique of 'variable etching' (eau-forte mobile) where, by varying the ink on the plate, he was able to produce individual results at each printing.William Jung, History of the Monotype June1996 ; view also the varied effects of his Lake of Nemi series He was to teach this technique to his old friend Edgar Degas and the two co-operated on, and duly signed, Degas' large monotype The ballet master of 1874, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Lepic and Degas were friends as young men, with similar interests, and were to co-operate in other ways too.Harvey Buchanan, \\"Edgar Degas and Ludovic Lepic\\", Cleveland Studies in the History of Art 2, 1997, p. 32 It was Degas who persuaded Lepic to help plan and participate in the first two Impressionist exhibitions, but insistence by the group that he should not exhibit at the same time in the official Salon led Lepic to distance himself from them. During this time, he had bought himself a boat and from 1877 paid annual visits to the town of Berck, south of Le Touquet, which was an artistic haven also for other artists on the fringes of Impressionism, such as Édouard Manet and Eugène Boudin. It is for his depictions of the beach and fishing boats there that Lepic is particularly remembered as a painter today.See selections at Artnet, the Ary Jan Gallery and San Francisco Museum In 1883, he achieved recognition by being appointed an official marine painter by the state, following his growing popularity after the award of a medal at the 1877 Salon. In 1879, he had a large individual exhibition of some 100 pictures at the Gallery \\"La vie moderne\\" and in 1883, he exhibited 150 at the Musée des Arts décoratifs. In between, he had published an illustrated account of an archaeological trip to Egypt, La dernière Egypte (1881). Lepic's painting of \\"The Smashed Boat\\" was one of the medal-winners at the 1877 Salon The appearance of Lepic in several works by Degas records some of the enthusiasms they had in common. These included horse racing and Degas' Gentlemen's race: Before the start (1862; Musée d'Orsay) pictures Lepic mounted among the jockeys.View online Ballet was another enthusiasm. Lepic is shown gazing through opera glasses in The ballet from Robert le Diable (1871; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), one of Degas' earliest treatments of the subject, and in quarter profile from behind in the Victoria & Albert Museum's larger copy (1876). Lepic's fondness for dogs, evidenced by his many etchings, resulted in Degas' final pastel of Lepic holding one in the Cleveland Museum of Art (1889).View online Earlier, he had included another dog in the amusing Place de la Concorde, in which the elegantly dressed and cigar-smoking Lepic strides to the right, an umbrella under his arm, while his two daughters and the dog all face the other way. Earlier still, the daughters appeared on either side of their father in the intimate painting Ludovic Lepic and His Daughters (1871). Notwithstanding his marriage in 1865 with Joséphine Scévole de Barral, the mother of these daughters, Lepic was later to take the prima ballerina Marie Sanlaville as his mistress and designed dresses for the ballets in which she danced, including the Harlequin costume for Les Jumeaux de Bergame. Degas was also to sketch this while it was in rehearsal in 1885. In 1889, he was suddenly taken ill, and Marie Sanlaville cared for him at her apartment until his death in October. He was then interred in the vault of the family property at Andrésy.

It reached No. 1 on the New York Times Bestseller List. Following the events of the novella \\"Darkness Under the Sun,\\" it follows the life of John Calvino, a survivor of a violent attack on his family and current police officer. In the aftermath of Billy Lucas's brutal slaying of his own family, Calvino notices many similarities between Billy Lucas's family and his own, and Lucas knows more about Calvino than he possibly can. Spooked, remembering the attack of that left his family dead so many years ago at the hands of the late Alton Turner Blackwood, Calvino starts worrying that Blackwood, or his memory, might be back, and the family Calvino created may be in danger. Though some may call it part of the horror genre, Koontz refers to the novel as a \\"ghost story.\\" Plot summary The novel begins with John Calvino investigating the murder of a family, committed by Billy Lucas. Billy is in a mental institution and being monitored for being schizophrenic. He openly admits to having killed his family and can describe to John in graphic detail how he murdered them. John goes to visit Billy; Billy indicates that the reason he killed them was because of “Ruin”. As John is leaving, Billy's countenance changes and he begins saying “help me”. John begins to investigate the murders, and finds that there are a number of similarities between the murders committed by Billy, and murders committed by Alton Turner Blackwood some 20 years previously. Alton Blackwood killed John's entire family. The two families were murdered in almost exactly the same way. John's family (his wife Nicolette, and his children Zach, Naomi, and Minette), begin to be haunted by dreams, sounds in the house, and ghostly phone calls. John receives a call from Billy taunting him and saying things that only John or Alton Blackwood would know concerning John's sister. John follows up on Billy to find out he does not have a phone in his cell and could not possibly have made the phone call. John begins to work on the theory that it wasn't Billy Lucas that killed his family, but rather Alton Blackwood. Billy is found dead in his cell having died from the stress of what he was going through. John's wife Nicolette, who had oral surgery three months before, begins to be haunted. Thinking that the medicine she received for her teeth were causing hallucinations, she sees he doctor again, only to have him confirm that the Vicodin she took at the time has not had any adverse effect. The reader begins to learn about other instances of people being possessed by the spirit of Alton Blackwood, known as the “rider”. A man named Reese Salsetto, possessed by Alton, attempts to kill his sister Brenda's family and rape his niece. Brenda shoots Reese dead; Alton then tries to possess her. In the fight, in order to escape Alton, she turns the gun on herself. It is later learned that she was trying to fend off the spirit trying to possess her. The spirit of Blackwood enters many others and causes them to do deplorable crimes. John believes that the spirit of Alton Blackwood is possessing people. He tells another detective, his friend Lionel, who is tentative but believes him. He goes and talks with a friend, Priest Abelard, who tells him about possession but who is not willing to help due to his own personal demons. John's daughter Naomi begins meeting with Melody Lane, a possessed woman who claims to be a fairy queen from a fantasy land. They develop a friendship. Alton Blackwood has killed on a 33-day cycle. John believes that on the next cycle he will try to kill John's family; however, the spirit advances the timetable and attacks early. Numerous people are possessed including the drug-addicted son of Calvino's housekeepers, child- killer Melody Lane, reporter Roger Hodd, and the children's math tutor, Professor Sinyavski. All four attack John's family in their house. John's family fights against the possessed people. The book ends with John offering his own body to the spirit, and with his youngest daughter's mysterious aid is able to defeat Blackwood's spirit and shed the less literal demons that have been haunting him since the murder of his first family.  Darkness Under the Sun  This novella was written for the Kindle, and saw print in the paperback edition of the novel. It is mainly set prior to the incidents in What The Night Knows, but also bookends the novel itself. In the initial part of the novella, Alton Turner Blackwood meets a boy named Howie, and the subsequent events of this novella dovetail into the background of the main novel, with a time lapse to the end of the novel.Koontz, Dean.

The municipality covers an area of 14.94 square kilometres (5.77 sq mi. In 2011 it had a population of 364 people. It is located between the shires of Tierras de Granadilla and Ambroz Valley.  Geography and environment  It is situated on Cambrian land, in the valley of Ambroz River and at the foot of the Cruces Altas mountains (Sistema Central). Its surroundings present holm oaks and cork oaks along with other species that are part of scrub, such as rockrose, aulaga, and lavender. The Ambroz River flows through the outskirts of the village, creating a great natural pool that makes the town a popular place to visit. In the summer, the village's life revolves around this river.  History  The name La Granja evokes to the concept of a farm. It is probable that it makes reference to its relation with the town of Granadilla first, and to Abadía later. It supposed a base of exploitation and supply for these populations, so related to the duchy of the House of Alba in its settling and exploitation after the called Reconquista. These lands, have been a transit point of so many historical settlements between the Castilian and Extremadurian plateau, and therefore of many warlike skirmishes, preserving signs like the fortresses or traces of their stay. In the town is located, a Roman milestone, with a Latin inscription that attests to the Roman presence and makes reference with traits of divinity to the Roman emperor in charge at that moment. Even so, the most prominent building in the town is the Catholic Christian church. According to inscriptions on its walls, the construction of the building is oriented to the 16th century, the year 1544 is chiseled in one of the stirrups of the northern part and the year 1597 in the base of the church.  Economy  According to Pascual Madoz, in the year 1847 in his Historical Statistical Geographic Dictionary, in his reference to La Granja, the town produces wheat, rye, barley, chickpeas, flax, oil, many vegetables, especially melons and watermelons. Sheep, goat-like, bovine and porcine cattle were kept. Small game and tench catch in the lagoons were raised and ordinary fish in the river. Regarding Industry and Commerce, it indicates that the town has 3 flour mills, 1 oil mill, 6 linen looms, 1 tile factory and some pepper, cattle and wool are exported. At present, the economical activity is depressed like other villages of the area. The primary sector occupies 60% of the active population and, as in the whole area, the stockbreeding sector stands out among the others. On the other hand, tourism is also important. Because of the geographical enclave in which this town is located, you can enjoy different activities and visit places of interest. In addition it counts with a couple cottages.  Transportation  It is located on the road EX-205, an important regional road that joins Hervás with Portugal and communicates the main rural areas of the province northwest. The Ruta de la Plata Highway and its secondary road N-630 are only 1 km east from the town, which allows easy access to and from it. In the northern part of the village there is a rural way that leads directly to Abadía.Mapa de La Granja Festivities All the local festivities held in the town have a Catholic Christian religious origin and are: * Saint Sebastian or \\"Los Mártiles\\"; celebrated on January 20. * Carnival; which has a variable date (between February and March depending on the year). * La Romería (the Pilgrimage); held on the last Saturday of April since the beginning of the 21st century. * Saint Anthony ″San Antonio″; celebrated on June 13. During the saint's figure procession offerings are made to him, to be auctioned later among the locals. * Saint Mary Magdalene; It is the most important and celebrated festivity of the village, being the 22nd of July the most important day. * The Christ of Peace; which takes place on the last Saturday of August.

He travelled to Chicago in 1962, inspired by architects such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and studied painting, sculpture, and arts and crafts at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he met his future wife.

Life Charles Nisbet was the son of William Nisbet (physician) and Alison Hepburn; his father was a schoolteacher at Long Yester near Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland. By 1754, Charles Nisbet had completed studies at both the High School and the University of Edinburgh and had entered Divinity Hall to prepare for the ministry. He was licensed by the Presbytery of Edinburgh on September 24, 1760. On May 17, 1764, he was ordained to the parish church of Montrose.Rev. Charles Nisbet, First President of Dickinson College, by Rev. Charles Collins 1853 Nisbet was an outspoken evangelical and sympathiser with the American Revolution. Anti-Catholic in his view, he was questioned after the Gordon Riots. Nisbet's old friend John Witherspoon was the head of Princeton College; and the college in 1783 awarded Nisbet the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity. This caused the Trustees of Dickinson College to turn their attention to him for the new institution in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Persuaded by Benjamin Rush and John Dickinson, Nisbet accepted the position and sailed from Greenock with his family on April 23, 1785. They arrived in Philadelphia on June 9, and in Carlisle on July 4, where the town greeted them. In the height of a humid Pennsylvania summer, the entire family fell ill with a fever. Given Carlisle's muddy frontier appearance and weather, Nisbet seriously considered returning to Scotland, but was persuaded to remain.Dickinson College, The History of 150 Years 1783-1933, by James H. Morgan 1933 Nisbet was unanimously re-elected as principal on May 9, 1786. For the following eighteen years, his efforts to build the new institution were untiring. On New Year's Day, 1804 he contracted a cold, which progressed to pneumonia. Charles Nisbet died two and a half weeks later on January 18, 1804, aged 68. At the funeral a sermon was preached and a Latin ode to his memory was given. A monument was erected to his memory by his son Alexander.The American quarterly register, Volume 14, American Education Society, page 332 Family In 1766, Nisbet married Anne Tweedie. The Nisbets had four children: Thomas, Mary, Alison (1773) and Alexander (1777). His son Alexander Nisbet born 1777 was a founding member of the St Andrews Society of Baltimore in 1806.

It is one of the few works of prose written by the author that are set during World War II and is said to have been based upon real life events witnessed by the author. The novella's original title was \\"Случай на станции Кочетовка\\" (An Incident at Kochetovka Station) – this is the authentic name of a small railway town in the general area implied by hints in the course of the story – but a change was forced upon Solzhenitsyn by the Novyi Mir editorial board due to its allegorical association with the name of Vsevolod Kochetov, then editor-in-chief of the conservative Soviet literary magazine Oktiabr' (October).Александр Минкин, Письма президентам, p. 202 In later editions, the author restored the name of the station back to \\"Kochetovka\\". Plot The action of the novella takes place only over three or four hours, a night in late October 1941, and is written mostly from the viewpoint (though not from inside the mind) of a somewhat short-sighted character called Lieutenant Vasili Zotov, who is the second in command of the station. The brief incident described involves a soldier and actor, Tveritinov, who has lost contact with his military unit and has spent several days trying to catch up, riding on board freight cars without a ticket or identification papers. Zotov is impressed by the actor's warm personality and is moved when shown photographs of the actor's family. But when Tveritinov asks what was the previous name of Stalingrad, Zotov suspects that he is a spy and has him arrested. Weeks later, Zotov twice asks about the actor only to be told that he \\"has been taken care of\\" and \\"we never make mistakes\\" – leaving the reader to guess Tveritinov's fate. Solzhenitsyn uses Zotov's restricted mind and overly suspicious thinking as a symbol of Soviet ideology and the workings of the Stalinist police state, but among those of Solzhenitsyn's characters that are overtly loyal to Joseph Stalin, Zotov is one of the more sympathetically written, and who has qualities that the author admires: he is hardworking, eager to do his best and a man of the people. Still, he becomes a tool of the paranoia of Stalinism. Film In 1964 a short film based on the novella was shot by Nikolai Rasheyev and Gleb Panfilov as a school project when at the High Courses for Scriptwriters and Film Directors.An interview with N.

It is the 48th Oswald short of the Lantz era and the 100th in the entire series. Plot Oswald is on a horse, riding through the outdoors and blowing his trumpet. Here, he is seen wearing a shirt for the first time. Also joining him in his adventure is a brown slender dog, running along. At a site not too faraway, a live girl teddy bear is keeping herself in shape by having her waist shuffled by a moving towel. The towel's ends are attached to the back of a shaky automobile. Meanwhile, her little brother hops on the car's front seat for a moment and jumps off, but accidentally moves a switch. As a result, the automobile was shaken too much for her liking, and she calls for help. Oswald picks up the distress call and comes to her aid. For some reason, Oswald fires his gun at the vehicle, stopping it completely. The teddy bear was relieved of her trouble and was most thankful. Oswald and the teddy bear befriended each other. As the rabbit greets her goodbye to carry on in his journey, the beautiful bruin asks him where he is heading. Oswald then tells he is on a hunting trip. Finding his activity interesting, the teddy bear requests him to get her a fox skin. Oswald agrees to her wish. Oswald and his dog set off in their horse to hunt for a fox. The fox in the area knows of their purpose, and therefore thinks of ways to keep them at bay. Minutes later, they were standing side-by-side, looking for their targeted animal. Without the two knowing, the fox comes up behind them and ties the dog's tail around Oswald's leg. The fox then kicks Oswald in the rear, prompting the rabbit to send the dog into a chase. In this, Oswald was pulled several yards away. His ride on the dog's tail would end as they ran into a residential gate. Just to toy with its pursuers, the fox steps on mud then walks on the ground, leaving a trail of its footprints. Oswald and the dog follow the tracks which lead to a tree, and Oswald goes for a climb. The rabbit reaches the top but finds nothing. It appears that the fox was actually on the ground as it ties the dog's tail around a wooden spike and goes on to shake the tree. Oswald then drops to ground, and the fox flees the scene. Oswald chases the fox into a house. As he enters, the fox leaps out from a window and closes the door. Thinking the rabbit has lost track, the fox stands and laughs just beside the entrance. All of a sudden, however, Oswald comes back out. Thus the fox ends up smashed by the door and pressed against the house's front wall. Just then, the teddy bear comes to Oswald, asking him if he got the fox skin she requested. Oswald then peels the flattened fox off the house and puts it on her like a scarf. Oswald and the teddy bear consider going on a date together.

The episode was written by Mark Verheiden and directed by Anthony Hemingway. Colonel Porter returns to the 2nd Mass and informs them that not only has the 7th Mass been destroyed, there has also been no contact with the 4th and 5th Mass. Weaver orders Tom to scout out the massive Skitter structure and determine how best to destroy it.  Plot  While scouting the Skitter command tower in downtown Boston, Tom, Hal and Weaver spy a tall, humanoid alien species directing Skitters. They appear to be the \\"officers\\" or master- race commanding or controlling the Skitters. Tom theorizes that the reason they haven't seen them before is because in a normal military occupation, high-ranking officers don't expose themselves in open territory until they feel confident that they've secured a region. Weaver, who used to run a construction business, observes the alien tower and notes that both the aliens construction techniques and building materials are fairly imitative of those found on Earth. They seem to be using fairly basic construction techniques, and while they do have access to some exotic materials in their ships and Mechs, their large-scale structures seem to be made out of basic construction materials found on Earth like concrete and steel rebar. Hal points out that this explains what they were doing with all of the scrap metal they were making the harnessed children collect. Back in the high school base camp, Pope has been assisting Uncle Scott in examining the wreckage of some of the Mechs they have managed to destroy, and Matt pokes around as he works. Pope explains that from what they can discern from the wreckage, even the Mechs are imitative of Earth technology, or as he puts it, \\"they're really big into recycling\\". Mech bodies are made using an exotic alien alloy - which they dub simply \\"Mech-metal\\" - which is tough enough to stop small arms fire while remaining compact and lightweight. However, their built-in autocannons use standard munitions. The Mechs are not simply using cartridges of similar size to Earth rounds; instead when Pope opened up the magazine in a Mech gun, he found Earth-built cartridges with human manufacturer markings on them. Pope's theory is that after the opening wave of the invasion, the initial EMP detonation and mass air strikes, the aliens began raiding every major armory and ammunition depot they could gain access to, then took the cartridges to use in their Mechs. The only difference is that they changed the tips on each of the cartridges so they fire bullets made out of exotic Mech-metal, making each shot armor-piercing (which Pope compares to using depleted uranium tipped rounds, but much more powerful). The human resistance does not know why the aliens are using Earth building materials and ammunition, only vaguely speculating that the aliens planned for the invasion to rely on local resources to support itself. Matt remarks that it's not fair that the Mech- metal used in the Skitters' robots gives them such an edge in combat that the humans don't have, which inspires Pope to start experimenting around with the recovered Mech-metal they have. Meanwhile, Dr. Anne Glass decides to perform an autopsy on the corpse of the Skitter she killed, which she hasn't had a chance to perform yet because of the temporary evacuation instigated by the incident with the 7th Mass. All previous attempts to perform autopsies on dead Skitters have been unsuccessful, because their innards rapidly decompose into unrecognizable mush very soon after they die. In the first months of the invasion the humans were just running for their lives and couldn't carry Skitter corpses back from the front lines, and even when they could bring one back later on, they had already decomposed internally. Because the captured Skitter died right inside of their base, it's their first real opportunity to successfully autopsy one. Lourdes assists Anne with the procedure, because as a first year medical student she's the closest thing to a nurse she has. They discover that while the Skitters have tough leathery skin and carapace armor, their internal structure isn't that much different from terrestrial vertebrates, including an endoskeleton, cardio-vascular system, and nervous system. Anne then confirms her fears when she saws through the armored carapace of the Skitter's back, and finds that it has a harness attached to its spine, identical in structure to the ones attached to the human children. The implications to Anne are clear: the Skitters were themselves harnessed, and might not always have been Skitters. Particularly because the harness was found within their outer carapace, it seems that they used to be some other kind of lifeform, captured by the tall humanoid aliens who used the harnesses to mutate them into shock-troops. Anne realizes this means that the harnessed children are being slowly mutated, either into Skitters or something like them. While returning to base, the scouting team meets a strange woman (Blair Brown) that invites them into her home. Tom and Hal take up her offer while Weaver guards their motorbikes. While inside, Weaver takes off, having removed the spark plugs on Tom and Hal's bikes. They eventually track him down to his old house where Tom finds him drinking whiskey in the backyard. Weaver explains that he had separated from his wife before the invasion and couldn't find her when the attack began. He found his younger daughter who had been harnessed and inadvertently killed her in removing it. They are interrupted when a Mech shows up, forcing Hal to hide and Tom and Weaver to work together to destroy it. Realizing that the only person who knew their location was the strange woman they met earlier, they return to her apartment and discover she is an agent of the Skitters who use her to capture people. While questioning her, a young woman turns up at the door inquiring whether any more people have been there. She turns out to be Karen, Hal's girlfriend, who has now been captured and harnessed. Before Hal can do anything, Tom looks through the peep hole and comes face to face with one of the new tall aliens. Hal is desperate to save Karen but Tom has to hold him back, because there's no way they can capture her without alerting the aliens to their presence. Deciding that the woman - who seems mentally disturbed after losing her family in the invasion - cannot be trusted, Tom lies to her about the direction they are actually heading as they leave. They return to the school with this news and find Pope demonstrating that a bullet made out of Mech armor can penetrate the Mech itself, to the applause of onlookers. Weaver orders teams to start melting down as much Mech-metal as they have into bullets, which will even the odds the next time the aliens face them and each soldier is firing armor-piercing rounds. Rick, who observed this, takes off, followed by Ben.

He was the husband of the writer Elizabeth Strutt, and father of the painter, traveller and archaeologist Arthur John Strutt.  Life  Strutt was born on 4 August 1784 in Colchester, in Essex, one of eight children of Benjamin Strutt and Caroline, née Pollett. In London, on 8 November 1813, he married Elizabeth Byron, with whom he had four children; their second son, Arthur John Strutt, was born in 1819. Strutt moved to Lausanne in Switzerland in about 1830. With his son Arthur he travelled in France and Switzerland from 1835 to 1837, and later to Italy; they established a studio in Rome. He returned to England in 1851, and died in Rome in 1864 or 1867.  Work  Strutt painted portraits and landscapes, mainly in gouache, in the style of Constable, with whom he may have studied. He was also a capable engraver. He showed work in London between 1819 and 1858. At the Royal Academy he exhibited from 1822 to 1852; in 1822 and 1823 he showed portraits, but from 1824 until 1831 showed only woodland or forest scenes. Two paintings were sent from Italy while he was living there: The Ancient Forum, Rome in 1845, and in 1851 Tasso's Oak, Rome. He published two books of poetry in translation, and several books of engravings.  Publications  * Claudianus, Claudius. Rape of Proserpine: with other poems, translated into English verse.

The team remained in the Carolina League. The team played at both Durham Athletic Park which is located in Durham, North Carolina and at Devereaux Meadow which is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Durham Bulls were renamed because the team itself acquired the nearby Carolina League rival Raleigh baseball team and the Raleigh team merged into the Bulls. The merge happened after the 1967 season. Before the merge and at the time, the Bulls were affiliated with the New York Mets for the 1967 season. The team was able to maintain its affiliation with the Mets after the merge, but the team then switched to the parent club’s name. The team continued as the Mets affiliate for the 1968 season only. The team then switched affiliations to the Philadelphia Phillies for the 1969 season which ended up being the only season affiliated with the Phillies. The Phillies abandoned them and the team was renamed the Triangles for the 1970 season.

Service Troop at Eau Claire redesignated Machine Gun Troop. Relieved from the 23rd Cavalry Division converted and redesignated as the 126th Field Artillery, 1 October 1940. History Following conversion from the 105th Cavalry Regiment, the 126th FA Regiment was subordinated to the 32nd Infantry Division. The regiment was initially equipped with 75-mm field guns. The 126th FA Regiment, less its second battalion, was redesignated the 126th Field Artillery Battalion on 31 January 1942. The regiment's second battalion had been redesignated as the 1st Battalion, 173rd FA Regiment on 16 January 1942. The 126th FA Battalion was reequipped with 105-mm howitzers during World War II and saw service in Australia, Goodenough Island, New Guinea, and the Philippines with the 32nd Division. On 28 February 1946, the 126th FA Battalion was inactivated in Japan.Stanton, pages 380 and 400. The 126th FA Battalion was reorganized on 23 June 1947 as part of the Wisconsin Army National Guard. Consolidation with the 132nd Anti-Aircraft Battalion in 1959 resulted in the reemergence of the 126th FA Regiment, with one missile battalion and one field artillery battalion. The FA battalion was called to active duty for ten months during 1961–1962. A further reorganization on 5 November 1963 designated the regiment's second battalion as the 1st Battalion, 126th Field Artillery. The missile battalion became a battery and was later relieved of assignment to the regiment in 1971. After riot control duty in Milwaukee in July 1967, the 1-126 FA Battalion was released from assignment to the 32nd Division in December of the same year. The reorganization of 1 July 1971 reduced the regiment to a single battalion and, on 1 May 1972, redesignated the 1-126th FA as the 126th Field Artillery. Subsequent assignments for the battalion were to the 257th FA Group and finally to the 57th FA Brigade.

It belongs to the civil law legal system. It is grounded on the principles laid out in the Constitution of Croatia and safeguarded by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia. Croatian Law system is largely influenced by German and Austrian law systems. It is significantly influenced by the Civil Code of the Austrian Empire (1811), known in Croatia as Opći građanski zakon (OGZ) (General Civil Law). It was in force from 1853http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=45220 to 1946, with some provisions still applying in the modern day. The Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi-controlled puppet state was established in 1941 during World War II, used the OGZ as a basis for the 1943 Base of the Civil Code for the Independent State of Croatia (Osnova građanskoga zakona za Nezavisnu Državu Hrvatsku). After the War, Croatia become a member of the Yugoslav Federation which enacted in 1946 the Law on immediate voiding of regulations passed before April 6, 1941 and during the enemy occupation (Zakon o nevaženju pravnih propisa donesenih prije 6. travnja 1941. i za vrijeme neprijateljske okupacije). By this law OGZ was declared invalid as a whole, but implementation of some of its legal rules was approved. During the post-war era, the Croatian legal system become influenced by elements of the socialist law. Croatian civil law was pushed aside, and it took norms of public law and legal regulation of the social ownership. After Croatia declared independence from Yugoslavia on June 25, 1991, the previous legal system was used as a base for writing new laws. he Law on Obligations (Zakon o obveznim odnosima) was enacted in 2005.Croatian legal history in the European context, Dalibor Čepulo, p. 357 Today, Croatia as a European Union member state implements elements of the EU acquis into its legal system.

He has a fine sense of organization: He prepares their missions like nobody else and he knows exactly what's going on. But his rather school- like answers to the problem are never quite as efficient as those of his boss. Genius Boy is both appalled by his boss's stupidity and always mystified by his unorthodox methods, which he has to admit, are pretty darn efficient. Even though he never reaps the recognition he deserves (Captain Biceps will never ever admit that his sidekick might be smart have come up with a good idea), Genius Boy remains Captain Biceps' faithful and devoted assistant. *The President - Suit and tie, a big cigar in his mouth and his faithful mutt at his feet… Meet the President. Most of the time he is hanging ten: In his office doing a crossword puzzle, having diner in a fancy restaurant, relaxing in his massive Turkish bath… When suddenly, he is interrupted by the announcement that some serious threat looms over Capitalcity, or even worse, the entire planet. So he picks up his phone and calls Captain Biceps. *Carmina Cantaloup - A big brassy mother, Carmina has her son wrapped around her fat little finger. And though he is 100% superhero, he has to: Brush his teeth before going to bed, always finish his spinach and Brussels Sprouts, pick up his dirty socks and so forth. Even though Carmina grumbles about the fact that he is still living at home (one of her ritual complaints), deep down, she is quite happy he is here! The Captain complains sometimes, but not too much and not too loudly. He doesn't want to get her angry. After all, your mom is your mom and Captain Biceps loves his big momma.

Wehrkraftzersetzung or Zersetzung der Wehrkraft (German for \\"undermining military force\\") was a sedition offence in German military law during the Nazi Germany era from 1938 to 1945. Wehrkraftzersetzung was enacted in 1938 by decree as Germany moved closer to World War II to suppress criticism of the Nazi Party and Wehrmacht leadership in the military, and in 1939, a second decree was issued extending the law to civilians.The term is nuanced, making it difficult to translate in a way that clearly conveys its sense. In picking any equivalent word, the translator necessarily leaves out all the others. The word Zersetzung means \\"decomposition\\", \\"corrosion\\", \\"disintegration\\", \\"putrefaction\\", \\"degradation\\" or \\"degrading\\", but is also used figuratively to mean \\"subversion\\" and \\"disruptiveness\\". The word Wehrkraft translates verbatim as \\"military power\\" or \\"military strength\\". See the translation of Zersetzung here. Wehrkraftzersetzung consolidated and redefined paragraphs already in the military penal code to punish \\"seditious\\" acts such as conscientious objection, defeatist statements, self-mutilation, and questioning the Endsieg. Convictions were punishable by the death penalty, heavy sentences in military prisons, concentration camps, or Strafbataillons.That was a clear case of wrongful judgement. The law as it stood, vague and tyrannical as it was, did not prohibit conscientious objection. Wehrkraftzersetzung was de facto abolished in 1945 after Nazi Germany's defeat, but text from the penal code continued to be used by the Federal Republic of Germany. On 25 August 1998 and 23 July 2002, after lengthy debate, the Bundestag removed the Nazi-era sentences from the German criminal justice system and all Nazi military sentencing for conscientious objection, desertion, and all other forms of Wehrkraftzersetzung were repealed as unjust. Current German military law neither contains the term \\"undermining the military\\" nor its extensive rules, but a few offences included under the umbrella of Wehrkraftzersetzung remain on the statute books in a vague form. Etymology The German phrase Wehrkraftzersetzung can be translated into English in various forms depending on context, and is difficult to translate its sense used by the Nazi Party. Wehrkraftzersetzung is composed of three parts: Wehr means 'defence' (a cognate of the English word \\"war\\"); kraft means power, force, strength; zersetzung means decay, decomposition, disintegration, but also subversion or corruption. The context of Wehrkraftzersetzung, or Zersetzung der Wehrkraft, used by the Nazi Party is typically translated into English as \\"undermining military force\\" or \\"subversion of the war effort\\" (in reference to the forthcoming war effort),Ian Dear and Michael Richard Daniell Foot (Eds.), The Oxford Companion to World War II Oxford University Press (2001), pp. 365–367 .

Retrieved September 4, 2011  Definition in the Nazi military penal code  The term Zersetzung der Wehrkraft was established in German military law by the Wartime Special Penal Code (Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung or KSSVO) on 17 August 1938, which criminalized all criticism, dissent and behavior opposed to Nazi political and military leadership, particularly within the Wehrmacht's military justice. The definition of the term is equivalent to the Treachery Act of 1934 but escalates the severity of the crime, with critical remarks by soldiers violating the Treachery Act were previously punished merely with a prison term, but the KSSVO added the death penalty, allowing a Zuchthaus or prison sentence only in minor cases. With the introduction of the Wartime Regulations for Criminal Procedures (Kriegsstrafverfahrensordnung or KStVO), those accused under the law were also deprived of the right to appeal, further weakening them at trial. The extent of the military judge's discretion and the degree of arbitrariness involved are indicated in a 1942 statement by Alfred Fikentscher, an admiral and chief medical officer in the Kriegsmarine. Speaking before military lawyers, he said, \\"...similar circumstances exist with subversive remarks, which may be seen as violations of the Treachery Act. Protracted submission [of documents] to the Minister of Justice to order a criminal prosecution is unnecessary if you approach the statement as undermining the military, which will be possible in almost every case.\\" The regulations created by the Wehrmacht in the course of preparing for World War II served during the war years as an instrument of terror to maintain the soldiers' \\"will to persevere\\" through coercion. Especially in the later stages of the war, the Nazi and Wehrmacht leadership were greatly afraid of repetition of the events during the German Revolution that occurred after World War I. Every act of resistance was to be suppressed so that a reoccurrence of the \\"stab-in-the-back\\" be prevented. At the beginning of 1943, the jurisdiction was transferred to the People's Court (Volksgerichtshof), though minor cases could be sent to the Sondergerichte (special courts) that were originally instituted for political crimes but by this time advanced to be the usual courts against common criminality. The Sondergerichte, not unlike later drumhead courts, prioritized hunting-down, not due process, as their express purpose. =Interpretation= §5 of the KSSVO reads: :Whoever openly challenges or incites others to refuse to fulfill their duty to serve in the German armed forces or their allies, or otherwise openly tries to self- assertively put up a fight to cripple or subvert the will of the German people or their allies ... will be sentenced to death for undermining the military.\\"Kriegssonderstrafrechtsverordnung (KSSVO)\\" lexexakt.de. Retrieved September 6, 2011 The word \\"openly\\" provided room for interpretation by authorities, so that even remarks made within one's own family could be used by relatives against the accused. The vague wording of the regulation made it possible to criminalize every type of criticism, also by civilians, deliberately encouraging denunciation as a means to more comprehensively control the population. That \\"undermining the war effort\\" in Nazi Germany was by no means a trivial offense is seen in the 1 November 1944 decree from the head of the National Socialist Secret Service of the Luftwaffe: :\\"It has long been self-evident that whoever expresses doubt about the Führer, criticizes him and his actions, spreads disparaging news or vilifies him, is without honor and worthy of death. Neither standing nor rank, nor personal circumstances or other grounds can exculpate such a case. In the most difficult, deciding period of the war, whoever expresses doubt about the final victory and thereby causes others to waver, has likewise forfeited his life!\\" Among others, examples of subversion given were: * Remarks in opposition to Nazi ideology * Doubt about the legitimacy of the struggle for survival imposed on us [...] * Dissemination of news about battle fatigue and German soldiers deserting * Doubt about military reports * Cultivating private contact with prisoners of war * Disparaging that important weapon in war: German propaganda * Discussing contingencies in the event of defeat * The assertion, that Bolshevism \\"is not so bad or that the democracy of our western neighbors could be contemplated\\".These examples were translated from the German Wikipedia. Some of them bear a strong resemblance to a quote from Dr. Günther Vollmer, a Ministerial Director at the Reich Ministry of Justice. He wrote, \\"No longer tolerable and fundamentally worthy of death are [...] remarks of the following kind: The war is lost; Germany or the Führer picked a fight and senselessly or frivolously started the war and must lose it; the NSDAP should or will relinquish power and, like the Italian model, make way for the understanding of peace; a military dictatorship must be established and will be able to forge peace, one must work slowly in order to bring about the conclusion; an intrusion of bolshevism would not be as bad as the propaganda paints it, and will only harm the leading National Socialists; the English or the Americans will stop bolshevism at the German border; urging by word of mouth or letters to the front to throw down their guns or turn back; the Führer is sick, incompetent, a butcher, etc.\\" Defeatist remarks were not prosecuted under military law, but were tried in military-backed \\"accelerated trials\\", such as in the case of Norbert Engel, a physiotherapist, after expressing his regret over the failure of the 20 July plot to a nurse, saying \\"If it had succeeded, the war would have been over in five days and we'd have been able to go home.\\" Engel was sentenced to death but escaped the sentence by fleeing to the Netherlands.SPD-Politiker Norbert Engel starb im Alter von 87 Jahren. Saarbrücker Zeitung, 22 April 2009.Virtuelles Denkmal \\"Gerechte der Pflege\\": Norbert Engel. Retrieved 16 April 2020. The introduction of the KSSVO marked a new stage in the persecution of the Nazis' political opponents and many thousands of them were killed. According to Wehrmacht criminal statistics, by 30 June 1944 there had been 14,262 convictions for Wehrkraftzersetzung, though German military historian Manfred Messerschmidt says the number of convictions was likely to have been closer to 30,000. The number of convictions and proportion of death sentences steadily increased towards the end of the war as criticism increased and the awaited \\"final victory\\" was pushed further and further into the future. The way the regulation was formulated meant that a conviction generally came from a denunciation by associates, though some convictions came from remarks in letters or slogans written on walls. The nature of denunciations meant the potential accuser could hardly be certain that during the course of the investigation, he would not also be denounced. The fact that every soldier was informed about the consequences of uttering banned speech may have inhibited the number of denunciations.  Use in the Federal Republic of Germany  Nazi Germany surrendered after signing their Instrument of Surrender on 8 May 1945, and the state was formally dissolved on May 23, effectively abolishing Wehrkraftzersetzung in its intended use. The Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany), established in 1949 from the occupation zones of the Western Allies, inherited legislation that had been used by Nazi Germany and its predecessors, including Wehrkraftzersetzung. West Germany's military law featured texts and phrases based on Wehrkraftzersetzung during its existence and after the reunification of Germany, and was not replaced until military law reforms in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Former Wehrkraftzersetzung-based laws are currently regulated under §§ 109-109k of the German criminal code titled \\"Crimes against the Defense of the Country\\" (Straftaten gegen die Landesverteidigung). Offences such as \\"Disturbing Propaganda against the Bundeswehr\\" is § 109d, places penalties on untruthful remarks that \\"disturb the operations of the Bundeswehr\\", as well as § 109 StGB,Strafgesetzbuch Juristischer Informationsdienst.

History The School and Observatory for Earth Sciences was created by decree in 1997 from the fusion of the Geology and Earth Physics institutes of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Strasbourg. Interests in Earth Physics arose around 1880 in Germany with the birth of seismology and meteorology. The origin of the Geology Institute is even older and is linked to the French development of the University during the first half of the 19th century. After the annexation of Alsace by Germany, the Imperial University pursued a policy of elitism, basing its excellence on fundamental research as practiced at the University of Wilhelm von Humboldt (early 19th century). The same model was used when the French Grandes Ecoles were built. Since 1920, the IPGS and the IPGP (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris) conducted research and geophysical observations non-stop, without interruption during the War. Between 1939 and 1945, the IPGS was relocated in Clermont-Ferrand, were the Diplômes d'Ingénieurs were signed by Louis Cagnard, a famous French geophysicist. The school Main building of the EOST and the IPGS The EOST engineering school is a French Grande École specialized in Earth sciences and accredited to deliver European University degrees, such as the Licence/Master/Doctorat, but also the French Diplôme d'Ingénieur.

Research units  EOST hosts two research units: the Institute of Physics of the Earth of Strasbourg IPGS and the Laboratory of hydrology and geochemistry of Strasbourg LHyGeS. = Institute of Physics of the Earth of Strasbourg / Institut de physique du globe de Strasbourg= Once dedicated to more general scientific topics, research at IPGS is currently focused on the comprehension of geological and geophysical phenomenon as well as applied sciences: environment, natural resources (energy, water) and hazards (seismic risks, landslides). = Laboratory of hydrology and geochemistry of Strasbourg / Laboratoire d'hydrologie et de géochimie de Strasbourg= Since its beginning in 2009 by the gathering of 3 research teams, the LHyGeS is dedicated to the analysis and the understanding of hydrological and geochemical phenomenon in natural environments. This unit focuses on the construction of quantitative and predictive patterns, through an approach combining geosciences, environmental and engineering sciences. EOST is the leader of the \\"laboratory of excellence\\" G-eau-thermie profonde project aiming to initiate a new research center for deep geothermal energy. Improving the knowledge of deep geothermal reservoirs and developing techniques are the main goals for the exploitation of this sustainable resource. EOST is involved in the REALISE network (Réseau Alsacien des Laboratoires en Ingénierie et Sciences de l’Environnement) and also provides leadership and administration. This network sets out to structure regional environmental research. Observatories EOST is an Observatory of Universe Sciences (OSU) under the supervisory authority of the CNRS (French national center for scientific research) and the University of Strasbourg. Its missions are to contribute to the monitoring of natural phenomenon and to provide the scientific community with data. Earthquakes, magnetic fields, gravity force, water chemical composition, gravitational instability are some examples of the natural phenomenon observed by EOST. To understand operational mechanisms at different time and space scales require human and instrumental resources. Observation is based on measuring devices relaying data to computer systems acquisition and processing. Maintenance and improvement of these tools are an important part of the mission of the observatories. Data analysis and model building is part of the mission as well as providing the scientific community with data. It aims to the better understanding and prediction of natural phenomenon. Each year, a great amount of published scientific articles are based on data collected by EOST's observational services, organized into themes: seismology, geodesy and gravimetry, magnetism, landslide processes, environment. EOST is the national coordinator (for the BCSF or OHGE) or active participant member of national networks (as the BCMT or RENAG). This network organization allows the sharing of means and skills. = Seismology = The record and analysis of seismic waves enable researchers to understand the earth dynamics and to improve knowledge of seismic hazard. EOST is in charge of measuring devices localized both in the North-East of France and abroad (Sénégal, Terres Austales et Antarctiques Françaises). They are integrated in national (Réseau large Bande Permanent RLBP, Réseau Accélérométrique Permanent,...) and international networks. EOST is the national coordinator of the RLBP as well as the Bureau Central sismologique Français (BCSF) and the Réseau national de surveillance sismique (RéNaSS).These last two centralize all earthquakes data located on the French territory. Instrumental data are completed by population enquiries: the BCSF gathers comments on earthquakes felt in France. * Bureau central sismologique français (BCSF)/ Réseau national de surveillance sismique (RéNaSS) * Réseau large bande permanent (RLBP) * Observatoire sismologique régional du Fossé Rhénan * Géoscope (Terres australes, Antarctique, Sénégal et Alsace) = Geodesy and gravimetry = Geodesy and gravimetry allow the analysis of earth structure and strain. These methods are complementary to seismology. The geodesic observational service of Strasbourg is part of the Réseau National de Géodésie RENAG (national geodesic network). EOST is responsible for 8 GPS stations located in the Rhénan area, assigned to study the tectonic strain of the North-East of France. EOST is also responsible for the Gravimetric observatory of Strasbourg. Through a supraconductive gravimeter, the observatory provides relative and continuous gravity field measurements. The observatory is part of the international project Global Geodynamics Project (GGP). The project MIGA intends to create a new infrastructure based on quantum mechanics. This infrastructure will allow a better comprehension of terrestrial gravity variations and its implications. * RENAG (Fossé rhénan) * Observatoire gravimétrique de Strasbourg = Magnetism = Observation of magnetism aims to comprehend the origins of magnetic fields variations at different time scales. EOST runs six permanent magnetic stations located in the Terres Australes et Antarctiques Française and in Madagascar Island. They are part of the Bureau Central de magnétisme terrestre (BCMT) network, under the supervisory authority of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, and the international network INTERMAGNET (INTERnational Real-time MAGnetic observatory NETwork). * BCMT (Terres australes, Antarctique et Madagascar) = Landslides processes = L’Observatoire multidisciplinaire des instabilités des versants OMIV (Multidisciplinary observatory for landsides processes) follows the evolution of several landslides in France through geophysics, geodesic, geochemical and hydrologic data. EOST is responsible for the Super-Sauze, La Valette (Southern Alps) and Villerville (Normandie) landslides as well as the coordination of the acquisition and the analysis of kinematics data. * Observatoire multidisciplinaire des instabilités des versants = Environment: surfaces et interfaces continentales = The main study site of the Observatoire hydro-géochimique de l’environnement (OHGE) is a granitic catchment basin: the Strengbach. This site is located in the Vosgian massif between 800 and 1100 meters high. The ecosystems and its changes, linked to natural or anthropic disruption, have been studied and monitored for more than twenty-five years throughout a multidisciplinary approach. * Observatoire hydrogéochimique de l’environnement  Museums and collections  The Museum of seismology and terrestrial magnetism, located in the former seismological station of Strasbourg, inaugurated on 1 July 1900, displays instruments for geophysical measurements and their evolution throughout history. The collection of the Museum of mineralogy hosts more than 30 000 international samples of minerals and meteors. Many of the most beautiful pieces are frequently exposed in France and abroad. The museum is situated in a historical monument of EOST, built at the end of the 19th century.

Background  Socialist youth groups had been appearing in Europe since the mid-1880s but there was only discussion of youth organizing on the international scale at the Socialist congress of 1900, in Paris. A resolution was passed on appealing to member parties to organize youth groups, and a meeting of youth representatives was supposedly held. Another meeting at the 1904 world congress in Amsterdam did take place, but without lasting consequences.See The International Federation of Socialist Young People's Organizations 1907-1919 by Gerd Callesen at the Friedrich Ebert Foundation International cooperation on a more permanent basis began during the lead up to the Stuttgart International Socialist Congress of 1907. At the Mannheim conference of the German Social Democratic Youth in September 1906, Karl Leibknecht made a speech about the struggle against militarism, particularly with regard to youth organizations.See Militarism and Anti- Militarism at Marxist Internet Archive. In the Preface he gives September 30, 1906 as the date of his speech It was decided there that an \\"internationale\\" of socialist youth should be attempted.L'Internationale Ouvriere et Socialist, the official report of the Stuttgart Congress, gives the date for this decision as September 28, 1906 Hendrik de Man, a member of the Belgian Workers Party youth group who was studying in Germany, was put in charge of the preparatory work. By December of that year he had begun publishing a Bulletin for the new group in French December 15, 1906, Nr. 01, éd. provisoire and a German version beginning in January 1907.Januar 1907, Nr. 01, provisorische Ausg. By March 1907 a provisional bureau had been established with de Man as secretary and Liebknect and Ludwik Frank as assessors, with a headquarters in Leipzig. The project was endorsed by the International Socialist Bureau, which granted the youth bureau a subsidy.Compte-rendu de la Première Conférence Internationale de la Jeunesse Socialiste tenue à Stuttgart le 24, 25 et 26 août 1907 Gand: Secretariat de la Fédération Internationale de la Jeunesse Socialiste, 1907 pp.22-23 By August 1907 the provisional bureau had already collected a number of written reports from a number of socialist youth organizations and published this in a small pamphlet making detailed reports on the situation in various countries unnecessary at the conference which assembled that month.Compte-rendu de la Première Conférence Internationale... pp.11-12  Stuttgart 1907 The first international socialist youth conference was held at Stuttgart August 24–26, 1907, in conjunction with that year's general international socialist congress.

Berne 1915  After the cancellation of the planned Socialist Youth Conference along with the rest of the International Socialist Congress at Vienna after the outbreak of the First World War the Swiss Socialist youth league began an active correspondence with the Italian and Scandinavian youth organizations with the goal of organizing a conference independently. They contacted Danneberg and the Vienna Bureau, but they were uninterested so the conference went ahead without the official backing of the Federation that had been established at Stuttgart in 1907.Olga Hess Gankin and H.H. Fisher eds, The Bolsheviks and the First World War: the origins of the Third International Stanford University Press, 1940 pp.301-303.

September 1915 Zürich: Bureau der Internat. Sozialist. Jugendorganisation, 1915 pp. 4-21 On April 5–7, 1915 (Easter) a conference of the young socialists was held at the Volkshaus in Berne, Switzerland. This was done n spite of official disapproval of the pro-war parties, much like the Socialist Women's conference held earlier that year in the same city. The following 16 delegates from 10 countries participated:Participation list in Wilhelm Munzenberg Die Sozialistische Jugendinternationale Berlin: Verlag Junge Garde Internationale Sozialistische Jugendbibliotek Heft 3 1919 pp.38-39 *Germany: Notz, Dietrich and StrumIn Sie ist nicht tot... p. 21, the German delegations is given as Schulz (Stuttgart), Meier (Gottingen-Ulm) and Muller (Karlsruhe).

It was decided by a majority that each country would have one vote, after which the Russian delegates withdrew in protest. After they left Grimm and Balabanoff introduced their draft resolution, which was adopted unanimously by all present. The next day the Russian delegation returned with each country given two votes and Poland counted as a country. The Russian and Polish delegates then offered their own resolution which was harsher and the revisionist socialists, state it was necessary to oppose not just this war, but any war of an imperialist character and explicitly stated the means of doing such. This resolution was rejected by a vote of 13 to 3, as were the Russians proposed amendments to the previous resolution.This is the version of events in Sie ist nicht tot... p. 35, and Gankin and Fisher p.306. The report in Berner Tagwacht never mentions the Russians leaving, the Russians resolution was voted down 14 to 4, as were their amendments to the previous resolution. Also, according to the Tagwacht, the main resolution was adopted 13 votes to three with the Dutch and Bolshevik voting against and the Polish delegate abstaining Berner Tagwacht #88 April 17, 1915 p. 1, summary in Gankin and Fisher p.306 n.57 A resolution introduced by the Scandinavian and Swiss delegates also caused dissension. The resolution invited all its affiliate members to bring pressure on their labor movements to achieve complete disarmament. This resolution was passed by a vote of 9 to 5 with all three Russian delegates voting against.Munzenberg p.40, also Gankin and Fisher pp.306-307 The Berne conference also took significant organizational steps. The conference created a new provision seat for the federation, at Zurich, with Munzenberg as secretary and Olaussen, Christiansen, Notz and Cantessi as a new bureau. They charged this new organization with publishing a regular periodical, keep in touch with the member socialist groups, direct co- ordinated propaganda and administer the \\"Leibknekt Fund\\" for victims of the war.Sie ist nicht tot... pp. 36-37, 39 also Gankin and Fisher p.307 On the initiative of the Lutaaren, it was decided to organize a \\"Jugendtag\\", a one protest against the war and militarism across national boundaries by the affiliated socialist youth leagues and co-ordinated the federation.Sie ist nicht tot... pp. 34-35 also Gankin and Fisher p.307 The conference ended with a declaration of sympathy with Rosa Luxemburg and the other victims of wartime persecution.Sie ist nicht tot... pp. 39 = Resolution = The resolution adopted by the conference confirmed its commitment to the previous resolutions made at Stuttgart, Copenhagen and Basel, and regretted that socialist youth leagues, like their parent organizations had not been guided by those decisions. The war was the result of the imperialist policy of all capitalist countries, even in those countries which claimed they were fighting a defensive war, and was incompatible with the interests of the laboring class. \\"Civil peace\\" was an abandonment of the class struggle and the interest of the proletariat. The Socialist gathered at Berne called on the young working masses to renew the proletarian class struggle in order to conclude peace. The resolution went on to condemn the use of socialist youth leagues \\"in the service of bourgeois militarist guards\\" and called on the youth leagues to concentrate on socialist education (which would show that war was an inevitable feature of capitalism) and the renewal of the struggle against capitalism and militarism.Gankin and Fisher pp.307-308  See also  *International Socialist Women's Conferences Notes  References  Category:History of socialism Category:Second International ","title":"International Federation of Socialist Young People's Organizations"},{"id":"32981233","text":"The Marriage Price is a 1919 American silent romantic drama film produced by Famous Players-Lasky and distributed through Paramount Pictures and Artcraft.

The obverse features a head of Fortuna. The reverse depicts a laurel wreath, a palm frond, and a caduceus, emblems of a triumph, indicating Sicinius' hope for a Pompeian victory. The gens Sicinia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens occur throughout the history of the Republic, but only one of them obtained the consulship, Titus Sicinius Sabinus in 487 BC. Throughout the long Conflict of the Orders, the Sicinii were celebrated for their efforts on behalf of the plebeians.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 815, 816 (\\"Sicinia Gens\\"). Origin The only hint as to the origin of the Sicinii comes from the surname Sabinus, applied to one of the first members of this family appearing in history. Sabinus belongs to a common class of surnames derived from the names of peoples or localities, and suggests that the Sicinii may have been of Sabine origin.Chase, pp. 113, 114. Although the earliest Sicinii occurring in history were plebeians, as were all of the later members of this gens, some scholars have concluded that Titus Sicinius Sabinus must have been a patrician, and the gens originally a patrician family, since the consulship was opened to the plebeians by the lex Licinia Sextia in 367 BC, a hundred and twenty years after Sabinus. But more recent scholarship suggests that the consulship was not originally restricted to the patricians, and only became so in the years following the decemvirate, from 451 to 449 BC.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 252–256. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Sicinii were Lucius, Gaius, Gnaeus, Titus, and Quintus, all of which were common throughout Roman history. The early generations of the family may have used Spurius, but the nomen of this individual is uncertain, and he may not have been a member of the same family. Branches and cognomina The Sicinii do not seem to have been divided into distinct branches, and most of those mentioned in history bore no cognomen. Of those that do appear, Vellutus or Bellutus seems to be derived from vellus, wool, and must have designated someone with conspicuously abundant or wooly hair.New College Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. vellutus. Sabinus referred to a Sabine, presumably referring either to a tradition that the Sicinii were of Sabine extraction, or that the individual to whom the surname was first applied had the characteristic habits or appearance of a Sabine. Dentatus would have been applied to someone with prominent teeth.Chase, p. 109. Members * Lucius Sicinius L. f. Bellutus or Vellutus, one of the plebeian leaders during the secession of the plebs to the Sacred Mount in 494 BC. He was subsequently elected one of the first tribunes of the plebs, and was aedile in 492. He was tribune of the plebs a second time in 491, and opposed the harsh measures proposed by Coriolanus.Livy, ii. 32–34.Dionysius, vi. 45, 70, vii. 14, 33–39.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 15–18. * Spurius Sicinius Bellutus, tribune of the plebs in 492 BC, perhaps a brother of Lucius, although some scholars think him a mistake for Spurius Icilius, otherwise his colleague in the tribunate.Dionysius, vii. 14, 17.Broughton, vol. I, p. 17. * Titus Sicinius Sabinus, consul in 487 BC, defeated the Volsci and received a triumph. He was a legate under the consul Manlius in 480.Dionysius, ix. 12.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 19, 20 (note 1), 25. * Gaius Sicinius, tribune of the plebs in BC 470, the first year that the tribunes were elected by the comitia tributa. Together with his colleague, Marcus Duilius, he attempted to prosecute Appius Claudius Sabinus, the consul of the preceding year, for opposing an agrarian law.Broughton, vol. I, p. 31. * Lucius Sicinius Dentatus, tribune of the plebs in 454 BC, was a famous warrior, described by ancient historians as \\"the Roman Achilles\\", for his courage and martial prowess. Under the second decemvirate, he encouraged the people to secede again, and was assassinated by the decemvirs.Dionysius, x. 48–52, xi. 25–27.Livy, iii. 43.Aulus Gellius, ii. 11.Pliny the Elder, vii. 27.Valerius Maximus, ii. 3. § 24.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. ii, p. 346.Broughton, vol.

Together with his colleagues, he called for the election of new consuls to replace the decemvirs, to restore the right of appeal, and for there to be no retribution against the leaders of the secession.Livy, iii. 54.Broughton, vol. I, p. 48. * Titus Sicinius, tribune of the plebs in BC 395, he proposed the establishment of a substantial colony at Veii, the great Etruscan rival of Rome, which had been conquered by Camillus the previous year.Livy, v. 24.Broughton, vol. I, p. 89. * Lucius Sicinius, tribune of the plebs in BC 387, proposed a law distributing arable land in the ager Pomptinus.Livy, vi. 6.Broughton, vol. I, p. 99. * Gnaeus Sicinius, aedile in BC 185, and praetor in 183, received the province of Sardinia. Praetor for the second time in 172, he spent his year of office forming alliances and raising troops for the Third Macedonian War, and was propraetor the following year, assigned the province of Macedonia.Livy, xxxix. 39, 45, xli. 13, xlii. 9, 10, 27, xliii. 5.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 372, 379, 411, 414 (note 1), 417. * Gnaeus Sicinius, tribune of the plebs in BC 76, led the assault on the Sullan law, which deprived the tribunes of much of their power. He harshly criticized the aristocracy, but Cicero relates that he was a poor orator, his chief virtue being the ability to make his audience laugh.Cicero, Brutus, 60.Pseudo- Asconius, In Divinatio, p. 103 (ed. Orelli).Quintilian, xi. 3. § 129.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Crassus\\", 7.Sallust, Historiae, iii. 22Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. iv, p. 385.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 93, 96 (note 2). * Gaius Sicinius, a grandson of Quintus Pompeius, the consul of BC 141, was quaestor circa 70 BC, but died before his career could advance further. Cicero mentions him among those Romans who had developed a talent for oratory.Cicero, Brutus, 76.Broughton, vol. II, p. 128. * Sicinius, mentioned in one of Cicero's letters to Titus Pomponius Atticus, dating to 51 BC.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, v. 4. § 3. * Quintus Sicinius, triumvir monetalis in 49 BC, possibly the same as the man mentioned by Cicero in 51. A supporter of Pompeius, with whom he departed Rome ahead of Caesar's approach, but he continued to mint coins for Pompeius during their flight.Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage, pp. 460-462. * Sicinius Amicus, the first husband of Aemilia Pudentilla, and father of Sicinius Pontianus and Sicinius Pudens. After his death, his elder son encouraged a friend, the writer Apuleius, to marry Pudentilla, who was quite wealthy.Apuleius, Apologia, 68. * Sicinius Aemilianus, the brother of Sicinius Amicus and Sicinius Clarus, and uncle of Sicinius Pontianus and Sicinius Pudens, was persuaded by Herennius Rufus to join the accusation against Apuleius.Apuleius, Apologia, 2, 28, 98. * Sicinius Clarus, the brother of Sicinius Amicus and Sicinius Aemilianus, described by Apuleius as a feeble old country gentleman. * Sicinius Pontianus, a native of Oea, and friend of Apuleius at Athens. He encouraged Apuleius to marry his mother, Pudentilla, a wealthy widow. However, Pontianus' father-in-law, Herennius Rufinus, eager to ensure that Prudentilla's money should remain in his family, induced Pontianus, his younger brother, Sicinius Pudens, and his uncle, Sicinius Aemilianus, to charge Apuleius with gaining Prudentilla's affections through witchcraft. Apuleius' spirited and ultimately successful defense formed the basis of his Apologia, or \\"Discourse on Magic\\".Apuleius, Apologia, passim. * Pontianus Pudens, the younger brother of Sicinius Pontianus, was only a boy when Herennius Rufus persuaded him to join the accusation against Apuleius. * Marcus Sicinius Philodamus, a boy buried at Rome, was the son of a vir egregius, a member of the equestrian nobility of the late second or early third centuries.. * Quintus Sicinius Clarus, governor of Thrace circa AD 202.PIR, vol.

It awarded the best in Brazilian music, popular culture and internet culture in the year of 2011. For this edition, the concept has undergone a major makeover; after the happy rock band Restart winning all the 5 categories in which it was indicated in the previous edition by its large number of fans voting exaggeratedly (including Act of the Year), and not by its merit; and also the renewal of the station's programming in 2011, which favored even more the music. Under the awards theme \\"A música não para\\" (The music never stops), this VMB went to have a 100-member expert jury - the VMB Academy - to choose seven of the 11 awards; three new categories: Best Album, Best Album Art and Best Music; and the indication of many independent artists, like Emicida, Marcelo Jeneci and Criolo, valuing the musical production. However, the VMB didn't neglected the pop artists and web hits, keeping categories as Hit of the Year, Web Hit of the Year and Best International Act, and adding a new category: Best Web Video (Video musics made for internet). For the first time, the VMB was held in a television studio (Quanta Studios), unlike the other editions, which were held in auditoriums such as Credicard Hall and Parque de Convenções do Anhembi. MTV Brasil considers that its structure was the largest in the history of the awards. And it was still divided into three stages: one for the main show, other for the VMBB (The B-side of VMB) and other for the VIP party - which this time took place simultaneously with the main show, and not after it. The first two stages had different live broadcasts - the main show on TV and Internet, and VMBB exclusively on the Internet. Some presentations of the awards - which had several of the meeting of 30 invited artists - had characterized the artists playing simultaneously and synchronously at the three stages of the event. Nominations The nominees were revealed on August 26, 2011. Criolo and Marcelo Jeneci have received the most nominations, tied at five. Criolo won 3 awards. =VMB Academy= Act of the Year * Emicida * Criolo * Marcelo Camelo * Marcelo Jeneci * NX Zero Video of the Year * Emicida - \\"Então Toma!\\" * Criolo - \\"Subirusdoistiozin\\" * Garotas Suecas - \\"Banho de Bucha\\" * Jota Quest - \\"É Preciso (A Próxima Parada)\\" * Lurdez da Luz - \\"Andei\\" * Mallu Magalhães - \\"Nem Fé, Nem Santo\\" * Mombojó - \\"Antimonotonia\\" * Móveis Coloniais de Acaju - \\"O Tempo\\" * Pitty - \\"Só Agora\\" * Thiago Pethit - \\"Nightwalker\\" Best Song * Criolo – \\"Não Existe Amor em SP\\" * Marcelo Camelo – \\"Ôô\\" * Marcelo Jeneci – \\"Feito pra Acabar\\" * Marina Lima feat.

After staying a hotel named Hongjewon (弘濟院), the envoys of the Manchu Qing Empire reached Mohwagwan (慕華館 lit. building of longing for China), where they received a reception from the king, and then entered the capital. Akdun (; Manchu: Akdun; Styled: Lixuan 立軒, ) (May 4, 1685- February 22, 1756) was an official of the Qing Dynasty He was a member of the Janggiya (章佳) clan and of the Manchu Plain Blue Banner. He was the father of the Qing Dynasty official and general Agui. Biography After receiving the Jǔrén degree in 1708 and his Jìnshì degree in 1709, Akdun became successively a bachelor from 1709–12, a compiler from 1712–15, an expositor from 1715–16, and a reader from 1716-17 in the Hanlin Academy. In 1717 he was sent as head of a mission to Korea, with re-appointments in 1722 and 1724. His impressive appearance and his dignified bearing lead to him being well received on all of these occasions . From 1718 to 1726 he served other posts, as sub-chancellor of the Grand Secretariat from 1718–22,as junior vice-president of the Board of War from 1722–23, chancellor of the Hanlin Academy from 1722–25, as senior vice-president of the Board of Ceremonies in 1726 and on the Board of War in 1726. When Kong Yuxun (孔毓珣) was summoned for an audience with the emperor in 1726, Akdun was sent to take his place as acting governor-general of Guangdong and Guangxi, and in addition was made Tartar General of Canton. In the following year he was transferred to the post of acting governor of Guangdong, and later in the same year to that of Guangxi. Unfortunately he did not get on well with his colleagues, and in 1728 as the result of charges brought against him by Kong Yuxun and Yang Wenqian (楊文乾), he was deprived of his office and titles. Three years later in 1731, he was reinstated as an extra sub- chancellor of the Grand Secretariat, serving in the army of the Northwest in a campaign against the Oirats. This campaign was a failure and proved embarrassing to the government, in 1734 Akdun was made assistant to Funai (傅鼐) in the peace negotiations held at the tribal headquarters at Ili. Failing to accomplish its aims, the Commission returned to Beijing in the spring of 1735. Late in 1738 Akdun was put in charge of another Commission and succeeded in concluding a boundary agreement. After his return to Beijing, early in 1739, he filled many posts, among them the following: junior and senior vice- president both of the Board of Works from 1738–40 and of the Board of Punishments in 1740; senior vice-president of the Board of Civil Office in 1740-46, serving concurrently as lieutenant-general of the Chinese Plain White Banner in 1742 and of the Manchu Bordered Blue Banner in 1743; chancellor of the Hanlin Academy in 1745-48; and president of the Censorate in 1746. He was also president of the Board of Punishments in 1746-48, and Associate Grand Secretary 1748. In 1748 an error was made in the Manchu translation of an edict framed by the Hanlin Academy conferring a posthumous title upon Consort Donggo. Since Akdun was the chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, he was deprived of his post, but remained to serve as sub-chancellor of the Grand Secretariat. Soon after, he was re-appointed president of the Board of Punishments, serving concurrently as lieutenant-general of the Chinese Bordered White Banner, and later as chancellor of the Hanlin Academy. Early in 1749 he was reinstated as Associate Grand Secretary. Thereafter he served the imperial government without interruption until his retirement in 1755 owing to declining eyesight. During his last years of service, when the emperor was journeying to Jehol, Henan, and Fengtian, he was entrusted three times (1749, 1750, and 1754) with the conduct of affairs at the capital. He died early in 1756 and was canonized as Wenqin (). References * Chang, S.K, Yang, J.C. \\"A-k'o-tun.\\" edited by Hummel, Arthur W. (1943). Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period.

Malvern is an unincorporated community located in the town of Pelican, Oneida County, Wisconsin, United States. Malvern is east-southeast of Rhinelander. History Malvern was established sometime on or after October 1882, when a Milwaukee, Lake Shore and Western Railroad spur was built from Monico to Rhinelander. In June 1893, this rail line was purchased by the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad. At about this time, a train stop with elevated platform was built just east of the intersection of the current North Pelican Lake Road and the abandoned rail line. There were also logging rail spurs/landings located in Malvern, along with several logging camps. There were also several homes, and a tavern - of which the foundations still exist. A one room school house was built nearby at the intersection of Haymeadow Creek and the old Highway 27, which was later relocated to near Rhinelander in the town of Pelican. It still exists and can be seen along County Highway P, near the current Pelican school. One of Malvern's original settlers was a Mr. Louis C Miller, who acquired the north-west part of the NW quarter section of Section 18 via the Federal Homestead Act in 1898. His cabin was located south of the wagon road that lay south of the railroad tracks, and he cleared approximately 25 acres of land. His cabin site and land clearing rock piles exist to this day. A post office called Malvern operated from 1902 until 1906. The name of the community commemorates the Virginia Battle of Malvern Hill.

She wrote, Her work introduced two fundamental innovations: the decimal point (today called the virgule in French) to separate the mantissa of the decimal parts, as well as the use of a zero in the decimal part to indicate that a place is absent. In doing this, she gave form to current decimal numbers. She named the zeroes nuls as the Germans were doing. Talented in writing as well as mathematics, she developed among other things the method of Pestalozzi and what she called denominational division, which has great utility for mental calculations, notably in its application in the rule of three.

Berlioz and his century – an introduction to the age of romanticism. Meridian Books, New York, 1956. David's friends and colleagues Charles Duveyrier (half brother of Mélesville) and Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin took it upon themselves to challenge a contract David had innocently signed with Escudier which had given the publisher the rights to all David's works for ever, for only 1,200 francs. Le désert was successful from its premiere and influenced the conception of works based around the orient by many other French composers. David later wrote other works in similar vein, such as his operas La perle du Brésil and Lalla-Roukh. The work is scored for speaker, tenor solo, male chorus and orchestra. It consists of several vocal and orchestral movements, each introduced by a recitation. The different sections of the ode move from the song of the desert, arrival of a caravan, storm in the desert, calm after the storm and the caravan continuing its journey, the star of Venus, a hymn to the night, dances, sunrise, the song of the muezzin, departure of the caravan and song to Allah. Le désert was planned to be staged as an opera at the Théâtre Lyrique to accompany La sonnambula in 1867, but these plans did not come to fruition.

With the payments she received from Shaw's likeness Lewis was able to fund her trip to Rome, Italy in 1865.

Another great inspiration of hers was the work of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his poem, The Song of Hiawatha, and she sculpted a bust in his honor due to her admiration.

Beside the man is a woman on her knees praying. In 1876, Lewis' work was shown at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. Lewis's epic work, The Death of Cleopatra, was presented for the occasion. In this piece she portrayed the Egyptian queen in a vulnerable state, which was unprecedented for the time. Artist William J.

Angel De Cora, painter In the late 1800s Angel De Cora (Ho-chunk) was a painter and writer who contributed to art as a Native American who had been assimilated through a policy put forth by President Grant. Her earliest paintings appeared with her own stories, The Sick Child and The Grey Wolf's Daughter, in Harper's Magazine. In her writing De Cora sought to change attitudes about Native Americans and described situations everyone could relate to. De Cora had a talent with combining a mix of Native American painting style with the mainstream European American style popular at the time, otherwise described as transculturation, and reflected the emotions from her stories in her art. Her success with her stories in Harper's helped her start a career in illustrating books about Native Americans for children. Though she had other interests in art, she was encouraged by her professors to pursue Native American influenced art because of their idea that art and ethnicity were linked.Hutchinson, E. (2001). Modern Native American art: Angel De Cora's transcultural aesthetics. The Art Bulletin, 83(4), pg. 740-756. Though De Cora flourished as an artist, she was still torn between two identities that were placed on her: one the noble savage, the other a product of successful assimilation, and though Harper's had published her work, it described her as a \\"naive ... Indian girl,\\"As quoted in a Harper's press release in A Native American literature. (1899, December). Red Man, 15(10),pg. 8. and one of her mentors only had this to say about her: \\"Unfortunately she was a woman and still more unfortunately an American Indian.\\"Curtis, N. (January 20, 1920). An American Indian artist. Outlook, pg. 64-66. In 1900 De Cora was given the opportunity to design the frontispiece for ethnologist Francis LaFlesche's book, The Middle Five, and soon after won a contest to also design the book's cover. On the cover she created her own typography with its own Native American influence and illustrated it with the simplistic style that was popular at the time. Not long after De Cora became a professor of Native Indian Art at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1906 and was invested in building an appreciation for Native American art and history with the idea in mind to bring Native American art into mainstream culture.Proulx, A. (June 25, 2005). Saturday review: essay: how the west was spun: the image of the cowboy as a noble pioneer taming a savage land still has a powerful hold. The Guardian, Guardian Saturday Pages, pg. 4. De Cora felt art was central to the economic survival and preservation of Native American cultureHutchinson, E. (2009).

(2007). American Indian nonfiction: an anthology of writings, 1760s-1930s. Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press. By doing so, De Cora enabled a trend toward art. She knew Native Americans would eventually leave certain aspects of their culture behind in time, but she also felt art would be one of the things to create a united community and help Native Americans to be proud of their heritage. \\"He may shed his outer skin, but his markings lie below that and should show up only the brighter,\\" she said of Native Americans during a speech in a 1911 proceeding of the Society of American Indians.De Cora, A.

Dat So La Lee, basket weaverThough the history of Dat So La Lee is slightly of a mythic quality, what is known of her is her discovery as a washerwoman by Amy and Abe Cohn in 1895, who found her baskets incredibly intriguing. The Cohns began selling her baskets in their shop in 1899 to tourists of Lake Tahoe.Moreno, R. (Ed.)(1998). The historical Nevada Magazine: outstanding historical features from the pages of Nevada Magazine. Las Vegas: University of Nevada Press. Though her basketry was revered, like many Native Americans of the day Dat So La Lee was presented by Amy Cohn as the noble savage through her lectures. \\"To the whole audience there was no incongruity in having a white woman explain the basket's symbols, while the weaver herself remained silent.\\"Cohodas, M. (1998). In R. Moreno (Ed.), The historical Nevada Magazine: outstanding historical features from the pages of Nevada Magazine (pg. 91). Las Vegas: University of Nevada Press. Further, Dat So La Lee's image was displayed on flyers as a simple-minded, unattractive native who Abe Cohn had to put up with. The Cohns fabricated much of her life for their own advertising purposes. It was Dat So La Lee who created the degikup style of basket weaving, though Amy Cohn preferred to boast in lectures this was of the native \\"pre-contamination\\" past (that is, before European settlers had appeared). During this time much appropriation and romanticization of Native American culture was popular, and this was not necessarily out of place: Amy Cohn would dress in native regalia for her lectures. Eventually, as a ploy to raise the demand for baskets, the Cohns announced that baskets would be made less and less due to Dat So La Lee's oncoming blindness,Berlo, J.C. (1992). The early years of Native American art history: the politics of scholarship and collecting. Seattle: University of Washington Press. though a reporter at the time who interviewed Abe Cohn blamed the decrease on alcoholism.Van Loan, C.E.

Retrieved from > http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/Jensen/NAW.html Jennie Ross Cobb (Cherokee) began to break stereotypes about Native Americans by presenting Cherokee women who were \\"poised, self-assured, fashionable, confident carriers of two cultures and extremely proud of their Cherokee heritage.\\" Cobb, the great granddaughter of Cherokee chief John Ross, began photography as a child in Tahlequah, Oklahoma after receiving a camera from her father.Tsinhnahjinnie, H, & Passalacqua, V. (Eds.) (2006). Our people, our land, our images: international Indigenous photographers. California: Heyday Books. Though formal poses were more traditional at the time, Cobb insisted on taking photographs of women as they did daily activities. Through her photography Cobb was able to capture women with the care that no other photographer could have brought to the medium. This was attributed to Cobb's close connection to her subjects and the ability to, as Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie puts it, \\"truly (imagine) Native American women with love and a humanizing eye.\\"Tsinhnahjinnie, H. (2003). When is a photograph worth a thousand words? In C. Pinney & N. Peterson (Eds.), Photography's other histories. North Carolina: Duke University Press Books. As a child Mabel McKay (Pomo) had dreams that foresaw her roles of a sucking doctor and basket weaver. During these dreams she learned to weave baskets as young as six years old and was inspired for designs and their special uses.Sarris, G. (1994). Mabel McKay: weaving the dream. Berkeley: University of California Press. McKay believed \\"baskets are living entities, not just pretty objects to look at, and each basket has a particular purpose.\\" She connected baskets with her healing as a doctor and would give a patient a basket of their own. McKay began holding classes to share her basket weaving skills and helped to introduce traditional basket weaving to those outside of the Native American community. During the 1950s and 1960s McKay also made public-speaking engagements at universities and museums in California on Native American culture and the art of basket weaving.Bibby, B. (1996). The fine art of California Indian basketry. California: Heyday Books. By 1975, McKay was known as the last remaining spiritual adviser of the Pomoans. McKay said of her basket weaving, \\"It's no such thing art. I only follow my dream. That's how I learn.\\" By 1920 an interest was growing for Native American art, either made by or influenced by Native Americans. Pop Chalee, who originally came from Taos Pueblo, ended up running away from her mother's home in Utah when she was only sixteen years old. She and her family settled in Taos Pueblo where, for the most part, she felt like an outsider. These clashing feelings made Chalee and her family decide to move back to Utah. Chalee began attending the Santa Fe Indian School in 1930 as a student of Dorothy Dunn. Chalee was taught in a specific design which would come to be associated with the Kiowa Movement. At Dunn's studio, Native American students were encouraged for the first time to pursue a career in art.Farris, P. (Ed.), Women artists of color: a bio-critical sourcebook to 20th century artists in the Americas. Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group. In 1936 one of Chalee's paintings was purchased by Disney as an inspiration for Bambi. After graduating Chalee was commissioned to paint a mural for Maisel's Trading Post along with fellow artists of the time: Awa Tsireh, Joe H. Herrera, Pablita Velarde, Harrison Begay, and Popovi Da. Chalee, and continued to paint murals which included sites such as the Albuquerque Airport and the Santa Fe Railroad. Chalee was not just a visual artist. She also performed while promoting the film version of Annie Get Your Gun, telling stories, lecturing, and even singing while wearing native dress and elaborate accessories.Heller, J. (1995). North American women artists of the twentieth century: a biographical dictionary. London: Taylor & Francis Routledge. Around the same time as Pop Chalee was gaining popularity, another artist, Ellen Neel, was taking risks in Canada by taking part in potlatch.Palmer, C.B. (2008). Renegotiating identity: \\"primitivism\\" in 20th-century art as family narrative. Frontiers: a journal of women studies, 29(2&3), pgs. 186-223.

An iron hand upon the people: the law against the potlatch on the northwest coast Seattle: University of Washington Press Neel (Kwakwaka'wakw) was a totem woodcarver who was the first to transfer elements of her totem designs to paper and fabricTownsend-Gault, C. (1994). Northwest coast art: the culture of the land claims. American Indian Quarterly, 18(4), pgs. 445-467. and carved miniature poles for tourists. In 1946 Neel opened Totem Arts Studios and began her work in a former World War II bunker. During this time she also worked on repairing and restoring older poles for the University of British Columbia, but this work proved tedious and time-consuming, and she eventually returned to work on her own art.Kramer, P. (2008). Totem poles. British Columbia: Heritage House Publishing. In 1955 Neel carved five totem poles for Woodward's department store.Stewart, H. (1993). Looking at totem poles. Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre. In her history, Neel also carved major poles for Stratford, Ontario, and the Museum of Copenhagen in Denmark. \\"In spite of the fact that she predated (Mungo Martin) and acted as his mentor, Canadian Council turned down a request to fund her totem pole projects as late as 1960.\\" She would die six years later. As Ellen Neel was becoming nationally renowned for her carving work, Jaune Quick-To-See Smith (Flathead Salish) was still in high school, completing a correspondence art course from Famous Artists School. Born in 1940, Quick-To-See Smith did not have an entirely stable childhood. As a daughter of a migrant worker, her family was constantly moving, and she lived in foster homes intermittently. Her father would later inspire Quick-To-See Smith's art in the area of aesthetics,Lippard, L.R. (2000). Mixed blessings: new art in a multicultural America. Canada: The New Press. and by 1978 Quick-To-See Smith would display her paintings in her first solo art show before she had even completed her M.F.A. at University of New Mexico.

Jaune said in 1994 about her work: > My paintings are expressing my feelings about particular things. They are > not generic works ...
