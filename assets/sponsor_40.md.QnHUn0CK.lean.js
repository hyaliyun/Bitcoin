It was roughly bounded by San Felipe Avenue, El Camino Real, San Juan Avenue, and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. The Southern Pacific acquired the original San Francisco to San Jose railroad, which was built in the 1860s. Southern Pacific operated both passenger and freight trains along the route. An interurban railroad ran parallel to the Southern Pacific, from San Francisco to San Mateo. Lomita Park's school children used the interurban trains to go to high school, first at San Mateo High School (from 1902 to 1923) and then at Burlingame High School (from 1923 to 1950). The completion of Capuchino High School in September 1950 enabled Lomita Park children to walk to school. In 1912, El Camino Real was paved through San Bruno and Lomita Park. This was the first paved state highway in California. Originally a two- lane highway, El Camino Real was widened to four lanes in the late 1920s. It was part of the original routing of U.S. Route 101; in the early 1960s, it was designated State Route 82. El Camino Real is now mostly a six-lane highway, running from South San Francisco to San Jose. In 1927, a post office was established in the community with the name \\"Belmae Park,\\" combining the names of Belle Mae Miggis the first post office lady.].\\" The name was changed to Lomita Park in 1933. The post office closed in 1957, but postal offices have continued in San Bruno and Millbrae. In 1953, San Bruno annexed the community.

The story concerns a teenage girl who joins a local repertory theatre troupe in Liverpool. During a winter production of Peter Pan, the play quickly turns into a dark metaphor for youth as she becomes drawn into a web of sexual politics and intrigue. The title is an ironic nod to the original Peter Pan story, in which Peter says, \\"To die will be an awfully big adventure.\\" Set in 1947, the film was adapted from the Booker Prize-nominated novel of the same name by Beryl Bainbridge. Plot In the film's prologue, a hotelier ushers a child into a bomb shelter during the Liverpool Blitz. We see a brief flashback to a woman leaving her baby in a basement surrounded by flickering candles. Before departing from the house, she quickly drops a string of pearls on the child's pillow, twined around a single rose. Years later, 16-year-old Stella Bradshaw lives in a working class household with her Uncle Vernon and Aunt Lily in Liverpool. Lacking an adult in her life to whom she feels close, she frequently goes into phone booths to \\"speak with her mother\\", who never appears in the film. Her uncle, who sees a theatrical career as being her only alternative to working behind the counter at Woolworth's, signs her up for speech lessons and pulls strings to get her involved at a local repertory theatre. After an unsuccessful audition, Stella gets a job gofering for Meredith Potter, the troupe's sleazy, eccentric director, and Bunny, his faithful stage manager. The impressionable Stella develops a crush on the worldly, self-absorbed Meredith, whose homosexuality completely eludes her. Amused, he gives her the small role of Ptolemy the boy-king in Caesar and Cleopatra but ignores her otherwise. Meredith reveals himself to be an amoral, apathetic man who treats Stella and everyone else around him with scorn and condescension. He reserves his greatest cruelty for Dawn Allenby, a desperate older actress whom he callously dismisses from the company; she later attempts suicide. Meredith also has a long history of preying upon young men. Stella is quickly caught up in the backstage intrigue and also becomes an object of sexual advances from men in and around the theatre company, including P. L. O'Hara (Alan Rickman), a brilliant actor who has returned to the troupe in a stint playing Captain Hook for its Christmas production of Peter Pan. In keeping with theatrical tradition, O'Hara also doubles as Mr. Darling. O'Hara carries himself with grace and charisma, but privately is as troubled and disillusioned as the other members of the cast. Haunted by his wartime experiences and a lost love who he believes bore him a son, O'Hara embarks on an affair with Stella, to whom he feels an inexplicably deep emotional connection. Stella, who is still determined to win over Meredith, remains emotionally detached, but takes advantage of O'Hara's affections, seeing an opportunity to gain sexual experience. The last straw for Stella is during a cast outing when Geoffrey, a fellow teenage stagehand whom Potter has been sexually toying with, bursts out and hits him in the nose. The cast rushes to comfort Geoffrey, but Stella exclaims that he ought to be sacked. O'Hara explains to her that Meredith has spent his life harming people like Geoffrey and causing pain to people like Bunny who really love him: \\"believe it or not, it doesn't much matter him or her, old or young to Meredith. What he wants is hearts.\\" Concerned, O'Hara visits her aunt and uncle, who disclose Stella's history. He finds out that Stella's long-missing mother was his lost love, whom he then knew by the nickname Stella Maris, making Stella ‚Å†‚Äî whom he's been sleeping with ‚Å†‚Äî his child, a daughter rather than the son he had imagined. Keeping his discovery to himself, O'Hara gets on his motorcycle and drives back out to the seaport. He distractedly slips on the wet gangplank, hits his head, and is pitched into the water. Before he drowns, he sees the woman from earlier flashbacks, clutching the infant. Stella is later seen hastening to the phone booth to confide her woes over the phone. The absent Stella Maris had years ago won a nationwide contest to be the voice of the speaking clock. It is her recorded voice that provides the only response to her daughter's confidences.

Upon rejection, she dyed her hair red, changed her name and reinvented herself as a teenage girl from Liverpool with no acting experience and applied again. The second time she got the role. Alan Rickman was reportedly miffed when he found out her true age. According to Mike Newell, he \\"treated her very tactfully, presuming that she was sexually inexperienced and could get upset by the scene.\\" Hugh Grant based his characterization of Meredith on Richard Digby Day, a past director of his from Nottingham Playhouse. Principal photography took place mostly in Dublin; the playhouse in the film was the Olympia Theatre. Soundtrack A soundtrack album was released on 20 June 1995 by Silva Screen Records. In addition to the original film score composed by Richard Hartley, the Irish folk song \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\" is used as O'Hara's theme music throughout the film. Release =Box office= The film did not perform well at the box office, earning only $593,350 domestically and $258,195 in the United States. However, Georgina Cates received a London Film Critics Circle Award nomination for Best Actress of the Year and Mike Newell was nominated for a Crystal Globe Award for Best Director at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. =Critical reception= The film received mixed reviews. Although Rickman and Grant were unanimously praised, many audiences were indifferent to its bleak, subtle humor and episodic structure. Lisa Schwartzenbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"Rickman ... is the most interesting thing going in this unwieldy muddle ... There's a creepy allure to O'Hara, and it is his energy that moves the story along to its unsettling surprise ending.\\" Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"This isn't a sentimental slice of British eccentricity, or a gentle glance at amateur theatricals and the oddballs who inhabit them . . . Instead, it's a sour, unpleasant experience that gives us every reason not to become involved. Newell, who directed Four Weddings with such a light touch and such fondness, leaves the impression here that he doesn't like his characters and doesn't mind if we don't, either.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times, however, felt that it captured \\"Mr. Grant as the clever, versatile character actor he was then becoming, rather than the international dreamboat he is today . . . [the film] isn't overly concerned with making its stars look good. Mr. Grant wears a monocle, has nicotine-stained fingers and appears in one scene looking dissolute and vomit-stained . . . As it turns out, a public relations blackout is only the least of this admirable film's problems. Its Liverpool accents are thickly impenetrable. And Ms. Bainbridge's book is elliptical to begin with, which guarantees that some of its fine points will be lost in translation. Mr. Newell directs his actors beautifully, but the screenplay by Charles Wood echoes Ms. Bainbridge in letting important information fly by obliquely. So listen closely. This is a dark, eccentric film that both requires and rewards keen attention.\\" Similarly, Joel Pearce of DVD Verdict commented that \\"An Awfully Big Adventure is disappointing, but not because it's a bad movie . . . In fact, it's a good movie that's been the victim of extremely bad marketing ... Hugh Grant is at his sleazy, sardonic best . . . Some elements of the film are too subtle, so it takes a while to figure out what's really going on.\\" Alan Rickman said that he felt the film suffered comparisons to Four Weddings and a Funeral. =Honours= * Crystal Globe - Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Czech Republic (nominated) * Actress of the Year (Georgina Cates) - London Film Critics Circle (nominated) References External links  Category:1995 films Category:1995 LGBT-related films Category:British films Category:British comedy-drama films Category:British coming-of-age films Category:British independent films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films set in 1947 Category:Films set in Liverpool Category:Films directed by Mike Newell Category:Incest in film Category:Juvenile sexuality in films ","title":"An Awfully Big Adventure"},{"id":"17324747","text":"The Canada Science and Technology Museum () is located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, on St. Laurent Boulevard, to the south of the Queensway (Highway 417).

In October 1966 the government appointed David McCurdy Baird as the first director of the museum; because it was intended that the museum would open during the centennial year, Baird's first task was to find an existing building that could be repurposed without delay to house the museum. He found and arranged the purchase of a large former bakery on St. Laurent Boulevard with truck bays and high ceilings.\\"A 'make-do' operation: Canada Science and Technology Museum 50th anniversary story from 2007\\".

GOODS is intended to enable astronomers to study the formation and evolution of galaxies in the distant, early universe. GOODS Field (Hubble component) The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey consists of optical and near- infrared imaging taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope, the Very Large Telescope and the 4-m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory; infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. These are added to pre-existing x-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESAs XMM-Newton, two fields of 10' by 16'; one centered on the Hubble Deep Field North (12h 36m 55s, +62¬∞ 14m 15s) and the other on the Chandra Deep Field South (3h 32m 30s, -27¬∞ 48m 20s). The two GOODS fields are the most data-rich areas of the sky in terms of depth and wavelength coverage.

(scioly reference by Ashrith) Many GOODS Objects, such as GOODS-S 29323, are potential evidence for the formation of direct collapse black holes. In this case, GOODS-S 29323 is 13.2 billion light years away from Earth. This distance portrays interest into the early universe, where matter was in large, dense, quantities. This distance leads to a possible conclusion that due to matter particles exerting gravity on themselves, they would instantly collapse, forming the earliest supermassive black holes that we know of in the center of many galaxies.

Early life Yevstigneyev was born into a Russian peasant family on in the village of Khokhly, Chelyabinsky Uyezd, Orenburg Governorate, in what is now the Shumikhinsky District of Kurgan Oblast, in Russia's trans- Urals. He completed seven grades of schooling in 1935 before moving on to vocational school. He trained as a fitter-turner and upon graduation in 1936 moved to work at the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, where he joined the local aeroclub which he graduated from in 1938.

Marvel 1602 is an eight-issue comic book limited series published in 2003 by Marvel Comics. The limited series was written by Neil Gaiman, penciled by Andy Kubert, and digitally painted by Richard Isanove; Scott McKowen illustrated the distinctive scratchboard covers. The eight-part series takes place in a timeline where Marvel superheroes are members of Elizabethan society. The characters are mainly from Marvel's 1960s period and include Nick Fury, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Doctor Doom and Magneto. Spider-Man also features, though he appears much younger than the 1960s version and does not have any superpowers. Other popular characters, such as Wolverine and Storm, were not added, because of Gaiman's vision to address the heroes of the 1960s. \\"The territory doesn't go much further than 1969 in terms of the characters that I picked to use,\\" Gaiman noted. \\"I couldn't get everybody in because there are an awful lot of Marvel characters.\\" Historical figures * Elizabeth I of England - Her history is essentially unchanged from the real-world version. She is assassinated by Count Otto von Doom (see below), a year before she should have died of natural causes. * James VI of Scotland and I of England - His history is also largely unchanged. He keeps his firm belief in the Divine Right of Kings and his loathing of the witchbreed (this reality's version of mutants) mirrors the real-life James' view of Catholics. James later took the throne of Elizabeth I following her death and conspired with the Grand Inquisitor to eliminate the Witchbreed. When Javier criticizes Fury for smoking a pipe, Fury remarks that James once made similar reproaches. James was indeed critical of smoking and even wrote A Counterblaste to Tobacco on the subject. On the other hand, he was also a heavy drinker, and he is seldom shown without a cup of wine in his hand. There are also hints towards his homosexuality in this timeline, as there was some suggestion that he was in real life. He was later killed by the Hulk as revealed in Hulk: Broken Worlds #2. He was also later revealed to be this world's version of Wolverine in a later storyline. * Virginia Dare - The first English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not disappear in the 1580s. Inspired by a legend that Virginia was killed in the shape of a white deer, Gaiman gives his version shapeshifting powers. She is able to become any real animal (ex: a wolf and a white deer), dinosaurs that in this timeline still survive in America (ex: a Tyrannosaurus), and mythological creatures (like a griffin and a sphinx). She was later killed by Master Norman Osborne. Gaiman has stated that he created Virginia Dare without a previous Marvel character basis in order to provide a unique and fully American character in the 1602 universe.. However, her aspect and powers resemble the ones of the Canadian superhero Snowbird. * William Shakespeare - A playwright who served the court of Elizabeth I and James I. While working on the scripts for Macbeth, he is kidnapped by the Vulture-Fliers and forced by Otto Von Doom to chronicle his journeys to the advanced city of Bensaylum (this reality's Atlantis) in Marvel 1602: Fantastick Four. Heroes * Sir Nicholas Fury - The Queen's Intelligencer. The 1602 world's version of Nick Fury is in the position of Sir Francis Walsingham, one of the great spymasters of the time who obtained the evidence that led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, and vital information that helped defeat the Spanish Armada. When she introduces him to Strange, Queen Elizabeth tells Fury not to give his official title since he will \\"tell us we do not pay you enough\\". In fact Elizabeth was extremely cautious with money and Walsingham's secret service got very poor financial support from the state. Dedicated to protecting the realm from threats both inside and out, Walsingham himself got into debt employing agents who have been described as \\"spies on a shoestring\\" budget. * Doctor Stephen Strange - The Queen's physician who is also an alchemist and magician. Strange's interests and skills mirror some of those of the Queen's contemporary John Dee, a mathematician, astrologer, and geographer who was also interested in conjuring. Strange works from his mansion in the then- village of Greenwich outside London (a play on the \\"real\\" Doctor Strange's mansion in Greenwich Village, New York City). * Peter Parquagh - Sir Nicholas' apprentice. He is this world's Spider-Man (Peter Parker), although without the powers, but with a keen interest in spiders. A running plot thread is that Peter is constantly being prevented from being bitten by spiders, which is how his mainstream counterpart obtained his powers. When Rojhaz climbs up a tower to fetch Virginia, Peter timidly and ironically says \\"I can't climb.\\" He is however bitten by a spider caught in the closing timestream rift and later develops powers similar to those of the mainstream Spider-Man, adopting the alias of \\"the Spider\\". There are hints of a budding romance between Peter and Virginia Dare, who resembles the ill-fated Gwen Stacy. This is further implied by Virginia's murder at the hands of Norman Osborne. In a lead-up to the Spider-Verse storyline, Peter Parquagh was killed by Morlun. * Matthew Murdoch - A blind Irish minstrel and freelance agent who occasionally works for Sir Nicholas. Matthew acquired heightened senses from a mysterious substance he encountered as a child, and is this world's Daredevil (a.k.a. Matt Murdock). He shows a lot of the quick wit and humour that Daredevil displayed before Frank Miller turned him into a more serious and moody character. * Clea Strange - Dr. Strange's wife and assistant. Clea comes from another dimension (in which she used to be a Queen) and is herself a sorceress. She is this world's version of Clea. * Rojhaz (pronounced \\"Ro-gers\\") - Virginia's blonde- haired, blue-eyed Native American bodyguard. The colonists assume him to be a product of congress between Indians and Welsh traders (see Welsh Indians). In fact he is actually Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America. Imprisoned in a dystopian future ruled by a President-for-Life and sent back in time, Rogers, and the hole his passage has left in time, serves as the trigger for the warping of history that introduces the other Marvels. He also changes history more directly by helping the Roanoke Colony through the winter. * Carlos Javier - A Spaniard living in England where he runs a College for the Sons of Gentlefolk. He is a witchbreed, a being born with special powers (i.e. mutants). But unlike the Inquisitor (see below), he believes in a future of peace between witchbreed (which he calls mutantur or changing ones) and normal humans (the mondani). He is this world's Professor X. * Carlos Javier's students - This world's version of the original X-Men. They are: ** Roberto Trefusis (Robert \\"Bobby\\" Drake, Iceman) - A nephew of Sir Francis Drake. ** Scotius Summerisle (Scott Summers, Cyclops) - He wears a visor made of rubies, and has a branded X on his shoulder which was put there when he was found to be a witchbreed in Scotland. ** Hal McCoy (Hank McCoy, the Beast) - A student with a grotesque appearance. He also escaped from James' Scotland. ** \\"John\\" Grey (Jean Grey) - \\"John\\" Grey is in fact a young woman (a reference to Shakespeare's plays in which young men often dress up women: As You Like It and Twelfth Night). ** Werner (Warren Worthington III, the Angel) - He was rescued from the Inquisition. His friendship with \\"Master John\\" causes jealous resentment on the part of Scotius Summerisle, though Werner is unaware of \\"John's\\" true sex. In fact he implies some homosexual feelings towards \\"Master John\\", which contrasts with the 1960s version of the Angel who was portrayed as a womanizing playboy. However, it also pays tribute to the love triangle between Jean, Scott, and Warren in the '60s. * Uatu the Watcher - He knows that all these heroes and villains are not due for another 350 years and is tempted to break the rules of the Watchers and interfere (albeit not for the first time). The other Watchers see his actions as being for the greater good since the destruction of this universe could result in that of others, leaving them with nothing to watch. Thus they interfere as minimally as possible and Uatu is ultimately rewarded with a gift: the seed of this universe preserved rather than altered by Captain America's return to the future. * The Four from the Fantastick - A famous group of heroes who feature in Murdoch's favourite ballad (which Gaiman has written a full version of, although only snippets appear in the comic). They were all transformed when their sailing ship, the Fantastick, encountered a wave of energy from the Sargasso Sea. Trapped under the castle of Count Otto von Doom, they remain in imprisonment until rescued by Sir Nicholas Fury and Carlos Javier. They are this world's Fantastic Four. Gaiman makes the interesting observation that their bodies reflect the four elements that alchemists believed made up all things. They consist of: ** Captain Benjamin Grimm - The captain of the Fantastick. Grimm's body becomes solid rock ** Sir Richard Reed - The explorer and genius who convinced the others to go on the voyage. Reed's flesh becomes pliable like water. ** Susan Storm - Reed's fianc√©. Unlike her 616 counterpart, she is permanently invisible. Susan's body becomes weightless and invisible like air ** Master Jonathan Storm - He retains his hot-headed and sarcastic personality, as well as his rivalry with Ben Grimm, but appears to be several years older than in the 616 continuity; in the original comics, Johnny was a teenager and the same age as Peter Parker, while in 1602 he seems to be an adult. John's body becomes living fire. * Donal the Ancient One - A Knight Templar who is entrusted with taking the \\"Templar Treasure\\" to Sir Stephen Strange. This proves to be the hammer Mjolnir, disguised as a simple walking stick. Donal is forced to use the hammer to become Thor, a pagan god who according to Donal's religion should not even exist. This act of blasphemy turns him to drink. He is this world's version of Donald Blake, a.k.a. the Mighty Thor. In a clever conceit, while the Marvel Universe Thor has Shakespearean speech patterns, the 1602 version speaks in Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse, and the calligraphy- style lettering in his speech bubbles is replaced with a rune-like font. * Henri Le Pym - Henri Le Pym is a philosopher who Victor Octavius blackmailed into helping to find a cure for him at the time he was trying to cure his shrunken wife. When his wife was covered in a spilled elixir he was working on, he licked it off her resulting in him becoming a giant. He is this reality's version of Henry Pym. * Janette Le Pym - Janette is Henri's wife who was shrunken by accident. After being hit by a spilled elixir, she became a human/wasp hybrid. She is this reality's version of Wasp. =Supporting Characters= * Captain Nelson - A seaman who regularly takes Matthew Murdoch across the English Channel. He is suspicious of the blind minstrel who suggests with a smile that he should keep his thoughts to himself. Nelson is this world's Foggy Nelson. * Dougan - The second-in-command of Fury's armies. He is very loyal to Fury and goes with him to Count Otto Von Doom's castle and the New World, where he stays and becomes the head of the police force, becoming a friend to Dare, as seen in 1602: New World. He is this world's Dum Dum Dugan. * Jonah Jameson - An Irish-accented newspaper owner in the New World. He is almost exactly like his Marvel Universe counterpart including his dislike of people with \\"powers\\". His newspaper is called the Daily Trumpet which is this reality's version of the Daily Bugle. * Rhodes - Rhodes is Lord Iron's Moorish engineer. His Marvel Universe counterpart is James Rhodes (a.k.a. War Machine). * Captain Ross - He is the English captain of the vessel that transports Lord Iron to the New World. He is the 1602 manifestation of Marvel's General Ross, since both men were charged with subduing the Hulk and his human counterpart. * Richard and Mary Parquagh - The parents of \\"The Spider\\". They were mentioned to have worked for Sir Nicholas Fury. They are this reality's versions of Richard and Mary Parker. * Numenor - He is the ruler of Bensaylum (this reality's Atlantis). He is this reality's version of Namor. * Rita - She is the cousin of Numenor. She is this reality's version of Namorita. * Lord Wyatt Wingfoot - A lord who is a rival to the Human Torch for the affection of Doris Evans. * Steve Rogers - About more than three-hundred years in the present Earth-311, an ill Steven Rogers was injected with a version of the super-soldier serum based on one of Henri Le Pym's preserved vial containing the Spider's blood. This allowed him to become this universe's modern Captain America. * Marioac - She is the leader of the local Native Americans who are feuding with the colonists. Marioa becomes a sort of friend to both Peter and Banner, and is portrayed as a little magical or supernatural. She is not based on a character in the traditional Marvel Universe. * Governor Dare - He is the governor of the colony and a wise and heroic man, although not based on a Marvel character. Villains Please note: among the characters classed as villains (i.e. enemies of the main protagonists) are characters who in the mainstream Marvel universe are actual heroes like Hulk or villains-turned-heroes like the Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and the Black Widow * \\"Brotherhood Of Those Who Will Inherit The Earth\\" - A secret society formed by Enrique, the Spanish Inquisitor who is actually one of the so-called Witchbreeds that the Inquisition has sworn to destroy. The society's name is a biblical allusion: \\"those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.\\" (King James Bible Psalm 37:9). Among its members are: ** Grand Inquisitor Enrique - Born a Jew, he was taken in by a Christian priest and baptized (and also implied to have been molested). The Christians later refused to let him be returned to his Jewish family, saying that giving him back to the 'Christ-killers' would damn his soul to Hell. As an adult, he leads the Spanish Inquisition which he oversees from Domdaniel. Although ordered to execute the witchbreed, he hides those whom he can pass off as normal with him being secretly a witchbreed himself. He is this world's Magneto. ** Sister Wanda and Petros - The Inquisitor's assistants. They are also his children, a fact he has kept from them. They are this world's Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (Wanda and Pietro Maximoff). ** Toad - He is Enrique's spy in the Vatican. Though his long tongue and ability for climbing walls are plainly visible, he manages to hide for an undisclosed, but lengthy amount of time. Gaiman also plays with other cold-blooded characteristics, such as a pronounced sleepiness at low temperatures. * David Banner - An advisor to King James, who replaces Sir Nicholas Fury when James takes the English throne. He is then sent to Roanoke with orders to kill Fury. Towards the end of the story, he is caught in the energies of the Anomaly and becomes a brutish monster. He is this world's Hulk. * Natasha - A freelance spy and \\"the most dangerous woman in Europe\\". She is partnered with Murdoch by Sir Nicholas, but betrays him and Donal to Count Otto. She is this world's Black Widow (who is one of Daredevil's regular on-off girlfriends). * Count Otto von Doom - The ruler of Latveria, known as Otto the Handsome and he is indeed a good-looking man. A long-time enemy of Sir Richard Reed, he is responsible for the Four from the Fantastick's disappearance by the story's start. He is this world's version of Doctor Doom, though his face-scarring injuries come after rather than before the Four from the Fantastick acquire their powers. * Master Norman Osborne - He wants to trick the Native Americans into selling the island of Roanoke. However, they have been educated in the English language by 'Rojhaz' (Captain America from the future) and see the flaw in his contract. Norman seeks to turn the colony against the natives, because he believes that the natives are hiding something of great value. He is this world's Green Goblin. * Lord Iron - A Spaniard weaponeer who was famous for his inventions. Lord Iron was captured during the war against England and was tortured by David Banner for weeks in order to manufacture new and deadly weapons. He has since built a suit of armor powered by electricity and harbors a grudge against Banner. Despite his allegiance, he has no special loyalty towards King James, and merely seeks revenge on Banner and by association the Hulk. He is this world's Iron Man. * The Vulture-Fliers - They are Count Otto von Doom's flying warriors, based on the Spider-Man villain the Vulture. * The Assassins are sent by Count Otto von Doom to murder Sir Nicholas Fury, Virginia Dare, and Queen Elizabeth: ** The first assassin does not appear to have a definitive counterpart in the regular Marvel Universe. ** The second is a Vulture-Flier. ** The third is a booby-trapped musical machine. * Baron Victor Octavius - An Italian nobleman and brilliant scientist living in exile in France who suffered from the bubonic plague. Octavius attempted to cure himself by using the blood of octopi which worked, but also slowly transformed him into a human/octopus hybrid. He is this reality's version of Doctor Octopus. * Curtis Connors - A philosopher who was infected with the bubonic plague. He created an elixir that transformed him into a reptilian creature that resembled a velociraptor, but retained his mind. He worked with Baron Victor Octavius to capture the Spider. He is this world's Lizard. * Four Who Are Frightful - Four Jacobean hired by Otto Von Doom to find the Lost City of Bensaylum. They are this reality's version of the Frightful Four. Among its members are: ** Wizard - A magic-user who is the leader of the Four Who Are Frightful. He is this reality's version of Wizard. ** Medusa - Medusa is the lover of the Wizard. She has snakes for hair and needs to wear a veil to prevent her gaze from turning men to stone. Though she has snakes for hair, she is still depicted as this reality's version of Medusa. ** Marko - An Albino who can conjure up dreams and nightmares. He can also induce sleep and waking dreams by blowing sand on people. Despite the difference, he is this reality's version of Sandman. He appears to be partially based on Gaiman's other character known as the Sandman (who appeared in DC comics). ** Trapster - A skilled huntsman. He is this reality's version of Trapster. * The King's Pin - Wilson Fiske is a pirate captain of the H.M.S. Vanessa and was known to have never spare any survivors he attacks. He is this reality's version of Kingpin. * Bull's Eye - He is an assassin and the second mate to Wilson Fiske. * The future President- For-Life - He assumes power in a 20th or 21st century America and rounds up and jails many aging heroes. He is also responsible for shunting Captain America, a living symbol of freedom, into the past. His dark-purple face on a poster (in contrast to the lighter pink of the other characters seen in flashback) implies that he is the Purple Man at the summit of his powers of persuasion.

Greenwood is situated on a 100-acre campus outside the village of Putney, Vermont in the southeastern part of the state. The Greenwood School is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), approved by the state of Vermont, and is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS). History Therapeutic based hands-on learning. They believed that the education of children who were underachievers, who were diagnosed as \\"dyslexic\\" or as having \\"attention difficulties\\" was best addressed by giving them intellectual and creative challenges in the classroom using discussion and verbal instruction. Learning was adapted to the students' natural strengths and aptitudes. Because the Scheidler's design for the school embedded a variety of learning experiences in a challenging pre-prep curriculum, Greenwood was not a \\"special school\\", but an enriched pre-preparatory program tailored to meet the needs of specific students. Class days included tutorial help in rote skills, especially reading and writing, but by tailoring the entire program to meet student needs and focusing on their method of teaching via oral tradition, the Scheidlers kept costs down for families and schools. The curriculum included all elementary and middle school subjects, as well as other required courses. The curriculum included structured exercises in the spoken word, visual art, manual skills and dramatics for all students, in recognition of the enhanced imaginations, visual memory and auditory skills of many Greenwood students and the need to develop students' oral communication skills. Tom Scheidler published articles about his work using guided imagery (psychosynthesis) techniques with Greenwood students, and concerning his utilization of metaphor to help students get past psychological and emotional barriers to learning. He lectured internationally and also served on the board of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). His work combined with Andrea Scheidler's speech, performance and visual art curriculum to encourage imagination, foster attention and self-discipline. The Scheidlers discovered that when students who were \\"acting out\\" were helped to channel energies into theater, storytelling and speech, students gained confidence and social skills that benefited them later in life. Philosophy and Academics Today, Greenwood is a Special School for students with a variety of academic learning challenges. With a 2:1 student to teacher ratio, classes are small at the Greenwood School, ranging from 1 to 10 students. Greenwood‚Äôs remedial language program uses a diagnostic-prescriptive approach, including the Lindamood-Bell and Orton Gillingham methods. The program targets all aspects of literacy, including phonology, phonics, morphology, and orthography. Students spend one hour a day in a language tutorial to study and practice reading, spelling, comprehension, handwriting, and writing from dictation. All instruction is multisensory, structured, sequential, and sensitive to students‚Äô individual learning styles. Because written work is such a difficult process for most students with a language-based learning disability, Greenwood students spend an additional period in writing instruction. Assistive technology programs such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Inspiration and Kurzweil are used to aid students in the writing process. The language remediation described above is combined with an academic curriculum that includes science, history, literature, art, music, crafts, and athletics. Twice daily study halls train students to apply skills independently. All students attend weekly group social pragmatics lessons, and for some students speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and/or additional social pragmatics are also part of Greenwood‚Äôs academic program. Facilities Boarding students live in the Greenwood dormitory, which has twenty-four student rooms, four faculty apartments, and three common rooms. The dorm is designed to allow developmental grouping. The remainder of the resident teachers live in adjacent buildings. The academic center houses the school library and assembly room, the dining hall, a STEM center, and 12 classrooms. A long time partnership with the Yellow Barn Music School and Festival has added nine eco- friendly, cabin-like classroom spaces that Yellow Barn uses as rehearsal spaces during the summer and Greenwood uses as supplemental classrooms during the school year. The gym, which includes an indoor skate park and climbing wall, is used for physical education and large gatherings. The campus also includes an expanded woodshop and pottery studio and an administrative building. Sports and recreation A gym teacher and four coaches head a variety of seasonal sports and outdoor activities, including interscholastic soccer, basketball, and baseball as well as intramural track, rock climbing, volleyball, bowling, archery, outdoor leadership, orienteering, cross-country skiing and downhill skiing. A network of trails that wind through the campus are used for hiking, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing. A pond is available for science classes, fishing, and boating; and the campus has an outdoor skate/bike park and dirt jump area. The winter sports program includes a weekend trip to Mount Snow for downhill skiing, snowboarding and terrain park. Outdoor activities are emphasized, the gym facility was originally intended to be a covered basketball court for use during rainy days. Vacation program The Greenwood School runs the CONNECT Program, a community service-learning program for boys with learning differences. National recognition The Greenwood School was featured on Public Television‚Äôs National Education Report in 2007. On February 2013, The Greenwood School announced that they were going to work together with Ken Burns on the documentary The Address. The film was aired on PBS in the spring of 2014. The school also was known for hosting the first annual Learn The Address national competition in 2014, where students from chosen schools would compete while reciting The Gettysburg Address. The national competition ran until 2017 in which other schools have hosted it.

The type species is A. cumminsi.  History of study  Acheloma was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1882 based on a partial skull with associated postcranial elements from the Arroyo Formation of Texas; the specimen is currently reposited at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Subsequent discoveries of large trematopids from the Arroyo Formation were named as different species of Trematops (T. milleri, T. willistoni), but these have since been synonymized with Acheloma cumminsi. Trematops stonei from the Washington Formation of Ohio and Trematops thomasi from Oklahoma have also been synonymized with A. cumminsi. A second species of Acheloma was described by Polley & Reisz (2011) from the Richards Spur locality in Oklahoma.  Anatomy  Schoch & Milner (2014) provide nine characters in their diagnosis of Acheloma: (1) toothed crest on the vomer extending medial to the internal naris; (2) constricted otic notch with nearly horizontal ventral margin; (3) preorbital region twice as long as the skull table; (4) naris twice as long as the orbit; (5) posterior skull table wide and posterolaterally expanded; (6) skull margin widens at level of and posterior to orbit; (7) palatine and ectopterygoid with tall fangs; (8) large intervomerine fenestra; and (9) choana elongate and curved with a Y-shaped contour. Acheloma cumminsi and A. dunni are distinguished by the purported absence of lateral exposures of the palatine (LEP) and the ectopterygoid (LEE) in A. cumminsi, but these exposures were subsequently identified following re-examination of the holotype of this taxon.  Ecology  Various analyses have confirmed hypotheses that Acheloma was a terrestrial temnospondyl.  Phylogeny  The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of Acheloma, from Polley & Reisz, 2011.

Baker, who was Secretary of War, during 1916-1920, while \\"he presided over America's mass mobilization of men and material in World War I. After the assassination of president John F. Kennedy in 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy purchased the house and lived here for about a year. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. and History The house was built in 1794 by Thomas Beall. During its early years, the house was situated on a large plot of land and was said to have had a servants wing attached to the east side. At that time N Street was known as Gay Street and was situated higher than today. In 1796, John Laird, a wealthy merchant, lived in the house, and later Maj. George Peter, a War of 1812 commander and Maryland Congressman, purchased the house who lived there until 1827, when the same Laird bought the house for his son. In 1834, William Redin, the first auditor of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, purchased it. In 1868, Redin's unmarried daughter inherited and sold the dwelling, which became the Georgetown Female Seminary. The Seminary had a student body of boarders and day students totaling 105. In approximately 1890, John H. Smoot bought the building and converted it back to a private residence again. In 1915, Col. William E. Pattison French purchased the house, and began renting it to Newton D. Baker in 1916. When Baker returned to Ohio in 1920, French either leased or lived in the house himself for more than two decades. During the World War II, the British military attache occupied the house and rented rooms to British officers. After the World War II, Vice Admiral Alan Kirk, later Ambassador to Belgium and to the Soviet Union, purchased the property. Three years later, Dr. E. H. Gushing bought the home along with his wife. They sold the attached servants' wing as a separate residence to Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Woodward who built a new front entrance and lived in the home. The Cushings updated the main house's electrical wiring and plumbing and removed some of the interior walls therefore enlarging the living room. In 1954, James McMillan Gibson bought the dwelling, added a small rear wing, and installed an elevator and lived there with his wife. In 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy purchased the house and lived in it shortly after the assassination of president John F. Kennedy in 1963. The Kennedy family lived here for about a year. In 1965, Michael Whitney Straight purchased the home for $200,000 (), from Kennedy when she moved to New York City. While living in the home, Straight married his second wife, Nina G. Auchincloss Steers in 1974. Nina was the daughter of Nina Gore and Hugh D. Auchincloss. She was the half-sister of writer Gore Vidal and coincidentally, a stepsister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Straight and his wife spent $125,000 () renovating the home and decided to move to Bethesda, Maryland in 1976 when he was vice chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. Straight and his wife lived in the home from until 1976. In 1976, Yolande Bebeze Fox, the former Miss America 1951, bought the home from Straight. Fox lived in the home until her death in February 2016. Architectural details The home is considered more representative of New England architecture than other contemporary Georgetown homes.

The comital branch of Lippe-Biesterfeld ascended the throne of the Principality of Lippe in 1905, after the extinction of the ruling main branch, when count Leopold of Lippe-Biesterfeld became Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe. He continued to rule until the German Revolution of 1918. In 1916, he created his younger brother, count Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, a prince. Through the latter's son, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld (1911‚Äì2004), the prince consort of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, it also became a title of the Dutch Royal House, created in 1937. History Biesterfeld estate in 1764 The branch of Lippe-Biesterfeld was founded by count Jobst Herman (1625‚Äì1678), youngest son of count Simon VII of Lippe-Detmold. He received Biesterfeld with parts of the former county of Schwalenberg, as a paragium. From the Lippe- Biesterfeld branch the line of Lippe-Weissenfeld was separated in 1734. Both, Biesterfeld and Weissenfeld were so-called paragiums (non-sovereign estates of a cadet-branch) of the ruling House of Lippe. Jobst Herman built the manor of Biesterfeld around 1660. Frederick Charles Augustus, Count of Lippe, moved the comital brewery from Schwalenberg to Biesterfeld in 1740. However, both the lands of Lippe-Biesterfeld and Lippe-Weissenfeld were ceded and sold to the princely line of Lippe(-Detmold) on 24 May 1762. Frederick Charles Augustus preferred to live in a hunting lodge in the Sachsenwald forest, near Hamburg, named after him, Friedrichsruh, the current home of the princes Bismarck. Lippe House at Oberkassel, Bonn Frederick William (1737-1803), the eldest surviving son of count Frederick Charles Augustus, married Elisabeth Johanna, Edle von Meinertzhagen (1752-1811) who inherited a small manor house at Oberkassel, Bonn, where the couple moved in 1770, and which was to become the home to the Lippe-Biesterfeld family for the following 209 years. Beethoven is said to have been the piano teacher of the couple's children. The Head of the Lippe-Biesterfeld family was given the style Illustrious Highness () at Detmold on 27 August and 1 October 1844. When, in 1895, the mentally ill Prince Alexander ascended the throne of the Principality of Lippe, Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe was appointed to act as regent of Lippe, according to a then secretly kept decree of the predecessor Prince Woldemar. Alexander was the last male of the Lippe-Detmold line; the next senior lines of the House of Lippe were the Counts of Lippe-Biesterfeld, followed by the Counts of Lippe-Weissenfeld, and then by the most junior line the Princes of Schaumburg- Lippe. Shortly after becoming a member state of the German Empire in 1871, the Lippe-Detmold line died out on 20 July 1895. This resulted in an inheritance dispute between the neighboring principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and the Lippe-Biesterfeld line. Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe (1871‚Äì1949), the first and only ruler of Lippe of the Biesterfeld branch Ernest, Count of Lippe- Biesterfeld, hitherto living at Oberkassel, became regent of the principality from 1897 until his death in 1904. The dispute was only resolved by the Imperial Court in Leipzig in 1905, with the lands passing to the Lippe- Biesterfeld line who, until this point, had no territorial sovereignty. Ernest's son Prince Leopold IV (1871‚Äì1949) was the first and only count of Lippe-Biesterfeld to become ruling prince of Lippe, residing at Detmold Castle. Prince Bernhard of Lippe (1872‚Äì1934), the younger brother of Leopold IV and father of prince consort Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, was born at Oberkassel and grew up there. Later he acquired the estate of Reckenwalde in East Brandenburg (today Wojnowo, Poland), where his son grew up. A first cousin of the prince-consort, Prince Ernst August of Lippe (1917‚Äì1990), sold the house at Oberkassel in 1979, after he had acquired Syburg castle at Bergen, Middle Franconia, in 1970. The current head of the House of Lippe is Stephan, Prince of Lippe (born 24 May 1959), a grandson of Leopold IV, and present owner of Detmold Castle. He is also a first cousin once removed of Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands (1911‚Äì2004), the prince consort of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands (1909‚Äì2004). 1627‚Äì1762: Lords of Lippe- Biesterfeld * Jobst Herman, Lord 1627‚Äì1678 (1625‚Äì1678), youngest son of Simon VII, Count of Lippe ** Rudolf Ferdinand, Lord 1678‚Äì1736 (1671‚Äì1736) *** Friedrich Karl, Lord 1736‚Äì1762, raised to Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld in 1762 (1706‚Äì1781) 1762‚Äì1905: Counts of Lippe-Biesterfeld * Friedrich Karl, 1st Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1762‚Äì1781 (1706‚Äì1781) ** Karl, 2nd Count of Lippe- Biesterfeld 1781‚Äì1810 (1735‚Äì1810) *** Ernst, 3rd Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1810‚Äì1840 (1777‚Äì1840) **** Julius, 4th Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1840‚Äì1884 (1812‚Äì1884) ***** Ernst, 5th Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1884‚Äì1904 (1842‚Äì1904) ****** Leopold, 6th Count of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1904‚Äì1905 (1871‚Äì1949) On 25 October 1905 Count Leopold became the reigning Prince of Lippe as Leopold IV. 1916-1918: Princes of Lippe-Biesterfeld * Prince Bernhard of Lippe- Biesterfeld, Prince of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1916‚Äì1918 (1911-2004) 1909‚Äì1916: Morganatic title and new cadet line Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, the later prince-consort of the Netherlands, in 1942.

Armgard was the wife of Prince Bernhard of Lippe (1872‚Äì1934), the brother of Prince Leopold IV. On 24 February 1916, Armgard and her two sons Bernhard (1911‚Äì2004) and Aschwin (1914‚Äì1988) were created Prince(ss) of Lippe- Biesterfeld with the style Serene Highness. They returned to a more senior position in the line of succession to the Lippian throne, in which they previously had been the very last.

Ecological Restoration The Friends of Blackwater Refuge worked in conjunction with the National Aquarium in Baltimore on a major marsh restoration project at Barren Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Barren Island is located twelve miles south of the Choptank River and is part of the Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife Refuge Complex; the island is adjacent to the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. The efforts of this partnership, which includes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA, the FWS, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and Maryland Conservation Corps have resulted in the planting of over 302,000 native marsh grasses with the help of 927 volunteers totaling 7,700 volunteer hours. Aquarium staff and the Friends of Blackwater Refuge have returned to the site semi-annually to monitor the success of the restoration project. Topographic, vegetative and fish utilization data have been collected. Initial monitoring indicates that the project has been successful as wave energy is being absorbed and sediment is in fact being accreted. A very natural marsh community which includes small invertebrates that live in the sediments, larger invertebrates including crabs and shrimp and fish and birds can be found in the more mature parts of the site that were planted in 2001. The more recently planted areas appear to be progressing well toward a similar community.

To the right of this section is a 1¬Ω-story gambrel-roofed addition, dating to the early 19th century. A single-story gable-roof ell extends from the rear of the main block. Commodore Esek Hopkins History Dating to 1754, the house was the home of Esek Hopkins, the first commander-in-chief of the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War. After Hopkins died, his daughters inherited the property, and it remained in the family for the next century. Descendant Elizabeth West Gould died in 1907, and the property was donated to the City of Providence in accordance with her wishes in 1908, with the stipulation that it be converted into a museum. Accounts of the time recounted that the property was being restored to its original condition. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Over the years, various plans were put forward over the years to convert the house into a museum. They all failed for lack of resources. Most recently, in 2011 the Providence Parks department put forward a plan to convert the house into a part-time museum; this has not yet come to pass. The building has suffered from inadequate maintenance by the city's parks department, and was placed on the Providence Preservation Society's \\"Most Endangered Properties\\" list in 1995, 2011 and again in 2015.

It is one of a series of brick row houses, probably built in the 1860s. It is three stories in height and three bays wide, with a corbelled cornice, and projecting brick hoods around its windows. It was from 1881 to 1885 the home of Mary Ann Shadd Cary. Mary Ann Shadd was born a free black in the slave state of Delaware, and was educated in Pennsylvania. Her father was active in anti-slavery circles, sheltering fugitive slaves in the family home. At first a school teacher for African American children, she and other family members left for Canada following passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Settling in Ontario, she began publishing works to inform American blacks about conditions in Canada, so that they could judge whether migration there was in their interests. This effort resulted in the founding of the Provincial Freeman, the first newspaper published by a black woman in North America, and the first by a woman in what is now Canada. After the American Civil War, she returned to the United States, where she returned to teaching and continued to be active in civil rights. She acquired a law degree in 1883.

She was the first Sub-Saharan African woman to direct a commercially distributed feature film, Kaddu Beykat, which was released in 1975. She has directed several documentary and fiction films focusing on rural life in Senegal. Biography =Early life and education= Safi Faye was born in 1943 in Dakar, Senegal, to an aristocratic Serer family. Her parents, the Fayes, were from Fad'jal, a village south of Dakar.Foster, p. 130. She attended the Normal School in Rufisque and receiving her teaching certificate in 1962 or 1963, began teaching in Dakar. In 1966 she went to the Dakar Festival of Negro Arts and met French ethnologist and filmmaker Jean Rouch. He encouraged her to use film making as an ethnographic tool. She had an acting role in his 1971 film Petit √† petit.Ukadike, p. 29. Faye has said that she dislikes Rouch's film but that working with him enabled her to learn about filmmaking and cin√©ma-v√©rit√©.Spaas, p. 185. In the 1970s she studied ethnology at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes and then at the Lumi√®re Film School. She supported herself by working as a model, an actor and in film sound effects. In 1979, she received a PhD in ethnology from the University of Paris. From 1979 to 1980, Faye studied video production in Berlin and was a guest lecturer at the Free University of Berlin.Schmidt, p. 286. She received a further degree in ethnology from the Sorbonne in 1988. =Film career= Faye's first film, in which she also acted, was a 1972 short called La Passante (The Passerby), drawn from her experiences as a foreign woman in Paris.Schmidt, p. 287. It follows a woman (Faye) walking down a street and noticing the reactions of men nearby. Faye's first feature film was Kaddu Beykat, which means The Voice of the Peasant in Wolof and was known internationally as Letter from My Village or News from My Village. She obtained financial backing for Kaddu Beykat from the French Ministry of Cooperation. Released in 1975, it was the first feature film to be made by a Sub-Saharan African woman to be commercially distributed and gained international recognition for Faye.Ukadike, p. 30. On its release it was banned in Senegal. In 1976 it won the FIPRESCI Prize from the International Federation of Film Critics (tied with Chhatrabhang) and the OCIC Award. Faye's 1983 documentary film Selb√©: One Among Many follows a 39-year-old woman called S√©lbe who works to support her eight children since her husband has left their village to look for work.Thackway, p. 153. Selb√© regularly converses with Faye, who remains off-screen, and describes her relationship with her husband and daily life in the village.Thackway, p. 154. Faye's films are better known in Europe than in her native Africa, where they are rarely shown. Personal life Faye, who lives in Paris, is divorced and has one daughter.

In traditional spreadsheet systems, such as Excel, cells are partitioned into \\"directly specified\\" cells and \\"computed\\" cells and the formulas used to specify the values of computed cells are \\"functional\\", i.e. for every combination of values of the directly specified cells, the formulas specify unique values for the computed cells. Logical Spreadsheets relax these restrictions by dispensing with the distinction between directly specified cells and computed cells and generalizing from functional definitions to logical constraints. As an illustration of the difference between traditional spreadsheets and logical spreadsheets, consider a simple numerical spreadsheet with three cells a, b, and c. Each cell accepts a single integer as value; and there is a formula stating that the value of the third cell is the sum of the values of the other two cells. Implemented as a traditional spreadsheet, this spreadsheet would allow the user to enter values into cells a and b, and it would automatically compute cell c. For example, if the user were to type 1 into a and 2 into b, it would compute the value 3 for c. Implemented as a logical spreadsheet, the user would be able to enter values into any of the cells. The user could type 1 into a and 2 into b, and the spreadsheet would compute the value 3 for c. Alternatively, the user could type 2 into b and 3 into c, and the spreadsheet would compute the value 1 for a. And so forth. In this case, the formula is functional, and the function is invertible. In general, the formulas need not be functional and the functions need not be invertible. For example, in this case, we could write formulas involving inequalities and non-invertible functions (such as square root). More generally, we could build spreadsheets with symbolic, rather than numeric data, and write arbitrary logical constraints on this data.  References  * J.

Pyramids were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because it is a structural form which is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads). Another notable engineering feat from antiquity still in use today is the qanat water management system. Qanat technology developed in the time of the Medes, the predecessors of the Persian Empire (modern-day IranAhmad Y Hassan, Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part Ii: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering Qanat, Kariz and Khattara: Traditional Water Systems in the Middle East - By Peter Beaumont, Michael E. Bonine, Keith StanleyThe Traditional Crafts of Persia: Their Development and Technology by Hans E. Wulff which has the oldest and longest Qanat (older than 3000 years and longer than 71 km)p. 4 of that also spread to other cultures having had contact with the Persian. Throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans, such as stone masons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. No theory of structures existed and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before'. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental. No record exists of the first calculations of the strength of structural members or the behaviour of structural material, but the profession of structural engineer only really took shape with the Industrial Revolution and the re-invention of concrete (see History of concrete). The physical sciences underlying structural engineering began to be understood in the Renaissance and have been developing ever since. Early structural engineering Archimedes is said to have remarked about the lever: \\"Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.\\" The recorded history of structural engineering starts with the ancient Egyptians. In the 27th century BC, Imhotep was the first structural engineer known by name and constructed the first known step pyramid in Egypt. In the 26th century BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed in Egypt. It remained the largest man-made structure for millennia and was considered an unsurpassed feat in architecture until the 19th century AD. The understanding of the physical laws that underpin structural engineering in the Western world dates back to the 3rd century BC, when Archimedes published his work On the Equilibrium of Planes in two volumes, in which he sets out the Law of the Lever, stating: Archimedes used the principles derived to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures including triangles, paraboloids, and hemispheres. Archimedes's work on this and his work on calculus and geometry, together with Euclidean geometry, underpin much of the mathematics and understanding of structures in modern structural engineering. Pont du Gard, France, a Roman era aqueduct circa 19 BC. The ancient Romans made great bounds in structural engineering, pioneering large structures in masonry and concrete, many of which are still standing today. They include aqueducts, thermae, columns, lighthouses, defensive walls and harbours. Their methods are recorded by Vitruvius in his De Architectura written in 25 BC, a manual of civil and structural engineering with extensive sections on materials and machines used in construction. One reason for their success is their accurate surveying techniques based on the dioptra, groma and chorobates. Flying buttress at Notre Dame Cathedral (1163‚Äì1345) During the High Middle Ages (11th to 14th centuries) builders were able to balance the side thrust of vaults with that of flying buttresses and side vaults, to build tall spacious structures, some of which were built entirely of stone (with iron pins only securing the ends of stones) and have lasted for centuries. In the 15th and 16th centuries and despite lacking beam theory and calculus, Leonardo da Vinci produced many engineering designs based on scientific observations and rigour, including a design for a bridge to span the Golden Horn. Though dismissed at the time, the design has since been judged to be both feasible and structurally valid Galileo Galilei. Portrait in crayon by Leoni The foundations of modern structural engineering were laid in the 17th century by Galileo Galilei, Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton with the publication of three great scientific works. In 1638 Galileo published Dialogues Relating to Two New Sciences,Galileo, G. (Crew, H & de Salvio, A. (1954)) outlining the sciences of the strength of materials and the motion of objects (essentially defining gravity as a force giving rise to a constant acceleration). It was the first establishment of a scientific approach to structural engineering, including the first attempts to develop a theory for beams. This is also regarded as the beginning of structural analysis, the mathematical representation and design of building structures. This was followed in 1676 by Robert Hooke's first statement of Hooke's Law, providing a scientific understanding of elasticity of materials and their behaviour under load.Chapman, Allan. (2005) Eleven years later, in 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, setting out his Laws of Motion, providing for the first time an understanding of the fundamental laws governing structures.Newton, Isaac;Leseur, Thomas; Jacquier, Fran√ßois. (1822) Also in the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both independently developed the Fundamental theorem of calculus, providing one of the most important mathematical tools in engineering.Stillwel, J. (2002). p.159 Leonhard Euler portrait by Johann Georg Brucker Further advances in the mathematics needed to allow structural engineers to apply the understanding of structures gained through the work of Galileo, Hooke and Newton during the 17th century came in the 18th century when Leonhard Euler pioneered much of the mathematics and many of the methods which allow structural engineers to model and analyse structures. Specifically, he developed the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with Daniel Bernoulli (1700‚Äì1782) circa 1750 - the fundamental theory underlying most structural engineering design. Daniel Bernoulli, with Johann (Jean) Bernoulli (1667‚Äì1748), is also credited with formulating the theory of virtual work, providing a tool using equilibrium of forces and compatibility of geometry to solve structural problems. In 1717 Jean Bernoulli wrote to Pierre Varignon explaining the principle of virtual work, while in 1726 Daniel Bernoulli wrote of the \\"composition of forces\\".Dugas, Ren√© (1988). p.231 In 1757 Leonhard Euler went on to derive the Euler buckling formula, greatly advancing the ability of engineers to design compression elements.

Lattice shell structure of the Shukhov Tower in Moscow. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, materials science and structural analysis underwent development at a tremendous pace. Though elasticity was understood in theory well before the 19th century, it was not until 1821 that Claude-Louis Navier formulated the general theory of elasticity in a mathematically usable form. In his le√ßons of 1826 he explored a great range of different structural theory, and was the first to highlight that the role of a structural engineer is not to understand the final, failed state of a structure, but to prevent that failure in the first place. In 1826 he also established the elastic modulus as a property of materials independent of the second moment of area, allowing engineers for the first time to both understand structural behaviour and structural materials.Hosford, W.F. (2005) Towards the end of the 19th century, in 1873, Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation \\"Intorno ai sistemi elastici\\", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.Castigliano, C.A. (Andrews, E.S.) (1966) In 1824, Portland cement was patented by the engineer Joseph Aspdin as \\"a superior cement resembling Portland Stone\\", British Patent no. 5022. Although different forms of cement already existed (Pozzolanic cement was used by the Romans as early as 100 B.C. and even earlier by the ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations) and were in common usage in Europe from the 1750s, the discovery made by Aspdin used commonly available, cheap materials, making concrete construction an economical possibility.Prentice, J.E. (1990) p.171 Developments in concrete continued with the construction in 1848 of a rowing boat built of ferrocement - the forerunner of modern reinforced concrete - by Joseph-Louis Lambot. He patented his system of mesh reinforcement and concrete in 1855, one year after W.B. Wilkinson also patented a similar system.Nedwell,P.J.; Swamy,R.N.(ed). (1994) p.27 This was followed in 1867 when a reinforced concrete planting tub was patented by Joseph Monier in Paris, using steel mesh reinforcement similar to that used by Lambot and Wilkinson. Monier took the idea forward, filing several patents for tubs, slabs and beams, leading eventually to the Monier system of reinforced structures, the first use of steel reinforcement bars located in areas of tension in the structure.Kirby, R.S. (1990) p.476 Steel construction was first made possible in the 1850s when Henry Bessemer developed the Bessemer process to produce steel. He gained patents for the process in 1855 and 1856 and successfully completed the conversion of cast iron into cast steel in 1858.Swank, J.M. (1965) p.395 Eventually mild steel would replace both wrought iron and cast iron as the preferred metal for construction. During the late 19th century, great advancements were made in the use of cast iron, gradually replacing wrought iron as a material of choice. Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury, designed by Charles Bage, was the first building in the world with an interior iron frame. It was built in 1797. In 1792 William Strutt had attempted to build a fireproof mill at Belper in Derby (Belper West Mill), using cast iron columns and timber beams within the depths of brick arches that formed the floors. The exposed beam soffits were protected against fire by plaster. This mill at Belper was the world's first attempt to construct fireproof buildings, and is the first example of fire engineering. This was later improved upon with the construction of Belper North Mill, a collaboration between Strutt and Bage, which by using a full cast iron frame represented the world's first \\"fire proofed\\" building.Blank, A.; McEvoy, M.; Plank, R. (1993) p.2Labrum, E.A. (1994) p.23 The Forth Bridge was built by Benjamin Baker, Sir John Fowler and William Arrol in 1889, using steel, after the original design for the bridge by Thomas Bouch was rejected following the collapse of his Tay Rail Bridge. The Forth Bridge was one of the first major uses of steel, and a landmark in bridge design. Also in 1889, the wrought-iron Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel and Maurice Koechlin, demonstrating the potential of construction using iron, despite the fact that steel construction was already being used elsewhere. During the late 19th century, Russian structural engineer Vladimir Shukhov developed analysis methods for tensile structures, thin-shell structures, lattice shell structures and new structural geometries such as hyperboloid structures. Pipeline transport was pioneered by Vladimir Shukhov and the Branobel company in the late 19th century. Again taking reinforced concrete design forwards, from 1892 onwards Fran√ßois Hennebique's firm used his patented reinforced concrete system to build thousands of structures throughout Europe. Thaddeus Hyatt in the US and Wayss & Freitag in Germany also patented systems. The firm AG f√ºr Monierbauten constructed 200 reinforced concrete bridges in Germany between 1890 and 1897 Leonhardt. p.41 The great pioneering uses of reinforced concrete however came during the first third of the 20th century, with Robert Maillart and others furthering of the understanding of its behaviour. Maillart noticed that many concrete bridge structures were significantly cracked, and as a result left the cracked areas out of his next bridge design - correctly believing that if the concrete was cracked, it was not contributing to the strength. This resulted in the revolutionary Salginatobel Bridge design. Wilhelm Ritter formulated the truss theory for the shear design of reinforced concrete beams in 1899, and Emil M√∂rsch improved this in 1902. He went on to demonstrate that treating concrete in compression as a linear-elastic material was a conservative approximation of its behaviour.M√∂rsch, E. p.83 Concrete design and analysis has been progressing ever since, with the development of analysis methods such as yield line theory, based on plastic analysis of concrete (as opposed to linear-elastic), and many different variations on the model for stress distributions in concrete in compressionHognestad, E.Hoogenboom P.C.J., \\"Discrete Elements and Nonlinearity in Design of Structural Concrete Walls\\", Section 1.3 Historical Overview of Structural Concrete Modelling, August 1998, . Prestressed concrete, pioneered by Eug√®ne Freyssinet with a patent in 1928, gave a novel approach in overcoming the weakness of concrete structures in tension. Freyssinet constructed an experimental prestressed arch in 1908 and later used the technology in a limited form in the Plougastel Bridge in France in 1930. He went on to build six prestressed concrete bridges across the Marne River, firmly establishing the technology.Hewson, N.R. (2003) Structural engineering theory was again advanced in 1930 when Professor Hardy Cross developed his Moment distribution method, allowing the real stresses of many complex structures to be approximated quickly and accurately.Heyman, J. (1998) p.101 In the mid 20th century John Fleetwood Baker went on to develop the plasticity theory of structures, providing a powerful tool for the safe design of steel structures. The possibility of creating structures with complex geometries, beyond analysis by hand calculation methods, first arose in 1941 when Alexander Hrennikoff submitted his D.Sc thesis at MIT on the topic of discretization of plane elasticity problems using a lattice framework. This was the forerunner to the development of finite element analysis. In 1942, Richard Courant developed a mathematical basis for finite element analysis. This led in 1956 to the publication by J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp's of a paper on the \\"Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures\\". This paper introduced the name \\"finite-element method\\" and is widely recognised as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today.Turner, J.; Clough, R.W.; Martin, H.C.; Topp, L.J. (1956) p.803-23, 854 High-rise construction, though possible from the late 19th century onwards, was greatly advanced during the second half of the 20th century. Fazlur Khan designed structural systems that remain fundamental to many modern high rise constructions and which he employed in his structural designs for the John Hancock Center in 1969 and Sears Tower in 1973.Mir, A. (2001) Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the \\"tube\\" and \\"bundled tube\\" structural systems for tall buildings. He defined the framed tube structure as \\"a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation.\\" Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads, for example wind, are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was in the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building which Khan designed in Chicago. This laid the foundations for the tube structures used in most later skyscraper constructions, including the construction of the World Trade Center. Another innovation that Fazlur Khan developed was the concept of X-bracing, which reduced the lateral load on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allowed for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space, and can be seen in the John Hancock Center. The first sky lobby was also designed by Khan for the John Hancock Center in 1969. Later buildings with sky lobbies include the World Trade Center, Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101. In 1987 J√∂rg Schlaich and Kurt Schafer published the culmination of almost ten years of work on the strut and tie method for concrete analysis - a tool to design structures with discontinuities such as corners and joints, providing another powerful tool for the analysis of complex concrete geometries.Schlaich, J., K. Sch√§fer, M. Jennewein In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the development of powerful computers has allowed finite element analysis to become a significant tool for structural analysis and design. The development of finite element programs has led to the ability to accurately predict the stresses in complex structures, and allowed great advances in structural engineering design and architecture. In the 1960s and 70s computational analysis was used in a significant way for the first time on the design of the Sydney Opera House roof. Many modern structures could not be understood and designed without the use of computational analysis.MacNeal, R.H. (1994) Developments in the understanding of materials and structural behaviour in the latter part of the 20th century have been significant, with detailed understanding being developed of topics such as fracture mechanics, earthquake engineering, composite materials, temperature effects on materials, dynamics and vibration control, fatigue, creep and others. The depth and breadth of knowledge now available in structural engineering, and the increasing range of different structures and the increasing complexity of those structures has led to increasing specialisation of structural engineers.

It is a five-story concrete, masonry, and brick building, designed by Louis E. Jallade and built in 1911 by the Norcross Brothers. It occupies a small, irregularly-shaped city block at the upper end of Washington Square, Newport's historic civic center. The building was constructed in a Beaux Arts style, with limestone finish predominating on the main facades, with some terra cotta paneling. Mrs. Thomas Emery, a philanthropist from Cincinnati, Ohio, funded its construction to provide services for Navy members when Newport was a major center of the United States Navy. YMCA closed after the Navy significantly reduced its presence in Newport in 1973. The building now serves as low income (section 8) housing. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Although it is within the boundaries of the Newport Historic District, a National Historic Landmark, it does not contribute to its significance, which has a cutoff date of 1820.

Early life Adams was born in 1915 in Trinidad, Colorado. He graduated from Bisbee High School in Bisbee, Arizona, in 1935. He spent a year playing in the Western Association before moving to the Pacific Coast League (PCL) for the 1936 season. Early professional career In 1936, Adams began playing for the Sacramento Solons of the PCL; he played in the PCL off-and-on for the next 16 seasons. When Adams broke his leg during the 1936 season, he had been leading the PCL in stolen bases, but he missed much of the season with that injury. Adams was in spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals in March 1939 when his jaw was fractured after he was struck with a thrown ball. He still made his major league debut on April 27, 1939 for the Cardinals, but appeared in only two games that season. He was cut in early May. In May 1941, Alan Ward of the Oakland Tribune wrote that Adams had been playing with a stomach illness for a couple of seasons. He was hitting .423 for the Sacramento Solons at the time. Adams finished the season with a .285 batting average in 1941 and then hit .309 the next season. Later career Adams returned to the majors with the Cardinals in 1943, playing in eight games before being traded to the Phillies. He played the rest of that season, all of 1944, and the first 14 games of 1945 with the Phillies. Though Adams had been able to play through his stomach ailment, the illness rendered him ineligible to serve in the military in 1944. In May 1945, Adams was traded back to the Cardinals for John Antonelli and Glenn Crawford. Adams played mostly in center field; a slot had opened up in the outfield because Stan Musial was serving in the military. Adams put together his best season with the Cardinals in 1945 and finished 18th in voting for the MVP Award. He finished the season with 109 runs batted in; his 101 RBI with the Cardinals was a record for a Cardinals center fielder until 1987. Adams also played in 1946 with the Cardinals and 1947 with the Phillies. He returned to the PCL after that and played until 1951. In 576 major league games over six seasons, Adams posted a .266 batting average (532-for-2003) with 282 runs, 96 doubles, 12 triples, 50 home runs, 249 RBI and 234 bases on balls. He recorded a .979 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. Later life Adams died of congestive heart failure in Rancho Mirage, California, in 1990.

In 2020, the team retired the Redskins branding amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests. Action On December 13, 2017 a Native American group, Rising Hearts, created several authentic- appearing websites and a Twitter campaign, that seemed to announce that the Washington Redskins had agreed to change its name to the Washington Redhawks for the 2018 season. The sites included one for the team, and for several news outlets: The Washington Post, ESPN, Sports Illustrated and the Bleacher Report. After an initial period, a disclaimer was posted on each spoofed page with a link to a press release explaining the group's action.Red Hawks Press Release The organizers describe their tactic as culture jamming, and state that their intention is to stimulate debate that will eventually lead to an actual name change. Rather than presenting the continued hostility of the debate, their action provided an opportunity for change advocates to write about the positive responses and outcomes that would follow the change. Rising Hearts Coalition includes Rebecca Nagle (Cherokee Nation), Sebastian Medina- Tayac (Piscataway), Valarie Marie Proctor (Cedarville Band of Piscataway), Jair Carrasco, (Aymara), Lindsay Rodriguez (Cheyenne Arapaho), Jordan Marie Daniel (Kul Wicasa Oyate) and Nick Courtney (Makah). Response The Washington Redskins posted a message on their own web site stating: \\"This morning, the Redskins organization was made aware of fraudulent websites about our team name. The name of the team is the Washington Redskins and will remain that for the future.\\" At a news conference the following day the organizers of Rising Hearts stated that their effort was satire or parody, and were surprised that the Redskins issued a statement denying any plans to change, as if it were serious, or \\"fake news\\". Reaction to the \\"culture jam\\" was varied among Native Americans depending upon whether the action was taken seriously or recognized for what it was. Some who took it seriously were elated, then felt betrayed when they found out it was not true. However, the action was supported by some long-time activists on the issue including Suzan Shown Harjo and Jacqueline Keeler, who agreed that it served to stimulate new attention. In an interview, the organizers took exception to the framing of their action as a \\"hoax\\", which has negative connotations of intending to mislead, which was not their intent. Washington Post sports columnist Thomas Boswell wrote based upon his experience when his alma mater, Amherst College, changed its mascot in 2016 from \\"Lord Jeff\\" to the \\"Mammoths\\". Although he was as attached to his team's mascot as any fan, he understood the reason for the change, and got over it quickly. The reason was letters that were discovered revealing that Lord Jeffery Amherst had advocated the use of smallpox-infected blankets as a weapon against Native Americans not to defeat, but to exterminate them. \\"Nicknames such as the Lord Jeffs and the Redskins are two illustrations of the same issue. In the beginning, no one means any harm. But once you know better, and don‚Äôt change, that's when the harm starts.\\" Boswell later explained that while dropping the team nickname, which was never official, was no big deal; changing the name of the town and college also named for the same person would be difficult. In Forbes, Demetrius Bell compliments the creators, stating \\"The best part of any hoax is ultimately how believable the hoax could be and from top to bottom, this is one of the more believable hoaxes that you'll see. If the team did indeed make the incredibly shocking decision to change their nickname and logo, then it wouldn't be a huge shock to see them go the conservative route with a change as relatively simple as this.\\" In July 2020, the team retired the Redskins branding amidst the removal of many names and images as part of the George Floyd protests.

The climate of Ireland is mild, humid and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Ireland's climate is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K√∂ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. (direct: Final Revised Paper) The country receives generally warm summers and cool winters. As Ireland is downwind of a large ocean, it is considerably milder in winter than other locations at the same latitude, for example Newfoundland in Canada or Sakhalin in Russia. The Atlantic overturning circulation, which includes ocean currents such as the North Atlantic Current and Gulf Stream, releases additional heat over the Atlantic, which is then carried by the prevailing winds towards Ireland, giving Ireland a milder climate than other temperate oceanic climates at similar latitudes, for example Seattle in the United States.McCarthy, G. D., Gleeson, E. and Walsh, S. (2015) The influence of the Ocean on the Climate of Ireland. Weather. 70, 8, 242‚Äì245, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.2543/abstract The prevailing wind blows from the southwest, breaking on the high mountains of the west coast. Rainfall is therefore a particularly prominent part of western Irish life, with Valentia Island, off the west coast of County Kerry, getting almost twice as much annual rainfall as Dublin on the east ( vs. ). January and February are the coldest months of the year, and mean daily air temperatures fall between during these months. July and August are the warmest, with mean daily temperatures of , whilst mean daily maximums in July and August vary from near the coast, to inland. The sunniest months are May and June, with an average of five to seven hours sunshine per day. Though extreme weather events in Ireland are comparatively rare when compared with other countries in the European continent, they do occur. Atlantic depressions, occurring mainly in the months of December, January and February, can occasionally bring winds of up to to Western coastal counties, with the winter of 2013/14 being the stormiest on record.Matthews, T., C. Murphy, R. L. Wilby and S. Harrigan (2014) Stormiest winter on record for Ireland and UK. Nature Climate Change, 4, 738-740. During the summer months, and particularly around late July/early August, thunderstorms can develop. Temperature Ireland experiences a lack of temperature extremes compared to other areas at similar latitudes. There is regional variation, with inland areas being cooler in winter and warmer in summer than their coastal counterparts. The warmest areas are found along the southwest coast. Valentia Island has the highest average temperature, at 10.9 ¬∞C. The coldest areas are found inland. Mullingar has the lowest average temperature, at 9.3 ¬∞C. The highest temperature ever recorded in Ireland was 33.3 ¬∞C at Kilkenny Castle, on 26 June 1887. The lowest temperature was -19.1 ¬∞C at Markree Castle on 16 January 1881. Six of the warmest ten years in Ireland have occurred since 1990. Due to climate change, it is estimated that the temperatures will rise everywhere of up to 3.4 degrees by the end of the century. Extreme heat and cold are both rare throughout the country. Summer temperatures exceed 30 ¬∞C usually once or twice every decade (2018, 2016, 2013, 2006, 2005, 2003, 1995, 1990, 1989, 1983, 1976 and 1975 are recent examples), although they commonly reach the high 20s most summers, while severe freezes occur only occasionally in winter, with temperatures below -10 ¬∞C being very uncommon in the lowlands, and temperatures below freezing uncommon in many coastal areas, although temperatures in the Wicklow Mountains are said to reach -10 ¬∞C annually. =Frost= Air frost occurs frequently in the winter, with most areas seeing over 40 days of air frost every year. In northern areas, air frost occurs on average 10.2 days every January, the month in which air frost occurs most frequently. In the Sperrins and the Glens of Antrim air frost occurs around 80 days a year. The pattern is similar with ground frost, with on average around 100 days of ground frost in the lowlands and over 140 in the mountains. The number of frost days in Ireland have declined massively over the past decade. The largest season decrease has been known to take place in winter. Frost is rarer along the coast, in urban areas and also in western and southern areas. Roches Point, County Cork receives the fewest days with air frost, with an average of 7.0 days with air frost recorded annually. Kilkenny, County Kilkenny receives the most days with air frost, with an average of 53.0 days with air frost recorded annually. In Dublin, Dublin Airport records air frost on average 24.3 days per year, while Casement Aerodrome (which is further inland) records air frost on average 41.3 days per year. Sunshine July sunshine in County Cavan The sunniest months are May and June. During these months sunshine duration averages between 5 and 6¬Ω hours per day over most of the country. The southeast gets the most sunshine, averaging over 7 hours a day in early summer. December is the most overcast month, with an average daily sunshine ranging from about 1 hour in the north to almost 2 hours in the southeast. Over the year as a whole most areas get an average of between 3¬º and 3¬æ hours of sunshine each day. Irish skies are completely covered by cloud roughly half of the time. The sunniest part of the island is the southeast coast. Rosslare, County Wexford is the sunniest area, and receives on average 4.38 hours of sunshine per day (1,598.41 hours per year). The cloudiest (i.e. least sunny) parts of the island are generally the west and northwest of the country. However, Birr, County Offaly, in the midlands, is the most cloudy (overcast) station, receiving on average 3.2 hours of sunshine per day, considerably less than the stations at Malin Head in the north or Belmullet in the west. Inland areas tend to receive less sunshine than coastal areas due to the convective development of clouds over land. Cloud develops because of vertical air currents caused by thermal heating of the ground. Precipitation =Precipitation= Rainfall is the most common form of precipitation on the island, and is extremely common throughout Ireland, although some parts of the west coast equally as much rain as the east coast. Rainfall in Ireland normally comes from Atlantic frontal systems which travel northeast over the island, bringing cloud and rain. Most of the eastern half of the country has between of rainfall in the year. Rainfall in the west generally averages between . In many mountainous districts rainfall exceeds per year. The wettest months almost everywhere are December and January. April is the driest month generally, but in many southern parts June is the driest. The average number of \\"wet days\\" (days with more than of rain) ranges from about 151 days a year along the east and southeast coasts, to about 225 days a year in parts of the west. The wettest weather station is Valentia Island, which receives of rain per year, on average. The driest weather station is Casement Aerodrome, which receives of rain per year, on average. The weather station with the highest number of \\"wet days\\" is Belmullet, with 193 days per year, while the station with the lowest number of \\"wet days\\" is Dublin Airport, with 128 days per year. Rainfall records Source: *The driest year recorded in Ireland was 1887, with of rain recorded at Glasnevin, County Dublin. *The longest drought in Ireland occurred in Limerick between 3 April 1938 and 10 May 1938 (37 days). *The greatest monthly total was ; recorded at the Cummeragh Mountains, County Kerry, in October 1996. *The greatest annual total was ; recorded at Ballaghbeena Gap in 1960. *The greatest daily total was ; recorded at Cloone Lake, County Kerry, on 18 September 1993. =Snowfall= Snow in Wicklow Severe cold weather is uncommon in Ireland with the majority of winter precipitation coming in the form of rain, although hills and mountainous regions in the country can commonly see up to 30 days of snowfall annually, with the Wicklow Mountains sometimes seeing 50 or more days of snowfall annually. Most low-lying regions of the island only see a few days of lying snow per year (from December to March inclusive), or may see no snow at all during some winters. However, there are preparations for snow and ice, including the distribution of grit, salt, and other snow-treatable minerals. In late 2011, the Irish Government set up \\"Winter-Ready\\", in order to prepare the country for such severe weather. Due to the variability of Ireland's weather (which is mainly because of the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, as well as Ireland's northerly latitude and vulnerability to Siberian/Arctic winds) weather during the winter months is difficult to predict, with the aforementioned factors making both extremely low temperatures and relatively mild temperatures possible. The snowiest weather station is Clones, County Monaghan, which receives, on average, nearly 30 days of snow and/or sleet per year. Of these, 10.8 days have snow lying at 09:00. The least snowy weather station is Valentia Island, County Kerry; which receives, on average, 5.6 days of snow and/or sleet per year. Of these, 0.8 days have snow lying at 09:00. =Hail= Hail, like snow and sleet, is also rare in Ireland; however, it can occur at any time of the year. It is most common in spring during thunderstorms. Malin Head, County Donegal receives the most hail, with an average of 48.4 days per year. Roche's Point, County Cork receives the least hail, with an average of 8.0 days per year. =Thunderstorms= Thunderstorms are quite rare in Ireland. They are more likely to happen in late summer, although they can occur at any time of the year. Cork Airport, County Cork experiences the least thunder; receiving it 3.7 days per year on average. Valentia Island, County Kerry experiences the most thunder; receiving it 7.1 days per year on average. Wind Generally, the coast tends to be windier than inland areas, and the west tends to be windier than the east. The station with the highest mean wind speed is Malin Head, County Donegal, averaging at . Malin Head also receives the most gale- force winds, recording them on average 66.0 days per year. The station with the lowest mean wind speed is Kilkenny, County Kilkenny; averaging at . The station that records the lowest number of gale-force winds is Birr, County Offaly; recording them on average 1.2 days per year. The highest wind speed ever recorded in Ireland was at Fastnet Lighthouse, County Cork on 16 October 2017. Tornadoes are very rare in Ireland, with around less than ten reported every year - mostly in August. Fog Fog in the Wicklow Mountains Fog is more common inland and on higher altitudes; mainly during winter and during the morning at times of high pressure. The foggiest station is that at Cork Airport, County Cork, which has 99.5 days of fog per year. The least foggy station is that at Valentia Island, County Kerry, which has 8.9 days of fog per year. Visibility Visibility is generally very good, because of the proximity of industry to the coast, allowing breezes to disperse any smog. Mist and fog often occur, as well as coastal fog in the east, but it is generally not long-lasting. However, in winter, it can be slow to clear.

Broadcast in 2008, the storyline is significant in the show's history as it involved a series of bombings in and around Sun Hill, which resulted in the death of PC Emma Keane.http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/the-bill/episodes/can-stone-save-emma Three major events occur across the storyline: PCs Armstrong, Gayle, Fletcher and Sgt. Stone's gang is found out by PC Keane, who does not agree with their techniques, Keane is later killed in a bomb blast, and DI Karen Lacy makes her debut and departure in three episodes. Synopsis Two almighty explosions occur in Colshaw Street, south of Canley. Upon investigation, it is believed that both blasts appear to have been caused by fertilizer bombs. Seven people are killed in the explosions, with many others injured. As the officers stretch to uncover who is behind the attacks, PC Emma Keane is tasked with clearing an office block, Industry House. She manages to escort all the civilians from the building, but before she can escape, a bomb goes off, killing her instantly. The counter terrorism unit are tasked with leading the investigation. At this point, they believe that a coordinated and highly motivated group, possibly political, are believed to be behind the attacks, and it is currently unknown why any of the three targets were bombed, and a connection between the three businesses is yet to be established. In the aftermath, Barton Street police station receive an email explaining today's bombings, and suggesting that more are to come. Three bombs have killed and maimed innocent people and the police are no closer to finding who's behind the attacks. Whoever the bomber is, they're very intelligent and motivated: they've managed to manipulate the situation so the police are chasing a victim rather than the offender. What has been uncovered from the investigation is the motivation behind this violent campaign ‚Äì the four evils of the internet. Avenging the evils, two business men were targeted and killed for supporting porn online, one man for being racist, and another man for identity theft who was set up to appear to be the bomber. The upshot is the bomber is still out there and there's a fourth target yet to get their comeuppance, a child abuser. The bomber led a campaign of terror that rocked London. In his wake, scores of innocent people were either seriously injured or left for dead. The bomber picked off each perpetrator of the four evils, one by one. His method was to blow each one up with a remote controlled incendiary device. Today all this culminated. Peter Waverley, a child abuser, was the last target. The bomb ended up in his wife's car outside their child's school. There in the school yard a colossal fire ball engulfed the area when the device exploded. Shortly beforehand CID officer DC Grace Dasari figured out the bomber's location - her appeals to give it up didn't work - instead the bomber deliberately detonated the bomb at the school using a mobile phone.

The pediment (as did the gable at the opposite end of the house) had an astylistic triple window in it. The roof was topped by an octagonal cupola with belvedere, with two narrow chimneys piercing the ridge line.

He has written screenplays of classic Bollywood movies like, Sujata, Bandini, Devdas, Majhli Didi, Abhimaan and Teesri Kasam. He has written stories for movies like Baap Beti, Shatranj, Raja Jani. He has also acted briefly in Do Bigha Zameen, Teesri Kasam and Lukochuri. Later in his career, he directed four movies as well. Biography Nabendu Ghosh was born 27 March 1917 in Dhaka (presently in Bangladesh). At the age of 12 he became a popular actor on stage. As an acclaimed dancer in Uday Shankar style, he won several medals between 1939 and 1945. Ghosh lost a government job in 1944 for writing Dak Diye Jaai, set against the Quit India Movement launched by Indian National Congress. The novel catapulted him to fame and he moved to Calcutta in 1945. He soon ranked among the most progressive young writers in Bengali literature. After partition, Urdu was declared the state language of East Pakistan; thereby banning all Bengali literature and films. It was this political division that prompted Nabendu Ghosh to join Bimal Roy in 1951, when he left New Theatres in Kolkata, to make films for Bombay Talkies. Others in the team who also shifted were Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Asit Sen, Paul Mahendra, Kamal Bose and later Salil Chaudhury. After Bimal Roy's death, Ghosh worked extensively with Hrishikesh Mukherjee. Nabendu Ghosh has written on all historical upheavals of 1940s ‚Äì famine, riots, partition ‚Äì as well as love. His oeuvre bears the distinct stamp of his outlook towards life. His literary efforts are 'pointing fingers.' There is a multi-coloured variety, a deep empathy for human emotions, mysterious layers of meaning, subtle symbolism, description of unbearable life. Love for humanity is also reflected in his writings. He has to his credit 26 novels and 14 collections of short story. He directed the film Trishagni (1988), based on Saradindu Bandopadhyay's historical short story Maru O Sangha. He died on 15 December 2007. He is survived by two sons, Dr Dipankar and filmmaker Shubhankar, and daughter Ratnottama Sengupta (film festival curator, author, and former The Times of India film journalist). His wife Kanaklata had died in 1999. His autobiography, Eka Naukar Jatri was published in March 2008. His daughter-in-law, Dr Soma Ghosh is an acclaimed classical vocalist, and was conferred with the Padma Shree award in 2016. To commemorate his birth centenary, an English translation of his science fiction novel, Aami o Aami (1999), was released on 25 March 2017. He had worked on the translation with his grandson, Devottam Sengupta. The book is known as Me and I in English.

The ballet premiered as The Night Shadow with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo on Wednesday, 27 February 1946, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with sets and costumes designed by Dorothea Tanning and costumes executed by Karinska. It was first performed by the New York City Ballet on 6 January 1960 at City Center of Music and Drama. The ballet tells the story of a Coquette, a Poet, and a beautiful Sleepwalker. The original 1946 program describes the story as follows: \\"Amid the somber walls of a decaying castle a masked ball has just begun. The host, an eccentric nobleman, receives his guests, among them a poet and a dazzling coquette. The poet, seduced by her charms, dances with her as the guests gradually leave the scene, then she too leaves. As the poet turns to follow, he sees a lovely white apparition gliding across the roofs toward him. It comes nearer and he sees that it is a beautiful somnambulist. He loses his heart to her at once, unaware that she is the wife of the host who keeps her locked away from the world. They dance, and he sees to join her in her realm of dreaming sleep. But they are seen. The coquette, flushed with jealousy, steals out to tell the host....All too soon the marvelous sleep-walker drifts away. The poet would follow her but the guests reenter and their dancing forms a barrier. Finally, he breaks through and disappears but the host follows too and stabs him. As he lies unconscious among the terrified guests the white figure of his love appears once more, gently raises him and together they glide away.\\" The ballet was renamed La Sonnambula in 1961, and has been revived numerous times.

Recent data suggests that these hills are either the remnants of large escarpments that pre-date the Mauna Loa volcano (the largest active volcano in the world), or uplifted blocks from the oldest parts of the Mauna Loa fault system. The Ninole Hills are remains of the top rim of a big deep hollow left when the prehistoric Punalu\`u landslide slid away.http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2002/02_03_07.html USGS - What made the Ninole hills? The rim over time eroded into deep canyons as lava from Mauna Loa ran down into the hollow and slowly filled it instead of burying the rim area, until now parts of the tops of the inter-canyon ridges are still unburied. It is apparent from the ruggedness of the eroded hills that they are much older than the surrounding landscape. Most of the surface of Mauna Loa is thought to have formed within the last 4,000 years, but the Ninole Hills are estimated to be between 100,000 and 200,000 years old. During this period there seem to have been massive failures in the support of the south wall of Mauna Loa, resulting in debris landslides that removed chunks out of the volcano, revealing remnants of the older sections of Mauna Loa.

Life and career  = Early experience with Music = Aslƒ± G√∂kyoku≈ü, who is also known as Aslƒ± was born on 26 October 1977 in Istanbul. Her work in music began with the band that she helped form during her years at high school, which was called \\"Phoenix\\". The group started off like any other garageband, which had their members doing their own thing and performing gigs at their high school whenever possible. Following their high school years, a few of the founding members of the band left and only to be replaced by new interested members. Of course, Aslƒ± stayed as she continued performing and working with her band mates. With the new group members being added, the band decided to change their names to that of, \\"Mary Jane\\". Their music basically consisted of rearranging cover hits and performing at local halls, bars and wherever they had been invited to perform. = Working with other Turkish artists = Their first performance occurred at the Beyoƒülu Guitar Bar. They then went on to perform at the famous Kemancƒ± rock bar for three years in Istanbul. Aslƒ± has worked with √úmit √ñzt√ºrk (at guitar) in the album Neresindeyim; Sessizzce song is √úmit's song in the album. It was during this period that Aslƒ±'s publicity and fame began to rise. Her strong vocal performance with the band helped her raise some eyebrows and so it was not long before she found herself being offered to be a back vocalist for famous Turkish rock artist, Haluk Levent. Aslƒ± had worked with Haluk for short period of time. She then moved on and agreed to be a back vocalist for yet another famous Turkish artist, Teoman. Aslƒ± had worked with Teoman for a longer period of time and through these experiences, she began to gain further knowledge in the music industry. Moreover, during the same period as she was being a back vocalist, she took courses in singing and solf√®ge which naturally expanded her knowledge in music in general. = Neresindeyim & Su Gibi = Following all these experiences and background knowledge she achieved, Aslƒ± decided to step up and record her own album with the support of her friends, Serkan √áelik√∂z and Selim √ñzt√ºrk who are members of the famous Turkish group, Kargo. Aslƒ± would go on and sign a contract with Sony Music Turkey and concentrated her attention at working into releasing her first album. Unfortunately, things did not seem as easy as earlier as expected and so the following year she relied on the help of famous composers, Serkan and Selim to direct her attention as well as guide her through this first solo journey into releasing an album. After all the intensive work at the studio for roughly three years, Aslƒ± had finally been able to release her first album in 2000 which was titled, \\"Neresindeyim\\" in 2000. Some of the singles released from this album includes \\"√ñl√ºm Kapƒ±mƒ± √áalmasa da\\", \\"Ke≈üf‚Äôi Alem\\" and \\"Sessizce\\". The album had some relative success at the beginning, though it was not a popular sell-out album. Due to that, Aslƒ± took a little break from the whole music industry and finally ended up coming out with her second album called \\"Su Gibi\\" in 2004. Some of the singles released off from this album include, \\"Su Gibi\\", \\"T√ºm ≈ûehir Aƒüladƒ±\\", and \\"K√∂rd√ºƒü√ºm\\". All of the tracks in this album had been composed by Aslƒ± herself. = Dans Etmeye ƒ∞htiyacƒ±m Var = In April 2007, Aslƒ± went on to release her third album which is titled, \\"S√∂ylediƒüim ≈ûarkƒ±larda Saklƒ±\\". Surprisingly, it has managed to achieve a lot of attention and success thus far. Her first single released, \\"Dans Etmeye ƒ∞htiyacƒ±m Var\\" (which means \\"I need to dance\\") is frequently played on Turkish radio and TV stations. A few months afterwards, Aslƒ± went on to release her second single called, \\"Yardƒ±mcƒ± Olmuyor\\" (which means \\"It doesn't help\\").

History  The meeting house was built in 1735 and served as a worship place for the Second Congregational Church, originally a Calvinist congregation. From 1755 to 1786, Ezra Stiles, a well-known minister who later became president of Yale University, pastored the church and lived in the Ezra Stiles House across the street. During the American Revolutionary War, British forces occupied the meeting house and minister's house for use as a barracks and hospital from 1776 to 1779. After the war, a committee of Second Church members, including William Ellery, Henry Marchant, Robert Stevens and William Channing wrote to John Adams in Europe requesting that he contact Reformed congregations there for assistance in repairing the church due to the British army's damage to the building. Adams responded that he would be unable to help because of differences in European attitudes toward soliciting for funds. Regardless of the difficulties, the building was extensively repaired in 1785. The congregation later left the building and merged with Newport's First Congregational Church to become United Congregational Church to which the building was sold in 1835. In 1847 the Central Baptist Society, which broke off from the Second Baptist Church in Newport, purchased and extensively modified the building. The Central Baptist Church later reunited with the Second Baptist Church and then in the 1940s reunited with the First Baptist Church in Newport to form the United Baptist Church. In 1950 St. Joseph's Church of Newport purchased the meeting house and further renovated the structure. The Clarke Street Meeting House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

Its boundaries, according to the City of Toronto, are by Bathurst Street to the east, Bloor Street to the north, Dovercourt Road to the west and College Street to the south. It is a mature downtown neighbourhood. Within this official neighbourhood of the City of Toronto are two neighbourhoods, Palmerston and Little Italy and the commercial enclave of Mirvish Village. History View of Palmerston Boulevard south of Harbord Street, c. 1909. The homes in the area were largely from the Victorian-era. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Ontario provincial and Metropolitan Toronto governments proposed running a six-lane north‚Äìsouth expressway to the east of Grace Street. This was an extension of Highway 400 and would have gone from a proposed Crosstown Expressway in the vicinity of Davenport and Dupont, south to the Gardiner Expressway. In the 1960s, opposition to the Spadina, Crosstown and Christie expressway projects led the then City of Toronto to oppose the Christie and Crosstown projects. After the cancellation of the Spadina Expressway by the province, the Crosstown and Christie expressway projects were abandoned as well. Son to Italian immigrants, Johnny Lombardi founded one of the first multilingual radio stations in Canada, CHIN in 1966, in Palmerston‚ÄìLittle Italy. Honest Ed's from Bathurst and Bloor Street, two major roads that run along the neighbourhood's boundaries. The neighbourhood is primarily residential, consisting mainly of residential side streets full of semi- detached homes, mostly built in the early 20th century. The major streets are Bloor Street to the north, running east‚Äìwest, a four-lane arterial road commercial in nature. Bloor Street has many commercial storefronts and businesses. To the east is Bathurst Street, running north‚Äìsouth, another four- lane arterial road with mostly residences along both sides. Running east-west is Harbord Street, a four-lane arterial road with a mix of residences and commercial storefronts and restaurants.

Notable landmarks in the neighbourhood include: * Honest Ed's (closed 2016) * Bathurst Street Theatre * Harbord Street Bridge Mirvish Village Mirvish Village is a commercial enclave on Markham Street, which is one block west of Bathurst Street, and encompasses the two sides of the street and back alleys for one block south of Bloor Street. The entire city block on each side is about to undergo a major transformation. The area that makes up Mirvish Village is made up of a series of former Victorian homes on Markham Street which housed independently owned shops, art studios, cafes, bookstores, boutiques and galleries. Between 1959 and 1963, the late Ed Mirvish of Honest Ed's bought up the east side of the block, immediately south of his store, with the intention of tearing down the houses and building a customer parking lot. Toronto's municipal government refused to issue a building permit; therefore, Mirvish converted the buildings into art studios and galleries with the help of his wife, Anne, a sculptor. Later, he purchased the houses on the other side of the street. His son owned the David Mirvish Gallery, which opened in 1963 as one of Mirvish Village's first shops and which continued for 15 years; along with David Mirvish Books which continued for several more years. A new chapter began with the Honest Ed's / Mirvish Village Proposed Redevelopment project. 23 buildings are considered heritage and will be preserved and renovated inside. The retail storefronts will remain small and varied. The heritage buildings on the east side will have a series of high rental apartment buildings behind them. A pedestrian marketplace and ‚ÄúHonest Ed‚Äôs Alley‚Äù are proposed on the east side and a park and daycare will be included on the west side. Honest Ed's was demolished in 2016.

Early life  Sharpe was born in Kingston, New York, in 1858, and was the son of Civil War veteran Brevet Major General George H. Sharpe. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1880. Career  Sharpe served on frontier duty with the 4th Infantry Regiment (United States) at Fort Laramie, Wyoming for the next year and a half. Following a six months' leave of absence, he submitted his resignation from the Army to take effect June 1, 1882. About fifteen months later on September 12, 1883, Sharpe was reappointed to the Army as a commissary of subsistence with the rank of Captain and assigned to temporary duty at New York City. He was then stationed at West Point 1884 to 1889. From 1889 to 1898, he served as a commissary officer at various locations to include Washington, Oregon and the St. Louis Depot. He was promoted to the rank of Major on November 13, 1895. He transferred from St. Louis to Boston on March 15, 1897, but assumed his duties there only after he had purchased and distributed supplies for the relief of sufferers from the Mississippi flood at St. Louis, Missouri and at Cairo, Illinois. When war with Spain was imminent in April 1898, he was appointed chief commissary of the First Army Corps, and deployed with the Corps to Puerto Rico. There he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and appointed an assistant commissary general of subsistence. He remained on duty in Puerto Rico until December 21, 1898. For a short time, he was assigned to the Chicago Depot as purchasing commissary general, but in September 1899 he was ordered to Washington to act as assistant to the Commissary General of Subsistence. This assignment lasted until the spring of 1902. He was then sent to Manila as chief commissary of the Division of the Philippines. By that time he been promoted to the rank of Colonel and was the senior officer in the Subsistence Department. On October 3, 1900, he was elected as a hereditary companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States by right of his father's service in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Sharpe's tour of duty in the Philippines lasted until he was again recalled to Washington to act as assistant to the Commissary General of Subsistence. He served in this capacity from June 22, 1904, to October 8, 1905. He was commissioned Commissary General of Subsistence with the rank of Brigadier General on October 12, 1905, and was reappointed for a second four-year detail in 1909. In the summer of 1907, he sailed to Europe at his own expense to investigate the supply departments of the British, French, and German armies. He visited the schools for bakers and cooks maintained by those armies. The data he obtained on the use of rolling kitchens in the French and German armies materially assisted in the development of similar equipment suitable for the U.S. Army. Upon his return to Washington in September 1907, General Sharpe submitted recommendations to the War Department urging the establishment of a supply corps. While these were not adopted, they undoubtedly proved helpful when the subject of consolidating the Quartermaster, Subsistence, and Pay Departments into one agency was being considered four years later. Sharpe was so enthusiastic about establishing a consolidated supply corps that Quartermaster General James B. Aleshire called him the father of consolidation. Many of Sharpe's friends recommended that he be selected to head the newly created Quartermaster Corps in 1912. But when his classmate, General Aleshire, was appointed, Sharpe accepted a subordinate post in the Corps and worked devotedly to prove the value of consolidation. When ill health brought General Aleshire's retirement four years later, General Sharpe was appointed to succeed him as Quartermaster General on September 16, 1916. This was approximately seven months before the United States declared war against Germany. =World War I= The Quartermaster Corps and the War Department generally were unprepared for World War I. The supply bureaus within the Quartermaster Corps were eager to procure and ship as quickly as possible the enormous quantities of supplies for which they were responsible. However, their uncoordinated procurement resulted in excessive and unbalanced railway shipments that overtaxed port facilities and finally developed into a serious congestion of the railroad system in the winter of 1917‚Äì18. By that time shortages in clothing, hospital equipment, and other supplies were causing hardships in Army camps, and it was charged by some that the lack of adequate clothing and shelter was responsible for an epidemic of pneumonia sweeping through the camps. General Sharpe was held responsible by many for a large share of the supply crisis that had developed. These developments stirred a widespread uneasiness that led to a Congressional hearing on the conduct of the war. In the end the General Staff took complete control of supplies and the Office of the Director of Purchase and Storage in the Purchase, Storage, and Traffic Division was erected on the foundation of the Quartermaster Corps. On December 15, 1917, a War Council was formed consisting of the Secretary of War, the Assistant Secretary of War, the Quartermaster General, the Chief of Artillery, the Chief of Ordnance, the Judge Advocate General, and the Chief of Staff. The War Council was to oversee and coordinate all matters of supply and to plan for the more effective use of the military power of the nation. While serving on the Council, General Sharpe was required to delegate all his administrative duties to an acting chief Quartermaster designated by the Secretary of War. In June 1918, General Sharpe was relieved from duty with the War Council and assigned to the command of the Southeastern Department. The following month he was appointed a Major General in the line of the Army, with rank from July 12 and officially ceased to be Quartermaster General. General Sharpe requested retirement on May 1, 1920, he was then 62. Retirement and death  In his later years, he lived in Providence, Rhode Island, where he died at the age of 89, on July 13, 1947. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Legacy General Sharpe was inducted into the Quartermaster Hall of Fame in 1989.

He was sometimes known as Louis de Vermandois, after his title. He died aged 16 unmarried and without issue. Early life Marie Anne, by Louis-√âdouard Rioult. Louis de Bourbon was born at the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 2 October 1667. He was named after his father. Like his elder sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, who was known at court as Mademoiselle de Blois, he was given the surname of de Bourbon not de France as a result of his illegitimacy. As a child, he called his mother Belle Maman because of her beauty. Louis was legitimised in 1669, at the age of two, and was given the title of comte de Vermandois and was made an Admiral of France. In 1674, his mother entered a Carmelite convent in Paris, and took the name S≈ìur Louise de la Mis√©ricorde. Afterwards, they saw very little of each other. From his mother and his father, Louis had four full siblings, three of whom died before his birth. Life at Palais Royal After his mother left, Louis lived at the Palais Royal in Paris with his uncle, Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans, and his wife Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate. At the Palais- Royal, he became very close to his aunt despite her well-known dislike of Louis XIV's bastards. The affection the aunt and nephew had for each other never diminished. While he was at the court of his libertine uncle, he met the Chevalier de Lorraine, his uncle's most famous lover. The young count got involved with the older chevalier and his set (including the Prince of Conti), joining a secret group of young aristocrats called, \\"La Sainte Congregation des Glorieux P√©d√©rastes\\" (The Holy Fraternity of Glorious Pederasts) and practicing le vice italien (the contemporary appellation for sodomy). When Louis XIV got wind of the group's existence and his son's involvement in it, he decided to have Louis flogged under his eyes, and to exile him, the Chevalier de Lorraine, and several other noble members. In order to cover up the scandal, it was suggested that the boy be married off as soon as possible; a bride suggested was Anne Louise B√©n√©dicte de Bourbon. Louis was exiled before anything could materialise. Exile and death In June 1682, Louis was exiled to Normandy. In order to smooth things over between father and son, his aunt Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate suggested to the king that Louis be sent as a soldier to Flanders, which was then under French occupation. The king agreed with the suggestion and his son was sent to the Siege of Courtray. It was there that Louis fell ill. Despite his illness, Louis was desperate to regain his father's love and continued to fight in battle regardless of advice given by the royal doctor and the marquis de Montchevreuil that he return to Lille in order to recuperate. Louis died on 18 November 1683, in Flanders, at the age of sixteen. He was buried at the cathedral at Arras. His loving sister and aunt were greatly impacted by his death. His father, however, did not even shed a tear. His mother, still obsessed with the sin of her previous affair with the king, said upon hearing of her son's death: Louis was later suspected of being the Man in the Iron Mask but this could not be true as he died in 1683, while the man in the iron mask died in 1703. His other half siblings included the future duc du Maine; Madame la Duchesse; Mademoiselle de Tours; Duchess of Orl√©ans, Madame le R√©gent and the Count of Toulouse.

From 1993 to 2001, he served on the board of directors of the Portland Teachers Credit Union. Sports anchor In 1977, Metsger was hired as a sportscaster for Portland television station KOIN, eventually working his way up to sports anchor and sports director. In the early 1990s, Metsger was moved to a combination news and sports role. In August 1992, hours after completing an investigative report about leaking nuclear waste tanks at the Hanford Site, Metsger was fired from the station. The report aired three weeks later (narrated by another reporter), and later won the Best Investigative Reporting award from the Oregon Associated Press Broadcasters Association. Political career In 1998, Metsger sought his first political office, running as a Democrat for the Oregon State Senate in the 14th state senate district (later renumbered the 26th due to redistricting). He was unopposed in the Democratic primary, and in the general election; he defeated former Oregon House member Jerry Grisham, who had defeated incumbent Ken Baker in the Republican primary. Metsger was re-elected in 2002 and 2006. In 2008, he became a candidate for Oregon Secretary of State, running to succeed incumbent Bill Bradbury, but lost the Democratic primary to Kate Brown. Metsger sought the Democratic nomination for Oregon State Treasurer in the special election to replace Ben Westlund, but lost to fellow Democrat Ted Wheeler. During Metsger's 12 years in the Oregon State Senate, he chaired the Business and Transportation Committee and served on committees with jurisdiction in the areas of education, revenue, the judiciary, human services and consumer protection.

The district consists mostly of Depauw Avenue from Vincennes Street in the west to Aebersold Drive to the east, and includes portions of the 1200 block of Beechwood Avenue and two residences on Vance Street. New Albany High School is located on the southern edge of the district. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Depauw Avenue is named for New Albany's Depauw family. Washington C. DePauw, a wealthy New Albany banker, was the original owner of the land. He made the bulk of his money from the American Glass Works, which by 1890 produced two thirds of the plate glass in the United States. His summer estate was what became Depauw Avenue. His son Charles Depauw started developing the land, but the first buildings were constructed after Charles died, leaving it to his widow Letitia. The district began as a neighborhood for upper-class residents, and quickly became a preferred place to live in New Albany. The initial four properties were built between 1906 and 1908, an additional four in 1911, and the bulk of the remainder built in the 1920s. Construction slowed during the Great Depression, and then concluded in the 1940s. Of the seventy-one primary buildings in the district, sixty-eight are considered to contribute to the historic integrity of the district, with fifteen contributing outbuildings. Architectural styles are a mix of Colonial Revival, Craftsman/Bungalow (of which 39 of the district's 68 domiciles are), Dutch Colonial Revival, Queen Anne, and Tudor Revival. Residences on the eastern side of the district are long and are affected by the creekbed that runs by the district. In 1994 an architectural study determined that DePauw Avenue could eventually achieve National Register status. In 2006 the Indiana Department of Natural Resources gave a grant of $6,150 to the city of New Albany to prepare DePauw Avenue, Cedar Bough Place Historic District, and the Shelby Place Historic District for registration on the National Register of Historic Places. (Depauw Avenue has an architectural style similar to Shelby Place's, but contains mostly larger domiciles, showing more architectural diversity.)

Known as Falls Road, the highway runs from MD 190 in Potomac to Great Falls Road and Maryland Avenue in Rockville. MD 189 connects Rockville with Potomac and the Great Falls of the Potomac River in southwestern Montgomery County. The highway was constructed from Rockville to Potomac by the early 1920s and extended toward Great Falls in the early 1930s. MD 189 was expanded to a divided highway around its newly constructed interchange with Interstate 270 (I-270) in the late 1980s. The highway was truncated at both ends in the late 1990s. Route description View north along MD 189 at Fallsmead Way in Rockville MD 189 begins at an intersection with MD 190 (River Road) in the village center of Potomac. Falls Road continues south as a county highway to MacArthur Boulevard and the entrance to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, which includes the Great Falls of the Potomac. MD 189 heads north as a two-lane undivided road that passes through several sharp curves between the Bullis School and the Falls Road Golf Course. The highway meets the western end of Montrose Road shortly before entering the city of Rockville. MD 189 expands to a four-lane divided highway ahead of its intersection with Wootton Parkway. The highway continues through a single- point urban interchange with I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) shortly before reaching its northern terminus at a four-way intersection with Great Falls Road, Maryland Avenue, and Potomac Valley Road. Great Falls Road (formerly a direct continuation of Falls Road, now a left turn at the intersection) heads north toward the west end of downtown Rockville and Maryland Avenue heads northeast directly toward downtown. History MD 189 was paved as an macadam road from Montgomery Avenue (now MD 28) in Rockville to Potomac by 1921. The highway was extended as a concrete road from Potomac to what is now MacArthur Boulevard near Great Falls in 1930. MD 189 did not originally have an interchange with Washington National Pike (now I-270). The highway's single-point urban interchange with I-270 was built in 1988. As part of that project, MD 189 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from south of Wootton Parkway to Maryland Avenue. The latter intersection was placed in its present form at that time, replacing the seamless transition from Falls Road to Great Falls Road just north of I-270. MD 189 was rolled back from Great Falls to its present southern terminus in Potomac in 1999. The highway was removed from Great Falls Road in Rockville in 2000.

They are asked to give a thumbs-up or thumbs-down style rating, and then fill out pages of questionnaires about their purchasing preferences, brands they like, products they are likely to use, and so forth. = The programs = The programs can vary from screening to screening, but most often they seem to be two shows: a 1997 drama called Soulmates featuring Kim Raver, and a comedy called City starring Valerie Harper. City was a short-lived show from 1990. Audience members are either told that Valerie Harper is looking to make a comeback, and wants viewers to judge her likability, or that screenwriter Paul Haggis, who wrote the show, wants to retool it for next fall, but needs viewer's opinions on its feasibility first. Other attendees have reported being shown the pilot of Dads, a show from 1997 starring C. Thomas Howell.  Associated companies  Within a few business days after the viewings, most participants receive phone calls come from a California based company called \\"Datascension\\", in which participants are asked additional questions about the presentation. The company has been known to make frequent, repeated calls, in the event no one at the participant's number answers, or if they reach an answering machine.

Civic Associations =Guerreran Civic Community= Genaro V√°zquez Rojas studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico () (UNAM), however did not finish. At age 24 he co- founded the Guerreran Civic Community (CCG), while teaching at schools in the slums of the Federal District. The following year in 1958 V√°zquez Rojas participated in the Revolutionary Teacher's Movement (MRM) during the strike and seizure of the Secretariat of Public Education. V√°zquez Rojas would eventually be fired from his teachers position and go on to represent coffee, copra, and palm workers before the Department of Agrarian Affairs and Colonization (DAAC). =Guerrero Civic Association= Between 1958 and 1960, the CCG would transform into the with the stated goals of fighting for land reform and peasant workers. On May 13, 1960, V√°zquez Rojas called his first neighborhood meeting in the San Francisco district of Chilpancingo, Guerrero, demanding an investigation of Raul Caballero Aburto, then Governor of Guerrero. On October 30, 1960, the ACG led 5,000 people in protest in a civic stand-in, similar to that of a sit-in, in support of recent demonstrations by students at the state university. Two years later, on December 31, 1962, 3,000 protesters assembled in Iguala, police attacked the demonstrators, 28 people were killed, dozens wounded, and 156 were arrested. The ACG was outlawed following the protests and V√°zquez Rojas was accused of killing an agent assigned to watch him. V√°zquez Rojas fled to the north-east, where he lay in hiding for four years. Genaro V√°zquez Rojas was eventually captured at the offices of the National Liberation Movement () (MLN) on November 9, 1966. On April 22, 1968, the ACG would attack the prison in Iguala and free its captured leader. Following the escape, V√°zquez Rojas fled to the hills of the sierra, where he began working on the goals of the ACG on a national level. With the new outlook came a new name, the ACG was reformed into the Guerreran National Civic Association (GNCA). =Guerreran National Civic Association= The GNCA, inspired by Fidel Castro's 1962 Declaration of Havana and the National Liberation Movement's (MLN) August 1961 program, was created to sustain a prolonged guerrilla struggle. The GNCA aimed to create links to other guerrilla organizations and coordinate revolution not just through Guerrero, but also throughout the country. In December 1971, once the goals of the GNCA had been met, the organization was renamed to the Asociaci√≥n C√≠vica Nacional Revolucionaria (ACNR). The ACNR continued to support the guerrilla groups and work toward uniting other radical groups. =Asociaci√≥n C√≠vica Nacional Revolucionaria= The ACNR conducted three guerrilla operations, all taking place between the years of 1969 and 1971. On April 19, 1969 the ACNR organized an assault on the Mexican Commercial Bank, the attack was deemed a failure as the police were able to recover three million stolen pesos and detain the guerrillas who conducted the raid. Due to a mechanical problem with the getaway vehicle, a taxi, the guerrillas were quickly captured and brought to justice. On January 5, 1971, Conaciano Luna Radilla, manager of Commercial Bank of the South, was kidnapped on the highway. A ransom of half a million pesos was requested and received and Conaciano was freed. The final act was taken on November 19, 1971, with the kidnapping of Jaime Castrej√≥n Diez. Diez was the owner of a Coca-Cola concession, proprietor of \\"Yoli\\" soft drink factories, Chancellor of University of Guerrero, and ex-mayor of Taxco. The ACNR demanded the release of nine political prisoners, two and a half million pesos, and formal trials of all peasants held in military barracks. The ACNR received a ransom of 500,000 pesos, and the release of the nine political prisoners to Cuba. Diez was released on December 1, 1971. The ACNR, operating along the Costa Grande between Acapulco and the Balsas River, drew the ire of the federal government for their actions. In response, they were pursued by army battalions, helicopters, paratroopers, and counter-insurgency technology developed by the United States in Vietnam.

It was the first such revival to gain nationwide publicity in China as well as international repute. p.162 The revival occurred during a series of half-day-long meetings led by Jonathan Goforth, a Canadian Presbyterian missionary with the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, who, along with his wife, Rosalind (Bell-Smith) Goforth went on to become the foremost missionary revivalist in early 20th century China and helped to establish revivalism as a major element of missionary work. The effect of the revivals in China reached overseas and contributed to some tension among Christian denominations in the United States, fueling the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy in the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. p.167  Beginnings  In 1907, the Great Pyongyang revival took place in Pyongyang, Korea that involved more than 1000 people during a series of meetings where there was an emphasis of teaching on the work of the Holy Spirit. This influenced revivals in China, including the Manchurian revival of 1908. p.73-76 Goforth notes a fellow missionary's initial observations of the Manchurian Revival in his book, By My Spirit: Goforth arrived in Manchuria in February, 1908, but according to Goforth's account, he \\"‚Ä¶had no method. I did not know how to conduct a Revival. I could deliver an address and let the people pray, but that was all.\\" ch. 3  Shenyang  Goforth held a series of special meetings at Shenyang (Mukden), with some initial opposition from church leaders, there. After Goforth's address the first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was ‚Äúinstantaneous\\". One person gave a ‚Äúpiercing cry\\" then many, now in tears, began spontaneous prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, That year hundreds of members returned to the church fellowship, many of them confessing that they did not think that they had ever really been converted before.  Liaoyang  Goforth then traveled to hold a series of meetings at the Liaoyang congregation. He wrote:  Guangning  Goforth proceeded to Guangning (Kwangning) (near Beizhen, Liaoning) where it was told him by another missionary that, \\"Reports have come to us of the meetings at Mukden and Liaoyang. I thought I had better tell you, right at the beginning, that you need not expect similar results here.\\" After Goforth had given his sermon, he said to the people: Spontaneous prayers come forth from several individuals at every meeting, followed by more confessions of sin and wrongdoing among church leaders. Goforth wrote: ch. 4  Jinzhou  From the very first meeting that Goforth led at Jinzhou (Chinchow) a renewal movement began to develop. Intense prayer and anxiety to get rid of sin characterized the effect on these believer as it had done at the other mission stations. Dr. Walter Phillips, who was present at two of the meetings in Jinzhou, wrote:  Xinmin  The Christians in Xinmin (Shinminfu) had suffered persecution during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. 54 of the church had been killed and were considered \\"martyrs\\" for dying for their faith at the hands of the Boxers. The survivors had prepared a list, containing 250 names of those who had taken part in the massacre. It was hoped by some that revenge would one day be possible. However, after the revival meetings, the list of names was brought up to the front of the church and torn into pieces and the fragments were trampled under foot.  Yingkou  Goforth ministered at Yingkou (Newchwang), the final resting-place of Scottish missionary William Chalmers Burns. Burns' impact was still being felt 40 years later among the Christian community of Yingkou. However, the same kind of repentance and prayer broke out, here as Goforth wrote:  References   Bibliography  * Rosalind Goforth,Goforth of China; McClelland and Stewart, (1937), Bethany House, 1986. * Rosalind Goforth, How I Know God Answers Prayer (1921), Zondervan. * Ruth A.

Also called the Orchestre du Jardin de Guin√©e, after the \\"bar dancing\\" music venue in Conakry that still exists today, the group made a number of recordings for the state-owned Syliphone label and become one of the first modern dance musical groups in Guinea to use traditional musical instruments and fuse together traditional Guinean folk music with more modern influences. Background The newly independent state of Guinea established a number of music groups, competitions and festivals throughout the country to play the traditional musics of Guinea rather than the European styles that were popular in the colonial period. The government also set up the Syliphone label to record the ensuing music and thus preserve and enhance the culture of the new nation. Balla et ses Balladins were one of the most popular groups arising from these initiatives. Career The group was named after their leader trumpet player Balla Onivogui, who was born in 1938 in Macenta, a small town in south-east Guinea and was a student at a conservatory in Senegal before being recruited to play in the Guinea independence celebrations in 1959. He quickly became a member of the state's leading orchestra, the Syli Orchestre National, who were tasked with working with music groups throughout Guinea to train them to play the traditional musics of the country. In order to expand this programme the government split the orchestra into smaller units, one of which under the leadership of Balla became Balla et ses Balladins and held a residency at the Conakry nightspot Jardin de Guin√©e. (The other group emerging from the split was the equally renowned Keletigui Et Ses Tambourinis.) Les Balladins made a number of recordings for the state-owned Syliphone label, which was founded in 1968. The group also toured abroad representing Guinea and some members worked as backing musicians for Miriam Makeba when she lived in Guinea in the 1970s. In 1970 Balla had a falling-out with some government officials and was briefly replaced as leader by his friend and trombone player Pivi Moriba, to be restored following the intervention of president S√©kou Tour√© himself. Sterns. STCD 3035-3036. Guinea suffered a series of economic crises in the 1970s and in 1983 the national orchestras were all established as private concerns. In 1984 President Sekou Toure died, and the Syliphone label ended. Balla et ses Balladins continued to play during the Lansana Conte era, and when Balla Onivogui retired in the late 1990s his group recruited new musicians and still performs in Conakry. Balla Onivogui died from a heart attack on 15 March 2011 in Conakry at the age of 75.

Luchins (March 8, 1914 ‚Äì December 27, 2005) was one of the most important American Gestalt Psychologists and a pioneer of group psychotherapy. He was born in Brooklyn, New York and died in New York.  Biography  Luchins was a student and staff member of Max Wertheimer, the main originator of Gestalt Psychology. After Max Wertheimer fled to the USA and started lecturing at the New School for Social Research, Luchins worked as his assistant and became one of his closest collaborators from 1936 till 1942. (In the 1970s he and his wife Edith Hirsch published a series of transcripts and reports on Wertheimer's advanced seminars and workshops.) He is well known for his research on the role of a mental set (Einstellung effect) in the use of the various water jar refill problems. The idea was to find out, to what extent the successful use of a problem solving strategy has a negative effect when the task cannot be solved by the previous strategy. Other fields of research were group psychotherapy and research methods and strategies. Luchins lectured at Yeshiva University (New York), McGill University (Montreal), the University of Oregon, the University of Miami. From 1962 on he was professor of psychology at the University at Albany, State University of New York and professor emeritus from 1984.

The light was deactivated in 1954 after Hurricane Carol and was going to be destroyed, but local citizens protested, and eventually Carl and Carolyn Haffenreffer bought the lighthouse in 1961. Explaining his decision to purchase the lighthouse, Carl Haffenreffer said, \\"I was afraid someone was going to paint it pink or haul it away for scrap.\\" The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

One of just five Navy primary training squadrons, VT-27 is one of two located on the Texas Coastal Bend. History Training Squadron 27 was initially established on July 11, 1951 as Advanced Training Unit-B at Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi. The command moved to Naval Air Station, Kingsville in 1952 and again to Naval Air Station, New Iberia, Louisiana in 1960. It was there the squadron was redesignated VT-27 in July of that year and about that time that the Grumman S2F-1T Tracker was put into service as a multi-engine trainer. In September 1962 the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system changed the Tracker's designation to TS-2A. In July 1964, the \\"Boomers\\" were returned to Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi where they continue to be an important part of the community. In 1973, the squadron began a transition to the role of a primary training squadron with the arrival on 1 August of the first T-28B Trojan. By 1 October 1973, the last Grumman TS-2A Tracker had departed, signifying the end of the advanced training role and the completion of the transition to primary training. In August 1983, the squadron took delivery of the first T-34C Turbo Mentor aircraft. From March 1984, when the last T-28B ever used for naval flight training departed, to June 2013, the T-34C was the mainstay of the Navy and Marine Corps primary flight training program.

History  The castle of Leiria was built by D. Afonso Henriques for the purpose of creating a line of defense against the Arabs. In 1142 he reinforced the defense of the castle after regaining Leiria. D. Sancho I ordered erection of the walls of the castle in 1195. In 1324 D. Dinis ordered construction of the keep (Tower of Menagem) which was completed only during the reign of D. Afonso IV. In the early 16th century D. Manuel ordered a sacristy to be built between the main chapel and the bell tower. Throughout the centuries the castle gradually lost its military value. It was badly damaged during the French invasion. At the end of the 19th century restoration of the castle started in 1915 by the initiative of Liga dos Amigos do Castelo. The restoration project was directed by Ernesto Korrodi between 1921 and 1933, and then by Baltazar de Vastro. The castle hosted important events as the meetings of the first courts called by D. Afonso III; became the residence of D. Denis and Queen Elizabeth; transformed into a meeting venue for the new court in the reign of D. Ferdinand I and the marriage of D. Jo√£o I‚Äôs son D. Afonso was celebrated in this castle as well. It has been listed as a National monument since 1910. The castle was damaged by the 1969 earthquake.  Architecture  The present configuration of the castle of Leiria was influenced by the 4 major construction periods: the 12th century‚Äôs Romanesque, the 14th century‚Äôs Gothic Dionysus, the early 15th century‚Äôs Gothic Johannine and the restoration trends of late 19th and early 20th century. The shape of the castle is irregular polygonal with solid walls and towers. Pa√ßos Reais (Royal Palace), the Church of Nossa Senhora da Pena, Menagem Tower, the former Collegiate space, and medieval barns are located inside the complex. The castle has 4 floors; the lower two floors are hardly seen from outside and are intended for domestic services. There is a large loggia with eight arches of twin capitals. The loggia has the panorama over the city and was used as a place for leisure and socializing. The loggia is accessed through a room called Royal Hall or Noble Hall which has a total area of 130 square meters used for receptions by monarchs. Stonemasonry, brick and concrete were used in the construction.  Gallery  File:LeiriaCastle.JPGCastle of Leiria File:Leiria-Ch√¢teau-Galeria-19670802.jpgGothic arcade (restored) of the Palace of D.

Biography Diego Capusotto was born in Castelar, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina on September 21, 1961, but moved to the Villa Luro neighborhood of Buenos Aires when he was 7, where he lived for three decades.Diego Capusotto: \\"Todo lo intenso muere r√°pido\\" - Diario Clar√≠n At 25, he began to study acting at the Arlequines Theater. He has starred in several movies. The first, Zapada, una comedia beat (1999), was not released commercially. He followed up with Mataperros (2001), India Pravile (2003), Soy tu aventura (2003), Dos ilusiones (2004) and Regresados (2007), also known as D-Graduated. His most recent film was Pajaros Volando (2010). His television career began in 1992 with De la cabeza, a series in which he worked with actors and comedians like Alfredo Casero, Fabio Posca, Mex Urtizberea, and Fabio Alberti. After the program was killed off by a falling out between Posca and the other actors, Capusotto teamed up with Casero and Alberti in a new comedy project, Cha Cha Cha, which was broadcast intermittently between 1992 and 1997.Gu√≠a de Cap√≠tulos de Cha cha cha - Cha-cha-cha.com.ar Capusotto and Alberti would team up again, in 1998, on the cast of the TV series, Delikatessen, starring Horacio Fontova, and again in 1999 when the program Todo por dos pesos (99 Cent Store) made its debut: this program would finally establish Diego Capusotto as an icon of Argentinian comedy. For this series, in which he established some of his best and most famous characters like \\"Irma Jusid\\", \\"El Hombre Bobo\\", and \\"Peter Conchas\\", Capusotto received the Martin Fierro Award for Comedy Performance in 2001.Se entregaron los premios Mart√≠n Fierro a la radio y la TV argentina - Periodismo.com\\"Telenoche\\" se llev√≥ el premio mayor en la fiesta de los Mart√≠n Fierro - P√°gina/12 Todo por dos pesos went off the air in 2002. In 2003, Capusotto played a mentally ill person in the series Sol Negro, produced by Sebasti√°n Ortega and with performances by Rodrigo de la Serna and Carlos Belloso, among others. On March 25, 2004, Capusotto returned to the theater together with Fabio Alberti to present the comedy show Una noche en Carlos Paz, written by Pedro Saborido and directed by N√©stor Montalbano, where they continued the shtick of Todo por dos pesos.Qu√© noche Bariloche! - Alternativa Teatral The show was followed by Qu√© noche Bariloche, which premiered in 2006. Up to the age of 17, Capusotto wanted to play Football: Capusotto was always involved with music, but he never wanted to make a career of it: In theater, Capusotto co-wrote and starred in the comedy plays Una noche en Carlos Paz (\\"A Night in Carlos Paz\\") and Qu√© noche Bariloche (\\"What a Night, Bariloche!\\"). In 2006, the tv show Peter Capusotto y sus videos (Peter Capusotto and his videos) debuted. The humoristic program (which features rarely seen rock music videos) consists in Capusotto parodying the different facets of the rock-and- roll lifestyle in various sketches, and taking rock personalities and stereotypes for an intertwining critique of several aspects of the Argentinean society and culture, with \\"Luis Almirante Brown (Artaud for millions)\\", \\"Pomelo, √≠dolo de rock\\" (\\"Pomelo, rock idol\\") and \\"Per√≥n y rock\\" as some of the highlights.

February 25, 2010.7 Things You Should Know About Open Textbook Publishing by Judy Baker and Jacky Hood. Educause Learning Initiative. March 8, 2011. One common frustration with traditional textbooks is the frequency of new editions, which force the instructor to modify the curriculum to the new book. Any open textbook can be used indefinitely, so instructors need only change editions when they think it is necessary. Many open textbooks are licensed to allow modification. This means that instructors can add, remove or alter the content to better fit a course's needs. Furthermore, the cost of textbooks can in some cases contribute to the quality of instruction when students are not able to purchase required materials. A Florida governmental panel found after substantial consultation with educators, students, and administrators that \\"there are compelling academic reasons to use open access textbooks such as: improved quality, flexibility and access to resources, interactive and active learning experiences, currency of textbook information, broader professional collaboration, and the use of teaching and learning technology to enhance educational experiences.\\" (OATTF, p. i)  Authorship  Author compensation for open textbooks works differently than traditional textbook publishing. By definition, the author of an open textbook grants the public the right to use the textbook for free, so charging for access is no longer possible. However, numerous models for supporting authors are developing. For example, a startup open textbook publisher called Flat World Knowledge pays its authors royalties on the sale of print copies and study aids.Flat World Knowledge , Author's World Other proposed models include grants, institutional support and advertising.Resources on Open Textbooks , the Student PIRGs  Legislation  Legislation \\"to authorize grants for the creation, update, or adaption of open textbooks\\" and assure those developed would be made available under favorable licenses was introduced into the 111th United States Congress, both in the SenateS.1714.IS Open College Textbook Act of 2009 (\\"Introduced in Senate\\" = IS) by Richard Durbin (D-IL).

Feb 2, 2010. Findings specific to open textbooks detailed in the bill text are: #The growth of the Internet has enabled the creation and sharing of open content, including open educational resources. #The President has proposed a new, significant Federal investment in the creation of online open-source courses for community colleges that will make learning more accessible, adaptable, and affordable for students. #The high cost of college textbooks continues to be a barrier for many students in achieving higher education, and according to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, 200,000 qualified students fail to enroll in college each year due to cost. #The College Board reported that for the 2007-2008 academic year an average student spent an estimated $805 to $1,229 on college books and supplies. #Making high quality open textbooks freely available to the general public could significantly lower college textbook costs and increase accessibility to such education materials. #Open textbooks can improve learning and teaching by creating course materials that are more flexible, adaptable, and accessible through the use of technology. This legislation did not reach the floor of either chamber for debate or vote prior to the conclusion of the 111th Congress.

His program Good Fishing was first syndicated internationally in the mid-1980s. As of 2017, Winkelman produces an additional program, Outdoor Secrets, which with Good Fishing, airs in the United States and internationally on channels such as CBS Sports, American Hero Channel, and Destination America. His programs are also available globally on 25,000 hyper-local websites across the U.S. and Roku, Apple TV, Opera TV, Amazon Fire, and Netflix. Early life Babe Winkelman (nicknamed by his father after baseball giant Babe Ruth) grew up on a dairy farm near the small town of Duelm, Minnesota. He started fishing at age 6 on Stoney Brook, a stream that ran through the family farm. It was there that he started to understand how fish moved around through the seasons and there that his \\"Pattern Approach\\" to fishing got its roots. Pheasants were abundant on the farm as well and his hunting career started there with his first pheasant kill at age 8. Deer hunting started as a driver at age 10 and he shot his first buck at age 12. Through endless hours of hunting and fishing, Babe polished his skills. During the 1960s, Babe spent a lot of time at the family cabin on Hay Lake near Longville, where he refined his \\"pattern\\" approach to fishing that he continues to teach others today. He started working construction after graduating eighth grade and continued learning carpentry throughout high school. He learned from his father, Don Winkelman Sr., who was a carpentry master. Less than two months after graduating high school, he became the youngest person in the history of Minnesota to get his journeyman's Union card. Babe spent his nights playing lead guitar and singing in bands. In May 1969, he started Winkelman Building Corporation Inc., a construction company, along with his brother Dennis and father Don. In February 1970, Johnny Winter called him 3 times for him to go on a world tour as lead guitarist for his band. He decided he couldn't leave his dad and the construction business, and his music career became a hobby that he still practices to this day. By the time Babe was 25, the company had grown into 6 corporations with nearly 200 employees. Babe decided his interests were elsewhere, and he embarked on a full-time career in the outdoors. Outdoor life He started guiding fishermen in 1965 and started fishing tournaments in 1970. In 1973, he helped found the Minnesota State Bass Federation to get bass tournaments started and served as president for nearly 3 years. 1973 was also the year Babe started writing for outdoor publications and gave his first seminar to teach fishing. Babe started in the outdoors full-time in 1975, where he guided, fished tournaments, taught at seminars, and did promotional work for Lindy/Little Joe Fishing Tackle. He became a field editor for Fishing Facts magazine, writing for them and a host of other publications. In the last four decades, Babe has written many articles and has guest hosted hundreds of radio shows and podcast episodes. In 1978, he was hired by S.C. Johnson to introduce a new product to America, \\"Deep Woods OFF.\\" The commercial was Babe, \\"as a professional fisherman\\", needing a stronger insect repellent because of his outdoor endeavors. Babe's fishing television series, Good Fishing, first hit the airwaves in 1980. This prompted him to start Babe Winkelman Productions Inc. and set up his own studio. For nearly 40 years he has owned the trademark,\\"Teaching America to Fish.\\" The show was educational and involved his whole family. The show kept growing in size and covered the U.S. and Canada. During the 1980s, Babe authored a series of \\"how to\\" books on fishing, was the only person to use audio tapes to teach fishing, was the first to develop videos that taught fishing starting in 1984, and went on to produce nearly 100 different titles in the next decade.  Appearances  The Saturday Evening Post ran a feature on Babe in 1987. He was also featured in People Magazine in 1988, Midwest Living around 1990, and thousands of other newspaper and magazine articles, radio, and TV appearances. Excerpts of Good Fishing appeared three times on Married... with Children and about a dozen different movies. Babe was also a guest on Donny & Marie. 1988 was also the year Babe aired his second television series, Outdoor Secrets (hunting series), which was the first hunting show on the air since 1978. Winkelman spoke at a presidential rally for President George W. Bush in 2004. Awards In 1988, Babe was inducted into the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame. In 1992, he was inducted into the Sports Legends Hall of Fame alongside professional boxer Evander Holyfield, baseball player Pete Rose, and 30 other athletes from around the world. Babe is the only outdoorsman ever to be inducted into this hall of fame. In 2001, he was inducted into the Fishing Hall of Fame of Minnesota. In 2007, he was given the Excellence in Craft award by the Outdoor Writers Association of America (OWAA), their most prestigious award for his work with television. Babe Winkelman's production company has won a couple hundred awards for production excellence, including 87 in a two-year span. This included the New York Film Festival, the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival (for a commercial), and production awards including the Teddy, Addy, and the Golden Moose Awards. In 2013, Babe and Kris were nominated by Otter Tail County as Conservationists of the Year for the state of Minnesota. The award recognized the work they have done at some land they bought for hunting with the whole family in 2002 and turned it into a wilderness paradise. In 2015, Babe was inducted into the Legends of the Outdoors National Hall of Fame.

The fighting between pro-government and opposition militias affiliated to respectively the Future Movement and PSP political parties on one side and Hezbollah, Amal, SSNP, LDP and the Arab Democratic Party on the other side, was sparked by a government move to shut down Hezbollah's telecommunication network and remove Beirut Airport's head of security after the discovery of a hidden remote-controlled camera monitoring one of the airport's runway and his alleged ties to Hezbollah. Clashes first occurred on May 7 after a general strike called for by the country's union federation to demand higher wages and decry high consumer prices became overshadowed by the government's decisions and escalated into low-level violence between pro-government and opposition protesters. Violence severely escalated the next morning on May 8 after a televised speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. In his speech, Nasrallah responded to the government's decision to declare the organization's telecommunication network illegal by calling it a declaration of war on the organization, shortly after which fighting between pro-government and opposition militias broke out in Beirut. Within two days, Hezbollah-led opposition fighters had seized control of several West Beirut neighbourhoods from pro-government Future Movement militiamen. In the following days, fighting between pro-government and opposition militias spread to other parts of the country with major clashes in the Aley District and Tripoli. On May 15, an intervention by the Arab League brokered an immediate end to hostilities and a pledge from warring parties to send emissaries to Doha for a mediation process. The resulting Doha Agreement, reached on May 21, 2008, brought an end to the 18-month political feud that exploded into fighting and nearly drove the country to a new civil war. Background On December 1, 2006, a series of protests and sit-ins began in Lebanon, led by the March 8 political coalition which opposed the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. Formed after the Cedar Revolution in 2005, the March 8 coalition was up of the Shiite Hezbollah and Amal, the Christian Free Patriotic Movement and a number of smaller parties such as the SSNP, LDP and the Arab Democratic Party. On the other side of the political divide stood the March 14 coalition, at the time holding the majority of cabinet and parliamentary seats. The March 14 coalition was made up of the primarily Sunni Future Movement and a number of smaller parties including the Druze Progressive Socialist Party and the Christian Lebanese Forces. At the core of commencement of the protests was the unhappiness of Hezbollah with the division of power under the current status quo and the pro-Western course of the Lebanese government. It argued that too much executive power was in the hands of the Future Movement, the primary political party of March 14, which it in their view misused by too closely aligning with Western states, most notably the United States, thereby compromising Lebanon's sovereignty and security. In addition, the period was marked by political strife between the March 8 and March 14 coalitions over the international investigation on the assassination of former prime minister Rafic Hariri, the creation of the future Lebanon Tribunal to prosecute the perpetrators this assassination and the question of Hezbollah's armed status. Hezbollah was the only organization allowed to retain its weapons after the ratification of the Taif Agreement, which brought an end to the Lebanese Civil War, although UN Security Council Resolution 1559 of September 2004 denied the organization the right to retain its arms. By 2008, the military strength of the organization had grown to such levels that it was widely considered to be stronger than the Lebanese Armed Forces. To ensure its interests, Hezbollah demanded a new national unity government in which March 8 would have at least a third plus one of the cabinet seats in order to grant them the ability to veto cabinet decisions. After Shi'a ministers of Hezbollah and Amal had resigned from the cabinet in December 2006 in protest against a decision concerning the Lebanon Tribunal, the opposition demanded the immediate resignation of the cabinet as it now was unbalanced with regard to the proportional representation of religious groups as stipulated by the Lebanese Constitution and therefore was deemed illegitimate. When Prime Minister Siniora refused to resign his cabinet, Hezbollah and its allies on March 8 called on its supporters in early December 2006 to protest against the perceived illegitimacy of the cabinet of Siniora to increase pressure on it. In the face of massive protests, Siniora and the remaining ministers in his cabinet still refused to step down as long as they enjoyed the support of the majority of the parliament. As protestors kept up the pressure on the government with their encampment near the Grand Serail, the prime ministerial office in downtown Beirut, Siniora and his minister were under virtual house arrest due to security concerns since the assassination of Pierre Gemayel, one of Siniora's ministers, in late 2006. With Siniora not giving in, the opposition organized a general strike in January 2007, which ended in sectarian clashes leaving multiple dead and hundreds wounded. Political deadlock took a new turn with the end of term of President √âmile Lahoud in late 2007 as the March 8 and March 14 blocs could not agree on his successor, leaving the country in a presidential vacuum further worsening the political crisis.  May 2008 controversies In May 2008, the tensions between the pro-government and opposition parties escalated when the cabinet announced a series of security decisions. Tensions began with revelations on Friday May 2 made by Progressive Socialist Party leader Walid Jumblatt, a key politician in the ruling March 14 alliance. He announced that a remote- controlled camera had been set up in a container park overlooking Beirut international airport's runway 17, which was frequently being used by March 14 politicians. In March 14 circles, fear was that the monitoring could be used for a possible attack on its leaders, as Lebanon had faced a series of political assasIsinations in recent times. Although Jumblatt did not accuse the party directly, he made clear that he thought March 8's Hezbollah was behind the monitoring system's installment. Hezbollah dismissed the accusations, calling the allegation a product of Jumblatt's imagination and saying that those who leveled them were scaremongering and simply parroting a US campaign against it and other groups which are resisting Israel. In addition to the monitoring system, Jumblatt stated that Hezbollah had laid down a fiber optic telecommunication network connecting its powerbase in Dahiya in South Beirut with cities and towns in South and East Lebanon in predominantly Shiite areas. Although this was known to the government, it was now claimed that the network was being extended to the predominantly Christian and Druze areas of Mount Lebanon. In its response to these allegations, the Lebanese cabinet announced that it regarded the telecommunication network and the monitoring system as a breach of law, undermining the state's sovereignty and the security of its citizens. Therefore, it declared that the matter would be referred not only to the Lebanese judicial system, but also to the Arab League and the United Nations. In addition to infringing state sovereignty, the network was regarded by the government as an infringement on public funds since it claimed that it competes with its own and used the Lebanese infrastructure. The cabinet announced that it would uproot the telecommunication network and in addition also ordered the removal Brigadier General Wafic Shkeir, head of security at Beirut's international airport and considered to be sympathetic to Hezbollah and Amal, on account of failing to deal with the monitoring system. These moves severely antagonized Hezbollah, bringing tensions between the March 8 and March 14 coalitions to a boiling point.  Armed clashes  = May 7: Protests and minor clashes = Coincidentally, a day after the cabinet's decision, on Wednesday May 7, the Lebanese General Workers Union had planned a general strike to demand higher wages and decry high consumer prices. The strike turned violent as the opposition threw their weight behind the strike, paralyzing large parts of Lebanon's capital Beirut. Instigated by the recent developments and the strike, pro-government and opposition supporters took the streets coming into conflict with each other at multiple places. Clashes were first reported when government and opposition supporters in a pro-government sector of Beirut exchanged insults and began throwing stones at each other after Hezbollah supporters insisted on blocking the roads. Witnesses said security forces intervened and gunshots were heard, apparently troops firing in the air to disperse the crowds. In the afternoon, verbal violence and stone throwing turned into more violent clashes, with gunfire sporadically going off in the city. Around the city, armed opposition supporters blocked roads including the strategic road towards Beirut international airport, cutting it off from the rest of the city, and roads to the city's sea port. = May 8 - May 9: Takeover of Beirut = After a tense night with sporadic gunfire, Hezbollah's secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah addressed the country in a speech televised on Hezbollah affiliated al-Manar station in the morning of May 8. He referred to the cabinet's decisions of that week as \\"despotic\\" and having inaugurated a new phase in Lebanese history, similar to the assassination of former prime minister Rafic Hariri in 2005. He stated that the telecommunication network was not a simple commercial operation aimed merely at generating profit for the organization, but \\"integral and fundamental\\" as part of its military apparatus. He claimed that his opponents had already known about the existence of the telecommunication network years before and in drawing attention to the timing of the decision, insinuated that the cabinet's actions were aimed at obstructing the forces of the Resistance (against Israel) in the region. Hezbollah had the right to defend itself, he argued, and metaphorically stated that they would cut-off the hand of anyone that would touch the Resistance. \\"All red lines had been crossed\\", according to Nasrallah, and the actions therefore amounted to no mere than a \\"declaration of war.\\" APC in Beirut, on May 9, during the unrest Minutes after Nasrallah's speech, heavy street battles began between pro-government and opposition militias. Fighting erupted along Corniche Mazraa, an avenue separating Shiite and Sunni areas, later spreading to the western, southern and eastern parts of Beirut where Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods overlapped. Combat was also heard near the office of Lebanon's Sunni religious leader - an ally of the government - and the palatial compound of the Hariri family in Koreitem was hit by RPG fire. More barricades were set up, closing major highways. Opposition militants eventually overran the positions of pro-government militias in West Beirut and burnt-down three pro-government offices. Saad Hariri, leader of the Future Movement, quickly responded to the outbreak of violence, describing the events as a form of fitna, criticizing the actions of Hezbollah as a threat to the unity of the country and calling on Nasrallah to stop the descendance towards civil war. Faced with large-scale inter-communal violence erupting all over the city, the Lebanese Armed Forces decided not to intervene in the clashes for fear of sparking divisions in the army along sectarian lines, as had happened during the civil war. Other factors that as to why the army did not act in line with the cabinet are, according to political scientist Aram Nerguizian, the apprehension among army commanders at how the cabinet chose to address the issue of Hezbollah's telecommunication network. Secondly, the perception among them that cabinet also did not sufficiently consult the army prior to their decision to dismiss Beirut's airport head of security. Thirdly, the presidential ambitions of Army Commander Michel Suleiman - who would indeed within two weeks become the country's next president - and his resulting need not to antagonize the March 8 coalition and its Syrian allies may also have influenced his decision not to intervene against Hezbollah according to Nerguizian. The army's decision to refrain from intervention did spark objections from within however. Some saw it as a \\"missed opportunity\\" for the army to \\"signal its objection to domestic military action by any of the country's competing political/sectarian forces.\\" Around 120 Sunni officers later even offered their resignation as response to \\"the humiliation felt from the military's conduct during the militias' invasion of Beirut\\" as their resignation letter stated. All of the officers except one later repealed their resignation however. Fighting from the previous day lasted throughout the night and only stopped for a short time a little bit after dawn on May 9, 2008. However, fighting quickly resumed after the brief lull. Pro-government militias were however no match to the Hezbollah led opposition forces. All over West Beirut, pro-government militias had lost ground. Media outlets related to the pro-government Future Movement, amongst which Future TV, Al Mustaqbal Newspaper, Future News, Radio Orient and Future-owned Armenian radio station Sevan had been raided by opposition fighters and forced to close. Future TV and Al Mustaqbal were particularly targeted by opposition fighters. RPG missiles were launched from empty adjacent buildings under construction to Mustaqbal's offices, setting fire to two floors. Future TV offices were raided by Hezbollah members who subsequently cut all of its broadcasts. According to Habib Battah, a media analyst, shutting down Future TV was not only a psychological attack on Future Movement's supporters, but also gave the opposition a monopoly on propaganda messages.Crowne Plaza in Beirut on May 9 Overpowered by Hezbollah's military apparatus and besieged in his residence, Saad Hariri had by then ordered militia members loyal to his Future Movement to stand down. The opposition had now firmly moved in and taken over abandoned positions of pro-government fighters, seizing large parts of the capital's western neighbourhoods. The Lebanese Army also stepped in to take over position deserted by pro-government militiamen and in some instance were handed over control of recently conquered position by Hezbollah. In some neighbourhoods, the takeover had been peaceful with opposition fighters facing no resistance as they moved throughout West Beirut. = May 10 - May 12: Fighting spreads to Aley and the North= Flags of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party were raised as a victory during the unrest on May 9th, 2008. As fighting in Beirut dwindled down, violence began to spread to other parts of the country, in particular the Aley District south of Beirut and the north of the country. In the evening of May 9 sporadic clashes erupted in Sidon, where two civilians were killed; and in Bar Elias in the Bekaa Valley where a woman was killed. Also, eight people were killed near the town of Aley in clashes between government supporters and opponents. Seven people who were Hezbollah supporters were killed. On May 10, 2008, a funeral procession was attacked by a shop-owner affiliated with the Amal Movement, whose shop was previously burned down by Sunni militants, leaving six people dead. An Associated Press photographer who witnessed the shooting said the attack came as a procession of 200 people headed toward a nearby cemetery to bury a 24-year-old pro-government supporter killed in previous fighting. At least 14 people were killed in the town of Halba, in the Akkar region of north Lebanon, as about 100 pro-Future Movement gunmen attacked an office of the SSNP. 10 of the dead were SSNP members, three were government loyalists and one was an Australian citizen of Lebanese descent on vacation in Lebanon, who was trying to get information at the SSNP offices about evacuating from the city. The Australian father of four, Fadi Sheikh, reportedly had his hands and feet cut off.Melbourne dad mutilated in Lebanon Herald SunAustralian Fahdi Sheikh's body mutilated by Beirut mob The Australian The SSNP says Fadi Sheikh was a member of the party - but was not a militant. He was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.https://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2008/s2243513.htm One other person was killed in fighting in Sidon and two soldiers died in fighting east of Beirut. Heavy fighting had also broken out between Alawite Hezbollah sympathizers and Sunni supporters of the government in the neighbourhoods of Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbaneh, two neighbourhoods in Tripoli notorious for its sectarian violence, leading thousands to flee their homes. Faced with the escalated situation as a result of the cabinet's decisions, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora announced on May 10 that the cabinet would handover the issue of telecommunication network to the army and, in addition, announced the reinstatement of the head of security of Beirut's international airport. Subsequently, the Lebanese army took a more active stance in the events and announced it had frozen the measures taken by the government and called for all armed militants to withdraw from the streets. In response, Hezbollah announced that it would withdraw its fighters together with other opposition fighters from West Beirut in compliance with the Lebanese army's request, but that a civil disobedience campaign will continue until the group's political demands are met. The next day, Beirut was quiet as control of areas seized by the opposition was handed over to the Lebanese army. Many roads in the capital remained blockaded however, including the strategic airport road, as the opposition continued their campaign of civil disobedience.  Battle of Mount Barook and Aley District  On May 9, heavy fighting broke out in Mount Lebanon between pro-government Progressive Socialist Party fighters and Hezbollah. The clashes started in Aytat, near Kaifun and soon expanded to cover many spots in Mount Lebanon including the cities of Baisour, Choueifat and Aley. Most of the fighting was concentrated on Hill 888. Fighting started when four Druze members of the Aley municipal police were kidnapped by Hezbollah. Soon after the news of the kidnapping spread, the mayor of Aley assembled a group of PSP fighters and went up to Hill 888. As they reached the hill they were attacked by Hezbollah gunmen who wounded a few of the PSP and municipality members. PSP members retaliated by killing 3 of the kidnappers. The incident developed into a significant armed clash. Artillery and mortars were used for the first time during these battles. A ceasefire agreement was supposed to take place at 18:00 of the same day, but fighters from both sides continued to exchange fire. Negotiations were ongoing for the PSP members to give up the fight and surrender their positions to the Lebanese Army, but it never happened. The battles at Aley stopped for several hours, but the two sides clashed again in Mount Barouk to the southeast shortly before midnight. Barook separates the Druze heartland of Shouf from the mainly Shi'ite southern end of the Bekaa Valley. That night Hezbollah's fighters deployed from southern Beirut to the Qmatiye area tried to attack the hills near Aley but they were beaten back. After that Hezbollah tried to go on the offensive again and attacked their rival's positions. The Druze fighters had fought the Hezbollah militants from dug-in positions left over from the 1975‚Äì90 Civil War. The Druze used hunting guns, AK 47s and other machine guns, RPGs and allegedly even 23mm anti-aircraft guns to blast at the advancing Hezbollah fighters. The offensive was backed up by Katyusha rockets fired from southern Beirut. Opposition forces bombarded the pro-government Druze area with artillery while ground forces attacked Druze positions using rockets and machine guns. By morning, the Druze fighters agreed to cease hostilities and several villages loyal to Lebanon's pro-government Druze leader Walid Jumblatt had been handed over to the army. The kidnapped municipality police members were released by Hezbollah on May 12 in exchange of at least 30 Hezbollah members that were kidnapped by PSP in Mount Barook. Clashes in Hamra and Tripoli After a day of relative quiet in Beirut renewed gunfire was heard in the commercial area of Hamra in the western part of the city shortly after midnight on May 12. The fighting occurred near the home of Future Movement leader Saad al-Hariri. A two-man Al Jazeera camera crew suffered injuries while trying to film the fighting and were evacuated by the Lebanese army. Meanwhile, in Tripoli, clashes left one person dead and at least six others wounded. Now taking a proactive role in the events, the Army stated that if the clashes did not end by Tuesday May 13, it would intervene and use force if necessary to end the fighting. The next days saw only limited and sporadic fighting.  Resolution process  = Arab League intervention = As fighting was spreading to other parts of Lebanon, the Arab League, which had been involved as a mediator in Lebanese political crises since 2005, decided to intervene in Lebanon at an emergency meeting on May 11. The League Council mandated the formation of a Ministerial Committee headed by the Foreign Minister of Qatar and the League's Secretary General which was to go to Lebanon and mediate in the crisis. The League Council also called for a halt to the fighting, the withdrawal of militiamen from the streets, the facilitation of the Lebanese Army to restore calm and talks between the Lebanese political leaders. On May 15, after a round of talks with Lebanon's prime political leaders, the Ministerial Committee announced an initial agreement that marked a cessation of all hostilities and entailed that major Lebanese political leaders would enter into a national dialogue the next day in Doha for further mediation. = Doha Agreement = After half a week of deliberations in Doha, Lebanese political leaders signed an accord on May 21 that brought an immediate end to the 16-month political crisis that had been plaguing the country. Following the principle of \\"no victor, no vanquished\\", which entails that no political party or sect can eliminate one of the other political parties or sects, the Doha Agreement was regarded as a compromise deal between government and opposition demands.For further information on how this principle has the effect that past violence continues to remain a concern in the present and facilitate the feelings of emergence of future violence see: Hermez, Sami (2017). War is coming : between past and future violence in Lebanon. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, Inc. . . The accord stipulated (1) the immediate election of Army Commander Michel Suleiman as president; (2) the formation of a national unity government with a blocking third for the opposition; (3) adaption of the electoral law aimed at redistricting based on the 1960 electoral law; (4) a commitment by the signatories not to resort to violence for political gains; (5) initiation of a national dialogue on the promotion of Lebanon's internal sovereignty and (6) a commitment by signatories to abstain from resorting to rhetoric of treason or political and sectarian incitement.Doha Agreement. 2008. Retrieved from https://peacemaker.un.org/lebanon-dohaagreement2008 The accord was considered a victory for the Lebanese opposition as they secured their key demands for veto-wielding power in the new government and a new electoral law which could benefit the opposition in the upcoming 2009 parliamentary elections. In addition, the question of Hezbollah's weapons was postponed, to be dealt with in a future national dialogue. Nonetheless, the opposition had to give concessions regarding the reappointment of Fouad Siniora as Prime Minister, the distribution of ministerial portfolios and the distribution of parliamentary seats in certain electoral districts. Despite Hezbollah's tactical victory on the streets of Lebanon and the securing of it demands in the accord, analysts have pointed out that the events greatly reduced its legitimacy as a popular resistance movement and that it was seen more than ever as a \\"Shiite militia brutally defending its parochial interests.\\" In addition, it increased the distrust and fear of it among other political parties and heightened domestic opposition to its armed status as a result of the use of its weapons against other Lebanese actors, despite its earlier pledge not to do so.  Reactions to the fighting  United States Assistant Secretary of State Sean McCormack discussing the unrest in Lebanon = Domestic reactions = Many March 14 leaders decried the events as a coup, pointed towards the Hezbollah's intricate relationship to the Iranian government and assigned a role played in the events to the latter. Hani Hammoud, a senior adviser to Saad Hariri referred to the events as a \\"one- sided civil war\\" with the end result that \\"Iran has taken over the country\\" Christian leaders Samir Geagea and Amine Gemayel also accused Hezbollah of staging a coup, with the former calling on moderate forces in the Arab world to intervene and asked the international community not to stand idly by. A US diplomatic cable revealed by Wikileaks also showed how on May 11, Gemayel, together with Social Affairs Minister Nayla Mouawad and Telecommunications Minister Marwan Hamadeh urged the US to provide more support to the March 14 coalition. Believing that a Hezbollah victory could be imminent, they proposed several ideas, including extending UN Security Council Resolution 1701 to Beirut's airport, sea port and access roads, an imposement of an air ban against Syria by the US and immediate US military aid to their own militias. PSP leader Walid Jumblatt stated that he still stood behind his support for the government's decisions that week, however he acknowledged that he had underestimated the response from Hezbollah. Regarding Hezbollah's next moves he told reporters to \\"ask [Iranian President] [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad\\", stating that \\"this situation goes beyond Lebanese borders.\\" Furthermore, he linked the events to regional geopolitics stating that \\"the Iranians chose the moment America is weak in the Middle East. The balance of power has completely changed in Lebanon and now we wait to see what new rules Hezbollah, Syria and Iran will lay down.\\" Michel Aoun, leader of the Free Patriotic Movement and a Hezbollah ally whose supporters did not participate in the fighting, spoke in more neutral terms, calling for the return for normality on the streets. = International reactions = The White House condemned Hezbollah's actions with a spokesman denouncing the organization as a \\"destabilizing force\\" which had turned \\"its arms against the Lebanese people and challenged Lebanon's security forces for control of the streets.\\" In addition, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pronounced the continuing support by the US for the Lebanese government. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal accused Iran of \\"backing what happened in Lebanon, a coup\\" and called for \\"all regional parties to respect the independence and sovereignty of Lebanon and to stop meddling in its affairs and inciting sectarian tensions\\". He further accused Hezbollah of taking \\"violent, offensive measures, which aim at an annihilation of people.\\" A diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks two years later show, however, that Prince Saud al-Faisal had proposed to the US Ambassador in Saudi Arabia the creation of an \\"Arab force\\" to be supported by the US and NATO which was to restore order in Beirut in response to \\"Hezbollah's military challenge to the Government of Lebanon.\\" Furthermore, he feared that a Hezbollah victory would lead to the fall of the Siniora cabinet and the \\"Iranian takeover of Lebanon.\\" Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mohammad-Ali Hosseini has called on national unity among the Lebanese adding that the situation can be \\"managed through talks and consensus-building.\\" Hosseini blamed the U.S. and Israel for the ongoing hostilities in Lebanon.  Casualties  The exact total number of casualties as resulting from the fighting in May remains uncertain, but figures range from approximately 70 to 110 deaths. A UN report published in June 2008 reports 69 fatalities, among which civilians, and more than 180 wounded. A Human Rights Watch Report from 2009 states a minimum of 71 deaths. In an article from September 2008 entailing a series of interviews on the events, Beatriz Mart√≠nez and Francesco Volpicella note that the official number of casualties up to 15 May is 80 deaths and more than 200 wounded. However, based on the combining casualty numbers provided in news articles, this article suggests a number of 109 deaths in total.

It regulated the safe, responsible, and efficient development of Alberta's energy resources: oil, natural gas, oil sands, coal, and pipelines. Led by eight Board members, the ERCB's team of engineers, geologists, technicians, economists, and other professionals served Albertans from thirteen locations across the province. The ERCB's mission was to ensure that the discovery, development, and delivery of Alberta's energy resources took place in a manner that was fair, responsible and in the public interest. The ERCB adjudicated and regulated matters related to energy within Alberta to ensure that the development, transportation, and monitoring of the province's energy resources were in the public interest. The Board provided this assurance of the public interest through its activities in the application and hearing process, regulation, monitoring, and surveillance and enforcement. The information and knowledge responsibility of the Board included the collection, storage, analysis, appraisal, dissemination and stakeholder awareness of information. Open access to information developed awareness, understanding and responsible behavior and allowed the Board and stakeholders to make informed decisions about energy and utility matters. This responsibility would result in the Board discharging its advisory role with respect to matters under the jurisdiction of the Board. The Government of Alberta owns about 80% of the province's mineral rights, such as oil, natural gas, coal, and the oil sands. In other words, most resources are owned by the people of Alberta through their government. While private companies can develop these resources, the ERCB was authorized by the government to protect the public's interest relating to the discovery, development, and delivery of these resources. Regulation was needed so that non-renewable resources were produced in a safe, responsible, and efficient manner, without waste. The ERCB also ensured that everyone affected by development had a chance to be heard. When conflicts regarding development remained unresolved between companies and landowners, the ERCB worked to settle the issues in a fair and balanced manner. In 1996, the Alberta Geological Survey (AGS) joined the ERCB. AGS assisted the ERCB by providing data, information, knowledge and advice about the geology of Alberta. History Alberta's first energy regulatory body was created in 1938. A succession of agencies led to the new ERCB being established 1 January 2008, as a result of the realignment of the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) into the ERCB and the Alberta Utilities Commission. The ERCB also includes the Alberta Geological Survey. In October 2008, ERCB was named one of Alberta's Top Employers by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the Calgary Herald and the Edmonton Journal. =Alberta Energy Regulator= Alberta Energy Regulator is a corporation created by the Responsible Energy Development Act passed on 10 December 2012 and proclaimed on 17 June 2013, in the Alberta Legislature, operating at arm's length from the Government of Alberta, under an appointed board of directors headed by Chair, Gerry Protti and CEO Jim Ellis, appointed by Energy Minister Ken Hughes. On 17 June 2013, all regulatory functions previously carried out by the Energy Resources Conservation Board were taken over by the Alberta Energy Regulator.pay wall\\"Alberta‚Äôs energy regulator has a new name, new responsibilities and new leadership. After sitting on the news of a recent spill for 12 days, it apparently also needs new policies about transparency. The Alberta Energy Regulator, formerly the Energy Resources Conservation Board, has a tough act to follow when it comes to alerting the public about pipeline ruptures and other incidents that cause hydrocarbons to soak the landscape. Its federal counterpart, the National Energy Board, sent the message last week that the bar has been raised (Globe and Mail 17 June 2013).\\" Alberta Energy Regulator is \\"100 per cent funded by industry and is authorized to collect funds through an administrative fee levied on oil and gas wells, oil sands mines, and coal mines. The industry-funded model is commonly used by regulatory agencies from various sectors across North America.\\" AER has \\"an annual budget of more than $165 million, more than \\"1000 staff working in 13 locations across Alberta.\\" Alberta Energy Regulator \\"regulates approximately - 181,000 active wells, 27,800 oil facilities and 20,000 gas facilities, and 405,000 kilometres (km) of pipelines.\\" AER also \\"considers some 36 800 applications for energy development every year.\\" In December 2012, the Responsible Energy Development Act passed in the Alberta Legislature. Alberta Energy Regulator is mandated under the Act, to direct and oversee \\"the orderly transition from the Energy Resources Conservation Act to the Responsible Energy Development Act. Under this act, the newly formed Alberta Energy Regulator, will \\"bring together the regulatory functions from the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development into a one-stop shop.\\" The Alberta Energy Regulator is now \\"responsible for all projects from application to reclamation.\\" They will respond to project proponents, landowners and industry regarding energy regulations in Alberta. The Alberta Energy Regulator was phased in in June 2013. Responsible Energy Development Act gave the Alberta Energy Regulator \\"the authority to administer the Public Lands Act, the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act and the Water Act, with regards to energy development.\\" The Alberta Energy Regulator will enforce environmental laws and issue environmental and water permits, responsibilities formerly the mandate of Alberta Environment.Maximum fines under the Responsible Energy Development Act are limited to $500 000 or less for a corporation and $50,000 or less for an individual. Gerry Protti, appointed by Energy Minister Ken Hughes, on 18 June 2013, as chair of the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), that will regulate oil, gas and coal development in Alberta, was a former executive with Encana, the founding president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) and spent many years as lobbyist for the Energy Policy Institute of Canada. Jim Ellis, a former deputy minister in environment and energy, was appointed as CEO by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. In the past the Energy Resources Conservation Board and Alberta Environment conducted investigations differently. Alberta Surface Rights Group, the United Landowners of Alberta, First Nations, farmers and ranchers have expressed concerns about the streamlining of regulatory processes that may benefit oil and gas industries at their expense. According to their brochure the Alberta Energy Regulator \\"ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans.\\" Scope The ERCB regulated the safe, responsible, and efficient development of oil, natural gas, oil sands, and coal, and as well as the pipelines to move the resources to market. Regulation was done through two core functions: adjudication and regulation, and information and knowledge. ERCB approval must have been given at almost every step of an energy project's life. Governance To maintain its autonomous structure, the ERCB answered directly to the Executive Council (Cabinet) of Alberta through the Minister of Energy, but it made its formal decisions independently in accordance with the six statutes it administers. Organization structure The ERCB was led by a Board of eight people: a Chairman and Board Members. Supporting the Chairman and Board Members was the Executive Committee, and approximately 900 staff who worked in eight main branches: =Applications= This branch, made up of three groups, provided a streamlined approach to processing some 40 000 energy development applications each year. The Facilities Group handled project reviews, audits, and approvals related to new or modified oil and gas facilities, such as wells, pipelines, batteries, and gas plants. The Resource Group dealt with applications and issues related to development and conservation projects for oil, gas, and coal. The Business Operations and Development Group managed the coordination of administrative support, approvals development, planning, objections, and hearings. =Field surveillance and operations= This branch provided technical and operational expertise in the development, application, and enforcement of regulatory requirements for conventional and nonconventional resources. The branch ensured that oil and gas operations are conducted in a safe and responsible manner through incident response, resource conservation, protection of the environment, and industry liability management. Operating from Field Centres across Alberta, field staff inspected construction, operation, and abandonment operations at oil, gas, and oil sands facilities and respond to emergencies and public concerns on a 24-hour basis. =Corporate support= This branch incorporated several groups. Human Resources provides services and programs to ensure that a competent and committed workforce was in place to achieve ERCB goals and objectives. The Communications Group developed strategic communication, consultation strategies and delivers related media, Web site, and document services to keep staff and stakeholders informed about ERCB activities. Administrative Services provided building, library, and printing services. =Finance= This branch provided revenue and expenditure management and administration of the industry funding levy. In addition, staff coordinated the preparation of the ERCB's three-year business plan and performance reporting. =Information and systems services= This branch was responsible for ERCB information systems, support, and technological infrastructure, with a focus on new ways to deliver electronic commerce. Another core area was the collection and dissemination of energy resource information, including oil and gas production. This information was also used to determine provincial royalties, well records, regulatory publications, maps, and various energy databases. =Law= This branch provided a wide range of legal advice and services to the organization, with a focus on procedural fairness and objectivity. Its responsibilities included application and regulatory policy, hearings, proceedings, related internal and external consultations, and the formulation of energy regulations and legislation. The branch administered intervener funding and led a key advisory committee that advises the Board on decisions and policy matters. =Geology, environmental science, and economics= This branch maintained an integrated and current inventory of Alberta's subsurface energy, mineral, and other resources in a geological framework. It provided knowledge, advice, and forecasts about the states of earth-energy resource development in the context of Alberta's environment, economy, and society. The branch also developed and supported regulatory processes and best practices to conserve earth-energy resources, maintains environmental quality, assures public safety, and guides informed risk taking in regulatory and policy decisions. =Oil Sands= The Oil Sands Branch had overall responsibility for how the ERCB regulated oil sands activities in Alberta. The branch comprised the Mineable Oil Sands Group, which looked after oil sands developments that use mining recovery technology as well as bitumen upgrading, and the In Situ Oil Sands Group, which focused on developments using recovery technology involving subsurface or in situ recovery methods. Collaborating with other ERCB branches, the Oil Sands Branch took the lead on processing applications, conducting surveillance and enforcement of approved projects, and carrying out geological assessments as they apply to the oil sands. In their 2012 report ECRB cautioned that oil sands operators failed to convert their tailings ponds into deposits suitable for reclamation in a timely fashion, as proposed in their project applications. \\"The volume of fluid tailings, and the area required to hold fluid tailings, continued to grow, and the reclamation of tailings ponds was further delayed.\\" ECRB follows the industry wide directive, Directive 074, the first of its kind, which sets out the \\"industry-wide requirements for tailings management,\\" requiring \\"operators to commit resources to research, develop, and implement fluid tailings reduction technologies and to commit to tailings management and progressive reclamation as operational priorities that are integrated with mine planning and bitumen production activities.\\" The Government of Alberta is setting up a Tailings Management Framework to complement and expand Directive 074's policies to \\"ensure that fluid fine tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible and that current inventories are reduced.\\" On 12 June 2013 the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo after many days of heavy rain, declared a state of emergency. The flood conditions lasted from June 10‚Äì18, 2013. It was the first of many communities to do so in Alberta during the 2013 floods. Wood Buffalo authorities organised evacuations from some areas and placed others in boil water advisories as local waterways, such as the Hangingstone River, rose to dangerously high levels.Communities affected included In Northeast Alberta between June 10‚Äì18, 2013 sections of communities such as Anzac and Fort McMurray were also flooded Energy applications An application was a request by a company for ERCB approval‚Äîin the form of a licence, order, permit, or approval‚Äîfor an energy project. Most energy-related projects require ERCB approval. Each year tens of thousands of applications were reviewed and approved by the ERCB. The ERCB also played a vital environmental protection role by reviewing flaring permits, oilfield waste disposal facilities, drilling waste practices, and emergency response plans. ERCB approval for a facility or project was considered to be routine if an application was complete, there were no landowner objections, and the company applying had met all technical, safety, public consultation, and environmental requirements. The turnaround time for a complete and well- prepared routine application could be as short as one day. Some projects required input from other government departments. The ERCB passed such applications to Alberta Environment, which handles distribution to other departments. This \\"one-window\\" approach meant that applicants did not have to go to each government department for individual review and approval. The general rule was that each government department checks that a specific proposal meets its own regulations and standards and then forwards any deficiencies or concerns to the ERCB via Alberta Environment. Nonroutine applications took more time‚Äîweeks, or even months‚Äîto process if there were landowner objections, community and environmental concerns, or objections from competing companies. Objections to applications may also have been resolved through facilitation, mediation, or negotiated settlements approved by the Board. However, any unresolved matter or objection related to an application may have proceeded to an ERCB hearing.

A hearing allowed for an open, public testing of technical, environmental, social, and economic evidence from those involved. The process ensured that all relevant arguments for and against the energy facility project are heard. ERCB hearings were held when the ERCB received an objection from a person who may have been directly and adversely affected by a proposed project. Applications filed may have created community concern or a need for more information; however, these matters were often settled through an Appropriate Dispute Resolution (ADR) process. When matters were settled through ADR or there were no public concerns and objections, there was no need for a hearing. The Board would also dismiss objections if the person does not appear to be directly or adversely affected. The ERCB mailed a Notice of Hearing to inform people and organizations affected by an application about the hearing. The Notice of Hearing may have been published in daily and/or weekly newspapers. Hearing notices were available on the ERCB Web site. Companies involved in large projects usually held an open house to explain their proposed project, answer citizens' questions, and address the community's concerns. The Notice of Hearing provided interested parties with the following information: * date, time, and location of the hearing, * application number and nature of the application, * a contact for the company that filed the application, * ERCB information, * the due date for filing objections or interventions, and * a statement that all material relating to the proceeding is subject to Alberta's Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy legislation. An ERCB hearing followed a formal process to ensure that everyone had a say: * Opening Remarks: The panel chair explains the purpose of the hearing and introduces the members of the panel and all ERCB staff in the room. Then participants in the hearing register an appearance, coming forward and introducing themselves. * Preliminary Matters: Procedural and legal matters are presented, such as adjournment requests or the scheduling of a specific witness at a particular time. * Applicant (Application): The applicant presents its case and may question its own witnesses. Then interveners, ERCB staff, and the Board panel may cross-examine those witnesses. Once cross-examinations are complete, the applicant may question the witnesses again to clarify any issues that arose. * Interveners: Interveners next present their cases in the same order they registered. After the intervener gives direct evidence, the lawyer for the applicant may cross- examine, followed by the other interveners who wish to cross-examine. ERCB staff and panel members may then cross-examine the intervener. Following cross-examination, the intervener is entitled to clarify any matters that arose. * Rebuttal Evidence by Applicant: Once the above process is complete with all the interveners and their witnesses, the applicant may submit additional evidence to address new points raised by interveners' evidence. * Final Argument or Summation: Each participant may provide an explanation of what he or she believes are the important aspects of the issues involved and what decisions they feel the panel should make. The applicant may respond to interveners' arguments. * Closing of Hearing: The panel chair announces the hearing is completed and that the decision of the panel and the reasons for it will be given at a later date.

Young that was published in 2007. The novel was self-published but became a USA Today bestseller, having sold 1 million copies as of June 8, 2008.Aim at 'spiritually interested' sparks 'The Shack' sales USA Today, 2008-04-30 It was the No. 1 paperback trade fiction seller on The New York Times Best Seller list from June 2008 to early 2010, in a publishing partnership with Hachette Book Group USA's FaithWords imprint (Hodder & Stoughton in the UK). In 2009 it was awarded the \\"Diamond Award\\" for sales of over 10 million copies by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association.Gold / Platinum / Diamond Book Awards Winners, Christian Book Expo, read 2012-02-12 The title of the book is a metaphor for \\"the house you build out of your own pain\\", as Young explained in a telephone interview. He also told radio host talk show Drew Marshall that The Shack \\"is a metaphor for the places you get stuck, you get hurt, you get damaged ... the thing where shame or hurt is centered.\\"Relevant Magazine Plot The novel is set in the American Northwest. The main character is Mackenzie Allen Phillips, a father of five called \\"Mack\\" by his family and friends. Four years prior to the main events of the story, Mack takes three of his children on a camping trip to Wallowa Lake near Joseph, Oregon, stopping at Multnomah Falls on the way. Two of his children are playing in a canoe when it flips and almost drowns Mack's son. Mack is able to save his son by rushing to the water and freeing him from the canoe's webbing but unintentionally leaves his youngest daughter Missy alone at their campsite. After Mack returns, he sees that Missy is missing. The police are called, and the family discovers that Missy has been abducted and murdered by a serial killer known as the \\"Little Ladykiller\\". The police find an abandoned shack in the woods where Missy was taken. Her bloodied clothing is found, but her body is not located. Mack's life sinks into what he calls \\"The Great Sadness\\". As the novel begins, Mack receives a note in his mailbox from \\"Papa\\", saying that he would like to meet with Mack that coming weekend at the shack. Mack is puzzled by the note‚Äîhe has had no relationship with his abusive father since he left home at age 13. He suspects that the note may be from God whom his wife Nan refers to as \\"Papa\\". Mack's family leaves to visit relatives and he goes alone to the shack, unsure of what he will see there. He arrives and initially finds nothing, but as he is leaving, the shack and its surroundings are supernaturally transformed into a lush and inviting scene. He enters the shack and encounters manifestations of the three persons of the Trinity. God the Father takes the form of an African American woman who calls herself Elousia and Papa; Jesus is a Middle Eastern carpenter; and the Holy Spirit physically manifests as an Asian woman named Sarayu. The bulk of the book narrates Mack's conversations with Papa, Jesus, and Sarayu as he comes to terms with Missy's death and his relationship with the three of them. Mack also has various experiences with each of them. Mack walks across a lake with Jesus, sees an image of his (Earthly) father in Heaven with Sarayu, and has a conversation with Sophia, the personification of God's wisdom. At the end of his visit, Mack goes on a hike with Papa, now appearing as an older Native American male, who shows him where Missy's body was left in a cave. After spending the weekend at the shack, Mack leaves and is so preoccupied with his thoughts that he is nearly killed in an automobile accident. After his recovery, he realizes that he did not in fact spend the weekend at the shack, but that his accident occurred on the same day that he arrived at the shack. He also leads the police to the cave that Papa revealed, and they find Missy's body still lying there. With the help of forensic evidence discovered at the scene, the Little Ladykiller is arrested and put on trial. Publication Young originally wrote The Shack as a Christmas gift for his six children with no apparent intention of publishing it. After letting several friends read the book he was urged to publish it for the general public. In 2006, Young worked with Wayne Jacobsen, Brad Cummings (both former pastors from Los Angeles) and Bobby Downes (filmmaker) to bring the book to publication after a period of sixteen months and four rewrites. They had no success with either religious or secular publishers, so they formed Windblown Media for the purpose of publishing the book. The Shack achieved its No. 1 best selling success via word-of-mouth and with the help of a USD$300.00 website; it is often reported that nothing else had been spent on marketing up to September 2007. Additional startup funds were supplied by Brad Cummings, president of Windblown Media, who spent the maximum credit limit on 12 personal credit cards in order to publish the book.Advancing the Cause Reception The Shack went largely unnoticed for over a year after its initial publication, but suddenly became a very popular seller in mid-2008, when it debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times paperback fiction best seller list on June 8. Its success was the result of a \\"word-of- mouth, church-to-church, blog-to-blog campaign\\" by Young, Jacobsen and Cummings in churches and Christian-themed radio, websites, and blogs. The Shack had over 10 million copies in print, and had been at No. 1 on The New York Times best seller list for 70 weeks.Windblown Media Official Website The Shack was also released in hardcover, and translated into Spanish as . In June 2009 a German translation with the title (The Hut ‚Äì a Weekend with God) was released. on the German Wikipedia It was also translated into Croatian as and became very popular in Croatia and also in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The book was also translated into Polish as and published in 2009. There were re- editions in 2011 and 2017 due to its popularity. However, former Mars Hill Church pastor Mark Driscoll criticized The Shack, saying that \\"it misrepresents God\\" and called William P. Young \\"a heretic\\". Evangelical author Chuck Colson wrote a review, called \\"Stay Out of The Shack\\", in which he criticizes the attribution of \\"silly lines\\" to characters representing the three Persons of the Trinity, and the author's \\"low view of scripture\\". R. Albert Mohler, Jr. called The Shack \\"deeply troubling\\" on his radio show, saying that it \\"includes undiluted heresy\\".The Albert Mohler Radio Program, \\"A Look at The Shack\\", April 11, 2008 Apologists author Norman Geisler and William C. Roach published a critique in 2012 detailing their 14 points of theological disagreement with the book (including \\"unorthodox\\", \\"false\\", \\"classic heresy\\", \\"non-rational\\", \\"psychologically helpful ... doctrinally harmful\\", and \\"very dangerous\\"). Pastor Sean Cole of the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Sterling, Colorado, offered yet another critique appearing in Pulpit and Pen. He provides six major arguments against the content of the book and Young's portrayal of the Trinity, and offers them as major problems. Theologian Randal Rauser has written a generally sympathetic guide to The Shack in his companion volume Finding God in the Shack (Paternoster, 2009). In the book Rauser responds to many of the objections raised by critics such as Colson and Mohler. Brad Robison, a psychiatrist and family therapist who used The Shack in his practice, wrote The Shack Study Guide (Windblown Media, 2016) to assist his patients on their healing journey. It is co-authored by William P. Young. Wayne Jacobsen, one of Young's early collaborators, wrote a detailed response to several common points of criticism. His column \\"Is The Shack Heresy?\\" was published online by Windblown Media. Legal dispute In July 2010, the Los Angeles Times reported that The Shack had \\"spawned a tangle of lawsuits over royalties and even the book's authorship\\". Young said that he was owed $8 million in royalties, Jacobsen and Cummings filed a suit against Young, Young asked the court to dismiss or stay the claims, and Jacobsen and Cummings responded. Hachette, the commercial publisher involved, asked the court to determine to whom it should pay royalties from the book. On January 10, 2011, the court declared that it had been advised that the case between Young et al. and Jacobsen et al. \\"has been settled or is in the process of being settled\\" and the case was dismissed. Film adaptation A film adaptation of The Shack, directed by Stuart Hazeldine and starring Sam Worthington, Octavia Spencer, and Tim McGraw, was released on March 3, 2017, to negative critical reviews. Audience response was, however, more positive. References in other works The Shack was referred to by Stephen King in his 2010 title, Full Dark, No Stars, which is a compilation of four novellas. In the final novella, A Good Marriage, the protagonist recalls that her husband recommended she read The Shack and he said the novel was \\"a life-changer\\". It is also cited in the introduction to Richard Rohr and Mike Morrell's The Divine Dance for encouraging people thinking about the Trinity again. References  External links  Interview with William P.

The Russian traveller Afanasy Nikitin/Athanasius Nikitin, who visited India (1468-1474) found Dabhol as a large town and extensive seaport. The horses from Mysore, Arabia, Khorasan and Nighostan were brought here for trade. This was the place which had links with all major ports from India to Ethiopia. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Dabul was an opulent Muslim trade centre, first under the Bahmani, later under the Badar sultans of Bijapur. As the port with most convenient access to the Bahmani sultanate's capital at Bidar, Dabul's fortunes ascended quickly with that dynasty. At its height, it was arguably the most important port between Chaul and Goa.For a brief discussion of the decline of the port of Dabul, see Dames (1918: p.164) and Nairne (1873). It was exactly the prominence of Dabul as a Muslim trade centre and port that led it to be bombarded, sacked and razed by a Portuguese expeditionary force (Battle of Dabul) under Francisco de Almeida in December, 1508, in a prelude to the famous Battle of Diu. Although the city's fort was not taken, it was only the first of several times, in the course of the next few decades, that the Portuguese tried to destroy Dabul. By the time of the last recorded attack, in 1571, the Governor of Dabhul was Khwaja Ali Shirazi. The battle led to killing 150 men at Dabhol. The break-up of the Bahmani state into several smaller Deccan sultanates had accelerated Dabul's decline. As new capitals for these statelets were erected, Dabul's geographic position was no longer as fortuitous as it had been before, and alternative, more convenient ports were cultivated. In the course of the 16th century, a lot of commerce was redirected away from Dabul and towards the rising new port of Rajapur further south. The Dabhol port boasts of centuries old history. Dabhol was of great importance in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries. It used to be the principal port of South Konkan region, carrying on trade with ports in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. During 13th to 15th centuries this port was ruled by the Bahamani dynasty and was known as Mustafabad. Later on it was Hamjabad and then it was Dabhol. Dabul was conquered by Shivaji around 1660 and annexed to the new Maratha kingdom. The erection of the Anjanvel Fort Maratha fort of Anjnavel right across the river eclipsed whatever role remained for Dabul, and the once-great port city simply evaporated and disappeared from the maps. Attempts to locate the historic port have sometimes led historians to mistakenly identify historic Dabul with modern Dapoli, an interior town several miles north of Dabhol. Sadly, Dabhol's name was revived in the 1990s in association with the infamous Dabhol Power Station erected near the site by the Enron company. The ferry boat at Dabhol that can carry vehicles to the other side of the creek. Locals call it as Jungle Jetty.

After receiving early training as a pilot from Orville Wright he served Brigadier General John J. Pershing's army against Pancho Villa, became decorated for bravery in World War I and commanded the 27th Infantry Division in combat in the Pacific War in World War II. At his death Smith was the oldest surviving general officer of the Army.Pace, E. (1998) \\" Gen. Ralph C. Smith, Honored For War Bravery, Dies at 104\\", The New York Times. January 26, 1998. Retrieved 5/9/08. Early life Born in Nebraska, Smith attended Colorado State College and served in the Colorado National Guard. He was an early aviator and was given flying lessons, as a young officer, by Orville Wright, and his pilot's license, signed by Wright, bore the number 13 because he was the 13th person to receive one. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch of the United States Army in 1916 and was involved in the Army's unsuccessful Mexican Punitive Expedition, whose Commanding General (CG) was Brigadier General John Pershing, against Pancho Villa, just before the American entry into World War I in early April 1917. During World War I Smith was awarded the Silver Star with an Oak-Leaf Cluster for two instances of bravery while serving with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front. He was sent overseas with the 16th Infantry Regiment, part of the 1st Division towards the end of 1917, later being transferred to the 4th Infantry Division. He was wounded in action in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in the latter half of 1918 and served in occupation duties in Germany after the war. Between the world wars his duties including teaching at the United States Military Academy and attending, and then instructing, at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. World War II Smith was a temporary colonel when the United States entered World War II in December 1941. In 1942, promoted to brigadier general, he served as an assistant division commander of the 76th Infantry Division, later becoming a major general and taking command of the 27th Infantry Division, the unit charged with the defense of the outer Hawaiian Islands. In November 1943, the 27th Infantry Division was incorporated with the 2nd Marine Division to form the V Amphibious Corps for the purpose of invading and securing the Gilbert Islands in the Central Pacific. While the Marines took the major objective, Tarawa Atoll (Operation Galvanic), the Army was tasked with capturing Makin Atoll (Operation Kourbash) approx. 120 statute miles to the north.Morison, S.E., Aleutians, Gilberts and Marshalls: June 1942 - April 1944, Vol. 7 of History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Boston: Little, Brown and Company (1951), LoC Card No. xx-xxxx, p. 89 The corps commander, Marine Corps Lieutenant General Holland M. \\"Howlin' Mad\\" Smith, expected the Army's 6,500 men to be able to overwhelm the 800 Japanese defenders in a day. Furious upon being informed of a lack of progress, Holland Smith went to Makin to assess the situation: \\"When he arrived at Ralph Smith's HQ he was told that there was heavy fighting in progress in the north of the island. Commandeering a jeep, he drove to the scene of the 'battle' and found it, in his words, 'As quiet as Wall Street on a Sunday.' ... This incident was the catalyst for a serious breakdown in relations between the Marines and the army that continued until well after the war.\\" Four full days were required to conquer Makin.Wright, D., Tarawa 1943: The Turning of the Tide, Oxford: Osprey Publishing (2004), , p. 77 In July 1944, the V Amphibious Corps, now including an additional Marine division, was assigned to the invasion of the Mariana Islands. In this action (Operation Forager), Ralph Smith's division fought alongside the Marines in the hard struggle for the mountainous island of Saipan. During the fight for Mt. Tapotchau in the center of the island, a vast difference in training and tactics between the Marines and the Army led to the 106th Infantry Regiment failing to reduce the area known as \\"Hell's Pocket\\", thus falling far behind the advance line of Marines. The corps commander, already ill-disposed toward the 27th Infantry Division because of its perceived lack of aggressiveness on Makin, relieved Ralph Smith of command and ordered him off the island.Rottman, G., Saipan & Tinian 1944: Piercing the Japanese Empire, Oxford: Osprey Publishing (2004), , p. 64 He contended that Ralph Smith's men had \\"failed to attack on time,\\" unnecessarily costing Marine lives in the conquest of the island.\\"The Generals Smith\\", TIME Magazine. September 18, 1944. Retrieved 5/9/08. Five times in the Pacific Theater of Operations were Army generals relieved of command, but it was unprecedented for the order to be given by a Marine Corps general, and the incident caused a considerable rift between the two branches.Morison, S.E., New Guinea and the Marianas: March 1944 - August 1944, Vol. 8 of History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Boston: Little, Brown and Company (1953), LoC Card No. 53-7298, p. 332 The Buckner Board, an all-Army panel that investigated the incident, concluded that, while Holland Smith had the authority to fire Ralph Smith, he had not acquainted himself with the particular difficulties faced by the Army troops in the fight for Mt. Tapotchau and that the firing was \\"not justified by the facts.\\" Rottman, p. 69 Ralph Smith was given command of the 98th Infantry Division charged with the defense of the Hawaiian Islands, but the negative publicity associated with his firing on Saipan made it impractical for him to remain in the Pacific Theater. He was thus transferred to Camp J.T. Robinson, Arkansas, where he supervised the Infantry Replacement Training Center.Rottman, p. 29 Smith went on to serve as the military attach√© at the United States Embassy in Paris and CARE's chief of mission for France. While he worked for CARE he also oversaw operations in other western European countries. Smith was decorated with the Legion of Merit for his service in World War II. Smith retired from the Army in 1948. After retirement General Smith was a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace. He died in 1998 of a lung ailment.

G. Wodehouse. A part of the Mr. Mulliner series, the story was first published in the UK in 1926 in The Strand Magazine, and appeared almost simultaneously in Liberty in the United States. It also appears in the collection Meet Mr. Mulliner.McIlvaine (1990), p. 53‚Äì54, A38. The main character in this story, Wilfred Mulliner, plays off-stage parts in \\"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo\\". Plot Wilfred Mulliner, the inventor of Mulliner's Magic Marvels, a set or creams and lotions that help \\"alleviate the many ills to which the flesh is heir\\", falls in love with Angela Purdue and recommends Mulliner's Raven Gypsy Face- Cream to help her keep her sunburn on. Angela fears that her guardian, Sir Jasper ffinch-ffarrowmere, will not approve of the marriage and her fears seem to be realized when the guardian arrives at Wilfred's home with a message from Angela calling the engagement off. Wilfred suspects the work of the dastardly baronet and being a man of action sets forth for Yorkshire where the baronet lives at ffinch Hall and, while wandering around the grounds at night, he hears a woman sobbing. Within a week, Wilfred enters the house as a valet (he bribes Sir Jasper's valet and replaces him as his cousin) disguised in a red wig and blue spectacles. Soon after entering the house he follows Sir Jasper carry a tray of food to a room at the top of the house. Convinced that Angela is being held in the room against her will, he resolves to rescue her but is unable to find a key in the baronet's room and has no idea how to get hold of it. Over the next few days, he worries, loses weight, and Sir Jasper, who has a weight problem of his own (he can't lose it) decides to get an indoor Turkish cabinet bath inside which he gets stuck. \\"First, I must have the key.\\" Wilfred demands the key to Angela's room as the price for releasing the baronet. \\"Give me the key, you Fiend,\\" he cries. \\"ffiend,\\" corrects Sir Jasper, automatically. To Wilfred's surprise, it turns out that the key is not with the baronet but with Angela. She refuses to let him in because his suntan cream has turned her piebald. To cut a long story short, Mulliner's Snow of the Mountains Lotion fixes the piebald-ness, Mulliner's Reduc-O takes care of Sir Jasper's weight problem, Mulliner's Ease-o relieves the butler's lumbago, and everyone lives happily ever after.

Elements used in one-dimensional models of viscoplastic materials. Viscoplasticity is a theory in continuum mechanics that describes the rate- dependent inelastic behavior of solids. Rate-dependence in this context means that the deformation of the material depends on the rate at which loads are applied. The inelastic behavior that is the subject of viscoplasticity is plastic deformation which means that the material undergoes unrecoverable deformations when a load level is reached. Rate-dependent plasticity is important for transient plasticity calculations. The main difference between rate-independent plastic and viscoplastic material models is that the latter exhibit not only permanent deformations after the application of loads but continue to undergo a creep flow as a function of time under the influence of the applied load. The elastic response of viscoplastic materials can be represented in one-dimension by Hookean spring elements. Rate-dependence can be represented by nonlinear dashpot elements in a manner similar to viscoelasticity. Plasticity can be accounted for by adding sliding frictional elements as shown in Figure 1.J. Lemaitre and J. L. Chaboche (2002) \\"Mechanics of solid materials\\" Cambridge University Press. In the figure E is the modulus of elasticity, Œª is the viscosity parameter and N is a power-law type parameter that represents non-linear dashpot [œÉ(dŒµ/dt)= œÉ = Œª(dŒµ/dt)(1/N)]. The sliding element can have a yield stress (œÉy) that is strain rate dependent, or even constant, as shown in Figure 1c. Viscoplasticity is usually modeled in three-dimensions using overstress models of the Perzyna or Duvaut- Lions types. In these models, the stress is allowed to increase beyond the rate-independent yield surface upon application of a load and then allowed to relax back to the yield surface over time. The yield surface is usually assumed not to be rate-dependent in such models. An alternative approach is to add a strain rate dependence to the yield stress and use the techniques of rate independent plasticity to calculate the response of a material For metals and alloys, viscoplasticity is the macroscopic behavior caused by a mechanism linked to the movement of dislocations in grains, with superposed effects of inter-crystalline gliding. The mechanism usually becomes dominant at temperatures greater than approximately one third of the absolute melting temperature. However, certain alloys exhibit viscoplasticity at room temperature (300K). For polymers, wood, and bitumen, the theory of viscoplasticity is required to describe behavior beyond the limit of elasticity or viscoelasticity. In general, viscoplasticity theories are useful in areas such as * the calculation of permanent deformations, * the prediction of the plastic collapse of structures, * the investigation of stability, * crash simulations, * systems exposed to high temperatures such as turbines in engines, e.g. a power plant, * dynamic problems and systems exposed to high strain rates. History Research on plasticity theories started in 1864 with the work of Henri Tresca, Saint Venant (1870) and Levy (1871) on the maximum shear criterion.Kojic, M. and Bathe, K-J., (2006), Inelastic Analysis of Solids and Structures, Elsevier. An improved plasticity model was presented in 1913 by Von Misesvon Mises, R. (1913) \\"Mechanik der festen Korper im plastisch deformablen Zustand.\\" Gottinger Nachr, math-phys Kl 1913:582‚Äì592. which is now referred to as the von Mises yield criterion. In viscoplasticity, the development of a mathematical model heads back to 1910 with the representation of primary creep by Andrade's law.Betten, J., 2005, Creep Mechanics: 2nd Ed., Springer. In 1929, NortonNorton, F. H. (1929). Creep of steel at high temperatures. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York. developed a one-dimensional dashpot model which linked the rate of secondary creep to the stress. In 1934, OdqvistOdqvist, F. K. G. (1934) \\"Creep stresses in a rotating disc.\\" Proc. IV Int. Congress for Applied. Mechanics, Cambridge, p. 228. generalized Norton's law to the multi-axial case. Concepts such as the normality of plastic flow to the yield surface and flow rules for plasticity were introduced by Prandtl (1924)Prandtl, L. (1924) Proceedings of the 1st International Congress on Applied Mechanics, Delft. and Reuss (1930). In 1932, Hohenemser and Prager proposed the first model for slow viscoplastic flow. This model provided a relation between the deviatoric stress and the strain rate for an incompressible Bingham solidBingham, E. C. (1922) Fluidity and plasticity. McGraw-Hill, New York. However, the application of these theories did not begin before 1950, where limit theorems were discovered. In 1960, the first IUTAM Symposium ‚ÄúCreep in Structures‚Äù organized by HoffHoff, ed., 1962, IUTAM Colloquium Creep in Structures; 1st, Stanford, Springer. provided a major development in viscoplasticity with the works of Hoff, Rabotnov, Perzyna, Hult, and Lemaitre for the isotropic hardening laws, and those of Kratochvil, Malinini and Khadjinsky, Ponter and Leckie, and Chaboche for the kinematic hardening laws. Perzyna, in 1963, introduced a viscosity coefficient that is temperature and time dependent.Lubliner, J. (1990) Plasticity Theory, Macmillan Publishing Company, NY. The formulated models were supported by the thermodynamics of irreversible processes and the phenomenological standpoint. The ideas presented in these works have been the basis for most subsequent research into rate-dependent plasticity.  Phenomenology  For a qualitative analysis, several characteristic tests are performed to describe the phenomenology of viscoplastic materials. Some examples of these tests are #hardening tests at constant stress or strain rate, #creep tests at constant force, and #stress relaxation at constant elongation. =Strain hardening test= Figure 2. Stress‚Äìstrain response of a viscoplastic material at different strain rates. The dotted lines show the response if the strain-rate is held constant. The blue line shows the response when the strain rate is changed suddenly. One consequence of yielding is that as plastic deformation proceeds, an increase in stress is required to produce additional strain. This phenomenon is known as Strain/Work hardening.Young, Mindness, Gray, ad Bentur (1998): \\"The Science and Technology of Civil Engineering Materials,\\" Prentice Hall, NJ. For a viscoplastic material the hardening curves are not significantly different from those of rate-independent plastic material. Nevertheless, three essential differences can be observed. # At the same strain, the higher the rate of strain the higher the stress # A change in the rate of strain during the test results in an immediate change in the stress‚Äìstrain curve. # The concept of a plastic yield limit is no longer strictly applicable. The hypothesis of partitioning the strains by decoupling the elastic and plastic parts is still applicable where the strains are small, i.e., : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} is the elastic strain and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} is the viscoplastic strain. To obtain the stress‚Äìstrain behavior shown in blue in the figure, the material is initially loaded at a strain rate of 0.1/s. The strain rate is then instantaneously raised to 100/s and held constant at that value for some time. At the end of that time period the strain rate is dropped instantaneously back to 0.1/s and the cycle is continued for increasing values of strain. There is clearly a lag between the strain-rate change and the stress response. This lag is modeled quite accurately by overstress models (such as the Perzyna model) but not by models of rate-independent plasticity that have a rate-dependent yield stress. =Creep test= { align=\\"right\\" Figure 3a. Creep test Figure 3b. Strain as a function of time in a creep test. } Creep is the tendency of a solid material to slowly move or deform permanently under constant stresses. Creep tests measure the strain response due to a constant stress as shown in Figure 3. The classical creep curve represents the evolution of strain as a function of time in a material subjected to uniaxial stress at a constant temperature. The creep test, for instance, is performed by applying a constant force/stress and analyzing the strain response of the system. In general, as shown in Figure 3b this curve usually shows three phases or periods of behavior # A primary creep stage, also known as transient creep, is the starting stage during which hardening of the material leads to a decrease in the rate of flow which is initially very high. (0 \\\\le \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\le \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_1 ). # The secondary creep stage, also known as the steady state, is where the strain rate is constant. (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_1 \\\\le \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\le \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_2). # A tertiary creep phase in which there is an increase in the strain rate up to the fracture strain. (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_2 \\\\le \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\le \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_R). =Relaxation test= Figure 4. a) Applied strain in a relaxation test and b) induced stress as functions of time over a short period for a viscoplastic material. As shown in Figure 4, the relaxation testFran√ßois, D., Pineau, A., Zaoui, A., (1993), Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Volume II: Viscoplasticity, Damage, Fracture and Contact Mechanics, Kluwer Academic Publishers. is defined as the stress response due to a constant strain for a period of time. In viscoplastic materials, relaxation tests demonstrate the stress relaxation in uniaxial loading at a constant strain. In fact, these tests characterize the viscosity and can be used to determine the relation which exists between the stress and the rate of viscoplastic strain. The decomposition of strain rate is : \\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{e}}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} ~. The elastic part of the strain rate is given by : \\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{e}}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} For the flat region of the strain-time curve, the total strain rate is zero. Hence we have, : \\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} Therefore, the relaxation curve can be used to determine rate of viscoplastic strain and hence the viscosity of the dashpot in a one-dimensional viscoplastic material model. The residual value that is reached when the stress has plateaued at the end of a relaxation test corresponds to the upper limit of elasticity. For some materials such as rock salt such an upper limit of elasticity occurs at a very small value of stress and relaxation tests can be continued for more than a year without any observable plateau in the stress. It is important to note that relaxation tests are extremely difficult to perform because maintaining the condition \\\\cfrac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = 0 in a test requires considerable delicacy.Cristescu, N. and Gioda, G., (1994), Viscoplastic Behaviour of Geomaterials, International Centre for Mechanical Sciences.  Rheological models of viscoplasticity  One-dimensional constitutive models for viscoplasticity based on spring-dashpot-slider elements include the perfectly viscoplastic solid, the elastic perfectly viscoplastic solid, and the elastoviscoplastic hardening solid. The elements may be connected in series or in parallel. In models where the elements are connected in series the strain is additive while the stress is equal in each element. In parallel connections, the stress is additive while the strain is equal in each element. Many of these one-dimensional models can be generalized to three dimensions for the small strain regime. In the subsequent discussion, time rates strain and stress are written as \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}} and \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}, respectively. =Perfectly viscoplastic solid (Norton-Hoff model) = Figure 5. Norton-Hoff model for perfectly viscoplastic solid In a perfectly viscoplastic solid, also called the Norton-Hoff model of viscoplasticity, the stress (as for viscous fluids) is a function of the rate of permanent strain. The effect of elasticity is neglected in the model, i.e., \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_e = 0 and hence there is no initial yield stress, i.e., \\\\sigma_y = 0. The viscous dashpot has a response given by : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\eta~\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} \\\\implies \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\eta} where \\\\eta is the viscosity of the dashpot. In the Norton-Hoff model the viscosity \\\\eta is a nonlinear function of the applied stress and is given by : \\\\eta = \\\\lambda\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}\\\\right]^{N-1} where N is a fitting parameter, Œª is the kinematic viscosity of the material and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}:\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sigma_{ij}\\\\sigma_{ij}}. Then the viscoplastic strain rate is given by the relation : \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\lambda}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right]^{N-1} In one-dimensional form, the Norton-Hoff model can be expressed as : \\\\sigma = \\\\lambda~\\\\left(\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}}\\\\right)^{1/N} When N = 1.0 the solid is viscoelastic. If we assume that plastic flow is isochoric (volume preserving), then the above relation can be expressed in the more familiar formRappaz, M., Bellet, M. and Deville, M., (1998), Numerical Modeling in Materials Science and Engineering, Springer. : \\\\boldsymbol{s} = 2 K~\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{eq}}\\\\right)^{m-1}~\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} where \\\\boldsymbol{s} is the deviatoric stress tensor, \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{eq}} is the von Mises equivalent strain rate, and K, m are material parameters. The equivalent strain rate is defined as :\\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\epsilon}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\bar{\\\\epsilon}}}:\\\\dot{\\\\bar{\\\\bar{\\\\epsilon}}} } These models can be applied in metals and alloys at temperatures higher than two thirds of their absolute melting point (in kelvins) and polymers/asphalt at elevated temperature. The responses for strain hardening, creep, and relaxation tests of such material are shown in Figure 6. {  Figure 6: The response of perfectly viscoplastic solid to hardening, creep and relaxation tests. } =Elastic perfectly viscoplastic solid (Bingham‚ÄìNorton model) = Figure 7. The elastic perfectly viscoplastic material. Two types of elementary approaches can be used to build up an elastic-perfectly viscoplastic mode. In the first situation, the sliding friction element and the dashpot are arranged in parallel and then connected in series to the elastic spring as shown in Figure 7. This model is called the Bingham‚ÄìMaxwell model (by analogy with the Maxwell model and the Bingham model) or the Bingham‚ÄìNorton model.Irgens, F., (2008), Continuum Mechanics, Springer. In the second situation, all three elements are arranged in parallel. Such a model is called a Bingham‚ÄìKelvin model by analogy with the Kelvin model. For elastic-perfectly viscoplastic materials, the elastic strain is no longer considered negligible but the rate of plastic strain is only a function of the initial yield stress and there is no influence of hardening. The sliding element represents a constant yielding stress when the elastic limit is exceeded irrespective of the strain. The model can be expressed as : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\mathsf{E}~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} & & \\\\mathrm{for}~\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\ < \\\\sigma_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}} = \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} + \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\eta}\\\\left[1 - \\\\cfrac{\\\\sigma_y}{\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\}\\\\right] & & \\\\mathrm{for}~\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\ \\\\ge \\\\sigma_y \\\\end{align} where \\\\eta is the viscosity of the dashpot element. If the dashpot element has a response that is of the Norton form : \\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\eta} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\lambda}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right]^{N-1} we get the Bingham‚ÄìNorton model : \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}} = \\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\lambda}\\\\left[\\\\cfrac{\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right]^{N-1}\\\\left[1 - \\\\cfrac{\\\\sigma_y}{\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\}\\\\right] \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{for}~\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\ \\\\ge \\\\sigma_y Other expressions for the strain rate can also be observed in the literature with the general form : \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}} = \\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} + f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\sigma_y)~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{for}~\\\\\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\ \\\\ge \\\\sigma_y The responses for strain hardening, creep, and relaxation tests of such material are shown in Figure 8. {  Figure 8. The response of elastic perfectly viscoplastic solid to hardening, creep and relaxation tests. } =Elastoviscoplastic hardening solid= An elastic-viscoplastic material with strain hardening is described by equations similar to those for an elastic-viscoplastic material with perfect plasticity. However, in this case the stress depends both on the plastic strain rate and on the plastic strain itself. For an elastoviscoplastic material the stress, after exceeding the yield stress, continues to increase beyond the initial yielding point. This implies that the yield stress in the sliding element increases with strain and the model may be expressed in generic terms as : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} =\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} = \\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = ~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} & & \\\\mathrm{for}~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} < \\\\sigma_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}} = \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{e}} + \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\mathsf{E}^{-1}~\\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} + f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma},\\\\sigma_y,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}})~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} & & \\\\mathrm{for}~\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} \\\\ge \\\\sigma_y \\\\end{align} . This model is adopted when metals and alloys are at medium and higher temperatures and wood under high loads. The responses for strain hardening, creep, and relaxation tests of such a material are shown in Figure 9. {  Figure 9. The response of elastoviscoplastic hardening solid to hardening, creep and relaxation tests. }  Strain-rate dependent plasticity models  Classical phenomenological viscoplasticity models for small strains are usually categorized into two types: * the Perzyna formulation * the Duvaut‚ÄìLions formulation = Perzyna formulation = In the Perzyna formulation the plastic strain rate is assumed to be given by a constitutive relation of the form : \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\left\\\\langle f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\boldsymbol{q})\\\\right\\\\rangle}{\\\\tau} \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\cfrac{f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\boldsymbol{q})}{\\\\tau} \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}& {\\\\rm if}~f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\boldsymbol{q}) > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\rm{otherwise} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} where f(.,.) is a yield function, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} is the Cauchy stress, \\\\boldsymbol{q} is a set of internal variables (such as the plastic strain \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}}), \\\\tau is a relaxation time. The notation \\\\langle \\\\dots \\\\rangle denotes the Macaulay brackets. The flow rule used in various versions of the Chaboche model is a special case of Perzyna's flow rule and has the form : \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{f}{f_0} \\\\right\\\\rangle^n (\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\chi}) where f_0 is the quasistatic value of f and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\chi} is a backstress. Several models for the backstress also go by the name Chaboche model. = Duvaut‚ÄìLions formulation = The Duvaut‚ÄìLions formulation is equivalent to the Perzyna formulation and may be expressed as : \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}_{\\\\mathrm{vp}} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathsf{C}^{-1}:\\\\cfrac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} - \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}}{\\\\tau} & \\\\rm{if}~f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\boldsymbol{q}) > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\rm{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} where \\\\mathsf{C} is the elastic stiffness tensor, \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} is the closest point projection of the stress state on to the boundary of the region that bounds all possible elastic stress states. The quantity \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} is typically found from the rate-independent solution to a plasticity problem. = Flow stress models = The quantity f(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}, \\\\boldsymbol{q}) represents the evolution of the yield surface. The yield function f is often expressed as an equation consisting of some invariant of stress and a model for the yield stress (or plastic flow stress). An example is von Mises or J_2 plasticity. In those situations the plastic strain rate is calculated in the same manner as in rate-independent plasticity. In other situations, the yield stress model provides a direct means of computing the plastic strain rate. Numerous empirical and semi- empirical flow stress models are used the computational plasticity. The following temperature and strain-rate dependent models provide a sampling of the models in current use: #the Johnson‚ÄìCook model #the Steinberg‚ÄìCochran‚ÄìGuinan‚ÄìLund model. #the Zerilli‚ÄìArmstrong model. #the Mechanical threshold stress model. #the Preston‚ÄìTonks‚ÄìWallace model. The Johnson‚ÄìCook (JC) model is purely empirical and is the most widely used of the five. However, this model exhibits an unrealistically small strain-rate dependence at high temperatures. The Steinberg‚ÄìCochran‚ÄìGuinan‚ÄìLund (SCGL) model is semi-empirical. The model is purely empirical and strain-rate independent at high strain-rates. A dislocation-based extension based on is used at low strain-rates. The SCGL model is used extensively by the shock physics community. The Zerilli‚ÄìArmstrong (ZA) model is a simple physically based model that has been used extensively. A more complex model that is based on ideas from dislocation dynamics is the Mechanical Threshold Stress (MTS) model. This model has been used to model the plastic deformation of copper, tantalum, alloys of steel, and aluminum alloys. However, the MTS model is limited to strain-rates less than around 107/s. The Preston‚ÄìTonks‚ÄìWallace (PTW) model is also physically based and has a form similar to the MTS model. However, the PTW model has components that can model plastic deformation in the overdriven shock regime (strain-rates greater that 107/s). Hence this model is valid for the largest range of strain-rates among the five flow stress models. Johnson‚ÄìCook flow stress model The Johnson‚ÄìCook (JC) model is purely empirical and gives the following relation for the flow stress (\\\\sigma_y) :\\\\text{(1)} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma_y(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}},\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}},T) = \\\\left[A + B (\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}})^n\\\\right]\\\\left[1 + C \\\\ln(\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}^{*})\\\\right] \\\\left[1 - (T^*)^m\\\\right] where \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}} is the equivalent plastic strain, \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}} is the plastic strain-rate, and A, B, C, n, m are material constants. The normalized strain-rate and temperature in equation (1) are defined as : \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}^{*} := \\\\cfrac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p0}}}} \\\\qquad\\\\text{and}\\\\qquad T^* := \\\\cfrac{(T-T_0)}{(T_m-T_0)} where \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p0}}} is the effective plastic strain-rate of the quasi- static test used to determine the yield and hardening parameters A,B and n. This is not as it is often thought just a parameter to make \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}^{*} non-dimensional.Schwer http://www.dynalook.com/european-conf-2007/optional-strain-rate-forms-for-the- johnson-cook.pdf T_0 is a reference temperature, and T_m is a reference melt temperature. For conditions where T^* < 0, we assume that m = 1. Steinberg‚ÄìCochran‚ÄìGuinan‚ÄìLund flow stress model The Steinberg‚ÄìCochran‚ÄìGuinan‚ÄìLund (SCGL) model is a semi-empirical model that was developed by Steinberg et al. for high strain-rate situations and extended to low strain-rates and bcc materials by Steinberg and Lund. The flow stress in this model is given by :\\\\text{(2)} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma_y(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}},\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}},T) = \\\\left[\\\\sigma_a f(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}) + \\\\sigma_t (\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}, T)\\\\right] \\\\frac{\\\\mu(p,T)}{\\\\mu_0}; \\\\quad \\\\sigma_a f \\\\le \\\\sigma_{\\\\text{max}} ~~\\\\text{and}~~ \\\\sigma_t \\\\le \\\\sigma_p where \\\\sigma_a is the athermal component of the flow stress, f(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}) is a function that represents strain hardening, \\\\sigma_t is the thermally activated component of the flow stress, \\\\mu(p,T) is the pressure- and temperature-dependent shear modulus, and \\\\mu_0 is the shear modulus at standard temperature and pressure. The saturation value of the athermal stress is \\\\sigma_{\\\\text{max}}. The saturation of the thermally activated stress is the Peierls stress (\\\\sigma_p). The shear modulus for this model is usually computed with the Steinberg‚ÄìCochran‚ÄìGuinan shear modulus model. The strain hardening function (f) has the form : f(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}) = [1 + \\\\beta(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}} + \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}i)]^n where \\\\beta, n are work hardening parameters, and \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}i is the initial equivalent plastic strain. The thermal component (\\\\sigma_t) is computed using a bisection algorithm from the following equation. : \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}} = \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{C_1}\\\\exp\\\\left[\\\\frac{2U_k}{k_b~T} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_t}{\\\\sigma_p}\\\\right)^2\\\\right] + \\\\frac{C_2}{\\\\sigma_t}\\\\right]^{-1}; \\\\quad \\\\sigma_t \\\\le \\\\sigma_p where 2 U_k is the energy to form a kink-pair in a dislocation segment of length L_d, k_b is the Boltzmann constant, \\\\sigma_p is the Peierls stress. The constants C_1, C_2 are given by the relations : C_1 := \\\\frac{\\\\rho_d L_d a b^2 u}{2 w^2}; \\\\quad C_2 := \\\\frac{D}{\\\\rho_d b^2} where \\\\rho_d is the dislocation density, L_d is the length of a dislocation segment, a is the distance between Peierls valleys, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, u is the Debye frequency, w is the width of a kink loop, and D is the drag coefficient. Zerilli‚ÄìArmstrong flow stress model The Zerilli‚ÄìArmstrong (ZA) model is based on simplified dislocation mechanics. The general form of the equation for the flow stress is :\\\\text{(3)} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma_y(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}},\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}},T) = \\\\sigma_a + B\\\\exp(-\\\\beta T) + B_0\\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha T) ~. In this model, \\\\sigma_a is the athermal component of the flow stress given by : \\\\sigma_a := \\\\sigma_g + \\\\frac{k_h}{\\\\sqrt{l}} + K\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}^n, where \\\\sigma_g is the contribution due to solutes and initial dislocation density, k_h is the microstructural stress intensity, l is the average grain diameter, K is zero for fcc materials, B, B_0 are material constants. In the thermally activated terms, the functional forms of the exponents \\\\alpha and \\\\beta are : \\\\alpha = \\\\alpha_0 - \\\\alpha_1 \\\\ln(\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}); \\\\quad \\\\beta = \\\\beta_0 - \\\\beta_1 \\\\ln(\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}); where \\\\alpha_0, \\\\alpha_1, \\\\beta_0, \\\\beta_1 are material parameters that depend on the type of material (fcc, bcc, hcp, alloys). The Zerilli‚ÄìArmstrong model has been modified by for better performance at high temperatures. Mechanical threshold stress flow stress model The Mechanical Threshold Stress (MTS) model ) has the form :\\\\text{(4)} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma_y(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}},\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon},T) = \\\\sigma_a + (S_i \\\\sigma_i + S_e \\\\sigma_e)\\\\frac{\\\\mu(p,T)}{\\\\mu_0} where \\\\sigma_a is the athermal component of mechanical threshold stress, \\\\sigma_i is the component of the flow stress due to intrinsic barriers to thermally activated dislocation motion and dislocation-dislocation interactions, \\\\sigma_e is the component of the flow stress due to microstructural evolution with increasing deformation (strain hardening), (S_i, S_e) are temperature and strain-rate dependent scaling factors, and \\\\mu_0 is the shear modulus at 0 K and ambient pressure. The scaling factors take the Arrhenius form :\\\\begin{align} S_i & = \\\\left[1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{k_b~T}{g_{0i}b^3\\\\mu(p,T)} \\\\ln\\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{0}}}}{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}}\\\\right)^{1/q_i} \\\\right]^{1/p_i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_e & = \\\\left[1 - \\\\left(\\\\frac{k_b~T}{g_{0e}b^3\\\\mu(p,T)} \\\\ln\\\\frac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{0}}}}{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}}\\\\right)^{1/q_e} \\\\right]^{1/p_e} \\\\end{align} where k_b is the Boltzmann constant, b is the magnitude of the Burgers' vector, (g_{0i}, g_{0e}) are normalized activation energies, (\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon}, \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{0}}}) are the strain-rate and reference strain-rate, and (q_i, p_i, q_e, p_e) are constants. The strain hardening component of the mechanical threshold stress (\\\\sigma_e) is given by an empirical modified Voce law :\\\\text{(5)} \\\\qquad \\\\frac{d\\\\sigma_e}{d\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}} = \\\\theta(\\\\sigma_e) where :\\\\begin{align} \\\\theta(\\\\sigma_e) & = \\\\theta_0 [ 1 - F(\\\\sigma_e)] + \\\\theta_{IV} F(\\\\sigma_e) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\theta_0 & = a_0 + a_1 \\\\ln \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}} + a_2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}} - a_3 T \\\\\\\\\\\\ F(\\\\sigma_e) & = \\\\cfrac{\\\\tanh\\\\left(\\\\alpha \\\\cfrac{\\\\sigma_e}{\\\\sigma_{es}}\\\\right)} {\\\\tanh(\\\\alpha)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ln(\\\\cfrac{\\\\sigma_{es}}{\\\\sigma_{0es}}) & = \\\\left(\\\\frac{kT}{g_{0es} b^3 \\\\mu(p,T)}\\\\right) \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} and \\\\theta_0 is the hardening due to dislocation accumulation, \\\\theta_{IV} is the contribution due to stage-IV hardening, (a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\\\alpha) are constants, \\\\sigma_{es} is the stress at zero strain hardening rate, \\\\sigma_{0es} is the saturation threshold stress for deformation at 0 K, g_{0es} is a constant, and \\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}} is the maximum strain- rate. Note that the maximum strain-rate is usually limited to about 10^7/s. Preston‚ÄìTonks‚ÄìWallace flow stress model The Preston‚ÄìTonks‚ÄìWallace (PTW) model attempts to provide a model for the flow stress for extreme strain-rates (up to 1011/s) and temperatures up to melt. A linear Voce hardening law is used in the model. The PTW flow stress is given by :\\\\text{(6)} \\\\qquad \\\\sigma_y(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}},\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}},T) = \\\\begin{cases} 2\\\\left[\\\\tau_s + \\\\alpha\\\\ln\\\\left[1 - \\\\varphi \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\beta-\\\\cfrac{\\\\theta\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}{\\\\alpha\\\\varphi}\\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\right] \\\\mu(p,T) & \\\\text{thermal regime} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2\\\\tau_s\\\\mu(p,T) & \\\\text{shock regime} \\\\end{cases} with : \\\\alpha := \\\\frac{s_0 - \\\\tau_y}{d}; \\\\quad \\\\beta := \\\\frac{\\\\tau_s - \\\\tau_y}{\\\\alpha}; \\\\quad \\\\varphi := \\\\exp(\\\\beta) - 1 where \\\\tau_s is a normalized work-hardening saturation stress, s_0 is the value of \\\\tau_s at 0K, \\\\tau_y is a normalized yield stress, \\\\theta is the hardening constant in the Voce hardening law, and d is a dimensionless material parameter that modifies the Voce hardening law. The saturation stress and the yield stress are given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tau_s & = \\\\max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{s_0 - (s_0 - s_{\\\\infty}) \\\\rm{erf}\\\\left[\\\\kappa \\\\hat{T}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\gamma\\\\dot{\\\\xi}}{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}\\\\right)\\\\right], s_0\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}{\\\\gamma\\\\dot{\\\\xi}}\\\\right)^{s_1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tau_y & = \\\\max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{y_0 - (y_0 - y_{\\\\infty}) \\\\rm{erf}\\\\left[\\\\kappa \\\\hat{T}\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\gamma\\\\dot{\\\\xi}}{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}\\\\right)\\\\right], \\\\min\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ y_1\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}{\\\\gamma\\\\dot{\\\\xi}}\\\\right)^{y_2}, s_0\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\dot{\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm{p}}}}{\\\\gamma\\\\dot{\\\\xi}}\\\\right)^{s_1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} where s_{\\\\infty} is the value of \\\\tau_s close to the melt temperature, (y_0, y_{\\\\infty}) are the values of \\\\tau_y at 0 K and close to melt, respectively, (\\\\kappa, \\\\gamma) are material constants, \\\\hat{T} = T/T_m, (s_1, y_1, y_2) are material parameters for the high strain-rate regime, and : \\\\dot{\\\\xi} = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\cfrac{4\\\\pi\\\\rho}{3M}\\\\right)^{1/3} \\\\left(\\\\cfrac{\\\\mu(p,T)}{\\\\rho}\\\\right)^{1/2} where \\\\rho is the density, and M is the atomic mass.

Established in 1974, following its first elections held a year before that, it is an elected local government body responsible for the most significant local services in the county, including county schools, county roads, and social services. Creation In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the administrative counties of Cumberland and Westmorland and the county borough of Carlisle were abolished, and the areas they covered were combined with parts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire to form a new non-metropolitan county called Cumbria. Functions Cumbria County Council is responsible for the more strategic local services of the county, including education (schools, both primary and secondary), libraries and youth services, social services, highway maintenance, waste disposal, emergency planning, consumer protection, and town and country planning for minerals matters, waste and for highways. This makes it a substantial employer. The former Cumberland County Council's final major road scheme, an A66 bypass for Keswick, was prepared by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick, consulting engineers, in 1972,Civil engineering and public works review, vol. 67, Issues 792-797 (1972), p. 715 and construction began in the summer of 1974, with the new authority completing the scheme.Tony Aldous, Goodbye Britain? (1975), p. 171 The Council operates various recycling and waste disposal facilities across the area. In January 2012, the Council announced plans to close six of these centres. The six sites identified by the review as most suitable for closure are at Ambleside, Brampton, Grange-over-Sands, Kirkby Stephen, Millom and Wigton. Although the administrative offices are at Cumbria House in Botchergate, Carlisle, formal meetings of the Council are held at the County Offices in Kendal. History Control of the council has swung back and forth. In its first four years (1973-1977) there was no overall control, but in 1977 the Conservatives gained a majority. In 1981, this became a majority for Labour, and from 1985 there was again no one-party control. In 1997, Labour again took control, but lost it in 2001. Since then, no party has had a majority. A proposal for Cumbria to become a unitary authority was made in 2007, and Cumbria went into consultation, with opposition coming from the district councils which would be abolished: Allerdale, Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Copeland, Eden, and South Lakeland. In the event, the county was left out of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. In 2008, the county council rejected a proposal to introduce a directly elected mayor, opting instead for a cabinet-style administration that resembled the status quo. During the same year, an administration of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats collapsed, suffering not least from lacking a majority in the council. Thirty-nine Labour members and three Independents exactly equalled the total of thirty-two Conservatives and ten Liberal Democrats. A minority Labour administration then took over running the council until the June 2009 elections, when a net gain of one seat from the Independents led to the creation of a new Conservative and Labour coalition.Julian Whittle, Political fight begins for control of Cumbria council dated 12 May 2009 at newsandstar.co.uk, accessed 1 January 2011 Elections The first elections to the authority were in 1973, and members have been elected since then every four years for a four-year term of office, with elections being held all together on the \\"first past the post\\" system. Since boundary changes in 2001, 84 councillors have been elected from 84 single-member electoral divisions. At the June 2009 elections, the outcome was 38 Conservatives members, 24 Labour, 16 Liberal Democrats and six Independents. A Labour-Conservative coalition was formed. Following the May 2013 elections the outcome was 35 Labour members, 26 Conservative, 16 Liberal Democrats and 7 Independents. A Labour-Lib Dem coalition was formed. Following the May 2017 elections, the outcome was 37 Conservative, 26 Labour, 16 Liberal Democrats and 5 Independents, resulting in a Labour-Lib Dem coalition with support from Independent members.

Image from French photographer √âmile Gsel (1838-1879).The Roneat Dek () is a Cambodian metallophone, comparible to the Roneat ek. It is an ancient instrument made of 21 blackened-iron bars. It may be used in the Pinpeat ensemble and Mahaori orchestra. It is believed to have originated from the Royal Courts before the Angkor period. This instrument is rarely covered with ornamentation on either the bars or the sound box. The roneat dek is analogous to the ranat ek lek of Thailand.  Etymology  In the Khmer language, Roneat means xylophone where \\"dek\\" or correctly written and pronounced as \\"daek\\" mean metal or iron. So Roneat dek literally means metal xylophone.Chhounnat dictionary, \\"roneat & daek\\". This name is probably derived from the fact that the Roneat Daek's note bars are made of iron or other metals.  History  The origin of Roneat Dek is similar to other Khmer Roneat genres and thought to predate the Angkorian period or in the earlier Angkorian period. According to Ouknha Moha Thipadei Meas Ni, the chief of Cambodian Royal Orchestra, this type of Roneat was modeled from Javanese gamelan musical instrument called Gend√©r since the reign of Khmer king Jayavarman II. At the end of 9th century he was in exile in Java. He then returned to Cambodia and became the first king of the Khmer Empire, bringing with him some Javanese influence. This type of Roneat genre is thought to have originated after this historical event; however, this Roneat genre had been modified distinctively from its original gend√©r form.  Structure  The Roneat Dek or Roneat Thong has 21 iron or bronze bars. Because of their weight, the bars cannot be suspended on cords but are laid in stepwise order on pads over a rectangular trough resonator. In its shape and size, the bars resemble those of Roneat Ek, but they are tuned by scraping or firing away part of metal. The player use a pair of mallets or Roneat sticks similar to those of other Roneats but made of hard material such as hide of a buffalo or elephant.  Variation  =Roneat Thong= A variation on the instrument was the roneat thong () which was made of a reddish-brown brass or bronze, similar to gold. The Roneat dek and roneat thong may have been equivalent, with the gold-barred version played \\"in the Royal Palace,\\" while the iron-barred version was used in the \\"Orchestra, picnic outside the palace, or in pagodas.\\" However, equivalent Thai metallaphone instruments can help illustrate possibilities; the Ranat ek lek had a golden and a blackened iron version. That version was also historically called \\"ranad thawng.\\" Thai music also has a lower pitched instrument, the Ranat thum lek. If these instruments follow the pattern of the Thai instruments, then the roneat thung may be like the ranat ek lek with brass and blackened-iron versions, or it may be the Cambodian equivalent of the lower pitched ranat thum lek. Pictures with these instrument names (and with equivalent numbers of tone bars) similar to the higher and lower pitched Thai instruments were illustrated in the Cambodian book \\"Cambodian National Music.\\" However, these Thai musical instruments originated more recently, in the reign of King Rama IV (1854-1868) in the 19th century. The similarity in their name may attributed to the Thai annexation of Northwestern Cambodia from late 18th century and ended in 1907 as the age of this Khmer musical instrument was thought to be much older than this. Significance Normally, Roneat Thong is used in Khmer royal orchestra whereas Roneat Dek is usually used in the Pinpeat orchestra outside the Royal Palace or in pagodas.

Free space optical communication technology has emerged in recent years as an attractive alternative to the conventional radio frequency (RF) systems. This emergence is due in large part to the increasing maturity of lasers and compact optical systems that enable exploitation of the inherent advantages (over RF) of the much shorter wavelengths characteristic of optical and near-infrared carriers: Fig 1. Modulating Retro-reflector Technology Overview. * Larger bandwidth * Low probability of intercept * Immunity from interference or jamming * Frequency spectrum allocation issue relief * Smaller, lighter, lower power  Technology  An MRR couples or combines an optical retroreflector with a modulator to reflect modulated optical signals directly back to an optical receiver or transceiver, allowing the MRR to function as an optical communications device without emitting its own optical power. This can allow the MRR to communicate optically over long distances without needing substantial on-board power supplies. The function of the retroreflection component is to direct the reflection back to or near to the source of the light. The modulation component changes the intensity of the reflection. The idea applies to optical communication in a broad sense including not only laser-based data communications but also human observers and road signs. A number of technologies have been proposed, investigated, and developed for the modulation component, including actuated micromirrors, frustrated total internal reflection, electro-optic modulators (EOMs), piezo-actuated deflectors, multiple quantum well (MQW) devices,http://www.nrl.navy.mil/fpco/publications/2000United%20States%20Patent_%206,154,299.pdfDRUM: Item 1903/6807 and liquid crystal modulators, though any one of numerous known optical modulation technologies could be used in theory. These approaches have many advantages and disadvantages relative to one another with respect to such features as power use, speed, modulation range, compactness, retroreflection divergence, cost, and many others. In a typical optical communications arrangement, the MRR with its related electronics is mounted on a convenient platform and connected to a host computer which has the data that are to be transferred. A remotely located optical transmitter/receiver system usually consisting of a laser, telescope, and detector provides an optical signal to the modulating retro-reflector. The incident light from the transmitter system is both modulated by the MRR and reflected directly back toward the transmitter (via the retroreflection property). Figure 1 illustrates the concept. One modulating retro-reflector at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in the United States uses a semiconductor based MQW shutter capable of modulation rates up to 10 Mbit/s, depending on link characteristics. (See \\"Modulating Retro-reflector Using Multiple Quantum Well Technology\\", U.S. Patent No. 6,154,299, awarded November, 2000.) The optical nature of the technology provides communications that are not susceptible to issues related to electromagnetic frequency allocation. The multiple quantum well modulating retro-reflector has the added advantages of being compact, lightweight, and requires very little power. The small-array MRR provides up to an order of magnitude in consumed power savings over an equivalent RF system. However, MQW modulators also have relatively small modulation ranges compared to other technologies. The concept of a modulating retro-reflector is not new, dating back to the 1940s. Various demonstrations of such devices have been built over the years, though the demonstration of the first MQW MRR in 1993 was notable in achieving significant data rates. However, MRRs are still not widely used, and most research and development in that area is confined to rather exploratory military applications, as free-space optical communications in general tends to be a rather specialized niche technology. Qualities often considered desirable in MRRs (obviously depending on the application) include a high switching speed, low power consumption, large area, wide field-of-view, and high optical quality. It should also function at certain wavelengths where appropriate laser sources are available, be radiation-tolerant (for non- terrestrial applications), and be rugged. Mechanical shutters and ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) devices, for example, are too slow, heavy, or are not robust enough for many applications. Some modulating retro- reflector systems are desired to operate at data rates of megabits per second (Mbit/s) and higher and over large temperature ranges characteristic of installation out-of-doors and in space. = Multiple Quantum Well Modulators = Semiconductor MQW modulators are one of the few technologies that meet all the requirements need for United States Navy applications, and consequently the Naval Research Laboratory is particularly active in developing and promoting that approach. When used as a shutter, MQW technology offers many advantages: it is robust solid state, operates at low voltages (less than 20 mV) and low power (tens of milliWatts), and is capable of very high switching speeds. MQW modulators have been run at Gbit/s data rates in fiber optic applications. When a moderate (~15V) voltage is placed across the shutter in reverse bias, the absorption feature changes, shifting to longer wavelengths and dropping in magnitude. Thus, the transmission of the device near this absorption feature changes dramatically, allowing a signal can be encoded in an on-off-keying format onto the carrier interrogation beam. This modulator consists of 75 periods of InGaAs wells surrounded by AlGaAs barriers. The device is grown on an n-type GaAs wafer and is capped by a p-type contact layer, thus forming a PIN diode. This device is a transmissive modulator designed to work at a wavelength of 980 nm, compatible with many good laser diode sources. These materials have very good performance operating in reflection architectures. Choice of modulator type and configuration architecture is application-dependent. Once grown, the wafer is fabricated into discrete devices using a multi-step photolithography process consisting of etching and metallization steps. The NRL experimental devices have a 5 mm aperture, though larger devices are possible and are being designed and developed. It is important to point out that while MQW modulators have been used in many applications to date, modulators of such a large size are uncommon and require special fabrication techniques. MQW modulators are inherently quiet devices, accurately reproducing the applied voltage as a modulated waveform. An important parameter is contrast ratio, defined as Imax/Imin. This parameter affects the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Its magnitude depends on the drive voltage applied to the device and the wavelength of the interrogating laser relative to the exciton peak. The contrast ratio increases as the voltage goes up until a saturation value is reached. Typically, the modulators fabricated at NRL have had contrast ratios between 1.75:1 to 4:1 for applied voltages between 10 V and 25 V, depending on the structure. There are three important considerations in the manufacture and fabrication of a given device: inherent maximum modulation rate vs. aperture size; electrical power consumption vs. aperture size; and yield. = Inherent Maximum Modulation Rate vs. Aperture Size = The fundamental limit in the switching speed of the modulator is the resistance-capacitance limit. A key tradeoff is area of the modulator vs. area of the clear aperture. If the modulator area is small, the capacitance is small, hence the modulation rate can be faster. However, for longer application ranges on the order of several hundred meters, larger apertures are needed to close the link. For a given modulator, the speed of the shutter scales inversely as the square of the modulator diameter. = Electrical Power Consumption vs. Aperture Size = When the drive voltage waveform is optimized, the electrical power consumption of a MQW modulating retro-reflector varies as: Dmod4 * V2 B2 Rs Where Dmod is the diameter of the modulator, V is the voltage applied to the modulator (fixed by the required optical contrast ratio), B is the maximum data rate of the device, and RS is the sheet resistance of the device. Thus a large power penalty may be paid for increasing the diameter of the MQW shutter. = Yield = MQW devices must be operated at high reverse bias fields to achieve good contrast ratios. In perfect quantum well material this is not a problem, but the presence of a defect in the semiconductor crystal can cause the device to break down at voltages below those necessary for operation. Specifically, a defect will cause an electrical short that prevents development of the necessary electrical field across the intrinsic region of the PIN diode. The larger the device the higher the probability of such a defect. Thus, If a defect occurs in the manufacture of a large monolithic device, the whole shutter is lost. To address these issues, NRL has designed and fabricated segmented devices as well as monolithic modulators. That is, a given modulator might be \\"pixellated\\" into several segments, each driven with the same signal. This technique means that speed can be achieved as well as larger apertures. The \\"pixellization\\" inherently reduces the sheet resistance of the device, decreasing the resistance-capacitance time and reducing electrical power consumption. For example, a one centimeter monolithic device might require 400 mW to support a one Mbit/s link. A similar nine segmented device would require 45 mW to support the same link with the same overall effective aperture. A transmissive device with nine \\"pixels\\" with an overall diameter of 0.5 cm was shown to support over 10 Mbit/s. This fabrication technique allows for higher speeds, larger apertures, and increased yield. If a single \\"pixel\\" is lost due to defects but is one of nine or sixteen, the contrast ratio necessary to provide the requisite signal-to-noise to close a link is still high. There are considerations that make fabrication of a segmented device more complicated, including bond wire management on the device, driving multiple segments, and temperature stabilization. An additional important characteristic of the modulator is its optical wavefront quality. If the modulator causes aberrations in the beam, the returned optical signal will be attenuated and insufficient light may be present to close the link.

It was originally settled in 400 A.D., and is situated on a hill at an altitude of 1500 meters, overlooking the Kadisha valley. Hadath el Jebbeh is a summer resort and touristic place, benefiting from its welcoming and friendly local families. The inhabitants of the village are mostly Maronites, with the presence of two churches in town, the historical St. Daniel church which was built around 1110 CE, and Notre-Dame church built in 1956. At the end of summer, Hadath el Jebbeh celebrates St. Daniel Festival, which takes place every second Sunday of September of each year. Location, climate and nature Hadath el Jebbeh is located in Bsharri District, overlooking Qannoubine Valley. The village is 94 km away from Lebanese Capital, Beirut, and 36 km away from Tripoli, the largest city in North Lebanon. Hadath el Jebbeh is well known by its cold (sometimes freezing) snowy weather during winter, and its cool weather during summer, which makes it lovely to visit anytime throughout the year, especially in the summer season, where numerous Lebanese consider it one of the best summer residences in Lebanon. Etymology Hadath is the name of three localities in Lebanon. To differentiate between the localities, the name of the region is added, Hadath Beirut, Hadath Baalbeck and finally Hadath el Joubbeh. Other localities by this name exist in the Middle East. The Semitic root of Hadath means \\"the new\\", hence the name could mean \\"the new town\\".Moubarac, Y. (1984). Pentalogie Antiochienne / Domaine Maronite - Volume 2 - Part 2, Cenacle Libanais, Beirut. page 649. The common pronunciation of the name is Hadad or Hadid. It gives an indication to a probable different meaning. Hadad was the northwest Semitic storm and rain god and the town could have had a temple dedicated to this god. And the popular tradition claims that the church dedicated to the saint patron of Hadath, Saint Daniel, was built on the remnants of a pagan temple.Lammens, H. (1986). Tasrih al-Absar fi Ma Yahtawi Loubnan min Al-Athar, Dar Nazir Abboud, Beirut. Page 99-100 Jebbeh is the traditional name of the Kadisha region, called also Jebbet Bsharri in reference to Bsharri the largest town of this region. The Semitic root Gb means \\"well\\", \\"deep\\" and could be a reference to the deep gorges of the Kadisha. In Lebanon, other Jebbeh exist like Jebbet Mnaytra and Jebbet Yanuh.

In 1883, the SM&AR; gained running rights over the Great Western Railway branch from Savernake Low Level to Marlborough and through services started between Swindon Town and Andover Junction railway station, and on down the Sprat and Winkle Line to Southampton. The same year, the Swindon and Cheltenham Extension Railway (S&CER;) opened north of Swindon as far as Cirencester and in 1884 the SM&AR; and the S&CER; merged to form the M&SWJR.; The line was completed as a through-route from the Midlands to the south coast by the completion of the northern end of the route between Cirencester and Cheltenham in 1891. Collingbourne was sited to the east of the village of Collingbourne Ducis and originally had a passing loop. The track was doubled through Collingbourne early in the 20th century. Collingbourne station had a brick building on the up platform towards Swindon and a shelter on the down platform, which also housed a signalbox. The station master's house was behind the up platform. There was a small goods yard, but goods traffic was not high. In 1932, a halt was opened at Collingbourne Kingston, about 1.5 miles north of Collingbourne station, in an effort by the GWR, which had taken over the M&SWJR; on the Grouping in 1923, to generate traffic on a line threatened by increasing road use. As a whole, traffic on the M&SWJR; fell steeply after the Second World War and the line closed to passengers in 1961, with goods facilities withdrawn from this section of the line at the same time.

Original available at University of Michigan.Michigan's Nautical City It was founded in 1910; however, production didn't begin until 1912.Traveling Through Time: A Guide to Michigan's Historical Markers Ownership of the quarry has changed a number of times in recent years, but it is still one of the country's largest producers of limestone. The limestone which it uses is found in the limestone deposit underground in the northeastern part of Northern Michigan near Alpena just south of Rogers City along the shore of Lake Huron. History Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company quarry About 1908 or 1909, the geologist Henry H. Hindshaw established the commercial value of limestone in Northern Lower Michigan. Limestone is a raw material essential in industry for making steel, chemicals, and concrete. Hindshaw determined the value due to the especially high grade and purity of the limestone deposit underground in the northeastern region of Lower Michigan along the shore of Lake Huron, near Alpena and just south of Rogers City.Presque Isle County area has history of adapting to changes The quality and size of the limestone deposit at Rogers City, and the availability of easy water transportation, led to the development of the quarry and a port. Both quarry and port are named Calcite, after Calcite, the principal ingredient of limestone. =Company= Michigan Limestone & Chemical Co. was formed in 1910 by New York investment banker William F. White and a group of investors who purchased a large block of land along the Lake Huron shore just south of the small lumbering community of Rogers (now Rogers City). It was the lumber industry that had brought the first settlers to the Rogers City area around the time of the Civil War. The first settlers arrived at Rogers in 1869 with the establishment of the Rogers-Molitor Lumber Company. Carl Bradley and W. F. White at Calcite in 1919 The lumber industry was the backbone of the economy in Rogers City and Presque Isle County until the second decade of the 20th century. By that time, most of the forests had been cut over and the major lumber companies were moving their camps to fresh forests in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and into the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. It was about that time that Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company began mining limestone. White, who continued to live in New York City, served as President of Michigan Limestone. In 1911, Carl D. Bradley was hired as General Manager of the Calcite Plant. Bradley oversaw construction of the limestone processing plant, which included a powerhouse, crusher, mill or screenhouse, conveyor distribution system, harbor, loading slip, ship loader, repair shop, and office building. Steam shovels were purchased for use in mining, and steam locomotives and dump cars were used to move the stone from the quarry to the crusher. Production at the quarry began in early 1912 and the first cargoes of stone were shipped in June of that year. Most of the stone mined at the Rogers City quarry was shipped on lake freighters to steel mills located along the lower Great Lakes at places like Detroit, Cleveland, Gary, and South Chicago. For most of the plant's history, its biggest customer was United States Steel (Also known as U.S. Steel.), the world's largest producer of steel products. Eventually, additional markets were found for the limestone in the agricultural, construction, chemical, and cement industries. The Rogers City area continued to develop and grow as the Calcite Plant grew. Within 20 years, the quarry at Rogers was the world's largest producer of limestone. ;U.S. Steel United States Steel Corporation purchased a controlling interest in Michigan Limestone in 1920 and Carl D. Bradley was promoted from General Manager to president of Michigan Limestone. Bradley also served as president of Michigan Limestone's fleet of self-unloading ships used to deliver the stone. Those ships were operated as the Bradley Transportation Co. Michigan Limestone and Bradley Transportation came under the full ownership of U.S. Steel upon Bradley's death in 1928. At that time U.S. Steel purchased all of the stock of both Michigan Limestone and the associated shipping concern, Bradley Transportation, and made both these companies subsidiaries of U.S. Steel.Presque Isle County Historical Museum of Rogers City, Michigan The company became a division in 1951 when the operations at Rogers City became U.S. Steel‚Äôs \\"Northern District\\", since the main offices were moved to Detroit. The operation is still a major employer in northern Michigan. Its ownership has changed several times in recent years. Since 2008 it has been owned by Carmeuse, a Belgium-based major international producer of lime-based products. Uses The limestone produced at Michigan Limestone is high quality and almost pure white.Tin Stackers Steel mills added limestone to molten iron in the blast furnaces. It is used to carry away impurities in the process of making steel. The material is also in widespread use in making cement. The limestone also produces just pure lime, which is used in everything from glass manufacturing, paint fabrication, baking powder assembly and ammonia production. Self-unloading ships of the company SS Bradley self-unloading. Michigan Limestone and Chemical Company built three ships between 1912 and 1917. They were named SS Calcite,Great Lakes Vessels Online Index - SS Calcite SS W.F. WhiteGreat Lakes Vessels Online Index - SS W.F. White and SS Carl D. Bradley (in 1927, this ship would be renamed John G. Munson, and a new SS Carl D. Bradley would be built). These ships were revolutionary in their own right. They represented the latest technology in \\"self-unloading\\" ships, then simply called \\"unloading ships\\". In 1912, the company built its first steamship, SS Calcite. It was considerably larger than the first modern self-unloader ever built on the Great Lakes. That ship was the SS WyandotteHistorical Collections of the Great Lakes - SS Wyandotte and was built in 1908 for the Michigan Alkali Company of Wyandotte, Michigan, better known as Wyandotte Chemical Co. The ship was used to haul limestone from the company's quarry at Alpena, Michigan, to their manufacturing plant on the Detroit River south of Detroit. The steamships W.F. White and Carl D. Bradley followed over the next few years. All the steamships' hulls were painted grey to minimize the appearance of the limestone dust that accumulated during loading and unloading. Launch Day for the SS Calcite - March 30, 1912 The design of these early self-unloaders was pretty much the same as today. The idea is that the \\"cargo hold\\" is built with its sides sloping toward the center of the ship along the keel. Where the two sides come together, a series of steel gates can be opened. This allows the material to drop onto a conveyor belt running the length of the ship beneath the \\"cargo hold.\\" The conveyor belt carries the material up to an exchanger, where it is transferred to a second belt which runs up to the main deck, then through a long boom on deck. The unloading swing boom hangs over the ship's side to discharge the material load onto the waiting customer's dock. The advantage of self-unloaders is that they can deliver the limestone material directly to a customer's dock without requiring expensive shoreside unloading rigs. As business grew over the years, the company built several more of these self-unloaders. These ships were operate under the name Bradley Transportation Company after 1920 and were known as the Bradley boats or the Bradley fleet.Rogers City‚Äôs Bradley Boats There are self-unloaders today that carry limestone from the Calcite plant through the Port of Calcite to industrial ports all around the Great Lakes. The SS Carl D. Bradley was lost in a storm in November 1958 while returning from delivering a load of limestone; 33 of the 35 crewmembers died, most of whom lived in or around the small town of Rogers City. No larger loss of lives has occurred in the lake freighter fleet since the Bradley's sinking.

As of 2009 the congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ (UCC). The church was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012, in recognition for the unique interior decorations executed in 1880-81 by John La Farge. History The congregation was gathered as Newport's First Congregational Church in 1695 by Rev. Nathaniel Clap, a Harvard College graduate who ministered to the Newport congregation until his death in 1745. The Second Congregational Church of Newport started another congregation in 1735, but the two later reunited. The congregation was active during the American Revolution and both churches' meeting houses were used as barracks and hospitals by the British and French troops in Newport. Dr. Samuel Hopkins was the minister of the church in the late eighteenth century. As of 2009, the church is pastored by the Reverends Mary Beth Hayes and Nan L. Baker. Building The current building is a Romanesque Revival structure, designed by Joseph C. Wells of New York City and completed in 1857. It is a basically rectangular building, built out of Connecticut brownstone, with two ornately decorated towers. In the 1880s the congregation retained the artist John LaFarge to redecorate its interior. LaFarge had recently completed work on Trinity Church, Boston, and sought to provide a more elaborate interior than he was able to in Boston. He produced twenty stained glass windows and a series of murals, which represent the only fully integrated ecclesiastical interior he produced. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012.

Thomas Martin Easterly (October 3, 1809 ‚Äì March 12, 1882) was a 19th-century American daguerreotypist and photographer. One of the more prominent and well-known daguerreotypists in the Midwest United States during the 1850s, his studio became one of the first permanent art galleries in Missouri. Although his reputation was limited to the Midwest during his lifetime, he is considered to have been one of the foremost experts in the field of daguerreotype photography in the United States during the mid-to-late 19th century. He took the very first known photograph of a lightning bolt in history. Biography  Born in Guilford, Vermont, he was the second of five children born to Tunis Easterly and Philomena Richardson. He reportedly came from a poor background, his father being a farmer and part-time shoemaker, and was living away from home at age 11. Around 1830, he was living in St. Lawrence County, New York although little is known of his early years. He began working as itinerant calligrapher and a penmanship teacher traveling throughout Vermont, New Hampshire and New York during the 1830s and 40s. By 1844, he had begun practicing photography taking outdoor photographs of architectural landmarks and scenic sites in Vermont. Among his earliest daguerreotypes, made a decade before outdoor photography was popular or profitable, those of the Winooski and Connecticut rivers are the only known examples to be self-consciously influenced by the romantic landscape paintings of the Hudson River School artists. He was also the first and only daguerreotypist to identify his work using engraved signatures and descriptive captions. In the fall of 1845, Easterly traveled to the Midwest United States and toured the Mississippi River with Frederick F. Webb as representatives of the Daguerreotype Art Union. The two gained some notoriety from their photography of the criminals convicted of the murder of George Davenport in October of that year. Iowa newspapers reported that Easterly and Webb had achieved a \\"splendid likeness\\" of the men shortly before their execution. Easterly and Webb continued touring on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers for several months before spending the winter of 1846-47 in Liberty, Missouri. The only known photograph of the first St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans, built to be the world's finest, was taken by Easterly ca. 1847. The following spring, Easterly and Webb went their separate ways with Easterly traveling on his own to St. Louis. He soon became popular for his portraits of prominent residents and visiting celebrities which were displayed in a temporary gallery on Glasgow Row. One of these portraits was that of Chief Keokuk taken March 1847. He also took a daguerreotype of a lightning bolt, one of the first recorded \\"instantaneous\\" photographic images, while in St. Louis. This was later recorded in the Iowa Sentinel as an \\"Astonishing Achievement in Art\\". Before returning to Vermont in August 1847, the St. Louis Reveille described his as an \\"unrivaled daguerreotypist\\". He was brought back to Missouri by John Ostrander, founder of the first daguerreotype gallery in St. Louis, in early 1848. Preparing for an extended \\"tour of the south\\", Ostringer asked Easterly to manage his portrait gallery. Esterly would continue running the gallery when Ostringer died a short time later. Many of his unique streetscapes depicting mid-19th-century urban life were taken from the windows of Ostringer's gallery. In June 1850, he married schoolteacher Anna Miriam Bailey and settled in St. Louis permanently. During the 1860s, improvements in photographic development caused daguerreotypes to become out of fashion. Easterly refused to acknowledge these changes believing the highly detailed daguerreotypes were far superior in terms of beauty or permanence urging the public to \\"save your old daguerreotypes for you will never see their like again\\". During the next decade, both his health and financial situation worsened. Despite the declining interest for pictures on silver, he was able to maintain his gallery until it burned in a fire in 1865. He was forced to move to a smaller location and continued working in near obscurity until his death in St. Louis on March 12, 1882. He had suffered from a long illness and partial paralysis in his final years and is thought to have been caused by prolonged exposure to mercury, one of the key ingredients used in the daguerreotype process. After his death, his wife sold most of his personal collection to John Scholton, another noted St. Louis photographer. The Scholton family eventually donated the plates to the Missouri Historical Society where they remained for nearly a century before being rediscovered during the 1980s by art scholars studying pre-American Civil War photography.Christensen, Lawrence O.

His name comes from an altarpiece, dating to between 1418 and 1422, commissioned by Konrad Imhoff for the Lorenzkirche in Nuremberg. Only the central panel, depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, and the wings, depicting several apostles, are still preserved in the church, albeit partially disassembled. On the inner wings, flanking the Coronation, may be found a donor portrait of the donor with three of his four wives. Originally the back of the altarpiece held an image of Christ as the Man of Sorrows, with the Virgin Mary and Saint John. This piece, which has since been removed to the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, is now believed to be the work of the Master of the Bamberg Altar. It is believed by some historians that the Master of the Imhoff Altar is also the so-called Master of the Deichsler Altarpiece, whose work is known from two surviving altarpiece wings in Berlin. Attempts have been made to link both artists to Berthold Landauer, but these have been based entirely on his activity in Nuremberg at the time in question. The Deischler paintings are believed to predate the Imhoff Altar by five to ten years, and are the work of an artist deeply familiar with the art of Bohemia from around 1400. The Imhoff Altar, by contrast, represents a marked shift towards a firmer and sparer manner, coupled with the use of stronger colors.

He collaborated with Ray Golden and Hal Fimberg on the screenplay of the Marx Brothers' vehicle The Big Store, for which he also supplied the lyrics to the musical climax, \\"The Tenement Symphony\\". Earlier in their careers, Kuller and Golden wrote comedy songs and special material for the Ritz Brothers. Although he wrote prodigiously and with facility throughout his life, Kuller admitted, \\"The creation of comedy is a painful experience\\".Quoted by Adamson, Joe, Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Sometimes Zeppo.  Vaudeville  After attending Columbia University, Kuller began contributing jokes and songs to vaudeville performers, such as Bert Lahr and Jack Benny, and became a ghost-gag-writer for the legendary Al Boasberg. While working on an Earl Carroll Vanities show he started to write comedy bits for the precision-dancing Ritz Brothers, who brought him and fellow-writer Ray Golden with them to Hollywood in 1937.Vosburgh, Dick, \\"Obituary: Sid Kuller,\\" The Independent, London, 13 October 1993. On Broadway Kuller and Golden were part of the team which wrote the book for the progressive 1940 revue Meet the People, which included one of his early hit songs Elmer's Wedding Day (with music by Jay Gorney).The Internet Broadway Database He also wrote the political musical revue, O Say Can You Sing, which was performed in Chicago,Goldstein, Malcolm, The Political Stage: American drama and theater of the Great Depression, 1974, p. 255. and may have been one of the producers of the original Chicago production of the Federal Theater Project's groundbreaking all-black Swing Mikado.,Lax, David, One Man Show, Washington Irving Gallery publication, 1976, p. 48. which transferred to Broadway without him.  Hollywood career  Through a string of Ritz Brothers' credits, the team of Kuller and Golden became known as one of Hollywood's best special material writers.Nash, J.R. et al, The Motion Picture Guide, 1985, p. 201. At this time Kuller, who specialized in funny, though politically aware sketches and clever blackouts,Stewart, Rex, Boy Meets Horn, 1991, p. 211. kept an open house in the Hollywood Hills where jazz and swing bands regularly jammed, including Duke Ellington's.Cooper, Jackie, Please Don't Shoot My Dog, New York, 1982, p. 96; Bradbury, David, Duke Ellington, 2005, p.58. Groucho Marx quickly recognized in Kuller a fellow wit (and admirer of Gilbert and Sullivan), and kept him on set to zing up lines for The Big Store as they went along (e.g., he's credited with, \\"You mean a woman of your culture and money and beauty and money would marry this impostor?\\").Vosburgh, op.cit. Returning after war service with the U.S. Army Air Corps First Motion Picture Unit, Kuller divided his time between writing and producing for Broadway (Alive and Kicking, debuting Gwen Verdon 1950); television (Colgate Comedy Hour, hosts Martin and Lewis, Donald O'Connor 1952-3; The Milton Berle Show 1951; The Jackie Gleason Show 1970); and various night-club acts (e.g. The Sportsmen Quartet). In 1952 he executive produced with Ben Hecht Actor's and Sin, using archive footage of Louis B. Mayer and Jack L. Warner, which ran into trouble when some theater chains refused to show it on the grounds that it lampooned Hollywood.Beck, Robert, The Edward G. Robinson Encyclopedia, McFarland, Uni. of Michigan, 2002, p. 21 In the 1970s Sid collaborated with Sandy Matlowsky and Tige Andrews (of Mod Squad fame) on two original songs on the Tiger Records label in Los Angeles, California. \\"The Modfather\\" and \\"Keep America Beautiful\\" were the A and B sides of the vinyl 45 single release. These songs had humor and poignancy for the post 60s youth culture that was embracing political awareness and the social revolution. Sid's clever writing techniques are at its finest in this rare collection that contributed to the advocacy of world peace and the environmental movement.  Black Entertainment Involvement  Redd Foxx recalled that Kuller had become a household name among black performers of the 1940s.Foxx, Redd, The Redd Foxx Encyclopedia of Black Humor, p. 116. While working on the cotton-picking pastiche in The Big Store (\\"Up n' down the ole plantation, All the cotton was-a rottin away etc.\\"), Kuller conceived with Duke Ellington the idea for a black, topical revue that would challenge segregation and try to break down the old Uncle Tom and Stepin Fetchit stereotypes still prevalent in the industry at that time. Their stated aim was to correct the race situation through theatrical propaganda.Erenberg, Lewis A., Swingin' the dream: big band jazz and the rebirth of American Culture, 1998, pp. 147-8. Jumpin for Joy, starring Dorothy Dandridge, Ellington and other leading black performers, ran for three months at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles before an integrated audience, with the backing of the Marx Brothers, Orson Welles and other Hollywood liberals. Kuller co- directed most of the skits he wrote, and together with Paul Francis Webster contributed biting lyrics to the music of Hal Borne and EllingtonBradbury, id. p. 58. (e.g. \\"Fare thee well, land of cotton; cotton lisle is out of style\\"). As Kuller later explained: \\"Traditionally, black humor had been portrayed by blacks for white audiences from a white point of view. Our material was from the point of view of black people looking at whites.\\"Lock, Graham, Blutopia, 1999, p.101. Although the show was an artistic and popular success, it had to be shut down with the outbreak of the Pacific War.Vosburgh; Stewart, op. cit. Kuller was also an early supporter of comedian and jazzman Scatman Crothers, with whom he worked on television. Kuller cast him in a featured role in his directorial debut, the 1950 swing version of The Return of Gilbert and Sullivan, filmed in the United Kingdom.The Internet Movie Database For Louis Armstrong Kuller created a jazz versus opera routine featuring Robert Merrill.Merrill, Robert, Once More From the Beginning, New York, 1965, p. 263. Kuller together with Borne also contributed to the successful revitalization of the Will Mastin Trio song and dance act in the early 50s, helping launch the breakthrough of Sammy Davis Jr. .Billboard, 25 July 1953, p. 11. During the 1950s he was involved with some other projects for black performers, most of which did not come to fruition: including another revue entitled Swing Family Robinson,Delson, Susan, Dudley Murphy: Hollywood Wild Card, 2006, p. 180. a biopic of Ellington and a revival of Jumpin for Joy in Las Vegas.Jet, 27 May 1954, p. 61; Jet, 8 September 1955, p. 62.  Later career  Kuller joined ASCAP in 1942 and was active in organizing many Variety Club charity shows.Jet, 22 September 1955, p. 62. In the 1956 Jule Styne production Mr. Wonderful, one of Kuller's interpolated songs (\\"Daddy, Uncle and Me\\") was performed by Sammy Davis, Jr. He was also the writer and producer of Miltown Revisited, the disastrous last Las Vegas show of Abbott and Costello, when the partnership finally split up in 1956.Parish, James R., The Funsters, 1979, p. 18. Kuller recalled that after Abbott turned up drunk for the second show at the Sahara Hotel, Costello never forgave him: \\"It was the most terrible night of [Kuller's] life in show business.\\"Vosburgh, op. cit. Nevertheless, Kuller continued producing night-club acts until his death and was responsible for writing two fondly remembered parody shows for the Jewish dialect comedians Mickey Katz and Billy Gray: The Cohen Mutiny (i.e. Caine takeoff)Katz, Mickey, Papa, Play for Me, Wesleyan Uni. Press, 2002. and My Fairfax Lady, where an upperclass British woman is taught to speak with a Jewish accent!The Internet Movie Database In 1963 Kuller was heavily involved in writing (and rewriting) the ambitious, but troubled Vernon Duke musical Zenda, based on The Prisoner of Zenda, for the San Francisco Light Opera Company with Alfred Drake and Chita Rivera. But his final stage experience was to be the hit 1981-3 revue Sophisticated Ladies, starring Gregory Hines, where famous songs he and others wrote with Ellington (e.g. \\"Bli-Blips\\") were introduced to a new generation.The Internet Broadway Database He and his wife Morine were supporters of Oakwood, the cooperative school established in Hollywood by the actor Robert Ryan, a fellow liberal active in the Civil rights movement, and his Quaker wife.Jarlett, Franklin, Robert Ryan, 1997, p. 65.

After the United States occupied the Philippines, the United States Navy seized, salvaged, and repaired her and commissioned her as gunboat in 1900 for service in the United States.

It was the largest campus drug bust in San Diego County history and one of the largest college drug busts in U.S. history. Background The sting operation was triggered by the overdose death of a 19-year-old female student, who died of a cocaine overdose on May 6, 2007. Another student, from Mesa College, died of an oxycodone overdose on February 26, 2008 while the covert investigation was being conducted. SDSU campus police, initially investigating alone, invited the DEA and the San Diego County District Attorney's office to get involved in the operation starting in December 2007, after the department became overwhelmed by the leads they uncovered. Results of sting The old Theta Chi fraternity house in May 2008. On May 6, 2008, San Diego State University Police in collaboration with the Drug Enforcement Administration culminated a year-long investigation into drug abuse in the college area with a series of early morning raids at several residences in the college area. The DEA initially announced the arrests of 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, (many of them interns at Adobe Systems Incorporated) on a variety of drug charges.\\"Drug bust nets 96 at San Diego State\\", CNN.com, May 6, 2008 One day later, on May 7, SDSU officials stated that only 33 were students, and that the inflated numbers issued originally included all drug-related arrests made over the course of the year- long investigation, many of which were months before the raid and most cases for simple possession. In total, two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 350 Ecstasy pills, 50 pounds of marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, hash oil, methamphetamine, illicit prescription drugs, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. origin.mercurynews.com, Six fraternities suspended in drug probe at San Diego State The day of the sting, SDSU President Stephen Weber spoke at a news conference, while authorities identified 22 SDSU students as drug dealers who sold to undercover agents, and 17 others that had supplied the drugs. The rest of the suspects apparently bought or possessed illegal drugs. Authorities further found that those arrested included students in the campus's Homeland Security and Criminal Justice programs. Students belonging to campus fraternities were also among those arrested as result of the operation.signonsandiego.com, 5 are students; DEA took part in yearlong operation In the immediate aftermath of the sting, the university placed six of its fraternity chapters on interim suspensions, as each had one or more members or former members arrested as result of the investigation. Some student groups, including SDSU group \\"Students for Sensible Drug Policy,\\" protested the arrests, especially SDSU's decision to involve the DEA, a federal agency, in the operation. In addition, they urged the university to adopt a \\"Good Samaritan\\" policy that would allow students in an overdose situation to call for help without fear of repercussions. On May 15, SDSU Vice President for Student Affairs James Kitchen announced that the interim suspensions for three of the fraternities had been lifted after an administrative review found that those arrested in connection to the controlled substances investigation were either inactive/former members of the fraternity and/or were not presently residents of chapter houses. On November 22, SDSU announced that Phi Kappa Psi had been suspended for 18 months and Theta Chi had been suspended for four years. Sentencing Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported that the majority of the defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.

John Peterson built the windmill on Old Mill Lane in Portsmouth, Rhode Island in 1810, and William Boyd purchased it in 1815. It originally had four common sails, but four more were added by the family. The mill is a timber-frame structure, octagonal in shape, and about tall, with a rotating cap powered by eight vanes with canvas sheets. The grindstones in the middle of the mill are Fall River granite; the upper one, which is connected to the power mechanisms, rotates six times for each turn of the mill's main shaft. In 1916 Benjamin Boyd removed the original vanes and powered the mill using a gasoline engine. It is one of only two historic windmills (out of what was estimated to be more than thirty) to survive on Aquidneck Island. The windmill was restored by the Middletown Historical Society after receiving it as a donation in 1990 and moving it to Paradise Valley Park in Middletown. The windmill is open to the public on Sunday afternoons in July, August and September. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

Generally, ranking is based on won-lost record of games, with the team with the best record at the top, and the worst record at the bottom. Another common method is a points-based ranking system, where a team is awarded a certain number of points per win, fewer points per tie, and none for a loss. In most sports, with association football generally being an exception, teams with the better records are awarded the advantage of playing in the postseason and all the glory that accompanies this privilege. In leagues that use promotion and relegation, being in or near last place typically results in relegation to the next-lower league, although in some leagues, teams that finish near but not at the bottom may enter a promotion/relegation playoff with one or more teams from the next-lower league, and some other leagues relegate teams based on performance over multiple seasons. In leagues with franchise systems, such as those in the US and Canada and in Australia, being in last place is only harmful to the team's reputation and not its place in the league. However, in some franchised leagues, the last place finisher may receive special compensation, such as being offered the first draft choice. By sport =Association football= Most association football leagues do not directly use teams' won-drawn-lost record to determine ranking. Instead, a points system is used: 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss. This system is also used in group stages of major international competitions (such as the FIFA World Cup) and international club competitions (such as the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores). All competitions also have a tiebreaking procedure to separate teams that are level on points. Most leagues determine their champions solely by regular-season standings. The most notable exceptions to this rule are leagues in North America and Australia. The top leagues in both regions‚ÄîMajor League Soccer (MLS) in the United States and Canada, Liga MX in Mexico, and the A-League in Australia (plus one team in New Zealand)‚Äîoperate playoff systems to determine the season champion (or, in Mexico, two season champions). MLS and the A-League are franchised, while Liga MX uses promotion and relegation. As a general rule, teams that finish sufficiently high on the regular-season table also earn the right to play in the next edition of one of the international club competitions for their region. For example, European clubs (more precisely, clubs in areas governed by UEFA, which includes several countries that lie partially or totally outside geographic Europe) can qualify for the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Europa League. Similarly, top teams in other parts of the world can qualify for the Copa Libertadores, AFC Champions League, CAF Champions League, CONCACAF Champions League, or OFC Champions League. =Cricket= Initially in the Indian Premier League, there were 52 matches in each league. This was increased to 96 matches in 2011. Top three teams in this league, automatically makes it to the Champions League Twenty20, held by International Cricket Council every year. =Baseball= In Major League Baseball, there are three divisions in each league. The leader in each division automatically makes the playoffs, regardless of record. As of 2012, two additional teams, known as the wild cards, play one game to determine who will face the division winner with the best record. From 1995 to 2011, a single wild card team reached the playoffs; before 1969 one team from each league reached the World Series, and from 1969 to 1993 each league had two divisions, whose leaders played a series to determine the league champion and entrant in the World Series. The 1994 season was played using a three- division, one-wild-card setup, but a labor dispute ended the season before these honors could be earned by any team (the first time in 90 years the United States would be without a World Series). In the Division Series, the team with the best record of the three plays the wild card survivor, and the other two teams play each other in a best-of-five playoff. Beginning with the 2012 postseason, the team with the best record plays the wild-card survivor, regardless of divisional alignment. Previously, teams from the same division were not allowed to meet in the Division Series. The winners of each series play each other in a League Championship Series in a best-of-seven playoff to determine the pennant winner. The two pennant winners then play a best-of- seven series known as the World Series to determine the champion. =Basketball and Hockey= In the NBA and NHL, finishing in last place does not guarantee the first draft choice. Rather, a lottery is used between all of the lower-ranking teams (The 14 out of 30 that failed to reach the postseason). The team with the worst record is given the highest odds of winning the lottery (often 4-to-1), but is not guaranteed the first choice. In the NBA, the first three draft choices are chosen via the lottery, and each winning team receives the draft place it won in the lottery. In the NHL, only one lottery winner is chosen, and if the team is not one of the four worst teams record-wise in the league, it improves four positions in the draft. If the team is one of the worst four, it receives the first draft choice. In both leagues, the remaining teams are sorted by their records during the regular season (lottery teams) or playoff performance. The lottery only affects the first round of the draft. This format is used to prevent a team from losing intentionally in order to automatically gain the first draft choice privilege. =American football= In the NFL, there are two conferences‚Äîthe AFC and NFC‚Äîwhich are each divided into four divisions‚ÄîNorth, South, East, and West. The winner of each division plus two \\"wild card\\" teams from each conference advance into the playoffs. The two teams with the best record in each conference receive byes from the first round of the playoffs and advance to the second round automatically. The four other teams play single-elimination games and the winners advance to play the two bye teams. The winners of those games advance to the conference championship games and then to the Super Bowl, where the winner receives the Lombardi Trophy and title of Super Bowl Champion, along with championship rings for each member. The NFL Draft is held every April and the order of selection is based on the records from the 16-game regular season, from worst to best, with the Super Bowl Champions selecting 32nd. Trading rules are the same as in basketball and hockey, and trading the rights of players after they have been drafted but before they have signed a contract is not uncommon. =Rugby union= As with association football, most leagues in rugby union use a points system to determine ranking. The most commonly used system in the sport is: * Base points: Win: 4, Draw: 2, Loss: 0 * Bonus points: ** 1 point for scoring 4 or more tries. In France's professional league, the try bonus is awarded to a team that scores at least 3 more tries than its opponent. ** 1 point for losing by 7 points or less (the value of a converted try) This system is used in the group stages of all competitions operated by the International Rugby Board, such as the Rugby World Cup. It is also used in group stages of most international club competitions, including the Heineken Cup. While The Rugby Championship in the Southern Hemisphere uses the standard bonus points system, its Northern Hemisphere counterpart, the Six Nations Championship, does not. It instead uses a system with no bonus points: Win: 2 points, Draw: 1 point, Loss: 0 points. All competitions also have a tiebreaking procedure to separate teams that are level on points. Unlike most association football leagues, rugby union leagues generally determine their champions in a knockout playoff. The most common system is a four-team Shaughnessy playoff, though France's Top 14 has a six-team playoff.

It can be prepared by epoxidation of styrene with peroxybenzoic acid, in the Prilezhaev reaction: 300px Styrene oxide is slightly soluble in water. A trace amount of acid in water causes hydrolysis to racemic phenylethyleneglycol via aryl cation.

Stereospecific reaction  Since styrene oxide has a chiral center at the benzylic carbon atom, there are (R)-styrene oxide and (S)-styrene oxide. If optically pure reagent is used, only one optically pure compound will be obtained.  Toxicology  Styrene oxide is a main metabolite of styrene in humans or animals, resulting from oxidation by cytochrome P450. It is considered possibly carcinogenic from gavaging significant amounts into mice and rats.EPA Styrene Oxide evaluation Styrene oxide is subsequently hydrolyzed in vivo to styrene glycol by epoxide hydrolase. Styrene oxide has a chiral center and thus two enantiomers. It has been reported that the two enantiomers had different toxicokinetics and toxicity. It was reported that the (R)-styrene oxide was preferentially formed in mice, especially in the lung, whereas the (S)-styrene oxide was preferentially generated in rats. In human volunteers, the cumulative excretion of the (S)-enantiomer of styrene glycol and mendelic acid were higher than the R form after exposure to styrene. In human liver microsomes, cytochrome P450-mediated styrene oxidation showed the production of more S enantiomer relative to the R enantiomer. It was also found that (S)-styrene oxide was preferentially hydrolyzed than the R enantiomer in human liver microsomes. Animal studies have shown that the (R)-enantiomer of styrene oxide was more toxic than the (S)-enantiomer in mice.

Originally intended to be released theatrically in April 1993, Trimark Pictures cancelled its release due to the 1992 Los Angeles riots and shifted the film to air on HBO on June 26, 1993 as a world premiere. Plot After an incident where he used questionable police tactics, Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips) is placed on probation. Upon hearing of his probation, a friend from the force later invites Jeff to join the Special Investigation Section, an elite and highly secretive LAPD unit designed to track and shut down high profile criminals. Jeff discovers that the group is actually a group of rogue cops who actually function like an unofficially sanctioned death squad and are given wide latitude when it comes to dealing with criminals. Although their official mission is to surveil criminals and arrest them in the act of committing a crime, the squad often resorts to brutality and murder to dispatch the subjects they are supposed to arrest. Jeff questions the purpose of the squad and begins to see them as more of a harm to society than a positive force for justice. When he tries to bring evidence of the squad's abuse of power, he learns that the squad is protected by well-connected and very influential people who already know and condone the squad's methods. Jeff's former teammates in the squad begin to suspect that Jeff has turned on them and decide to take measures to eliminate him before he can expose their activities to the public.

It was founded by Darren Hann and Melanie Collins in mid-to-late 2006, and held its first festival in 2007. Since its first year, Sci-Fi on the Rock has been a completely volunteer organized non-profit event.  History  It began in 2007 at the Hotel Mount Pearl, moving on to be housed in the Holiday Inn in St. John's as of April 2008. The convention made another move in 2016 to the Sheraton Hotel Newfoundland. The festival has had a number a notable guests both from Newfoundland and beyond, including science-fiction author Kenneth Tam (Defense Command, His Majesty's New World), comic-book artist Paul Tucker (The Underworld Railroad, Google John Smith), actor Brian Downey (Lexx, Millennium), actor Jeremy Bulloch (The Empire Strikes Back, Octopussy), author William Meikle (The Midnight Eye series), horror author Matthew LeDrew (Black Womb, Roulette) and author Shannon Patrick Sullivan (The Dying Days).  First Festival  Sci-Fi on the Rock's first festival was held on April 1, 2007 at the Hotel Mount Pearl (formerly Chateau Park) in Mount Pearl, Newfoundland. It featured special guest authors Kenneth Tam and Shannon Patrick Sullivan, and local business/fangroup, Vader Party. As well as featuring special guests, the festival featured workshops throughout the day including the popular \\"Lightsaber Techniques\\", \\"Basic Horror Make-Up for Film and Television\\" and \\"Costume Designing\\". In addition, there were a number of sales-and-display tables, and a number of competitions such as Video Games, Model Building, Costume Contest, and others. Sci-Fi on the Rock also featured a canteen with Sci-Fi related food (i.e.: \\"The Kirk Burger\\"). Having been planned and put off within only a few months, and with little publicity, Sci-Fi on the Rock's first festival was a surprise success with almost 500 people attending, and was covered in many local media pages, as well as internet sites.  Sci-Fi on the Rock II  As a result of the success of the first festival, Sci-Fi on the Rock organizers Darren Hann and Melanie Collins, as well as the now-larger organizing committee decided that the festival should be held again the following year and should be bigger. Around the summer of 2007, planning for Sci-Fi on the Rock II would commence. The first change was time and place. It was increased from a one-day to a full weekend event, and was held in a larger venue. Sci-Fi on the Rock II was held at the Holiday Inn hotel in St. John's, on Saturday, April 19 and Sunday, April 20, 2008. As a kick-off to the festival, author Kenneth Tam was invited back as a special guest, and launched the first book in his new series The Grasslands on the evening before the festival. Other changes included the amount of publicity the festival received, and the structure of different competitions. The list of special guests grew from three to seven, with Kenneth Tam and Vader Party returning for their second year, and the addition of authors Matthew LeDrew and Willie Meikle, comic-book artist Paul Tucker of Viper Comics, as well as the appearance of Celebrity Special Guests, actors Jeremy Bulloch, who notably played the bounty hunter Boba Fett from the Star Wars Franchise, and Brian Downey, who is perhaps best known for his role of Stanley Tweedle from Lexx: The Series. Like the year before, Sci-Fi on the Rock II was met with positive reviews and overall success. In addition to more media coverage, both before and after the festival, the attendance increased to over 700‚Äîwith a number of patrons coming from other parts of Canada, the United States and even the United Kingdom. The guests as well had an enjoyable time. Jeremy Bulloch commented on his website that \\"The people of Newfoundland are extremely friendly. It was only the second time that Darren had put the 'Sci-Fi on the Rock' show on, and it was very well attended. Lots of costumes and games for the children and it seemed that everyone was having a good time\\". Jeremy Bulloch's Home Page Sci-Fi on the Rock II featured a Charity Auction, which benefited the School Lunch Association. Items that had been placed for bid included a Limited Edition Star Wars T-shirt-and-Box Set which is not available in North America (donated by Jeremy Bulloch), a Lexx Prize pack, including many behind-the-scenes cuts and scripts (donated by Brian Downey), a Limited Edition Boba Fett action figure, personally autographed by Jeremy Bulloch, and a P.A.D.D. that was used on the set of Star Trek: The Next Generation (which was donated by an agent of one of the actors of the show).  Sci-Fi on the Rock III  Sci-Fi on the Rock had its third festival on April 25 and 26, 2009 at the Holiday Inn in St. John's once again. The special guest actors for this year were Vaughn Armstrong, who is perhaps best known as Admiral Maxwell Forrest from Star Trek Enterprise, Christian Simpson, who notably played Lt. Gavyn Sykes in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and also worked on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (as Old Fred Weasley), and Peter Mayhew who notably played Chewbacca the Wookiee in the Star Wars saga. Author guests included returning authors Kenneth Tam, Matthew LeDrew and Willie Meikle, and welcomed for the first time Louise Bohmer. Following in the tradition of the previous year, the festival was upgraded due to the overwhelming response to the last festival to better accommodate the demand. Such changes included the addition of a third workshop room, which added around 20+ workshops to the festival. Other additions included the Cantina, a midnight movie, and website redesigns. This year also marked the first Fan Film that Sci-Fi on the Rock was involved with producing: Star Wars: Inner Demons. Returning attractions included many of the workshops from the previous year, including Lightsaber Technique, Stage Combat, Star Wars, Transformers, Special Effect Make-up and others. The Charity Auction also returned, again aiding the School Lunch Association. Dinner with the Stars, an event where a limited number of guests are able to sit and enjoy a three-course meal with the special guest actors, also returned. Sci-Fi on the Rock 3 was met with over a thousand visitors, and received many positive reviews from patrons.  Sci-Fi on the Rock IV  Sci-Fi on the Rock IV took place on April 17 and 18, 2010. Planning began in September 2009. The festival took place in its regular venue, the Holiday Inn. Special guests included actors Casey Biggs who played Damar on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Max Grod√©nchik who played Rom on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Nalini Krishan who is perhaps best known as Barris Offee, the Jedi Padawan to Lumiara Unduli, as well as authors Matthew LeDrew, Ellen Curtis, Dwain Campbell, Ira Nayman, Kevin Woolridge and Patti Kennedy. Actor Mike Savva was scheduled to attend, but as a result of the Icelandic Volcano eruptions and the resulting ash cloud over UK Airspace, he was unable to come to Newfoundland. The 2010 festival again broke its previous record by having over 1200 people visit its attractions, beating the previous year's total of just over 1000. This was a twofold success, as this year the festival competed with the 2010 JUNO Awards. Besides growth in numbers, the festival grew in other ways. For example, in May 2009 (almost immediately following the past festival), Sci-Fi on the Rock opened an online store on their website. Also, Due to the success of Hann Made Film's first fan-film, Star Wars: Inner Demons, Hann Made Films filmed another fan-film, this time a Stargate SG-1/Doctor Who crossover film, titled Replication. The film debuted at Sci-Fi on the Rock IV, to great reception again. Also, Sci-Fi on the Rock and HannMade Films teamed up to create Sci-Fi on the Rock TV, a video magazine that provided festival updates on an \\"almost bi-weekly\\" basis. Season One of Sci-Fi on the Rock TV was hosted by Steve Lake and Ellen Curtis, and ran from September 11, 2009 to May 2010. Season Two began in September 2010, with both hosts returning, until Ellen Curtis was replaced by Melanie Collins.  Sci-Fi on the Rock V  Sci-Fi on the Rock held its fifth festival on April 15, 16 and 17, 2011, making this year the first time the organization launched a festival that spanned three days. It was held again at the St. John's Holiday Inn, and was kicked off with a book launch from festival co-founder Darren Hann, followed by the festival's first ever film festival. Special guests who were in attendance this year were actor Mike Savva (who was scheduled to appear for Sci-Fi on the Rock IV but was waylaid due to Volcanic activity over UK airspace), actor Robert Axelrod (better known as the voice of Lord Zedd from the Power Rangers), actor David Nykl, known as Doctor Zelenka from Stargate Atlantis, actor John Garman \\"J. G.\\" Hertzler (known in the Star Trek community for his role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9) as the Klingon General, and later Chancellor, Martok) and Suzie Plakson who is an actress, singer, writer, poet, and artist, who has played four characters on various Star Trek series, including Worf's wife K'Ehleyr. Special guests also included returning authors Matthew Ledrew, Ellen Curtis, and actor/comic creator Kevin Woolridge, and welcomed newcomers Charles Picco from Todd and the Book of Pure Evil. Picco, a native Newfoundlander, is the co-creator/co-writer/executive story editor of Todd and The Book of Pure Evil, a comedy/horror series that previously aired on the Space Channel. Like in previous years, the fifth festival beat its numbers from the previous year; while an exact figure is not yet known, it is estimated that around 1500 people visited the festival this year. Because this year marked the organization's fifth year, the festival staff introduced its first annual film festival, which commenced on the festival's opening night. Eleven films were submitted and screened, ten of which were from local film-makers, and one (X-Meeting) from Halifax, Nova Scotia. The winner of this film festival was a horror/comedy short called \\"Date With The Dead\\".  Sci-Fi on the Rock VI  Sci-Fi on the Rock VI occurred on April 20 to 22, 2012. Due to the growth of attendees at Sci-Fi on the Rock events, the layout of the festival underwent and overhaul to ensure the larger numbers could be accommodated. This new layout has continued to stand as the standard. Special guest actor Richard Hatch of Battlestar Galactica fame, in addition to appearing as a guest, offered an acting workshop for festival patrons. Also appearing was Jeffrey Combs from the Reanimator series, Peter Roy who appeared in Star Wars and Doctor Who, French- born Fantasy Art model Drakaina, comedian and chocolate bar inspiration Fat Apollo, and talent agent Lolita Fatjo, who has helped Sci-Fi on the Rock obtain many of their previous and future guests. The Film Festival returned, featuring 9 short films. This time, the festival went international very unexpectedly, and received submissions from India, Spain, Mexico, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The winner of the JFE Audience Choice Award was a film called \\"Deadspiel\\", from Ontario. Once more, the festival beat its own record for attendees, with the numbers reaching close to 1800.  Sci-Fi on the Rock VII  Sci-Fi on the Rock held its seventh annual festival from April 24 to April 26, 2013. The special guests for that year included Mike Dopud from Stargate Universe, Dominic Keating from Star Trek: Enterprise, Dean Haglund who portrayed Langly in The X-Files and its spin-off series The Lone Gunmen, Gary Jones who is perhaps best known for playing Walter Harriman on Stargate: SG1, and cosplay model and actress Ginny McQueen. In the previous year, some of the special guest actors undertook a more active role in the event than simply delivering a Q&A; panel and offering photos and autographs (namely, Richard Hatch offered an acting workshop). The same happened this year, as actors Dean Haglund and Gary Jones‚Äîwho are close friends in real life‚Äîserved as Masters of Ceremonies for the Sci-Fi on the Rock cantina, as well as closing out the show with a rousing improvised comedy sketch. The remaining special guests were among the entertained audience members, showcasing that the Sci-Fi on the Rock offerings as well as the inherent charm of Newfoundland and Labrador made this event equally as entertaining to the guests themselves as it did to the patrons. Continuing again with its trend of breaking its own attendance numbers, Sci-Fi on the Rock 7 was met with a staggering increase in popularity. The Sci-Fi on the Rock International Film Festival entered its third year, and received some of its best submissions. Films were received from Newfoundland, Ontario, Alberta, the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom. The winning film was \\"Brutal Relax\\", a Spanish film by film maker David Mu√±oz.

The event was again a great success. The crowd was so large that it was clear that Sci-Fi on the Rock had again outgrown a venue. This would be the last year that Sci-Fi on the Rock took place at the Holiday Inn.  Sci-Fi on the Rock 10  Sci-Fi on the Rock experienced its first big move since 2008. Sci-Fi on the Rock 10 took place at the Sheraton Hotel Newfoundland in St. John's from April 1st - 3rd, 2016.

Frey, a writer. As well Fat Apollo came back again to act as emcee. The location change was very successful. The move gave Sci-Fi on the Rock some room to stretch its legs and attendees appreciated the extra space that the Sheraton Hotel provided. The vendor's area grew and more varied vendors and artists were able to attend. The attendance for SFotR 10 was well over 2250 people throughout the weekend. This was the first year that Sci-Fi on the Rock had a VIP pass. The change in location also gave Sandbox Gaming a bigger and more comfortable space at our convention for gaming.  Sci-Fi on the Rock 11  Sci-Fi on the Rock 11 was held at the Sheraton Hotel Newfoundland in St. John's from April 28‚Äì30, 2017.

Several new events were offered for 2019 including the book launch of \\"The Fifth Queen\\" for author Ali House, and a live performance from the CBS band.  Geek Survivor  Additional to the contests discussed in the main articles, there is a larger competition held during the festival called \\"Geek Survivor\\", where contestants compete to be crowned the title of \\"Newfoundland's Ultra Geek\\". Although it is called \\"Geek Survivor\\", it more closely resembles Jeopardy! and Beat the Geeks in structure and style. It is a trivia-based game, where contestants answer questions of varying difficulty about different Sci-Fi topics. At the end of the game, the contestant with the highest score is crowned \\"Ultra Geek\\". Mark Downey was crowned as the first Sci-Fi on the Rock Ultra Geek on April 1, 2007. Dr. Glyn George, a MUN professor and Doctor Who and Star Trek enthusiast, was crowned on April 20, 2008. He later abdicated his throne, as he became involved in the planning of Sci-Fi on the Rock, retiring from the competition undefeated. Newfoundland's Ultra Geek for 2009, crowned at Sci-Fi on the Rock 3, was Chickie Who. They, too, retired undefeated. Andrew O'Brien was crowned as Newfoundland's fourth Ultra Geek on April 18, 2010. Unlike his predecessors, he competed again in the fifth Geek Survivor challenge, but was dethroned by Ford Cooke, who was crowned as the fifth Ultra Geek on April 17, 2011. In 2012, the winner of Geek Survivor was a patron who was identified only as \\"Star Wars guy\\", and 2013 saw the rise of Jason Gosse as Newfoundland's Ultra Geek. Film Festival In 2011, Sci-Fi on the Rock teamed up with a local company, to bring forth the festival's first annual film festival as a large-scale addition to the festival attractions. This festival offered the JFE Audience Choice Award, sponsored by Justin Foley Entertainment, which was awarded to the film that received the highest amount of audience votes. In its first year, 11 films were submitted and screened, 10 of which were from local film-makers, and one (X-Meeting) from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2015, the film festival separated from Sci-Fi on the Rock due of large interest, and became a stand-alone event called Granite Planet International Film Festival, but still brings highlighted films to be screened at Sci-Fi on the Rock. A refreshed version of the Film Festival will be returning to Sci-Fi on the Rock in 2018 to be organized by Sci-Fi on the Rock. Workshops Apart from the media guest Q&A;'s, autographs and photo sessions, there are many other workshops during the festival, these change yearly but in the past have included: * Comic-Book drawing * Acting * Getting Published * Getting Self-Published * Costume Contests * Lego Robotics * Lightsaber Workshop * Movie Make-up * Writer's Circle =The Cantina= Making its first appearance at Sci-Fi on the Rock 2009, the Cantina is an informal concert/variety show held on one of the evenings of the festival. Performers opt to play Sci-Fi related music, known as Filk, but that is not always the case. The Cantina features performances by musicians involved with the festival, an open mic, and there is an improvised acting piece prepared that audience members are call upon to perform. The event gets its name as a reference to the Mos Eisley Cantina in Star Wars: A New Hope. At its maiden performance in 2009, guest Vaughn Armstrong performed at the Cantina with his ukulele, which was a highlight performance. In 2011, Suzie Plakson gave a singing performance, and in 2013 the Cantina was hosted by Gary Jones and Dean Haglund, a first-time occurrence for the Cantina. They also closed out the show with an improvised sketch comedy, which paid a great deal of attention to the name of one of Newfoundland and Labrador's communities, Dildo. The Cantina was replaced with Friday Night Karaoke in 2015. =The Dance= Sci-Fi on the Rock holds a dance on the Saturday of the convention. This is a 19+ event held at the hotel the convention is being held in. It is a very popular event that draws quiet a crowd. =Starlight/VIP Social= The Starlight Social started as an add-on event that included champagne and possibly meeting guests. After the introduction of the VIP Pass in 2015 it became a VIP only event. Dessert buffet or finger food platters have been provided in previous years, and it is a chance to socialize in a smaller setting than the dance or karaoke. In 2018 the Starlight Social also included a live musical accompaniment by the Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra.

It is a conventional, single seat design of wooden construction. The undercarriage is a fixed monowheel, and construction is of wood (freij√≥ and plywood) throughout. Development The original KW-1a prototype, designed and constructed by Kuno Widmaier, first flew in 1969. At the time CTA (Brazilian Aviation Authority at the time) was looking for a new sailplane of Brazilian design to re-equip the Aeroclubs. Other types were considered, but the good results achieved by Widmaier called attention of the selection group.Andrade, Roberto Pereira de, 1976 KW1 during its construction in Novo Hamburgo, Brazil IPE started the process of adaptations required for certification and assembly production: taller cockpit, redesigned nose, and enlarged rudder,Andrade, Roberto Pereira de, 1976 it achieved Brazilian certification in December 1976 and was produced by IPE (Ind√∫stria Paranaense de Estruturas) under contract by the Brazilian Government. 156 units were produced and supplied to Brazilian flying clubs. Many soaring records were established with the type (Kw-1 Records), which is commonly used as the first solo type during flight training. As of 2017 it still is the most numerous glider type in Brazil.  Variants After certification, about four different variants were developed: two variants by IPE, and two from independent initiatives. =Quero Quero II= Developed by IPE with different vertical and horizontal tail, and retractable wheel.

It is Geographically Separated Unit of the 14th Flying Training Wing at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi, and operates the A-29B Super Tucano aircraft conducting close air support training to the Afghan Air Force as part of ISAF. It is stationed at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia. Mission Provide the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and United States Air Forces in Europe commanders with dedicated close air support, air strike control, and combat search and rescue capability. History =World War II= The squadron was first activated on 15 January 1942, at Key Field, Mississippi, as the 81st Pursuit Squadron flying the P-40 Warhawk. The squadron was assigned to the 50th Fighter Group to replace the 11th Pursuit Squadron, which had been transferred after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor to reinforce the air defenses of Alaska.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 61‚Äì62 In May 1942 the 50th Group was assigned to the Fighter Command School of the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics and the 81st became the 81st Fighter Squadron (Special). Night fighter combat over the skies of England made the Army Air Forces aware of the need for night air defense training and tactics development. The Air Defense Operational Training Unit had been established on 26 March. Later it was renamed the Fighter Command School.Goss, p. 275 The 81st Fighter Squadron became responsible for night fighter training, using Douglas P-70 Havocs.Saunders, p. 1 The 81st was assigned the \\"daunting task\\" of training sufficient crews to man seventeen night fighter squadrons within twelve months, initially \\" [w]ith no trained instructor pilots or [radar operator]s, no aircraft, no radar, and no communications equipment\\"MacFarland, p. 17 The original night fighter crews were recruited from 27 pilots from the 50th Group who were qualified to fly twin-engine aircraft. They attended transition training school at Williams Field, Arizona before returning to Florida.MacFarland, p. 18 In October 1942 the 81st moved to Orlando Army Air Field Florida. By the end of September, the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics Night Fighter Department had been activated and the 81st Fighter Squadron was detached from the 50th Group and placed under the Department for training and operations. In October 1942, the personnel and equipment of the 81st squadron provided the manpower and equipment for the newly formed 348th and 349th Night Fighter Squadrons, and the squadron was remanned. The 81st helped test procedures and equipment, seeking better ways to manage the huge efforts required to supply troops and maintain aircraft fighting overseas. In 1943 the 81st moved to Cross City Army Air Field, Florida, while the 50th Fighter Group remained headquartered at Orlando. Each of the 50th Fighter Group's detached squadrons (including the 81st) returned to Orlando AAF in January 1944. The squadron continued to train and teach at Orlando AAF while preparing to ship out to England. In March 1944, the 81st was re-equipped the P-47 Thunderbolt and shipped to England with the 9th Air Force. Between April 1944 and the V-E Day in May 1945, the unit flew hundreds of fighter escort, close air support, and interdiction missions, taking part in the D-Day invasion and operating from numerous advanced landing bases in Europe while covering the US Army's advance. The squadron received two Distinguished Unit Citations for combat, was credited with 30 aerial victories, and produced the 50th Fighter Group's only ace, Major Robert D. Johnston. The unit was inactivated on 7 November 1945 at La Junta Army Air Field, Colorado. =Reserve operations= It was reactivated at McChord Field, Washington in July 1947, where the 81st tested a number of different aircraft. =European Service= On 1 January 1953 the 81st was established at Clovis Air Force Base, New Mexico where it briefly flew the F-51 Mustang before transitioning to the F-86 Sabre in the spring of 1953. In August 1953, the squadron relocated to Hahn Air Base, Germany. In July 1956, the 81st moved to Toul- Rosi√®res Air Base, France, converting to the F-100 Super Sabre in July 1958. One year later, it returned to Hahn Air Base and in December 1966, re-equipped with the F-4 Phantom II. The squadron took their Phantoms to Zweibr√ºcken Air Base, Germany, in June 1971 to fill the vacancy left by the departure of the Canadian Forces. In 1973, the 81st moved to the 52d Tactical Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, where it took on the Wild Weasel mission of defense suppression. As NATO's only defense suppression squadron, the 81st received the first 24 F-4G advanced Wild Weasels equipped with the APR-38 Radar Attack and Warning System. In 1984, the 81st FS transitioned to a mixed F-4G and F-4E hunter/killer team, using the AGM-88 HARM and AGM-45 Shrike, as the 52d TFW became the only defense suppression wing in NATO. The 81st converted its F-4E aircraft to the F-16 Fighting Falcon in January 1988, becoming a member of the only wing in the U.S. Air Force to fly two different aircraft in the same combat element. In June 1988 the squadron upgraded its F-4G with the APR-47. The 81st FS crews flew the F-4G and F-16C in the hunter/killer role until December 1993, when the unit again became an all-F-4G squadron. It served until 31 December 1993, where they racked up 113 radar kills, flew more than 12,000 combat sorties and 25,000 hours over Iraq. The last F-4G left Spangdahlem Air Base 18 February 1994. The 81st then became an A/OA-10 squadron and replaced the 510th Fighter Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base. During this period, the squadron continuously deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy in support of Operation Deny Flight, enforcing a no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In September 1997, it became the first U.S. Air Forces Europe squadron to participate in Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the United Nations imposed no-fly zone in southern Iraq. Members of the 81st again deployed to Aviano Air Base in October 1998, supporting NATO air presence during the crisis in Kosovo, Yugoslavia. The 81st FS returned to Aviano Air Base in January 1999 for a regular contingency rotation, but then stayed to support Operation Allied Force. The squadron supported air operations from Aviano Air Base until 11 April 1999, when it moved to Gioia del Colle, Italy. From there, the unit flew more than 1,400 combat missions throughout Operation Allied Force and led the first large force packages in A-10 history. The 81st also led the first two successful combat search and rescue task force missions, which involved coordinating all rescue assets resulting in the rescue of downed F-117 and F-16 pilots. In September 2000, the 81st deployed 12 aircraft to Southwest Asia for Operation Southern Watch, accumulating more than 700 combat and training sorties. Immediately following the deployment, the 81st FS was additionally tasked to participate in Croatian Phiblex 2000. The squadron generated and deployed their remaining 6 A/OA-10s and 183 people to Split, Croatia, to aid U.S. Marine and U.S. Navy forces in a joint amphibious landing exercise with Croatian military forces and support another real-world contingency. The squadron deployed several times to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan to provide close air support to coalition ground forces during Operation Enduring Freedom in June 2003, September 2004, and most recently May 2006. During the 2006 deployment the squadron performed an intensive regimen of combat patrols to find, fix and destroy elusive, guerrilla-type enemy combatants in support of ground forces, flying in excess of 2,000 combat sorties and 7,600 combat hours. The 81st employed over 109,000 rounds of 30mm, dropped 350 guided and conventional bombs, and fired over 325 rockets in support of 260 Coalition force operations. As a direct result of the combat action in the 2006 deployment two pilots in the 81st won the prestigious Mackay Trophy and the Daedalian Exceptional Pilot Awards. The first A-10C arrived in May 2009, after receiving the Precision Engagement upgrade, which significantly increased the Warthog's already impressive precision and lethality with a digital stores system, integration of advanced targeting pods, hands on throttle and stick (HOTAS) functionality and Situational Awareness Data-Link (SADL). The Panthers returned to Afghanistan with the A-10C in May 2010, this time to Kandahar AB in the south. Despite the heat, wind and dust, the 81 FS flew over 9,500 hours on over 2,100 sorties and employed over 70,000 rounds of 30mm, 159 precision weapons and 141 rockets while again providing precision close air support to OEF and ISAF operations. The 81st has earned the 1991, 1996, and 2006 USAFE Commander's Trophy. \\"On 18 June 2013, the 81st Fighter Squadron was inactivated at Spangdahlem Air Force Base in Germany. The inactivation signaled the end of A-10 operations in Europe at that time.\\" =Light attack training= The squadron was reactivated at Moody Air Force Base on 1 October 2014 as part of the 23d Wing flying the A-29 Super Tucano. By December the initial cadre of pilot and maintenance trainers and three A-29s were in place. The A-29 is a turboprop aircraft designed for light air support and will be used to support the Afghan training mission at Moody.

The outpost was located 14 kilometers north of Jerusalem, it fell under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. It was the largest outpost of its kind, with a population of 300. The council says it was founded in 1999 and re-founded in 2001, on land registered before 1967 by the villagers of Burqa.Amira Hass, Migron‚Äôs Palestinian neighbors waiting to see if they get land back', at Haaretz 27 March 2012. The Israeli government contributed NIS 4.3 million from the Construction and Housing Ministry to build Migron. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Responding to a petition filed in 2006 by Peace Now, Israel's High Court of Justice ruled on 2 August 2011 that Migron was illegally built on lands belonging to Palestinians and ordered Israel to dismantle the outpost by April 2012. The Israeli government decided not to obey the court order, and instead pursued an agreement with the settlers that gave them time to delay the move until 30 November 2015. However, on 25 March 2012 the High Court reaffirmed its earlier ruling, noting the government had admitted it was built on privately owned Palestinian land, and ordered the IDF to evacuate Migron by 1 August 2012, while making clear that this court ruling is an obligation, not a choice. On 2 September 2012 the evacuation of Migron was complete, after the residents had agreed to relocate to a new site a few hundred meters south of the former location. The site, built by the government in great haste, consists of 50 prefabricated housing units built on state land, and has a status of a government-approved settlement. Geography Migron nursery school Migron was located 14 kilometers north of Jerusalem in the northern Binyamin, 7.7 km east of the Green line, outside of the Separation Barrier. It fell under the jurisdiction of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. It was situated on a dominant hilltop over Highway 60, the main road that connects the northern West Bank with the southern areas, between the settlement Ofra and the Shaar Binyamin Industrial Park. Etymology Migron is named after the village Migron mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in Isaiah 10:28 as a village somewhere on the route between Ai and Mikhmas along which the Assyrian army advanced.Isaiah 10 / Hebrew ‚Äì English Bible / Mechon-MamreCarl Friedrich Keil (1857 Digitized 21 September 2007) Translated by James Martin Commentary on the Book of Joshua p.181 History According to the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, Migron was founded in 1999 and re-established in 2001. It was the largest unauthorized settlement in the West Bank, with a population of 300 living in 60 mobile homes. According to the Sasson Report based on testimony from the IDF Brigade Commander, Migron was established in April 2002, a few days before Operation Defensive Shield. A request for a cellular radio tower on the hilltop was granted by Israel Defense Forces although ownership of the land was then still in dispute. Some time later, caravans were placed near the radio tower without authorization, leading to a confrontation between settlers and the IDF. The infrastructure for Migron was financed by the Housing Ministry, headed by Yair Rafaeli, who urged his staff to provide the illegal outpost with massive government support.Chaim Levinson, 'Israel decides not to charge official over state funding of West Bank outpost Migron,' at Haaretz, 3 April 2012. According to the Sasson Report, government subsidies amounted to four million NIS, despite the lack of statutory planning or a cabinet decision approving the construction. Following the publication of the Sasson report in March 2005, Israeli police investigated the procedure that led to Migron's establishment, with Rafaeli reportedly being the prime suspect in the case. The case was passed to the State Prosecutor's Office in 2007 where, according to Haaretz, \\"it gathered dust for several years\\". State Prosecutor Moshe Lador closed the case in January 2012 \\"due to lack of evidence against some of the suspects, and due to lack of public interest regarding others\\". In response, Peace Now said \\"Criminal offenses that were committed in broad daylight were not investigated seriously\\". = Juridical actions = Migron caravans, 2008 Land ownership According to the Israeli government, Israel's Supreme Court,Tovah Lazaroff Migron settlers sign relocation agreement, at Jerusalem Post, 11 March 2012:'According to the court, Migron was constructed without proper permits on land that the state has classified as belonging to private Palestinians..' and the Israeli organisation Peace Now, the land Migron sits on is owned by a number of Palestinian families living in the nearby villages of Burqa and Deir Dibwan. In July 2008, additional questions were raised as to the ownership of some of the land that Migron stands on. Apparently, land was purchased with forged documents. According to a news report, Abd Allatif Hassan Sumarin, who supposedly sold a plot of land to Binyamin Regional Council owned by al-Watan Ltd in 2004, had been dead since 1961. These suspicions were later confirmed by an Associated Press investigation. At the end of 2008, after the state had failed to evacuate Migron as it had undertaken to do in a petition to the High Court of Justice, some of the land owners filed a claim for damages for the loss of income from their land, hoping to pressure the state to evacuate Migron. After the HCJ verdict ordering Migron's evacuation, this lawsuit was withdrawn, allegedly in order to save costs and time and to prevent any forestalling with regard to the evacuation.The Migron File Peace Now, October 2006 In January 2012, the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court accepted the request that the suit for damages be revoked. The petitioners were ordered to compensate the settlers and the State for court costs. Settlers then attempted to use the withdrawal as an argument for claiming that the Palestinians had failed to provide evidence of their ownership of the land, an argument the court rejected. According to Arutz Sheva, by 26 February 2012, not all claims of ownership of the land of Migron have been settled. The state of Israel said that \\"(..) there will be no civilian presence at the present site of Migron until the claims of ownership of the land are all settled. In addition, it insists that all buildings at the site be razed and says that only if it turns out that the land has no private owner can they be rebuilt.\\" The proposed new settlement will be near the Psagot WineryTovah Lazaroff Migron settlers sign relocation agreement, at Jerusalem Post, 11 March 2012 about two kilometers away from Migron, and defined as part of the existing settlement of Kochav Yaakov, though it does not abut it, and has no road connection to it.Nehemia Shtrasler Migron deal makes a joke of Israel's judicial system, at Haaretz, 27 March 2012 According to Nehemia Shtrasler, the agreement worked out with Benny Begin, while stating that the Migron settlers trespassed illegally on Palestinian land, allows them to evade punishment, and receive an expensive government gift in the form of a new settlement to be built for them. He concluded: : > \\"That is to say, the state will compensate offenders who appropriated > private lands and established a settlement illegally. That's how crime, > punishment and rewards are dealt with by Benny Begin.\\"Nehemia Shtrasler > Migron deal makes a joke of Israel's judicial system, at Haaretz, 27 March > 2012 Evacuation orders Ariel Sharon announced that Migron would be dismantled in 2003. On 17 December 2006, the Israeli government, responding to a petition from Peace Now and residents of Burqa and Deir Dibwan, conceded that the establishment of Migron had not received official authorization. On 12 February 2007, the Israeli High Court of Justice ordered the government to submit a report within 60 days on steps that would be taken to remove the outpost. On 1 May 2007, the government told the court that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had instructed the Defence Ministry to prepare an evacuation plan within the next two months. A 60-day extension was requested. On 8 July 2007, the government requested a further 90-day extension so that the new Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, could formulate his position on the issue. On 23 January 2008, the government informed the court that \\"The Prime Minister and Defense Minister have decided that the outpost Migron, which was constructed on Private Palestinian land, will be evacuated within six months, that is until the beginning of August 2008\\". In addition the statement also expresses that the Defense Ministry reserves the right to \\"request from the Supreme Court an extension on this date, if it deems necessary\\". The promise was accepted by the Supreme Court on 6 February 2008. On 13 August 2008, the government declared that the Yesha Council had agreed to decide within 30 days to which location to transfer the outpost, on 24 November 2008 the government signed an agreement with the settlers to remove the outpost to the settlement of Geva Binyamin. On 26 November, the Supreme Court ordered the government to explain within 45 days why it didn't remove the outpost. Israeli Independence Day celebration at Migron In her summation Supreme Court President Dorit Beinisch criticized the State \\"Today you are submitting papers full of promises, but without any knowledge of who will actually see this through in 3 years time, your statements have turned into meaningless words. In your statements you have revealed some of your secrets: you explain how the evacuation will be carried out, but you never actually say that it will be carried out\\". On 2 February 2009 the government responded with the declaration that they intend to construct a new neighbourhood in an existing settlement for the evacuees of the Migron outpost. On 28 June 2009, the government submitted an affidavit to the courts, according to which the Ministry of Defense authorized the construction of a new neighborhood in the existing settlements of Geva Binyamin. The construction would include 50 housing units for the evacuees of Migron and another 1,450 units for new settlers. Supreme Court ruling On 2 August 2011, in response to a petition filed by Peace Now along with Palestinians, Israel's Supreme Court issued a ruling ordering the state to dismantle the outpost by April 2012. Supreme Court president Dorit Beinisch wrote: \\"There is no doubt that according to the law a settlement cannot be built on land privately owned by Palestinians\\". It is the first time the Supreme Court has ordered the state to dismantle an outpost in the West Bank. The ruling was denounced by several Members of the Knesset, including Tzipi Hotovely (Likud), who called it \\"hypocritical\\", and Moshe Feiglin (Likud), who accused the Supreme Court of denying Jewish land rights. The Yesha Council accused the court of applying a double standard and of needlessly inflaming tensions. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz called the ruling \\"one of the most serious indictments ever filed against Israel's political establishment, legal system and security apparatus\\". The Israeli government decided not to obey the court order, and instead pursued an agreement with the settlers that gave them time to delay the move until 30 November 2015. However, on 25 March 2012 the High Court reaffirmed its earlier ruling and ordered the IDF to evacuate Migron by 1 August 2012, while making clear that this court ruling is an obligation, not a choice. Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin (Likud) held out the possibility of legislation which would nullify the court's decision. On 3 July 2012, the settlers filed another appeal in an attempt to prevent the demolition of Migron. This time, they claimed that the land was recently bought from the Palestinian owner. The owner, however, had died a year earlier. The development firm al-Watan again tried to register the land, citing an apparent false purchase, and appealed to the Jerusalem District Court.Haaretz, 3 July 2012; Settlers say they bought outpost land, one year after Palestinian owner's death. In August 2012 the High Court denied the settlers' petition and ordered Migron evacuated by 11 September 2012. Aryeh Eldad, pro-settlement Knesset member, said that he \\"hoped ultra- nationalists flocked to the outpost to protect it.\\" By 2 September 2012 all of the 47 families in Migron had been evacuated. Yesh Din petition In early September 2011, a force of approximately one thousand police officers destroyed three illegal permanent structures in Migron, arresting six youths among the 200 protesting settlers. The three buildings were ordered to be destroyed by the Supreme Court, following a petition issued by the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din. Shortly after the demolition, a mosque in the West Bank village of Qusra, south of Nablus, was set on fire, according to Palestinian sources by Israeli settlers. Elyakim Levanon, Regional Rabbi of the Samaria Regional Council declared in August 2012 that \\"Whoever raises a hand on Migron ‚Äì his hand will be cut off.\\"Anshel Pfeffer Israel's fundamentalist horizon at Ynet, Aug.31, 2012.

He wrote the first Italian instructional book on flatpicking. His flatpicking style is similar to Doc Watson's and Moravian folk music. This style is characterized by flashy licks, intricate cross-picking patterns, open tunings, and fluid slides up and down the neck of the guitar.Pattison, Kermit B., p. 68. Although Beppe lives in Genoa, he travels throughout North America every year. He has performed in the Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas, MerleFest in North Carolina, the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas and festivals in Winnipeg and Edmonton. He has appeared on the radio programs All Things Considered and eTown. Beppe has performed with David Grisman, Gene Parsons, Doc Watson, Norman Blake and the band Men of Steel, which comprises Dan Crary, Tony McManus, and Don Ross. He toured with banjo player Tony Trischka and released the accompanying live album Alone and Together. In 2015, Gambetta embarked on a brief tour with cellist Rushad Eggleston.

It was first published in 2008 and is about a Norwegian American family and their troubles. The novel is partly autobiographical in that Hustvedt herself is of Norwegian descent and in that passages from her own deceased father's journal about the Depression in America and the Pacific theatre of war during World War II are scattered through the book.Cf. the \\"Acknowledgments\\" at the end of the novel. The Sorrows of an American operates on several time levels and depicts the difficult times of four generations of the fictional Davidsen family. At the core of the novel lies a long-kept family secret which the first person narrator, a middle-aged psychiatrist called Erik Davidsen who lives and works in New York, sets out to unearth together with his sister. However, the novel abounds in subplots which focus on the present rather than the past. Plot summary On the death of their father Lars, a retired Professor of History, Erik Davidsen and his sister Inga, a philosopher, clean out his home office in rural Minnesota and, while going through his copious papers, find a cryptic note written and signed by someone they do not know called Lisa which suggests to them that as a boy back in the 1930s their father was involved in some illicit act and that he has kept his promise never to tell anyone about it. The siblings decide to investigate the matter further, if only half-heartedly at first. For the time being, Erik Davidsen is preoccupied reading his father's journals, which the latter completed only shortly before his demise. For Erik, all this will mean that in the months to come he will not only be haunted by the ghosts of the present but also of the past. It has been pointed out that none of the characters in The Sorrows of an American leads a carefree, untroubled existence.Susan Salter Reynolds: \\"The Sorrows of an American by Siri Hustvedt\\", The Los Angeles Times (April 6, 2008).Margot Kaminski: \\"Review: Hustvedt's Sorrows\\", The San Francisco Chronicle (April 10, 2008) E-5. The narrator himself suffers from a slight form of depression triggered by his recent divorce, childless state, and subsequent feeling of loneliness but still finds satisfaction in attempting to cure his patients of the complaints he occasionally recognizes in himself. His sister Inga has had absence seizures from childhood and migraines all her adult life. What is more, when the novel opens she is being harassed by a female journalist who states her intention to publicize hitherto unknown facts about Inga's deceased husband, a cult author and filmmaker, and who demands that she be co-operative without telling her what exactly she is aiming at or planning to do. Inga's 18-year-old daughter Sonia suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder, having witnessed, from the windows of her Manhattan school, the September 11, 2001 attacks and the collapse of the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Lars Davidsen, the long-term patriarch of the family, was a fugueur. But also the characters outside the family show neurological symptoms. Whereas the journalist who is harassing Inga only bears an age-old personal grudge against her (of which the latter is unaware) and is out for straightforward revenge, Erik's friend and colleague Bernard Burton, apart from sweating excessively, has not been able to cope with the fact that Inga is not in love with him and, without her realizing it, has kept a watchful eye on her over the years in a way which might be construed as stalking. Edie Bly, a former actress who is now impoverished, is a recovering substance abuser who has an illegitimate son by Inga's deceased husband and appears to be in an unstable psychological condition. Finally, the real stalker in the novel, a photographer and installation artist called Jeffrey Lane, displays various signs of compulsive behaviour, for example the urge to document virtually everything in his life by taking photos. He crosses the psychiatrist's path while pursuing his former girlfriend, a Jamaican-born beauty who has recently rented, and moved into, the downstairs apartment of Erik's now too large Brooklyn brownstone. Erik Davidsen is immediately drawn towards Miranda, the young woman from Jamaica, and Eglantine, her pre-school daughter by Jeffrey Lane. He soon falls head over heels in love with the dark-skinned woman while at the same time watching what he perceives to be the slow but steady deterioration of his own self. Gently rejected by Miranda, he has enough willpower left to go on a date with a sexy colleague and, for purely physical reasons, starts an affair with her. As the story progresses, however, he is more and more pulled into the quagmire of events surrounding Miranda, Inga, and himself. At one point he catches a burglar in his empty house at night, is surprised to see it is Lane, confused when the escaping Lane takes a photo of him wearing nothing much but wielding a hammer, and shocked when, months later, he recognizes the image at one of Lane's exhibitions with a caption saying, Head Doctor Goes Insane. Most of the mysteries are cleared up in the end. Erik and Inga succeed in tracking down the mysterious -- and now dying -- Lisa, and it turns out that all those years ago a young Lars Davidsen helped her bury her illegitimate, stillborn child, in all secrecy, somewhere on his family's farm. The reputation of Inga's deceased husband is not smeared either when the existence of a batch of letters to Edie Bly can be established without doubt but when it turns out at the same time that they have no sensational value because they belong to the realm of fiction--they are addressed to the character Bly played in one of the author's films rather than Bly the actress and mother of his child. Bernard Burton proves instrumental in procuring the letters without succumbing to the temptation to actually read them, in a chivalric act in which he dresses up as a frightful bag lady in order not to reveal his identity, a scene which also provides some comic relief. The conclusion of the novel is a four-page stream- of-consciousness-like recapitulation of the story's images racing through Erik's mind, and the assurance that the characters' fragmented lives will remain that way. Reviews The Sorrows of an American was published to almost unanimously positive reviews.Hustvedt claims that she does not read reviews or profiles: \\"It's not the mean things, it's the things which wind up casually wrong.\\" Cf. John Freeman: \\"Life in the Public Eye\\", The Denver Post (April 25, 2008). Ron Charles calls it \\"a radically postmodern novel that wears its po-mo credentials with unusual grace; even at its strangest moments, it never radiates the chilly alienation that marks, say, the work of Hustvedt's husband, Paul Auster.\\" Ron Charles: \\"Whose Life Is It Anyway? A Family Revelation Sparks a Psychiatrist's Identity Crisis\\", The Washington Post (April 6, 2008) BW07. For Sylvia Brownrigg, \\"the erudite Hustvedt\\" explores \\"larger questions of art and madness, mind and spirit, and the construction of the self\\" Sylvia Brownrigg: \\"What Used to Be\\", The New York Times (April 6, 2008). through the dialogues of her intellectually minded characters and the interior monologues of her narrator. True, little use is made of the vernacular, which prompts Haley Edwards to state that \\"Hustvedt writes very well, but her prose has all the flair of your Aunt Olga's dinner rolls. Sometimes Erik says things about the human condition that are wonderfully perceptive and incredibly poignant, but he seems to say them as if he's observing the human condition, rather than experiencing it himself.\\" Haley Edwards: \\"Among the \\"Sorrows\\" and Secrets, Much Insight But Little Heartfelt Emotion\\", The Seattle Times. What some critics found disappointing is that \\"the secrets Inga and Erik pursue don't yield the drama or meaning they have hoped for, suffusing the scenes of revelation with an air of anticlimax. This may be intentional--Hustvedt may be warning us of the folly of hoping for neat resolutions in our explorations of past pains--but it means the narrative slackens somewhat toward the end.\\" Sylvia Brownrigg: \\"What Used to Be\\".

Howard. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1937 by Herbert Jenkins. The first United States edition was published by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in 1966. The stories continue on from each other, like chapters in a book. Overview The stories are humorously written as if told by Breckinridge Elkins, a hillbilly with no schooling. He and his kin live in the Humboldts in Nevada. Elkins is six feet six inches tall, is as strong as a grizzly bear, and he can be just as bad tempered if riled. And there is a lot to rile him, especially his relatives. Though a dead shot, he prefers to use his fists, feet, teeth, etc. In numerous fights he attacks whole groups of armed men and commits mayhem. No one actually dies but limbs are broken, jaws shattered, faces are trod on, skulls fractured, ribs broken, and so on. Even buildings do not always survive such an attack. He picks up many injuries himself, but being shot, getting many cuts with Bowie knives, head bashed with numerous objects, having his ear chewed, scratched up by a mountain lion he then threw into a room full of feuding men and such are just minor nuisances to him. He previously rode an old mule called Alexander, the only animal that could carry him till he came across Cap'n Kidd, his equine equivalent, and tamed him. Elkins is the only man tough enough to ride the giant, pugnacious horse. Glory McGraw (a local girl) is his sometimes love interest but he is often too dumb to see it.

History  The Slovene Society was founded upon the proposal of several Slovene patriotic associations and individuals from Maribor, who urged the establishment of an institution that would publish advanced scholarly literature in Slovene, foster the expansion of culture among Slovenes, and development of scientific terminology in Slovene. In 1864, the consortium Slovenska matica was founded in Ljubljana. Its work was based on the examples of similar institutions in other Slavic countries, such as the Matica hrvatska in Croatia, Matica srpska in Vojvodina, Matice ƒçesk√° in the Czech Lands, and Matica slovensk√° in Slovakia. The consortium was established with private capital, as well as with capital of the Duchy of Carniola and several cultural associations. The Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I also gave a substantial financial contribution for its founding. The institution reached its peak at the beginning of the 20th century. At that time, it functioned as a regular publishing house on a free market, publishing books for a general public, many of which became bestsellers; at the same time, it also performed the role of an Academy of Sciences, fostering high culture and maintaining close contacts with the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Belgrade, as well as similar institutions in Prague, Krakow, London and Sankt Peterburg. During World War I, the SM was closed and its properties confiscated by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. The alleged cause was the publication of the book Gospodin Franjo (\\"Mister Franjo\\") by the Slovene author and officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army Fran Maselj Podlimbarski, which was a strong satirical critique of the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Slovene Society expanded its publishing work and in 1938 it was one of the co- founders of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. During the Italian occupation in World War II, the leadership of the Slovene Society collaborated with the Liberation Front of the Slovene People. In 1944, it was shut down by the Nazi German authorities. In the late 1945, the communist authorities of the People's Republic of Slovenia allowed the society to be re-established, although its editorial policies were considered \\"too conservative\\" by the new regime. Most of its properties were nationalized by the state, but the institution was allowed to continue functioning and later received substantial subsidies. The work of the institution was reinvigorated again in the 1980s, when it started systemically publishing translations of major Western philosophers and political theorists, including authors regarded as subversive of the official Socialist ideology, such as Heidegger, Machiavelli, Jan Patoƒçka, Unamuno, Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Aurelius Augustinus, and the complete works of Nietzsche.  Chairmen  Since its establishment, the Slovene Society has been headed by important figures from Slovene cultural and public life. * 1865: Anton Zois, politician and philanthropist * 1865‚Äì1869: Lovro Toman, lawyer, author and politician * 1869‚Äì1875: Etbin Henrik Costa, lawyer and politician * 1875‚Äì1881: Janez Bleiweis, politician * 1881‚Äì1882: Josip Marn, literary historian * 1882‚Äì1885: Peter Grasselli, politician, mayor of Ljubljana * 1885‚Äì1886: Josip Poklukar, editor * 1886‚Äì1893: Josip Marn * 1893‚Äì1907: Fran Levec, literary historian * 1907‚Äì1914: Fran Ile≈°iƒç, literary historian * 1917: Peter Grasselli * 1918‚Äì1920: Ivan Tavƒçar, author and politician, mayor of Ljubljana * 1920‚Äì1947: Dragotin Lonƒçar, historian and political theorist * 1947‚Äì1949: Oton ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç, poet * 1950‚Äì1966: Anton Melik, geographer * 1966‚Äì1975: France Koblar, art historian * 1975‚Äì1978: Fran Zwitter, historian * 1978‚Äì1987: Bogo Grafenauer, historian * 1987‚Äì1994: Primo≈æ Simoniti, classical philologist, historian and translator * 1994‚Äì2008: Jo≈æa Mahniƒç, literary historian * since 2008: Milƒçek Komelj, art historian and critic  Editors and chancellors  Many prominent individuals served as editors and chancellors (chief secretaries) of the institution.

Establishment Sheffield Town Council was constituted in 1843. While the town had one of the less restrictive electoral franchises, only ratepayers of three years standing were permitted to vote. Tenants of cottages, including many workers in the city, typically paid their rates indirectly through their landlords and were therefore not permitted to vote. This set-up had been unproblematic until the Council was founded, but was now of concern, as the registered voters were generally the wealthier residents. In 1843, only 5,584 people were registered to vote, and this had risen to 8,000 in 1845.Clyde Binfield et al., The History of the City of Sheffield 1843 - 1993: Volume I: Politics In 1846, a committee of Chartists in the city met to discuss the problem of voter registration. They decided to focus their campaign for registration by putting up two candidates in the November elections: Thomas Briggs, a farmer, in Brightside in the annual election, and Isaac Ironside, an accountant and former support of Robert Owen, in Ecclesall in a by-election held soon afterwards. Briggs was easily elected, while Ironside won narrowly on a record turnout: 397 votes to 317 for his Liberal rival. Voter registration was also up, reaching 11,500 people. The Liberals dominated the council, and portrayed the Chartists as socialists, and Ironside as a demagogue. The Liberal press in the shape of the Sheffield Independent was initially supportive, but as the group gain success, became increasingly hostile. In 1847, Ironside was re- elected in Ecclesall, along with another Chartist councillor. Other Chartists were elected in Brightside, St George's, St Philip's and Nether Hallam wards, and by the end of the year they formed a group of nine councillors. In addition, Richard Otley was elected in Ecclesall, but was unseated because he failed to meet the property qualification. This required councillors to have resources worth ¬£1,000 or to occupy property with a rental value above ¬£30 a year. As a result, the Chartist councillors were mostly shopkeepers and craftsmen, with a couple of surgeons and a farmer. This was not representative of their electorate. The Chartists joined a campaign against Wilson Overend, a local magistrate accused of anti-trade union bias, and later in the year, initiated a campaign in support of former police constable George Bakewell who had been banished from the town by his superintendent after being accused of stealing a pair of trousers. This campaign was supported by Liberal members of the Watch Committee, annoyed that they had not been consulted.David A. Reeder et al., Cities of Ideas: Civil Society and Urban Governance in Britain 1800-2000 Policies and organisation Chartist candidates had to give their broad support to Chartist goals, and in particular had to support universal male suffrage. The group was lightly whipped, a situation much criticised by the Sheffield Independent. Its main planks of policy were opposition to high civic salaries, and opposition to the Sheffield City Police, criticising its organisation and calling for a lower police rate. This was supported by the group's efficient administration of the Ecclesall board of highway surveyors. In 1848, the Chartists won four of the six wards they contested, and by the end of the year had fifteen councillors. This rose to 22 the following year. They still opted not to run in the Park ward as they lacked registered supporters, but as the voter registration drive gained successes, in 1851 they came a close second to the Liberal, and in 1852 the Liberal association decided to avoid a repeat by adopting the Democrat candidate as official. By this time, Ironside had become recognised as the leader of the group, and had persuaded the council to set up a health committee and to set up a model farm at Hollow Meadows.\\"Ironside, Isaac\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The Chartists set up ward committees which met regularly and were responsible for selecting candidates, canvassing for them and for encouraging supporters to vote. These committees, known as \\"wardmotes\\" and open to all \\"burghers\\" (loosely defined as the skilled working classes), were inspired by Joshua Toulmin Smith's ideas. In 1851, Ironside formalised the network by launching the Sheffield Free Press as a party newspaper, followed by the Central Democratic Ward Association to co-ordinate the ward committees and decide borough-wide strategy. The Liberals largely failed to imitate these structures. The Association allowed the wardmotes to select any candidate they chose, and while many were active Democrats, other radicals and independent Chartists were sometimes elected on to their slate. Ironside also saw the wardmotes as a venue for the resolution of local grievances. For example, they took up complaints against pollution and inadequate street maintenance, and even petty crimes. On one occasion, Ironside found five youths disturbing the peace and a wardmote passed a resolution calling for their parents to bring them before the body. When one youth attended the next meeting, he was reprimanded, while the body pressed for summons for the others. Members of the police force and other relevant bodies were also free to attend the wardmotes to justify their actions, and the Democrats were not universally critical of their actions. By the 1840s, there was a general consensus in the city that a new Act of Parliament was needed to replace the Sheffield Improvement Act 1818. The council opposed the Public Health Act 1848 as centralising, adding expense and placing local boards under central governmental rather than local democratic control. The Chartists also opposed the additional property qualifications it introduced for voters and members of local boards, noting this would disenfranchise many of their supporters. In 1851, Ironside seconded a council motion to call a public meeting to decide whether a local bill should be applied for that year. The meeting was little-attended, but supported the proposal. The bill claimed for Sheffield a wide range of powers, which would include the absorption of the Church Burgesses and the Town Trustees. These two measures were later dropped in order to minimise Parliamentary opposition. A public meeting was held in December and was dominated by Chartists. They opposed it on the grounds that it did not introduce a universal male franchise for the council, and that it would for the first time impose rates on housing with a rateable value of ¬£7 or less per year. The meeting rejected the bill. Ironside also moved to oppose it, but his change in position alienated both colleagues in favour of it and members who had opposed it from the start. Later activities By 1852, the group was sufficiently successful that six of their candidates were elected without opposition, and a further four in contests, giving the group a total of twenty-six councillors. However, not all councillors stuck to the party line, and as a result, a non-Democrat Mayor of Sheffield was elected. During the 1850s, the Democrats were easily the main opposition on the council. Under their influence, from 1854 to 1857, the council annually voted a petition for parliamentary reform, and also petitioned the monarch on taxation, the Poor Law and county administration. Ironside was the chair of the city's Highways Board from 1852 to 1854, and led a campaign of street paving and laying deep sewers. Ironside attempted to get Toulmin Smith to stand for the Parliamentary seat of Sheffield at the 1852 general election, but Smith refused. Ironside also became a shareholder in the Sheffield Consumers Gas Company, which engaged in a rivalry with the established Sheffield Gas-Light Company. Disputes over these actions led some former allies to turn against him. In 1853, two former allies organised a campaign against Ironside, and he lost his seat in Ecclesall. He subsequently took a seat in St George's, but in 1854, only two of the nine Democrat candidates were successful, and Ironside again lost his seat. The Democrats lost influence on the council, but remained influential on the highway and vestry boards. In 1858, they opposed a new bill, sponsored by George Calvert Holland, essentially a more limited version of the 1851 proposal. Ironside's support for former diplomat David Urquhart lost him further support, and by the 1860s, the group was defunct.

Technical characteristics Marques del Duero was a first-class gunboat, or \\"aviso\\", built by La Seyne in France. She was laid down on 20 January 1875, launched on 3 May 1875,The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Marques del Duero and completed the same year. She was designed to fight against the Carlists in the Mediterranean and the Bay of Biscay during the Third Carlist War, patrolling off Carlist ports to intercept contraband and blockade the ports, and also providing despatch services between Spanish Navy forces operating off various ports, hence her Spanish designation of aviso, meaning \\"warning.\\" She had an iron hull with a very prominent ram bow, was coal-fired, was rigged as a schooner, and could carry 89 tons of coal.Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 386 She was reclassified as a third-class gunboat in 1895. Operational history The Spanish took delivery of Marques del Duero from her French builders at Marseilles, France. She set out on her first operational deployment from Marseilles on 27 July 1875, heading for San Sebasti√°n Bay in northern Spain for blockade, patrol, and despatch duty. She served there beyond the end of the Third Carlist War on 27 February 1876, finally leaving after Spanish naval forces there began to leave for postwar duties after 5 April 1876. On 29 July 1876, Marques del Duero departed Spain for the Philippines, where she was based at Zamboanga, assigned to the South Division of the Asiatic Squadron. On 24 July 1880, Marques del Duero left Philippine waters for courtesy visits to the kings of Siam and Annam at Saigon and Singapore. On 27 September 1895, Marques del Duero captured several pirate launches manned by Moros in Borneo. She later attacked a group of Moro and Tagalog pirates, killing 18 and wounding 30. Marques del Duero was the oldest member of Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo de Pasaron's Pacific Squadron at Manila in the Philippine Islands when the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out in April 1898. She was anchored with the squadron in Ca√±acao Bay under the lee of the Cavite Peninsula east of Sangley Point, Luzon, eight miles southwest of Manila, when, early on the morning of 1 May 1898, the United States Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey, found Montojo's anchorage and attacked.Nofi, p. 17 In the resulting Battle of Manila Bay, the first major engagement of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Marques del Duero took one , one , and about three other shell hits, which wrecked her bow gun, a side gun, and an engine. Her crew scuttled her in shallow water; part of her upper works remained above water, and a boarding crew from the gunboat went aboard and set these on fire at the end of battle. After the war, a U.S. Navy salvage team raised and repaired Marques del Duero. She served briefly in the U.S. Navy as USS P-17, but was decommissioned and scrapped in 1900.

Background Oligonucleotide probes of microarrays that are sequence identical may have different identifiers between manufacturers and even between different versions of the same company's microarray; and sometimes the same identifier is reused and represents a completely different oligonucleotide, resulting in ambiguity and potentially mis-identification of the genes hybridizing to that probe. This also makes data interpretation and integration of different batches of data difficult. nuID was designed to solve these problems. It is a unique, non-degenerate encoding scheme that can be used as a universal representation to identify an oligonucleotide across manufacturers. The design of nuID was inspired by the fact that the raw sequence of the oligonucleotide is the true definition of identity for a probe, the encoding algorithm uniquely and non-degenerately transforms the sequence itself into a compact identifier (a lossless compression). In addition, a redundancy check (checksum) was added to validate the integrity of the identifier. These two steps, encoding plus checksum, result in an nuID, which is a unique, non- degenerate, permanent, robust and efficient representation of the probe sequence. For commercial applications that require the sequence identity to be confidential, encryption schema can also be added for nuID. The utility of nuIDs has been implemented for the annotation of Illumina microarrays, which can be downloaded from Bioconductor website . It also has universal applicability as a source-independent naming convention for oligomers. The nuID schema has three significant advantages over using the oligo sequence directly as an identifier: first it is more compact due to the base-64 encoding; second, it has a built-in error detection and self-identification; and third, it can be encrypted in cases where the sequences are preferred not to be disclosed. For more details, please refer to the nuID paper.

Education and awards Michael A. Arbuthnot received his bachelor's degree in Philosophy and minor in Anthropology from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1996. He holds a master's degree in Anthropology from Florida State University. He specialized in underwater archaeology and graduated magna cum laude. Arbuthnot is an active member in many professional organizations, including: the Registry of Professional Archaeologists (RPA); the Florida Archaeological Council (FAC); the Southeastern Archaeological Conference (SEAC); the Florida Anthropological Society (FAS); the American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS); and the St. Augustine Archaeological Association (SAAA). In addition to being the author of many published articles and papers, Arbuthnot is considered an authority on submerged prehistoric sites. He focused his thesis on paleo-environmental change and the impact it has on archaeological sites in the Gulf of Mexico. Arbuthnot's research has been presented at many conferences, including the Society for American Archaeology, the Northeast Florida Symposium on Underwater Archaeology, the annual meeting of the Florida Anthropological Society, and the Southeastern Archaeological Conference. The results of his research in the Caribbean are now exhibited at the George Town Museum on Grand Cayman Island. Titanic Michael Arbuthnot is currently a faculty member at Flagler College, located in historic downtown St. Augustine, Florida. There, he teaches his students about the fascinating world of archaeology, which included a field expedition to the RMS Titanic. He hopes to set aside the boring impression people have of archaeology, saying, ‚ÄúPeople have this idea of archaeologists sitting there with a brush and a toothpick, but it can be exciting.‚ÄùMichael Arbuthnot: Archaeologist and Adjunct Instructor. Arbuthnot's trip to the Titanic took him 12,600 feet below the ocean's surface. James Cameron, the producer, writer, and director of the movie ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù recruited Arbuthnot in 2005 to work on the first systematic archeological survey of Titanic's internal bow structure. Findings from this survey were shown in the Discovery Channel special ‚ÄúLast Mysteries of the Titanic‚Äù and will exhibited as part of the Titanic Legacy Database Project presently in development with the non-profit digital historic preservation organization, CyArk. Team Atlantis Arbuthnot founded Team Atlantis Productions in 1996. The name, of course, is a play on the mythical underwater city of Atlantis. Arbuthnot defines Team Atlantis, saying, ‚ÄúTA is a multi- disciplinary outfit whose mission is to explore archeological mysteries with an emphasis on those enigmas associated with underwater contexts.‚ÄùArbuthnot, Michael. Ed. Preston Peet. Underground! The Disinformation Guide to Ancient Civilizations, Astonishing Archaeology and Hidden History. The Disinformation Company, 2005. (302). Because underwater archeological sites usually have some connection with sites on land, Team Atlantis is not restricted to only underwater locations. Team Atlantis has explored and surveyed many sites around the world,Underwater Adventures. including: * Egypt (1996): Here, Arbuthnot and his team traveled extensively along the Giza Plateau. Arbuthnot developed his Orion Pyramid Theory while in Egypt. * Grand Cayman Island, Caribbean (1997): Arbuthnot participated in the mapping of the remains of the Geneva Kathleen, a schooner that sank in 1930. * Yonaguni, Japan (1998): In Japan, Arbuthnot organized an expedition that examined the Yonaguni Monument and created a film documentary of the experience. * Cat Island, Bahamas (2000): Team Atlantis journeyed to the Bahamas to explore the possibility of ancient shorelines submerged in the shallow water of the Great Bahama Bank. * The Gulf of Mexico (2000): Arbuthnot and other members of Florida State University's Program in Underwater Archaeology excavated submerged prehistoric sites and shipwrecks under the direction of Dr. Michael Faught. * Yucat√°n, Mexico (2000): Team Atlantis explored Mayan ruins at Tulum and Chichen Itza and digitally documented their trip. * La Jolla in San Diego, California (2005): Underwater artifacts were first discovered here in the early 1900s. Team Atlantis decided to make a trip to California to investigate. The team discovered a total of six artifacts, including a stone bowl, dated 4000 to 7000 years ago. This contributes to the already over 2000 artifacts recovered in this area of at least 34 submerged sites. More about La Jolla Team Atlantis Productions plan to open the eyes of the public to archaeological mysteries off the coast of San Diego through their show, ‚ÄúLa Jolla‚Äôs Sunken City.‚Äù Michael Arbuthnot, the Writer/Producer of the show, paired with Director/Editor David Faires, to take underwater cinematography to new depths. ‚ÄúNot only is Mike Arbuthnot the Writer/Producer, but he is rapidly becoming one of the most recognizable archaeologists in the United States. As a young professional archaeologist and former college professor, Arbuthnot has been featured on ABC, Discovery Channel and the Learning Channel. Most recently Arbuthnot conducted the first archaeological survey of the famous shipwreck R.M.S. Titanic with film maker and explorer James Cameron on Discovery Channel‚Äôs televised event, Last Mysteries of the Titanic. He continues to excite audiences and historians alike by blending ancient history and archaeology with filmmaking.‚ÄùMysterious Adventures of La Jolla‚Äôs Sunken City. As stated previously, artifacts were first found in the early 1900s. Children would return to the shore from playing in the shallow water with small stone bowls. Scuba diving became increasingly popular in the 1950s, leading to more exploring around La Jolla. Due to this exploration, more than 2000 artifacts have been recovered. Some date to more than 5000 years ago. At least 34 submerged sites have been discovered in places as deep as 30 meters. Some scientists believe that La Jolla is an entire sunken village. In ‚ÄúLa Jolla‚Äôs Sunken City,‚Äù Arbuthnot and Faires explore several hypotheses concerning how these objects were originally deposited, and they reveal never before seen artifacts. Arbuthnot had trouble at the beginning of the expedition, but was eventually successful in finding artifacts at La Jolla. According to the CineForm article on La Jolla: Their success was aided by the help of a small octopus. A diver was tracking it, when the octopus stopped behind a round stone. This ‚Äòstone‚Äô turned out to be a beautiful stone bowl, which eventually led the team to discovering a total of six artifacts in 20 feet of water. Arbuthnot speculates that these ancient finds date to between 4,000 and 7,000 years ago! Currently Arbuthnot has worked on underwater archaeology projects in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and the Caribbean since 1997. He has surveyed, mapped, excavated, interpreted and analyzed artifacts, and published reports on a variety of diverse archaeological sites. He continues his work, based mainly in Florida. He also functions as Newsletter Editor for the Florida Archaeological Council. Arbuthnot presently serves as a Senior Project Manager for SEARCH, a leading cultural resource company based in Florida.SEARCH Staff. Arbuthnot is working with the Discovery Channel to create the television show \\"America's Lost Vikings\\", about the location of the mythical Viking Vinland, and where they may have settled along Canada and the United States.

She was reportedly one of Juan Gabriel's muses. Bell was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1938. In the mid-1950s, she was barely in her teens when she won a talent contest held at Radio Mineria in Santiago and became a regular at the station's live broadcasts. Her voice caught the attention of band leader Roberto Inglez who, in 1956, hired her as a vocalist for his group and took her on a three-week gig at New York's Waldorf Astoria. They went over so well that the band and its brand new singer stayed for a year. Next they toured Europe and in Madrid Monna had such a phenomenal reception that she decided to go solo becoming a big sensation at the Pasapoga, the city's most fashionable night club. In 1959 she performed a jazzy novelty tune titled \\"Un Telegrama\\" at the First Benidorm International Song Festival. The song won all the top awards and became an international major hit when Monna recorded it for the Hispavox label. It was the first of many hits that made her a recording sensation both in Europe and Latin America. She toured the world and decided to settle down in Mexico where she branched out into films and married cinematographer Alex Phillips Jr. It was not an enduring marriage but it produced daughter Jennifer and son Alex III who is currently a rock musician. In the late 1960s she continued recording highly successful albums for the Musart label and did a lot of television work in Mexico and abroad. In the 1970s she signed with Orfeon and her recordings began suffering due to mediocre material and backing, however she continued touring on the strength of her old hits. By the 1980s her career was over and she decided to retire. Singer-composer Juan Gabriel tried to remedy the situation by writing and producing Monna Bell Ahora, an album released in 1993 by Sony which went nowhere. Monna went back to retirement and in the 2000s moved next to her daughter in Tijuana, Baja California. Diehard fans kept waiting for a successful return but their hopes where crushed when the singer died of cardiac arrest after a successful colon cancer surgery on April 21, 2008. After her death many of her old recordings were released in CD format and are the best witness of Monna Bell's greatness as one of the most creative Latin singers in history. Pedro Almod√≥var used one of Bell's songs, \\"Estaba Escrito\\", in his 1980 film, Pepi, Luci, Bom and Other Girls on the Heap (Pepi, Luci, Bom Y Otras Chicas Del Monton). Death Monna Bell died of a stroke on April 21, 2008, in Tijuana, Mexico, at the age of 70.

History HMS Cerberus was a frigate of the Royal Navy built in 1758 and carrying 28 guns. HMS Lark, also a frigate, was built in 1762 and carried 32 guns. Cerberus had been stationed off Rhode Island as part of a blockade of its ports since April 1776, and was joined by Lark in February 1777. Upon the arrival of a large French fleet off Narragansett Bay in late July 1778, the two ships were among the twenty British vessels in the bay which were then tasked to defend British-occupied Newport. Stationed in the northern stretch of the East Passage (separating Aquidneck and Conanicut Islands), the two ships were ordered to Newport, with instructions to not surrender to the enemy. While en route to Newport on August 5, the two ships were sighted by French ships of the line. On 8, the 64-gun Fantasque and the frigates Aimable, Chim√®re and Engageante, under Pierre Andr√© de Suffren, entered the Bay.Cunat, p.37 Rather than engage on a lopsided battle that would have ended in their surrender, the two captains decided to scuttle their ships. Captain Symonds ran Cerberus aground, put the crew ashore, and set fire to the ship, while Captain White did the same with Lark. Two other British frigates, Orpheus and Juno, suffered the same fate. When Larks gunpowder magazine was reached by the flames, it exploded, sending debris flying for miles around. The wrecks of all four ships lay essentially undisturbed until the 1970s, when an archaeological team located portions of Lark, Cerberus, and Orpheus. As of 2008, the full extent of the wreck sites has not been established, and only fragmentary evidence of the ships has been recovered. The site of the wrecks of Cerberus and Lark was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

They also were the first to record it, in 1938. That recording is remarkable for its unusual duet feature: Haggart whistles the melody and plays the bass, while only Bauduc accompanies him on the drums. Halfway through the solo, Bauduc starts drumming on the strings of the double bass, while Haggart continues to play with his left hand, creating a percussive bass solo. The original version was just bass and drums but many other arrangements have been performed including one by the Bob Crosby big band with the band's vocal group. After the success of the initial recording, Haggart and Bauduc performed the song frequently for the rest of their careers, including in several films, most notably in 1941's Let's Make Music and 1943's Reveille with Beverly. The original recording was featured on the soundtrack of Raging Bull. Nick Nolte and Debra Winger danced to a version credited to Bob Crosby and the Bobcats in the 1982 film Cannery Row. Composition The song was a spontaneous composition, created at the Blackhawk in Chicago in 1938. When some of the band were late getting back from a break, Haggart and Bauduc started free improvising while they waited and \\"Big Noise\\" was the result. It was a joint composition, later formalized by arranger Haggart. Later, lyrics were written by Gil Rodin and Bob Crosby.

Rational consumers will continue to search for a better product or service until the marginal cost of searching exceeds the marginal benefit. Search theory is a branch of microeconomics that studies decisions of this type. The costs of searching are divided into external and internal costs . External costs include the monetary costs of acquiring the information, and the opportunity cost of the time taken up in searching. External costs are not under the consumer's control, and all he or she can do is choose whether or not to incur them. Internal costs include the mental effort given over to undertaking the search, sorting the incoming information, and integrating it with what the consumer already knows. Internal costs are determined by the consumer's ability to undertake the search, and this in turn depends on intelligence, prior knowledge, education and training. These internal costs are the background to the study of bounded rationality. The Internet was expected to eliminate search costs . For example, electronic commerce was predicted to cause disintermediation as search costs become low enough for end-consumers to incur them directly instead of employing retailers to do this for them. This would in turn lead to lower prices and less variation between prices quoted by different sellers.

Alma was the third tropical cyclone, first named storm, and first hurricane for the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. It is believed by meteorologists that the storm originated out of an Atlantic tropical wave which crossed Central America in the middle of June. In warmer than average waters of the open Pacific, it gradually organized and it was first designated as a tropical depression on June 20 before quickly intensifying to a tropical storm. Early on June 22 the storm was upgraded to a hurricane and subsequently reached peak intensity of 969 mb, a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Alma made landfall on Mexico's shoreline, but it soon moved back out over water and began to weaken. Alma had severe impact in Mexico. Twenty deaths were reported. Damage is unknown. Meteorological history The origins of Alma is believed to be related to the tropical wave which spawned Tropical Storm Arthur in the Atlantic. Satellite imagery and upper-air observations indicated that the disturbance crossed Central America during the middle of June, entering warming than average waters of the Pacific. Initially, the system was located within a sheared environment, although it did not hinder development. The convection soon became aligned with the low-level center and during the overnight on June 20 it was designated as a tropical depression. The depression intensified and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alma later that day. The wind shear relaxed it was upgraded to a hurricane at early on July 22 while tracking generally northwest. A mid-level trough located near Baja California and a mid- to-upper-level low over the southwest Gulf of Mexico began to steer Alma northward towards the southwest coast of Mexico, prior to reaching a peak intensity of 969 mb at 1200 UTC on June 23. Before long, the steering flow collapsed and the hurricane drifted further towards land. Later that day it made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas, although Alma quickly moved back over open water and meandered for about 36 hours. This made the hurricane the first of three consecutive storms to make landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten-day span. It weakened to a tropical storm over land, before moving back to the open waters. However, a small portion of the circulation of Alma was still over land, and thus it was severely disrupted by Mexico's high terrain. Alma was tracking slowly along a path roughly parallel to the coastline, it was further downgraded to a tropical depression on June 25. Alma remained weak and dissipated on June 27. Alma was forecasted well, with errors well below long-term averages at the time. Despite this, tropical cyclone prediction models were a mixture of accurate and inaccurate, with the Aviation and GFDL models performing badly and the OFCI model performing well. The errors in dynamic models was attributed to a lack of data on upper-air conditions over the ocean southwest of the cyclone. Preparations and Impact In anticipation for the storm, hurricane warnings were placed into effect along of coastline between the resorts of Zihuatenejo and Manzanillo. Hundreds of people were evacuated prior to the passage of the hurricane. Also, the Mexican government sent troops to the area to help with disaster relief, and the Michoac√°n state government sent five truckloads of bedding and medicines. Prior to landfall, 14 inches of rain was expected. In the Mexican states of Guerrero and Michoac√°n, the hurricane generated estimated wind gusts of up to , and dropped large amounts of rainfall peaking at of rainfall just east of where it had made landfall. Also, there were reports of swells up to along the coast. Three people died in Lazaro Cardenas when their house collapsed. Alma ripped roofs off of some houses, downed power lines and uprooted numerous trees, Flooding for Alma left thousands homeless. Heavy rainfall resulted in major flooding in Puebla, which killed 17 people. In all, 20 deaths were reported in Mexico. Damage is unknown, since the official report has no damage figures.

The Roneat Thung or Roneat Thum () is a low-pitched xylophone used in the Khmer classical music of Cambodia. It is built in the shape of a curved, rectangular shaped boat. This instrument plays an important part in the Pinpeat ensemble. The roneat Thung is placed on the left of the roneat ek, a higher-pitched xylophone. The Roneat Thung is analogous to the ranat thum of Thai.  Etymology  Roneat means xylophone where thung literally mean [wooden] container in Khmer.Chhounnath' dictionary. \\"roneat, thung\\" This may derived from the shape of this type of xylophone which shaped like a rectangular wooden container. Terry E. Miller and Sean Williams in their book The Garland Handbook of Southest Asian Music, Roneat Thung is better called Roneat thomm/ thum which literally means \\"large xylophone\\". This name may designates the fact that roneat thum's resonator and note bars are larger and longer than those of roneat ek.  History  Roneat Thung, the sister musical instrument of Roneat Ek was already established itself as the member of the Pinpeat orchestra since before Angkor period.Traditional Musical Instruments of Cambodia. UNESCO Digital Library. Retrieved from: https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000135257 According to other source, Cambodian Roneat genres were derived from the Javanese gamelan musical instruments which influenced the Khmer musical instrument in the early Angkorian period which spread from Kampuchea further northwest to Myanmar. Specifically, Roneat Thung is identical to the Indonesian and Malay gambang kayu. Throughout the history of Cambodian music, especially in the post- Angkorian period, Roneat thung usually appears in various mural paintings along with Roneat ek and always represent in the Pinpeat or Mahori orchestra.  Structure  Man playing a roneat thung (Cambodian xylophone), from a postcard by Pierre Dieulefils.The shape of Roneat Thung is thought to be modeled from river boat as Roneat Ek as well. Roneat thung's rectangular trough-resonator measures about 50 inches long supported by four short legs. While the end-pieces of the roneat aek and the roneat daek are flat and straight, the roneat thung end-pieces are curved slightly outward. The roneat thung has sixteen bamboo or wooden bars, measuring about 18.75 inches (low pitch) to 15.25 inches (high pitch) in length. The width of the bars (low and high) is approximately 2.5 inches and the thickness of both is about 0.75 inch. As the materials, which are used to make the bars, are the same as the roneat aek, the same tuning blobs are also utilized. Like the roneat aek, the roneat thung bars are suspended with two cords running through holes in each bar and placed on two hooks at each of the two curved end-pieces that are connected to the resonator. Only soft mallets are used to play the roneat thung, either indoor or outdoor. While the mallet handles of the roneat thungare about the same length as those of the roneat aek, their disc are larger and thicker. Each measure approximately 1.75 inches in diameter and about 1.5 inches in thickness. The range of the roneat thung overlaps that of the roneat aek, one octave lower. Due to its stylistic playing, the sixteen bars cover a range of music of over two octaves, a range that is wider than that of the roneat aek. The role assigned to the roneat thung is to counter the melody. The roneat thung plays a line almost identical to that of the korng thomm, except in a lak (vivacious, funny, comic) fashion.  Significance  Roneat Thung or Roneat Thum has significant function in Khmer traditional orchestra both Pinpeat and Mohaori. But the Roneat Thung used in Mahori has to have higher sound (one sound) than the Roneat Thung used in Pinpeat starting from the first bar note. According to Cambodian traditional musicians, Roneat Thung has the same representation as Roneat Ek. Roneat Ek represent female naga or dragon where Roneat Thung itself represent male naga in which both nagas has to be next to one another or pairing as accompanied in Khmer traditional orchestras.

The 179th is equipped with the General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon. History =World War II= Training in the United States P-39D as used by the group for training The squadron was first organized as the 393d Fighter Squadron at Hamilton Field, California, on 15 July 1943, as one of the original squadrons of the 367th Fighter Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 252‚Äì254Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 483 Several members of its initial cadre were former Flying Tigers with prior combat experience. It was not until late August, however, that the group received its first Bell P-39 Airacobra.Groh, p. 12 After building up its strength, the squadron moved in October to Santa Rosa Army Air Field, California. In December group headquarters and the squadron moved to Oakland Municipal Airport, while the other squadrons of the group were at other locations in northern California. The squadron moved temporarily to Tonopah Army Air Field, Nevada, where it performed dive bombing and gunnery training. Training accidents with the Bell P-39 Airacobra cost several pilots their lives. In January 1944, as it prepared for overseas movement, the 393d was beefed up with personnel from the 328th and 368th Fighter Groups.Chickering, p. 78 The squadron staged through Camp Shanks, and sailed for England aboard the .Groh, pp. 23‚Äì24 The \\"Drunken Duchess\\"Nicknamed for its unusual rolling motion in heavy weather. Groh, p. 23. docked at Greenock, Scotland on 3 April and the group was transported by train to its airfield at RAF Stoney Cross, England. P-38 transition and combat operations from England Lockheed P-38 Lightning of the 367th Fighter Group wearing D-Day invasion markings, June 1944. Having trained on single engine aircraft, the squadrons's pilots were surprised to find Lockheed P-38 Lightnings sitting on Stoney Cross's dispersal pads.Chickering, p. 79 Only members of the advance party had any experience flying the Lightning. These pilots had flown combat sorties with the 55th Fighter Group.Groh, p. 26 The change from single engine to twin engine aircraft required considerable retraining for both pilots and ground crew. Although some pilots entered combat with as little as eight hours of flying time on the P-38, in late April the squadron was reinforced by pilots who had trained on the Lightning in the States and were more experienced on the type.Groh, p. 31 However, the lack of instrument training in the P-38 took its toll on the 393d as weather, not enemy action, caused the loss of pilots and airplanes.Groh, pp. 50‚Äì51 On 9 May, the squadron flew its first combat mission, a fighter sweep over Alen√ßon.Groh. p. 32 For the remainer of the month, the unit flew fighter sweeps, bomber escort and dive bombing, missions and suffered its first combat losses.Groh. pp. 32‚Äì37 On D-Day and the next three days the squadron flew missions maintaining air cover over shipping carrying invasion troops. These missions continued for the next three days. The 393d and other P-38 units stationed in England were selected for these missions with the expectation that the distinctive silhouette of the Lightning would prevent potential friendly fire incidents by anti-aircraft gunners mistaking them for enemy fighters.Groh, p. 42 Shortly after the Normandy invasion, on 12 June, the 367th Group was selected to test the ability of the P-38 to carry a 2,000 lb bomb under each wing. The selected target was a railroad yard, and results were mixed.Groh, p. 43 However, on this mission, the squadron scored its first air-to-air victory when Lts James Pinkerton and James Mason teamed up to shoot down a Messerschmitt Me 410 flying near the assigned target. By mid June German ground forces had withdrawn to defend a perimeter around Cherbourg, a major port whose capture had become more important to the allies with the destruction of Mulberry A, one of the artificial harbors constructed near the Normandy beachhead. An attack by VII Corps on 22 June was to be preceded by low level bombing and strafing attack by IX Fighter Command. Briefed by intelligence to expect a \\"milk run\\" The 394th flew at low altitude through what turned out to be a heavily defended area. Within two to three minutes after beginning the attack the squadron lost five pilots. Seven group pilots were killed in action. Nearly all surviving aircraft received battle damage and the entire 367th Group was out of action for several days.Groh, p. 46 Ninth Air Force moved its medium bomber forces to bases closer to the Continent in July, so they would be able to strike targets near the expanding front in France. The 387th Bombardment Group was moved to Stoney Cross, forcing the 394th to vacate their station and move the short distance to RAF Ibsley.Groh, p. 52 From Ibsley the group struck railroads, marshaling yards, and trains to prevent enemy reinforcements from reaching the front during Operation Cobra, the Allied breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July 1944. =Operations on the European Continent= Starting on 19 July, the 367th Group's forward echelon crossed the English Channel to take up stations in Normandy.Groh, p. 59 Group headquarters shared Beuzeville Airfield with the 371st Fighter Group, while the 393d Squadron was at Cricqueville Airfield, advanced landing grounds made from pierced steel planking. After the breakout of ground forces in the Saint-L√¥ area, the squadron concentrated on close air support of General Patton's Third Army. In late August, the squadron attacked German Seventh Army convoys which, to prevent being surrounded, were withdrawing eastward from the Falaise pocket. Five convoys and 100 Tiger Tanks were destroyed on one day. On 22 August the group attacked three Luftwaffe airfields near Laon. The 392d Fighter Squadron dive bombed and destroyed two hangars on one airfield but were jumped by twelve Focke-Wulf Fw 190s as they completed their attack. Eighteen Messerschmitt Me 109s and Fw 190s engaged the 393d as it reformed from its dive bomb run. After bombing its target, the 394th Fighter Squadron turned to reinforce the 392d. The squadrons of the 367th Group claimed fourteen enemy aircraft in total against a loss of one Lightning. The 393d received a Distinguished Unit Citation when it returned to the Laon area three days later. That day, the 367th Group attacked Luftwaffe airfields at Clastres, P√©ronne and Rosi√®res-en-Haye through an intense flak barrage. The group then engaged more than thirty Focke-Wulf 190 fighters that had just taken off. Group claims were 25 enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and 17 damaged against the loss of 6 group aircraft.These claims were from an estimated 50 enemy aircraft engaged in the air and on the ground. Chickering, p. 79 Then, despite a low fuel supply, the unit strafed a train and convoy after leaving the scene of battle. Captain Larry Blumer of the 393d destroyed five enemy aircraft becoming an ace on one mission. In the afternoon the squadron conducted a long range fighter sweep of more than 800 miles to airfields in the Dijon-Bordeaux area.Groh, p. 72 As Allied forces moved forward across France the squadron began leap-frogging to new bases. In early September they relocated at Peray Airfield, but moved again a week later to Clastres Airfield. From Clastres The 393d supported Operation Market-Garden by escorting troop carrier aircraft and attacking flak positions. For its attacks that fall, the squadron was cited in the Order of the Day by the Belgium Army. In late October, as Ninth Air Force brought its medium bombers to bases in France, the 393d was bumped from its station for the second time by the 387th Bombardment Group, when it moved to Juvincourt Airfield, north of Reims.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 274 Juvincourt was a former Luftwaffe base with permanent facilities, in contrast to the advanced landing grounds where the squadron had been based since moving to France.Groh, pp. 98‚Äì99 The squadron attacked German strong points to aid the Allied push against the Siegfried Line throughout the fall of 1944. The German Ardennes Offensive occurred as the holidays approached. A planned move to a field in Belgium was canceled. During the Battle of the Bulge, the 394th, after escorting C-47s on a resupply drop to encircled troops at Bastogne, conducted an armed reconnaissance of the Trier area. The group was engaged by Fw 190s and a 40-minute air battle ensued in which the group claimed eight destroyed, two probably destroyed and nine damaged. Transition to the P-47 Thunderbolt The P-47D (44-33524) of the Group commander, Col. Chickering, in 1945 Early in 1945 a desire to standardize the fighter-bombers in Ninth Air Force, the squadron transitioned into Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. Pilots flew Lightings on combat missions while training at the same time with the Thunderbolt. The 393d was the first squadron of the 367th Group to fly a combat missions with the P-47s. Using the Thunderbolt the squadron was again cited in a Belgium Army Order of the Day, earning the Belgian Fourragere. The 393d received a second Distinguished Unit Citation for action on 19 March 1945. The 367th Group's target was the headquarters of Field Marshal Kesselring, the German Commander-ln-Chief, West,Kesselring assumed command the day of the attack. American intelligence believed Field Marshall von Rundstedt was still in command. Groh, p. 136. at Ziegenburg near Bad Nauheim, Germany. Aircraft of the leading 394th Fighter Squadron would attack at low level to achieve surprise, carrying a 1,000-pound bomb under each wing. The P-47s of the 392d Fighter Squadron would be similarly armed, but would dive bomb from a higher altitude. The bombs were equipped with time-delay fuses intended to crack the concrete roofs of the bunker. The 393d carried napalm intended to seep into the bunkers and burn what remained. The attack was scheduled for a time that intelligence reports indicated would find senior staff and commanders at lunch, the only time they would not be in the reinforced tunnels underneath the castle that housed the headquarters. The target was located in mountainous terrain well defended by antiaircraft artillery. Moreover, to avoid alerting the Germans to the pending attack, photographic reconnaissance aircraft had avoided the area, so detailed target photography was not available. The day of the attack the castle was concealed by ground haze which caused the 394th Fighter Squadron to stray off course at the last minute, preventing them from executing the attack as planned and reducing the element of surprise.Groh, p. 136 Although senior German officers reached the underground bunkers and survived the attack, the group reduced the military complex to ruins, disrupting communications and the flow of intelligence at a critical time. The squadron struck tanks, trucks, flak positions, and other objectives in support of the assault across the Rhine late in March and the final allied operations in Germany. It was commended by the commanding generals of XII Corps and the 11th Armored Division for the close air support the unit provided for their commands. On 10 April the squadron moved to Eschborn Airfield on the northwest side of Frankfurt, Germany. The 393d flew its last combat mission, a defensive patrol, one year after entering combat on 8 May.Groh, p. 158 During its combat tour, the squadron was credited with 22.5 air-to-air victories over enemy aircraft.Newton & Senning, pp. 645‚Äì646 Return to the United States and inactivation All hostilities ceased the following day, exactly one year after the squadron became operational. On 4 June, the 367th Group led a flyby for General Weyland. On 1 July it was announced the 393d was to redeploy to the Pacific Theater after it was re-equipped with and trained with long range P-47Ns in preparation for Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The squadron moved to Camp Detroit in France then to a staging area near Marseille. Here it boarded two ships, the , and the . When Japan surrendered, the Morton was diverted to Newport News, Virginia, while the Ericcson sailed for Staten Island, New York. Following leave for everyone, the few personnel that remained in the squadron after transfers and discharges reassembled at Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina, on 2 November and the 393d was inactivated there on 7 November 1945. =Minnesota Air National Guard= A Minnesota ANG F-51D Mustang in the early 1950s. The wartime 393d Fighter Squadron was redesignated the 179th Fighter Squadron and was allotted to the National Guard on 24 May 1946. It was organized at Duluth Municipal Airport and was extended federal recognition on 17 September 1948. The squadron was equipped with North American F-51D Mustangs and was assigned to the 133d Fighter Group at Wold-Chamberlain Field, Minneapolis. Korean War activation On 1 March 1951, the 179th was federalized and brought to active duty due to the Korean War. Shortly after activation it was redesignated the 179th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and became part of Air Defense Command. On active duty it assumed an air defense mission and initially remained assigned to the 133d Fighter-Interceptor Group at Duluth Municipal Airport.Cornett & Johnson, p. 124 However, ADC experienced difficulty under the existing wing base organizational structure in deploying its fighter squadrons to best advantage.Grant, p. 33 As a result, in February 1952 the 133d Group was inactivated and the squadron was reassigned to the 31st Air Division. The squadron was inactivated and returned to the control of the State of Minnesota on 1 December 1952. Cold War 179th FIS Convair F-102 Delta Dagger 56-1323 alongside a F-84F Thunderstreak of the 170th TFS, an ANG F-100D Super Sabre and a F-101B Voodoo from the 178th FIS. The unit was organized by 1 January 1953 and ADC became its gaining command upon call to active duty. It resumed its peacetime training mission. The squadron upgraded in 1954 to the radar equipped Lockheed F-94 Starfire all-weather interceptor, armed with 20 millimeter cannon. With this new aircraft, the 179th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron became an all-weather interceptor unit. In 1957, the 179th again upgraded to the improved Northrop F-89C Scorpion then in 1959, the unit converted to the F-89J model of the Scorpion, which was not only equipped with data link for interception control through the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system, but which carried the nuclear armed AIR-2 Genie. On 1 July 1960, the 179th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 148th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was established along with supporting squadrons. The 179th became the new group's flying squadron. The other squadrons assigned to the group were the 148th Material Squadron, 148th Air Bse Squadron and the 148th USAF Dispensary. The same day, the squadron assumed a 24-hour air defense alert status at Duluth alongside the regular Air Force 11th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron. In 1967, the supersonic Convair F-102A Delta Dagger replaced the squadron's F-89J. The McDonnell F-101B Voodoo came aboard in April 1971 and remained until January 1976 when the unit was redesignated, becoming the 179th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron with McDonnell Douglas RF-4C Phantom II Mach-2 unarmed reconnaissance aircraft. Its new mission entailed all weather, high or low altitude, day or night, reconnaissance. This mission also required the unit to have the capability to deploy to a wide variety of operating locations. The 179th TRS deployed seven RF-4Cs to Erding Air Base in West Germany between 3 and 23 August 1979 as part of Exercise Coronet Bridle. McDonnell Douglas F-4D-26-MC Phantom II 65-0608 at Duluth Air National Guard Base, Minnesota, 1989. (This aircraft is today preserved at Dulth). In October 1983, the mission changed again and the 179th returned to air defense becoming the 179th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron. The return to alert and air defense was accompanied by the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II tactical fighter, most of the unit's aircraft being veterans of the Vietnam War. Between 1 March 1986 and 6 April 1987, three F-4Ds (65-0585, 65-0593 and 65-0648) from the 179th FIS were deployed to Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, alongside Phantoms of the 178th FIS and 194th FIS as part of Exercise Creek Klaxon, which saw the ANG units take QRA responsibilities while the 526th TFS converted to the General Dynamics F-16C Fighting Falcon. Post-Cold War Balad AB, Iraq, on 20 March 2007. On 10 March 1990, the 179th FIS received the first variants of the F-16A Fighting Falcon air defense fighter (ADF) to take over from the F-4D Phantom II. The early F-16 markings included \\"Duluth\\" on a tail stripe as well as an image of the Big Dipper. The last flight of a 179th FIS F-4D was under taken by 65-0608 on 17 April 1990. On 17 March 1992, the 179th was renamed the 179th Fighter Squadron. A few years later, in October 1995, the unit was tasked with maintaining a detachment (Detachment 1, 148th Fighter Wing), which maintained alert status at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. To fit the needs of a shrinking air force, the squadron dropped the air superiority role and became a general purpose tactical fighter squadron. Already proficient in the air-to-air mission, the 179th had to be brought up to speed with both using guided and unguided bombs. Live bombs were dropped for the first time in March 2000 during a training exercise. Due to the role change, the squadron's base facilities also had to be renovated. On 11 September 2001, the squadron became very busy as a result of the attack on the two World Trade Center towers in New York City. As an immediate aftermath, the 148th was again tasked with air defense, providing combat air patrols over our nation's capital and New York City, and with deploying personnel and aircraft back to its detached alert facility at Tyndall. Towards the end of 2003 the Bulldogs began conversion to the F-16C/D block 25. Most F-16A/Bs were retired straight to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center. During the course of the conversion, Detachment 1 at Tyndall was discontinued. With the newer Fighting Falcons, the squadron began combat deployments, sometimes operating as an expeditionary fighter squadron. As part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 179th was one of the first F-16 units to be based in Balad Air Base, Iraq. The 179th deployed more than 200 personnel between April and June 2005. The squadron was tasked with both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat operations. Another deployment to Balad was set up between September and December 2008. On 27 April 2010, the squadron began another conversion being the first Air National Guard unit to operate the block 50 F-16C/D when five aircraft arrived from Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany when 22d and 23d Fighter Squadrons at Spangdahlem were replaced by the 480th Fighter Squadron, with the surplus aircraft going to the 179th. The majority of the block 25s were sent to retirement at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Between April and July 2016, the 179th deployed to Osan Air Base, South Korea, as the 179th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, being replaced by the 157th Fighter Squadron.

Ephraim K. Avery, 1833. Ephraim Kingsbury Avery (December 18, 1799 - October 23, 1869) was a Methodist minister who was among the first clergymen tried for murder in the United States. Avery is often cited as \\"the first\\", although it is thought there is at least one case that precedes Avery's. The murder On December 21, 1832, farmer John Durfee of Tiverton, Rhode Island, discovered a woman's corpse hanging by her neck from a rope tied to a stackpole used to dry hay. Investigators identified the woman as 30-year-old factory worker Sarah Maria Cornell, of Fall River, Massachusetts. The family from whom Sarah Cornell rented a room discovered among her personal effects a note written by Cornell and dated the same day as her death: > \\"If I should be missing, enquire of the Rev. Mr. Avery of Bristol, he will > know where I am.\\" Other suspicious and incriminating letters came to light, as well as a conversation she had had with a doctor indicating the married Avery was the father of her unborn child. A coroner's jury was convened in Tiverton before any autopsy had been performed. This jury found that Cornell had \\"committed suicide by hanging herself upon a stake ... and was influenced to commit said crime by the wicked conduct of a married man.\\" After the autopsy was performed, however, it was discovered that Cornell had been four months pregnant at the time of her death. A second coroner's jury was convened, this time in Bristol, Rhode Island. This jury overruled the earlier finding of suicide and accused Ephraim Kingsbury Avery, a married Methodist minister, as the \\"principal or accessory\\" in her death. Avery was quickly arrested on a charge of murder, but just as quickly set free on his own recognizance. An 1833 print illustrating the widely held belief that Avery was guilty despite his acquittal. One demon asks, \\"How will this be managed if it should go to a jury?\\" Another replies, \\"A Jury, ye young fools, is nothing. What's to be done with Public Opinion.\\" Cornell's pregnancy led another Methodist minister to reject the responsibility of burying her the second time (she already once been exhumed for autopsy). He claimed that she had only been a \\"probationary\\" member of his congregation. Responsibility for her burial was assumed by the Fall River Congregationalists, and Cornell was buried as an indigent, on Christmas Eve. That night in Fall River, money was raised and two committees pledged to assist the officials of Tiverton with the murder investigation. The next day (Christmas being not widely celebrated in largely Puritan New England), a steamship was chartered to take one hundred men from Fall River to Bristol. They surrounded Avery's home and demanded he come out. Avery declined, but did send a friend outside to try to placate the crowd. The men eventually left when the steamship signaled its return to Fall River. In Bristol, an inquest was convened, in which two Justices of the Peace found there to be insufficient evidence to try Avery for the crime of murder. The people of Fall River were outraged, and there were rumors that one of the justices was a Methodist, and was looking to quell the scandal. The deputy sheriff of Fall River, Harvey Harnden, obtained from a Rhode Island superior court judge a warrant for Avery's arrest. When a Rhode Island sheriff went to serve it, he discovered that Avery had already fled. On January 20, 1833, Harnden tracked Avery to Rindge, New Hampshire. Avery later claimed he had fled because he feared for his life, particularly at the hands of the mob that had surrounded his house. Harnden extradited Avery to Newport, Rhode Island, where Avery was put in jail. On March 8, 1833, Avery was indicted for murder by a Newport County grand jury. He pleaded \\"not guilty\\". A war for public opinion There were a great deal of external concerns interested in the case of the young Methodist girl who had been employed at the Fall River Manufactory. For one, New England Protestantism was suspicious of the encroachment of the comparatively new sect of Methodism, and the trial seemed to confirm their worst fears. Another was the 19th-century American industrialists whose cotton mills relied on the labor of young, newly independent women. The case of Sarah Cornell cast into doubt the industrialists' assertion that women would be as safe in the factories as they were working at home with their families. It was therefore in the interest of the factory-owners to keep Cornell from being smeared in the press, and to push for the arrest and conviction of her murderer. Conversely, the Methodist Church wanted to earn respectability and make converts, and wanted to avoid at all costs a criminal and sexual scandal involving one of its own ministers. Consequently, both of these groups contributed a great deal of effort, money and publicity to the trial, for either the prosecution's side or the defense. The trial The trial began on May 6, 1833, and was heard by the Supreme Judicial Council (what is today the Rhode Island Supreme Court). The lawyers for the prosecution were Rhode Island Attorney General Albert C. Greene and former attorney general Dutee Jerauld Pearce. The six lawyers for the defense, hired by the Methodist Church, were led by former United States Senator and New Hampshire Attorney General Jeremiah Mason. The trial lasted 27 days. Under Rhode Island law at the time, defendants in capital cases were not permitted to offer testimony in their own defense, so Avery did not get the opportunity to speak. However, both the prosecution and the defense called a large number of witnesses to testify, 68 for the prosecution, and 128 for the defense. Although Jeremiah Mason maintained that Avery had not been present when the murder occurred, the larger part of the defense strategy was to call into question Sarah Cornell's morals. The defense characterized her as \\"utterly abandoned, unprincipled, profligate,\\" and brought forth many witnesses to testify to her promiscuity, suicidal ideation and mental instability. Much was made of how Cornell had been cast out of the Methodist Church for fornication. Sarah Maria Cornell had come from a fairly prosperous and prominent Connecticut family, but had fallen on hard times after her father, a successful paper cutter, had abandoned them. In her late teens and twenties, Cornell went back and forth between factory work and skilled employment as a seamstress. She acquired a reputation for petty theft and general \\"bad character\\". She moved from town to town in New England, engaging in several affairs along the way, and once contracting gonorrhea. The prosecution largely attempted to portray the Methodist clergy as a dangerous, almost secret society, willing to defend their minister and the good name of their church at any cost. A medical debate centered around whether the unborn child was in fact conceived in August, although Puritan standards of propriety regarding the female body sometimes made it difficult to elicit factual information. One female witness, when questioned as to the state of Cornell's body, absolutely refused to answer, saying, \\"I never heard such questions asked of nobody.\\" Acquittal and aftermath 1833 print depicting Avery being transported to hell by demons. On June 2, 1833, after deliberating for 16 hours, the jury found Ephraim Kingsbury Avery \\"not guilty\\". The minister was set free and returned to his position in the Methodist Church, but the public opinion was that Avery had been wrongfully acquitted. Rallies hanged or burned effigies of Avery, and he himself was once almost lynched in Boston. A great deal of anger was also directed at the Methodist Church. To ease tensions, the church's New England Conference convened a trial of its own, chaired by Wilbur Fisk, in which Avery was again acquitted. This did little, if anything, to quell public antipathy toward Avery or the church. Avery later embarked on a speaking tour to vindicate himself in the eyes of the public, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful. In 1836, Avery left the Methodist ministry, and took his family first to Connecticut, then upstate New York. They ultimately settled in Ohio, where he lived out the rest of his days as a farmer. Avery also wrote a pamphlet called The correct, full and impartial report of the trial of Rev. Ephraim K. Avery.

Cornell, despite his acquittal. Sarah Maria Cornell (May 3, 1803 - December 20, 1832) was a Fall River mill worker whose corpse was found hanging from a stackpole on the farm of John Durfee in nearby Tiverton, Rhode Island on December 21, 1832. Her death was at first thought to be a suicide. After an autopsy, it was discovered she was pregnant. Methodist minister Ephraim K. Avery would be suspected of her pregnancy and tried for her murder, in a trial what would engage local industrialists against the New England Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Although Avery would be acquitted for the murder, he was forever scorned in the eyes of the public.Fall River Outrage, David Richard Kasserman, 1986 Biography Sarah Maria Cornell was born on May 3, 1803, likely in Rupert, Vermont to James and Lucretia (Leffingwell) Cornell. Lucretia had been born well-off in an old Puritan family, the daughter of a Connecticut merchant and paper maker.Christopher Leffingwell House However she had been disowned by her father after she married James Cornell, who had worked in his paper mill, and of whom he did not approve. James abandoned the family when Cornell was a baby, forcing her mother to give up her older sister and brother to relatives as she was financially unable to care for three children. Cornell remained with her mother to age eleven when she moved in with her aunt Joanna, in Norwich, Connecticut. Later in her teens, she apprenticed as a tailor. In 1820 she moved to nearby Bozrahville and worked as a tailor for about two years. Around 1822 or 1823 she went to work at a cotton mill in Killingly, Connecticut. In the years that followed, she would move often and work at various mills in Rhode Island and Connecticut, including stints in North Providence, Jewett City, Slatersville. During this period, Cornell often got into trouble, including charges of theft and other \\"inappropriate\\" acts for a woman of that time. During her time at Slatersville between 1823 and 1826, Cornell converted to Methodism, and sought to change her ways. However, in February 1826, the mill at Slatersville burned to the ground and she was forced to seek employment elsewhere. She first moved to the nearby village of Branch Factory and later to Mendon Mills (later called Millville, Massachusetts), several miles away. In early 1827, Cornell moved again to find mill work in Dedham, Massachusetts. However, after only a few weeks there she moved again to Dorchester, Massachusetts, where she was able to reconnect with the Methodists. In May 1828, she moved to the booming mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts where she worked as a weaver until about the end of 1829. It was during this period in Lowell that she met a newly arrived Methodist minister, Ephraim Kingsbury Avery. In September 1830, she moved to Dover, New Hampshire. Only two months later she moved again to Somersworth, New Hampshire. During the summer of 1831 she left New Hampshire for Waltham, Massachusetts but only stayed there a few weeks. She then moved to Taunton, Massachusetts where she found employment. In May 1832 she left Taunton for Woodstock, Connecticut where she was able to find work again as a tailor in Grindall Rawson's shop. It was at a Methodist Camp Meeting in Thompson, Connecticut at the end of August 1832 that Cornell once again crossed paths with Reverend Avery. By this time, Avery had become the minister in Bristol, Rhode Island. It is alleged that during the Thompson Camp meeting that Avery seduced Sarah Cornell. In October 1832, she moved to Fall River where she found lodging at the home of Elija Cole. By this time she was showing clear signs of pregnancy, and sought advice from a local doctor in Fall River. By early December 1832, she moved to the Hathaway residence on Spring Street. Death Grave of Sarah M.

Early life and education A native of Warwick, Rhode Island, Mills graduated cum laude with a double major in biochemistry and government from Bowdoin College in 1972. He then went on to earn a PhD in biology at Syracuse University in 1976 and a JD from Columbia University in 1979, where he was a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. Upon graduating, he soon began working at the law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton, where he became a partner in 1986. Career A member of the Board of Trustees from 1994 through 2000, Mills became president of Bowdoin College in October 2001. Since then, Mills has dramatically changed Bowdoin's curriculum and campus. As part of a master plan first designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 2004, the college has built new residential dorms, a recital hall, a hockey arena, a fitness center, converted one of the college's pools into an architecturally distinctive recital hall, and has undergone a highly publicized renovation to the Bowdoin College Museum of Art. In 2011, Bowdoin set a record low rate of admissions for the class of 2015 at 15.7%. Three years earlier, in 2008, it was recognized as \\"School of the Year\\" by College Prowler. Additionally, that January, Mills announced that all student loans would be replaced by grants beginning in September. Mills presented the Bowdoin Campaign in 2006, a $250 million fund-raising campaign set to be finished in June 2009 and focusing on new faculty positions and financial aid. Aided by a $10 million gift by Subway Sandwiches co-founder Peter Buck, the goal was met that February. In response to the global financial crisis, in September 2008, Mills announced that the college would slow down the rate of new capital projects and faculty positions but would retain job security at the college. In April 2014, Mills announced he would \\"step down as president of the College ... at the conclusion of the 2014-15 academic year.\\" He officially stepped down on July 1, 2015, and was succeeded by Clayton Rose. In March 2017, Mills was appointed deputy chancellor and chief operating officer at the University of Massachusetts Boston. In that role, he oversaw the academic and research program and campus operations. He stepped down from the role at the end of the 2017-18 academic year. Personal life On December 19, 2008, his wife, Karen Mills, was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve in his administration as Administrator of the Small Business Administration, in which role she served in until February 11, 2013.

The terms draws on Lisa Cliggett's \\"gift remitting\\",Cliggett 2003 but is used to describe a wider body of work. Broadly speaking, remittances are the money, goods, services, and knowledge that migrants send back to their home communities or families. Remittances are typically considered as the economic transactions from migrants to those at home.Trager 2005 While remittances are also a subject of international development and policy debate See Hernandez and Coutin (2006) for a discussion of how remittances are treated as national and international resources for development and migration policy. and sociological and economic literature,See, for example, Peggy Levitt 1998; 2001; Tumama Cowley 2004. this article focuses on ties with literature on gifting and reciprocity or gift economy founded largely in the work of Marcel Mauss and Marshall Sahlins. While this entry focuses on remittances of money or goods, remittances also take the form of ideas and knowledge. For more on these, see Peggy Levitt's work on \\"social remittances\\" which she defines as \\"the ideas, behaviors, identities, and social capital that flow from receiving to sending country communities.\\"Levitt 1998:927 Anthropologists on remittances Anthropological work on remittances appears to be divided into two streams: one based on overseas diasporas of migrants (primarily in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia) and the other from urban areas to rural (primarily in Africa). While both are interested in the relationships among migrants and remittance recipients, the transnational work tends to approach financial remittances as a key source of support for rural households in the sending countries while the other focuses on monetary remittances as gifts, and on the intentionality of gift giving in maintaining relationships. All share a focus on the exchange within relationships, within the context of a household, family, kinship, community or other social network. Within the transnationalism framework, Jeffrey Cohen and Dennis Conway have detailed a debate in which remittances are treated as either sources of development (for example by funding water infrastructure projects in sending communities) or dependency (by perpetuating a cycle migration and remittances to maintain households and communities).Cohen and Conway 2001 They draw on their experiences with transnational migrants in Oaxaca, Mexico to show that this is a false divide. Their focus on the noneconomic, gender, and informal economy relationships that accompany migration,Conway and Cohen 1998:29 highlights the shared emphasis on relationships and social context which marks anthropological treatment of remittances as distinct and which ties transnational work with that of those explicitly focusing on gift remitting. Although in apparent disagreement with Cohen and Conway on the development/dependency debate, Leigh Binford strengthens the call for studying remittances as an international process, documenting the impact of remittances on both sides of the exchange,Binford 2003:325 an approach to which anthropologists are well trained. One space for such a transnational treatment of ‚Äúgifting remittances‚Äù is in the analysis of barrels filled with new and recycled gifts sent home, typically to the Caribbean or Asia.Moore, Waveney Ann (2007, December 2) Sending Love Home by the Barrelful. Saint Petersburg Times. . Accessed on May 6, 2008. Gift Remitting, Remitting the Gift While remittances could also be theorized as gifts in the above-mentioned transnational work, the terms gift remitting and remitting the gift make explicit the focus on gifts and the accompanying social ties. Discussion of ‚Äúgift remittances‚Äù goes back at least to Aderanti Adepoju‚Äôs work in Nigeria on the socio-economic links between urban migrants and their rural sending communities in which money is remitted alongside gifts not readily available in the home country. In this work the focus on socio-cultural context and networks is strong.Adepoju 1974 That the economic cost may be high for the migrant head of household is highlighted as visiting and bringing the requisite gifts can be very expensive, a disincentive to visiting the non- migrating family and community members. Margo Russell writes that defining remitted moneys as gifts rather than payments enhances freedom and flexibility for the giver. This works in Swaziland because moneys are not sent to a household but to ‚Äúa range of individuals in urban and rural areas to whom, because of specific relationships, various workers feel a particular obligation.‚ÄùRussell 1984:610 Here ties are not just of affect; they are of mutual obligation reinforced through the passage of gifts. Gifting remittances fits within and strengthens a larger pattern of reciprocity and obligation in Swaziland.Russell 1984:614 Following on the work of these earlier anthropologists working in Africa, Lisa Cliggett uses the phrases \\"gift remitting\\" and \\"remitting the gift\\"Cliggett 2005 to describe urban to rural gifting among Zambian families, highlighting that these remittances are more irregular, are of lesser amounts, and tend to be material as opposed to monetary. In Zambia, urban migration and remittance strategies serve to uphold ties, thereby reducing insecurity and allowing for return migration, particularly in old age. Unlike the interests of policy makers and scholars interested in remittances for development, Cliggett emphasizes that: \\"Zambia migrants do not remit large sums of cash or goods, and that the fundamental concern for migrants in Zambia is investing in people and relationships through remitting, rather than investing in development, improved living conditions or other capital in rural sending communities.\\"Cliggett 2005:45 Trager provides support from a similar phenomenon in Nigeria, where she has observed intentional use of even minimal remittances and services to maintain home-town ties with family, kin, and the community as a whole.Trager 1998 The regular giving of remittances and other services such as joining hometown associations and helping in community fund-raising maintained ties. Conway and Cohen also describe cases in which remittance to the community and communal reciprocal relationships were equally important to kin.Conway and Cohen 1998:36 Along the lines of Mark Granovetter‚Äôs strength of weak ties, they describe non-kin relationships as even more important as household ties and obligations as the social aid networks are very flexible and reinforcing.Conway and Cohen 1998:37 Charles Piot‚Äôs Remotely Global: Village Modernity in West Africa places the analysis of domestic gift remitting explicitly within a framework of global change, showing how remittances from wage workers and gifts from successful cash croppers are transforming landscape and relations of exchange, personhood, and social solidarity. His work reinforces that gifting exists alongside and within the capitalist world economy and represents an attempt to update Marcel Mauss‚Äôs theory of the gift for the 21st Century, a project more fully undertaken by Maurice Godelier. Anthropology of Gifting = The Gift = In her forward to The Gift: The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies, Mary Douglas summarizes Marcel Mauss‚Äôs argument succinctly: ‚Äúno free gift‚Äù as gifts entail maintenance of mutual ties.Mauss 1990:vii In terms of potlatch in North America, this meant that each gift is ‚Äúpart of a system of reciprocity in which the honor of giver and recipient are engaged‚Äù and failing to return means losing the competition for honor.‚Äù A Maussian approach to giving and reciprocity provides useful insight into the analysis of ‚Äúgifting remittances‚Äù precisely because of the focus on constructing and maintaining ties through the giving and receiving of such funds, goods, and services. = From the Spirit of the Gift to the Social Life of Things = Since Mauss discussed the ability of gifts to drive giving, receiving, and reciprocating gifting as animating objects through a piece of the giver going with the property, the spirit of the gift has been a subject of scholarship.Appadurai 1986; Godelier 1999; Helms 1998; Mauss 1990; Sykes 2005; Weiner 1992 and others. Mauss termed this spirit ‚Äúhua‚Äù a MƒÅori word describing ‚Äúthe spirit of things‚ÄùMauss 1990:11 and discusses its mana, referring to a certain power or authority of the giver or the gift itself. Because of the ‚Äúthing itself possesses a soul‚Äù for the MƒÅori, and for Mauss‚Äôs theory of the gift ‚Äúto make a gift of something to someone is to make a present of some part of oneself‚Äù and ‚Äúto accept something from somebody is to accept some part of his spiritual essence, of his soul.‚ÄùMauss 1990:12 More simply put, receiving a gift carries with it an obligation to receive and to reciprocate, and the gift itself drives this system of exchange. It is based on this that the anthropology of gifting is located on the contextual and historically contingent relationship between giver and receiver turned reciprocator.[Marshall Sahlins] (1972) further ties economic and social relations, linking material flows and social relations through redistribution into a series of exchange patterns based on See reciprocity (cultural anthropology): generalized (sociable extreme), negative (unsociable extreme), and in between them, balanced reciprocity (a more direct, impersonal exchange). Though familiar from introductory anthropology classes, this typology is little used in contemporary literature. Trager‚Äôs work in Nigeria supports the sense of obligation tied to gift giving, or, conversely, the need for continued use of gifting remittances and services to maintain relationships with kin and community: ‚ÄúEven those with little interest in community affairs or in ever living in the home town themselves, feel obliged to maintain ties in these ways.‚ÄùTrager 1998:364 In Enigma of the GiftGodelier 1999 Maurice Godelier summarizes and critiques Marcel Mauss‚Äôs work in ‚ÄúThe Gift.‚Äù,Mauss 1990 updating it to more explicitly treat interwoven domains of market exchange, gift exchange, and withholdingWeiner (1992) discusses at length the motives and power involved in keeping objects from the realm of exchange, including reciprocial gift giving, through the concept of inalienable possessions such as heirlooms and sacred knowledge which are ‚Äúimbued with the intrinsic and ineffable identities of their owners which [unlike most commodities] are not easy to give away‚Äù (1992:6). objects from the realm of exchange.See Chapter 4, ‚ÄúThe Disenchanted Gift‚Äù in Godelier 1999 Mauss, however, had observed the persistence of gift giving in his contemporary society of early 20th century France in Chapter 4 of The Gift, wherein he raised an important criticism of the concept of utility and its attendant theories of value, which were coming to dominate economic theory of day, even so far as to inform the French policies that created the social welfare system (Fournier 2006, Gane 1992). Noting that Mauss did well to highlight the three obligations of gift exchange (gift, receipt, reciprocation) his focus was strongest on the question of reciprocity and he failed to pay sufficient attention to receiving or giving. Godelier suggests that Mauss‚Äôs depiction of the spirit of the gift as the ultimate explanation for its reciprocation - not just as a symbol or bonds of knowledge of social relations ‚Äì resulted from Mauss‚Äôs inability to adequately resolve his own questions, thereby leaving objects with agency, free of the people who created it. (\\"It will basically look as if things themselves had persons in tow\\".Godelier 1999:105 Godelier says this positioning of spirit and agency in the gift basically leaves all objects and all of nature as human and human centered, set in motion purely by human will.Godelier 1999:102) All of the articles grouped here under the loose rubric of ‚Äúgifting remittances‚Äù share this fundamental focus on locating exchange within socio-cultural relationships and using the insight that gifting/remitting grants broader insight into the broader economy and culture, approximating Mauss‚Äôs treatment of the study of the gift as a window onto a study of the sum total of social life. Yet none goes so far as to speak directly of the mana or hua of gifts or remittances even though the ability of gifts to spur reciprocation is part of the analysis and of the calculations of those doing the remitting. With his stance that the divide between gifts and commodity exchange is overstated,Appadurai 1986:11 Arjun Appadurai‚Äôs treatment of gifts and commodities Appadurai defines a commodity as ‚Äúany thing intended for exchange‚Äù (1986:9). as, like people, having ‚Äúsocial lives‚ÄùAppadurai 1986:3 is closer to their work. However, with this definition of the commodity as \\"anything intended for exchange\\" (1986: 9), he thereby makes gift giving into a social act that is nearly indistinguishable from commodity exchange and ultimately emphasizes the economic value of giving, rather than the social, moral or spiritual values that people mark as important. By blurring the distinction between commodities and gifts, a distinction that ordinary people routinely make in their everyday lives as they give emphasis to the value they place on specific social relationships, Appadurai undermines the possibility of understanding the movement of goods and money, between life as a commodity embedded in a market to life as a gift embedded in intimate relationships of giving, receiving, and reciprocating.Wilk and Cliggett (2007:159) differentiate between a commodity and a gift, suggesting that with gifting goes a desire to generate or reciprocate exchange, action, solidarity, etc. and more direct social relations. For a full treatment of the problem of why there is an efflorescence of gift exchange within conditions of market penetration see Gregory, C.A. (1982) \\"Gifts and Commodities\\". London: Academic Press. For Appadurai (1986:9) the definitions of both commodities and gifts are not only socially constructed but provisional. From his position Appadurai can only describe, but he cannot explain, how social acts of giving gifts seem to multiply with the advance of the market. = Motivations and gifting = Drawing on Marshall Sahlins, Pierre Bourdieu reminds us that gifting morphs with social distance: as social distance increases, self-interest and calculation increases and the importance of generosity and equity declines‚Ä¶ the logic of warfare enters even as people look for ways to mediate the distance by ‚Äústriv[ing] to substitute a personal relationship for an impersonal, anonymous one‚Äù.Bourdieu 2000:20 Yet, while the capacity to calculate is universal the spirit of calculation (the presumed rationality of the economic actor) is culturally and historically contingent: the \\"economic habitus\\" of an actor is learned.Bourdieu 2000:25 Understanding that gifts move in and out of overlapping economic systems and that the manner in which they move may be impacted by social and physical space, is useful in analyzing the transnational and market-based relations in which remittances are generated, transferred, and spent. Similarly, the motivations of actors over time are contingent and may, at one point, be altruistic and at other self-interested. Tumama describes motivations for remitting among New Zealand migrants which range from future investments to maintaining kinship ties which pushed some to go without food while striving to remit. A motivation of self-interest may become necessary as ‚Äúit is likely that the pressures of providing for a family in New Zealand may override the gift giving traditions for some younger Pacific people‚Äù Tumama 2004:441 who are unable to meet the financial stress of general and traditional gift giving. Focusing on El Salvador, Ester Hernandez and Susan Bibler Coutin, take the discussion of motives ‚Äì or portrayal of them ‚Äì to the national level. They show that by treating remittances as ‚Äúaltruistic gifts or unrequited transfers,‚ÄùHernandez and Coutin 2006:201 central banks can make them appear as cost free money transfers. In turn, those who do not save a significant portion of received remittances are portrayed as selfish, i.e. as self-interested instead of altruistic actors. = Gifting and Social Analysis = In her overview of anthropological theory from the perspective of the gift, Karen SykesSykes 2005 presents analysis of the gift as a relationship between people in which the relationship is made substantial by the tangible exchange as encompassing not just ceremony (as with Malinowski) but all of social life (as with Mauss). For Sykes, focusing on the gift is a way to avoid the pitfall of focusing on the individual and having to conjecture individual motivations or on motivations and being locked into an abstract analysis of the contents of the human mind. Sykes argues that focusing on the relationship, or the exchange, keeps the analysis squarely within anthropological analysis of social relations. She concludes by arguing for focus on the gift as the focus of economic anthropology because, \\"when understood as a total social fact, gift giving concentrates many aspects of human relationships, but does not underwrite all of them as the economic.\\" Sykes 2005:75 In her summary of gifting, Lisa Cliggett concurs: \\"gift giving is a good way to see all the various aspects of human nature in action at one time because gifts can be simultaneously understood as rational exchange, as a way to build political and social relations, and as expressions of moral ideas and cultural meanings\\" Wilk and Cliggett 2007:159 These insights, show that Mauss's assertion that gift exchange is about building social relationships remains a central part of gift theory to this day. Articulated as such (ex. Cliggett‚Äôs work in Zambia) or not (Cohen‚Äôs and Conway‚Äôs work in Oaxaca), it is an insight that is also central to work within the general rubric of gifting remittances.

This electron-rich derivative of benzophenone is an intermediate in the production of dyes and pigments, for example Methyl violet. It is also used as a photosensitizer. It is named after the German chemist Wilhelm Michler. Synthesis The ketone is prepared today as it was originally by Michler using the Friedel-Crafts acylation of dimethylaniline (C6H5NMe2) using phosgene (COCl2) or equivalent reagents such as triphosgene :COCl2 \\\\+ 2 C6H5NMe2 ‚Üí (Me2NC6H4)2CO + 2 HCl The related tetraethyl compound (Et2NC6H4)2CO, also a precursor to dyes, is prepared similarly. Uses Michler‚Äôs ketone is an intermediate in the synthesis of dyes and pigments for paper, textiles, and leather. Condensation with various aniline derivatives gives several of the dyes called methyl violet, such as crystal violet. Condensation of Michler's ketone with N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine gives the dye Victoria Blue B (CAS#2580-56-5, CI Basic Blue 26), which is used for coloring paper and producing pastes and inks for ballpoint pens. Michler‚Äôs ketone is commonly used as an additive in dyes and pigments as a sensitizer for photoreactions because of its absorption properties. Michler‚Äôs ketone is an effective sensitizer provided energy transfer is exothermic and the concentration of the acceptor is sufficiently high to quench the photoreaction of Michler‚Äôs ketone with itself. Specifically Michler‚Äôs ketone absorbs intensely at 366 nm and effectively sensitizes photochemical reactions such as the dimerization of butadiene to give 1,2-divinylcyclobutane. Related compounds p-Dimethylaminobenzophenone is related to Michler's ketone, but with only one amine. Auramine O, a dye, is a salt of the iminium cation [(CH3)2NC6H4]2CNH2+. Michler's thione, [(CH3)2NC6H4]2CS, is prepared by treatment of Michler's ketone with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of acid or sulfideing auramine O.

He returned to Puerto Rico in 2002, interested in becoming a performer of reggaeton, a contemporary Latin American urban music genre. While living in Puerto Rico, he would eventually form part of a popular then-underground reggaeton act, Arc√°ngel & De La Ghetto. The duo went on to make songs that became popular among reggaeton fans in the United States and Puerto Rico, including \\"Agresivo\\", \\"Sorpresa\\" and \\"Mi Fan√°tica\\" during the mid-2000s. Arc√°ngel went on to release his debut studio album, El Fen√≥meno, in late 2008. The album included songs that were produced in 2008, as well as the DJ Nelson produced \\"Chica Virtual\\", which was produced in 2007. Half of the album also included newly produced tracks, ones including \\"Pa' Que la Pases Bien\\" and \\"Por Amar a Ciegas\\", which went on to become successful airplay songs on American Latin Urban radio stations across the United States. Early life Arcangel was born in New York to Dominican parents. He grew up in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico. His mother, Carmen Rosa, was a former member of the all-women merengue group, Las Chicas del Can, who were popular during the mid 1980s to the early 1990s. Arcangel grew up listening to various types of music and has been a fan of rock music, particularly Robi Draco Rosa, a Puerto Rican pop rock artist and a former member of Menudo. Arc√°ngel was not always a fan of reggaeton; he claims that it is not his favorite type of music, but it is easy to sing to. During the early 2000s, Arc√°ngel grew fond of the new kind of music. Listening to artists like Tego Calder√≥n and Tempo, it inspired him to pursue a singing and rapping career in Puerto Rico. Music career =2004‚Äì07: Career beginnings with De La Ghetto= After returning to Puerto Rico in 2002, Arc√°ngel had decided to follow in the footsteps of the upbringing of reggaeton music. He went on to form part of an underground reggaeton act, Arc√°ngel & De La Ghetto. The duo was signed to reggaeton artist Zion's record label, Baby Records, a subsidiary of Universal Music Group. The duo were also involved with Machete Music in 2004 during the time that they were recording for reggaeton compilation albums.

Though an active musical duo, Arc√°ngel & De La Ghetto never released a studio album since the formation of the duo. Any production they had been involved with only resulted in tracks and recordings being included on compilation albums or leaked onto the Internet. This was due to a conflict with Baby Records because the company was not releasing any material by Arc√°ngel & De La Ghetto onto an album of their own. Arc√°ngel claimed to have even spent $150,000 on producing an album, which resulted in the label not releasing it to market. The tracks produced were said to have been leaked onto the Internet instead. Arc√°ngel had then filed a lawsuit with Baby Records in 2007 for US$1,000,000 and would eventually leave the record company in December 2006, when he announced that he was embarking on a solo career and founding a label of his own. =2008‚Äìpresent: Solo career and debut album= After the separation of the duo in early 2007, Arc√°ngel went on to perform solo, working with various reggaeton producers and performers on compilation albums.

Arc√°ngel founded Flow Factory Inc. in 2008, and his mother became his manager afterward. He claimed that it was easier having his mother be his manager so that he would not have to pay 20 percent of money received from record sales to his record label and manager. He went on to release his debut album, El Fen√≥meno, in late 2008. The album included songs that were produced in the last quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, including the DJ Nelson produced \\"Chica Virtual\\".

In mid-January 2009, Arc√°ngel announced plans of a European tour sometime during 2009, in promotion of his debut album, El Fen√≥meno, and to receive more exposure across the world from reggaeton fans. To comment on the tour, he claimed that in order for it to be successful, good equipment would be highly important, and by going along with the tour, he will be able to learn more on what the continental tour experience is like. Arc√°ngel confirmed to be touring in several countries, including Germany, France, Portugal, Spain, England, the Netherlands and Denmark. His Mixtape The Problem Child was released in April 2010 and now he is planning to make a new album called Sentimiento, Elegancia & Maldad. His most recent mixtape Optimus A.R.C.A was released in October 2010.

He had made climbs with Edward Whymper and was his rival when he attempted to climb the Matterhorn for the first time. Whymper ultimately succeeded in making the mountain's first ascent in July 1865 while Carrel led the party that achieved the second ascent three days later. Carrel was in the group that became the first Europeans to reach the summit of Chimborazo in 1880. He died from exhaustion when guiding a party on the south side of the Matterhorn. Early life Carrel was born on 16 January 1829 in Valtournenche, in the Aosta Valley, an Arpitan-speaking village of Kingdom of Sardinia (now Italy) which lies at the foot of the Matterhorn. He served in the Bersaglieri, a light infantry unit of the Piedmontese army. He resigned from the Bersaglieri to work as a hunter and mountain guide, but was recalled to duty in 1859 to defend Italy against Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, for which he won a French medal for the Italian campaign. Ascent of the Matterhorn Carrel first attempted to climb the Matterhorn's Lion Ridge in 1857‚Äîby which time the mountain was the tallest unclimbed peak in the Alps‚Äîwith his uncle and Am√© Gorret. In the early 1860s, Carrel made numerous attempts to climb the Matterhorn, often in the same party as Edward Whymper and John Tyndall, and at other times competing against them to reach the summit first. Carrel had agreed to accompany Whymper on his ascent of the Swiss side in 1865, but withdrew at the last minute when he was recruited by Felice Giordano on behalf of the Italian Alpine Club to lead an Italian party up the Italian side at the same time. Ultimately, Whymper's party outclimbed the Italians and reached the summit on 14 July 1865, marking the first ascent of the Matterhorn. Carrel and his Italian party successfully summited the Matterhorn three days later. Death Carrel died in August 1891 while guiding a party on the south side of the Matterhorn. After ensuring that his clients descended the mountain safely and easily in a severe storm, he collapsed from exhaustion and died on a rock at the mountain's base.

He started off as a player of the English diatonic accordion, but was best known as a harmonica or moothie player. His playing was distinguished by a very clear sense of rhythm, with a definite lilt. He was a major figure in Northumbrian music. He was also the composer of several tunes that have entered the tradition and are played at gatherings and sessions. Biography Atkinson was born in Crookham, Northumberland in 1908. He worked as a shepherd and as a rabbit-catcher until his retirement, also working at times maintaining road signs. From his youth, until the end of his long life, he was very active and influential in traditional music circles, on both sides of the Border. He had twin sons, of whom George, who died in 1987 aged 53, was also a musician, a noted Northumbrian piper. Will died on 30 July 2003. Musical life He came from a musical family - his maternal uncle Geordie Armstrong was, according to Will's cousin Willy Taylor, 'the best fiddler around'. After Will's father was killed in France in 1916, Will and his mother lived with Armstrong, her brother. The musical tradition continued in the family - Will's son George, who died before him, was widely respected as a player of the Northumbrian smallpipes. In the 1930s he began playing melodeon for dances with Geordie Armstrong and Joe Davidson playing fiddles. He was a founder member of the Alnwick Branch of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in the 1930s; the Alnwick branch later became the Alnwick Pipers' Society, and Will was its president for many years. Later he formed a band The Northumbrian Minstrels with Jack Armstrong playing fiddle and smallpipes, Jack Thompson on fiddle, Bob Clark on drums and Peggy Clark on piano. This group made some broadcasts for the BBC, including one from Alnwick in 1942 - a press cutting relating to this is at Woodhorn Museum website, where he is shown with a melodeon. They made some recordings at Powburn in 1944 - since rereleased in a compilation by Saydisc SDL 252, together with the piping of Jack Armstrong. These Powburn recordings, together with later recordings, are also available on the FARNE archive. In the 1950s, Atkinson played with other musicians near Alnwick forming The Cheviot Ranters, a noted dance band in northern Northumberland, but left the group some time later. He also bought a good mouth organ at this time, intending it to be for his son, but liked it so much he kept it himself. He also refined his mouth organ technique after hearing Larry Adler's playing, and mostly played mouth organ subsequently. In 1974 he was one of the artists recorded by Topic, playing mouth organ, on Bonny North Tyne - Northumbrian Country Music. In later life, he recorded many times, chiefly with producer Geoff Heslop. The first release, with his friends Joe Hutton (piper) and Willy Taylor, collectively known as The Shepherds, was Harthope Burn, next came a compilation of Northumbrian Music and Poetry, From Sewingshields to Glendale (with Kathryn Tickell, Alistair Anderson, Mike Tickell, Hutton and Atkinson, etc.) and in 1989 Heslop and Alistair Anderson recorded him in a solo album called simply Will Atkinson - Mouthorgan. This included tunes from various sources, including five of his own compositions. Several recordings of him playing at folk clubs are available on the FARNE archive. When compiling the multi-album anthology The Voice of the People, Reg Hall selected several recordings of Will, which appeared on the record Ranting and Reeling - these included some of the recordings made for Bonny North Tyne, as well as later recordings made with The Shepherds.

The value of perveance indicates how significant the space charge effect is on the beam‚Äôs motion. The term is used primarily for electron beams, in which motion is often dominated by the space charge.  Origin of the word  The word was probably created from Latin pervenio‚Äìto attain.  Definition  For an electron gun, the gun perveance P is determined as a coefficient of proportionality between a space-charge limited current, I, and the gun anode voltage, U_a, in three-half power in the Child-Langmuir law Handbook of Accelerator Physics and Engineering, edited by A.W.

In this case, the beam is assumed to have been accelerated in a stationary electric field so that U_a is the potential difference between the emitter and the vacuum chamber, and the ratio of \\\\frac{I}{U_a^\\\\frac{3}{2}} is referred to as a beam perveance. In equations describing motion of relativistic beams, contribution of the space charge appears as a dimensionless parameter called the generalized perveance KLawson, J. D., J. Electron.

Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL), the firm he founded in 1974, is among the oldest and largest private equity firms globally. Lee is currently the managing partner of Lee Equity Partners, a private equity firm he founded in 2006 after leaving Thomas H. Lee Partners.

He has two brothers: Richard S. Lee and Jonathan O. Lee. Lee attended Belmont Hill School and graduated from Harvard College in 1965, quickly going to work as an analyst in the institutional research department of L.F. Rothschild in New York. The next year, Lee went to work for the First National Bank of Boston, where he spent eight years ultimately rising to the rank of Vice President in 1973.Museum of Jewish Heritage Announcement: \\"Thomas H.

Lee Partners= In 1974, Lee founded a new investment firm to focus on acquiring companies through leveraged buyout transactions. By the mid-1980s, Thomas H. Lee Partners was firmly established among the top tier of a new class of private equity investors, while taking a friendlier approach than the so-called corporate raiders of the era (e.g., Nelson Peltz, Ronald Perelman, Carl Icahn). One of THL's early successes was the 1985 acquisition of Akron, Ohio-based Sterling Jewelers for $28 million. Lee reportedly put in less than $3 million and when the company was sold two years later for $210 million walked away with over $180 million in profits. The combined company was an early predecessor to what is now Signet Group, one of Europe's largest jewelry retail chains.Forbes: \\"Tom Lee is on a roll\\" by Phyllis Berman November 17, 1997 In 1992, THL's acquisition of Snapple Beverages marked the resurrection of the leveraged buyout after several dormant years in the wake of the RJR Nabisco takeover, the fall of Michael Milken, and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Thomas H. Lee In Snapple Deal (New York Times, 1992) After ceding public attention to his competitors, most notably Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the Snapple Beverages transaction catapulted Lee to prominence. Only eight months after buying the company, Lee took Snapple Beverages public and in 1994, only two years after the original acquisition, Lee sold the company to Quaker Oats for $1.7 billion. Lee was estimated to have made $900 million for himself and his investors from the sale. Quaker Oats would subsequently sell the company, which performed poorly under new management, three years later for only $300 million. From 1974 through 2006, THL raised more than $22 billion of capital in six institutional private equity funds and completed more than 100 investments representing in excess of $125 billion of aggregate purchase price.Thomas H. Lee Partners website The final years of Lee's tenure at THL were marred to a certain extent by the firm's investment in Refco, a financial services company specializing in commodities and futures contracts that collapsed suddenly in October 2005, only months after its IPO. THL as the lead investor (and Lee himself) was named in a class action shareholder lawsuit against Refco, along with Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Grant Thornton.Thomas H.

Note \\"decapatation\\" of ripple crests due to change in current. In sedimentology, wave-formed ripples or wave-formed ripple marks are a feature of sediments (sandstones, limestones, siltstones) and dunes. These ripple marks are often characterised (and thus distinguished from current ripples) by symmetric cross sections and long relatively straight crests, which may commonly bifurcate. Commonly, these crests can be truncated by subsequent flows. Their wavelength (periodicity) depends on the sediment grain size, water depth and water- particle orbits in the waves. On tidal flats the pattern of wave-formed ripples may be complicated, as a product of changing depth and wind and tidal runoff directions.Maurice E. Tucker (2001) \\"Sedimentary Petrology\\", Symmetrical ripples are commonly found in shallow waters. Beaches are a good place to find these ripples. While wave-formed ripples are traditionally described as symmetrical, asymmetric wave ripples are common in shallow waters along sandy shores. They are produced by bottom oscillations generated by passing breaker waves, which have unequal intensity in opposite directions.O. F. Evans, \\"The Classification of Wave-formed Ripple Marks\\", Journal of Sedimentary Research, Volume 11 (1941), Wave-formed ripples indicate an environment with weak currents where water motion is dominated by wave oscillations.Monroe, James S., and Reed Wicander. The Changing Earth: Exploring Geology and Evolution, 2nd ed. Belmont: West Publishing Company, 1997. pp. 114-15, 352. Symmetrical ripple Although symmetrical ripples are also called bi-directional ripples there is a difference between them. Bi- directional ripples are rarely symmetrical due to the difference in force of the two directions, where as the wave formed or oscillation ripples form from the circular water movement pattern of water molecules. These ripples form parallel to the shore line. They usually display rounded troughs and rounded crests. thumbWave motion-i18n A=Effect of oscillatory motion in deep water B=Effect of oscillatory motion in shallow water 1=Progression of wave 2=Wave crest 3=Wave trough Hampton, Monty A., Torresan, Michael E., and Barber, Jr., John H., 1997, Sea-floor geology of a part of Mamala Bay, Hawaii: Pacific Science, v. 51, n. 1, p. 54-75.

With continuous current flow in one direction, asymmetrical ripples form. Asymmetrical ripples contain a steeper slope downstream. With an alternation in current flow from one direction to the opposite symmetrical ripples form. Symmetrical ripples tend to have the same slope on both sides of the crest.Marshak, Stephen. \\"Chapter 7: A Surface Veneer: Sediments, Soils and Sedimentary Rocks.\\" Earth Portrait of a Planet. 3rd ed. New York: W.W Norton & company, 2008. 211. Print.  Formation  Symmetrical ripples form as water molecules oscillate in small circles. A particle of water within a wave does not move with the wave but rather it moves in a small circle between the wave crest and wave trough. This movement of water molecules is the same for all water molecules effected by the wave. The water molecules continue to do this to a depth equal to 1/2 the wavelength. The water molecule traveling in a circular pattern interacts with the sediment on the floor and moves the sediment into symmetrical ripples. These ripples can be either straight crested or sinuous crested ripples.Atlantic coast beaches : a guide to ripples, dunes, and other natural features of the seashore / William J. Neal, Orrin H.

Working for an international freight forwarding company, he first led shipments for the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit in West Africa and was subsequently appointed Managing Director of the new branch office in Munich. In the 1980s, Schweizer had various engagements as a stuntman. He performed a bungee jump in Willy Bogner‚Äôs action film \\"Fire, Ice and Dynamite\\". In the following years, Schweizer set several world records, including in 1997 for the jump from a helicopter with the longest bungee rope and the highest fall distance of 1,050 meters. The same year, Schweizer ended his career as a stuntman. = Entrepreneurial activities = In 1985, Schweizer founded the event and advertising agency Kajak Sports Productions, headquartered in Munich. This company later became the foundation for the Jochen Schweizer Group. Kajak Sports Productions produced several fun sports and action sports movies, such as \\"Mad Family\\", \\"Over the Edge\\", \\"Topolinaden\\" and \\"Verdon ‚Äì Die Schlucht gestern und heute\\". In 1989 the company opened the first stationary facility in Germany, located in Oberschlei√üheim. It is the oldest still active jumping facility in Europe. In subsequent years the company expanded its activities to include other activities and adventures, such as the vertical catwalk show. Schweizer's companies faced a major crisis in 2003 due to a fatal accident at the Florianturm in Dortmund. The company changed its business and focused on selling experiences from then on. In 2004 the company started to sell experience vouchers over the Internet. Later, they opened their own stores in Germany, with experience vouchers also sold through trading partners. Today, the Jochen Schweizer Group offers a total of 1,900 different experiences, employs 500 people and achieves an annual turnover of 70 million euros.

In the 1950s, the bore hole was capped, but in the 1970s, enough pressure was established to blow off the cap. As a result, an estimated volume of water in the range of 800 to 3,500 gallons per minute flows from the bore hole.

His most important writing, Jaimini Bharata is a version of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The writing focuses on the events following the battle of Indraprastha between the Pandavas and Kauravas, using the Ashvamedha (\\"horse sacrifice\\") conducted by Yudhishthira as the topic of the epic narrative. The writing is in the shatpadi metre (hexa-metre, 6 line verse) and was inspired by the Sanskrit original written by sage Jaimini.Sastri (1955), p. 365 Life Parts of the Kannada epics: Kumaravyasa's Mahabharata and Lakshmisha's Jaimini Bharata The place, time and religious sect that Lakshmisa belonged to has been a subject of controversy among historians. Some historians believe he was a native of Devanur in modern Kadur taluk, Chikkamagaluru district, Karnataka state. It is claimed that his family deity was \\"Lakshmiramana\\" (a form of Hindu God Vishnu) to whom he dedicated his writing. Devanur was called by multiple names in his writing; Surapura and Girvanapura.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 58 Other historians feel Surapura is located in the erstwhile Hyderabad region. Some historians believe that Lakshmisa was an Advaitin or a Smartha Brahmin (believer of monistic philosophy) of the Bhagavata sect because the poet has invoked the names of Hindu God Shiva, his consort Parvati and son Ganapati in the beginning of his writing. However, despite these invocations, he may have been a Srivaishnava (a follower of the Visishtadvaita philosophy preached by 12th century philosopher Ramanujacharya), there being examples of other Srivaishnava poets (who wrote in Kannada) who praised the God Shiva, Parvati and Ganapati in their writings.Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 59 There is also controversy about when he wrote Jaimini Bharata. Scholars have assigned him various dates, the earliest being , but more generally mid-16th century,Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 210Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1182 and late 17th century.Sastri (1955), p. 365Kamath (2001), p. 230 The 16th century or earlier dating is based on similarities between Virupaksha Pandita's (1584 CE) Chennabasava Purana and Lakshmisa's work,Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 60 while the 17th century dating is based on the claim that no author, Brahmin or otherwise, has referenced his writing and directly mentioned his name in any literature during the period 15th century through late 17th century. Whereas, authors who do mention Lakshmisa regularly in their writings are from the 18th century. Magnum opus Jaimini Bharata, Wesleyan Mission Press, Bangalore, 1852 The Jaimini Bharata, one of the most well known stories in Kannada literature was written in the tradition of sage Jaimini. It has remained popular through the centuries. In a writing full of similes and metaphors, puns and alliterations, Lakshmisa created a human tale out of an epic, earning him the honorific \\"Upamalola\\" (\\"One who revels in similes and metaphors\\") and \\"Nadalola\\" (\\"Master of melody\\"). The writing focusses on the events following the battle when the victorious Pandavas conducted the Ashvamedha Yagna to expiate the sin of fratricide. The writing differs entirely from Kumara Vyasa's rendering of the same epic (called Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari) of c. 1430, both in metre and content. Kumara Vyasa had used the flexible bhamini shatpadi metre and followed the Vyasa tradition whereas Lakshmisa used the vardhaka shatpadi metre which is well suited for figures of speech. The work has been criticised though, for failing to achieve the level of devotion towards Hindu God Krishna that Kumara Vyasa managed in the various stages of his story. However, Lakshmisa is considered a successful story-teller with an ability to narrate the Upakhyanas (\\"story within a story\\"), describe the physical beauty of a woman at length and to hold the reader with his rich Kannada diction and rhetoric. The writing has been considered an asset to the enlightened reader as well as those not so educated. Lakshmisa authored some poems reminiscent of the Haridasa poetry but without the same success. In 1852, the Wesleyan Mission Press published the Jaimini Bharata with an English translation by Daniel Sanderson, a Wesleyan missionary at the Bangalore Wesleyan Canarese Mission.

He is considered to be the father of extreme skiing and that has given him the name \\"skier of the impossible\\". He has the most difficult 18 descents to his credit. In mountains people are usually known for first ascent of high and difficult peaks but he is famous for first descents (see French Wikipedia). In 1969 he skied Monte Rosa, and Mount Hood in 1971. In 1970 he skied the W flank of the Eiger. He has climbed then skied back down the SW face of Denali (Mount McKinley), Alaska, the highest mountain in North America, in 1972; Mont Blanc in 1968, the highest mountain in the Alps; Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa; Nun peak in the Himalayas in 1976; and a number of other peaks in Nepal and the Karakoram. On his 50th birthday he skied down Japan's Mount Fuji, without snow, on scree. Saudan's crowning achievement came in 1982 when, at age 46, he skied down Pakistan's -high Gasherbrum I, or Hidden Peak, in the Himalayas. It was, and possibly still is, the longest 50-degree ski descent ever accomplished and likely the first full descent of an '8,000 meter' mountain. In order to safely ski these mountains he developed a new technique to \\"jump turn\\" on very steep inclines. Normal jump turns would have accelerated the skier and thrown him too far down the mountain so, using long ski poles, Saudan turned by planting a ski pole downhill and, keeping his weight on both skis and leaning back on his heels, he lifted the ski tips up and swivelled them in an arc into the turn. These turns, rhythmically swivelling the skis in arcs left and right, he christened the windscreen wiper turns. He is an accomplished guide for heliskiing, one of the first European guides, along with Hans Gmoser, to exploit the Bugaboos in British Columbia in the 1970s, with waist deep powder snow (often 150,000 vertical feet per week or more). He later developed his own line of skis suited for powder skiing. These were relatively short and wide metal skis, designed to be quick turning in powder snow, as well as to be easily loaded outside the helicopters. His extreme exploits involved considerable preparations, studying the mountain, the snow, and the terrain over an extended period of time. Saudan is now a motivational speaker for corporate executives, using his films to demonstrate the leap in courage it takes to conquer new peaks and new challenges.

History Former logo Sir William ffolkes, chairman 1902‚Äì1912 In 1902, the council consisted solely of landowners. =Chairmen of the council prior to 1974= 1889-1902 Robert Gurdon, 1st Baron Cranworth 1902-1912 Sir William Browne-ffolkes 1912-1920 John Holmes Esq. 1920-1925 Ailwyn Fellowes, 1st Baron Ailwyn 1925-1941 Russell Colman Esq. 1941-1950 Sir Henry Upcher 1950-1966 Sir Bartle Edwards 1966-1969 Douglas Sanderson Esq. 1969-1974 John Hayden Esq. : From this point onwards the role of Chairman became ceremonial with the council being run by a Leader. The council, as currently constituted, was established in 1974 following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972, which replaced the two previous county authorities (the County Borough of Norwich and the County of Norfolk) with a single top tier authority for the whole of Norfolk. Politics Norfolk County Council is currently (since May 2016) run by a Conservative Administration. Norfolk County Council has traditionally been known as a Conservative stronghold, being run by them from its formation until 1993. For the period 1993 until 2001 no one party had overal control. The Conservatives won a majority in the 2001 local elections and held the authority until 2013. The countryside is almost all Conservative territory, with few areas being strong for the Liberal Democrats. The urban areas of Norfolk have always been more mixed in their loyalties, however, and seats in Norwich, Great Yarmouth, and King's Lynn are often held by the Labour Party. From 2009 to 2013 the Greens held the greatest number of Norfolk County Council electoral divisions within the city of Norwich. Following the county elections of May 2013, Norfolk County Council was under no overall control, the Conservatives being the largest party on the council, with 40 Conservative councillors, UKIP having 15, Labour 14, the Liberal Democrats 10, and the Green Party 4, plus 1 Independent councillor. In a by-election in August 2013, the Labour Party gained one seat from UKIP, thus taking over from UKIP as the second largest political group on the county council. Norfolk County Council's ruling administration was made up of an alliance of non-Conservative councillors (14 UKIP, 15 Labour, 10 Liberal Democrat, 4 Green and 1 independent) with a Labour leader until May 2016. The alliance collapsed in May 2016 when the Green Party withdrew its support resulting in the Council electing a Conservative Leader, and that in turn lead to a minority Conservative administration running the council until May 2017. In the Local Elections of May 2017 the Conservatives won an overall majority of the seats and were able to form a majority administration. The results were Conservative 55, Labour 17, Liberal Democrats 11 with both UKIP and the Green Party losing all their seats on the council. In April 2014 a project to establish an incinerator at King's Lynn was scrapped by the Labour lead alliance under Cllr George Nobbs when the members of the council voted by 48 to 30 to end the authority's contract with the firm Cory Wheelabrator after a heated debate at County Hall in Norwich on 7 April. That decision was directly followed by a cabinet meeting, in which the administration voted unanimously to axe the scheme. This decision meant the council had to pay compensation to the company of several million pounds. In May 2018 just one week after being re-elected Leader of the council for a further year Cllr. Cliff Jordan resigned from his position and his seat on the council due to ill health. The following month at an Extraordinary Meeting of the Council Cllr. Andrew Proctor was elected Leader. =Election results= :For the election results, see Norfolk County Council elections Economy and business The council spends an average of ¬£56.5 million a month with suppliers. Education See also List of schools in Norfolk The council is in charge of all Nursery, Primary and Secondary state schools throughout Norfolk which are not academies, but not Tertiary education. There are three nursery schools, 359 primary schools, 35 secondary schools, one all-through school, one free school, one short stay school and 11 special schools. The council provides a school finder for parents to find children a school. The primary school curriculum is set by the government, and recorded on Directgov. The secondary (high) school curriculum is set by the government, and recorded on Directgov. There are compulsory subjects which are needed to be followed in Norfolk and England. In Year 9 (sometimes Year 8), children are required to pick their GCSE options for the forecoming year. In England, a student must take at least two optional choices. In February 2013, Ofsted inspectors judged that vulnerable children in the county were at risk. Shortly afterwards, the regulator expressed concern about the county's educational provision. Three years later, in August 2016, Ofsted found that Norfolk County Council had still failed to address the regulator's earlier judgements (in February and August 2013, respectively) that the council's arrangements for the protection of children and for services for looked after children were 'inadequate'. In 2017 after further inspection the rating was raised to 'requires improvement' after considerable progress in the department. Health and Social Care The council is responsible for coordinating and managing the Adult Social Care of the population of Norfolk. This work was overseen by the Adult Social Care Committee based at County Hall. However, in May 2019 the committee was abolished and its responsibilities transferred to the Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care, Public Health and Prevention. Since 2012 the Health and Wellbeing Board for Norfolk and Waveney has been responsible for Public Health in the county. The board has been chaired by Cllr. Bill Borrett since 2017, it comprises representatives from most NHS bodies such as the five Clinical Commissioning Groups and the three Norfolk Acute Hospitals as well as Norfolk and Waveney's County and District Councils. See Healthcare in Norfolk for the details of the different NHS bodies charged with delivering health in the county. Transportation Norfolk County Council is responsible for maintaining Norfolk's road networks and bus routes. They often go into schools and promote road safety to students. Conservation Norfolk County Council public footpath signpost Norfolk County Council offered grant aid for landscape conservation, submitted to the Director of Planning and Transportation. Many historic buildings in the county are protected by the Norfolk Historic Buildings Trust, established in 1977, which is under the guidance of the county council. Between 1995 and 2000, the Trust played a major role in restoring the Denver Mill site, at a cost of over ¬£1 million.

In the Middle Ages Bajwada was an important town, as reflected by the prominence of its mention in Mughal records.The Punjab under the Mughals, by Muhammad Akbar, Ripon Press, 1948 - Page 21 Various Mohyal ballads, especially the Vishav Rai Niti, extol the feats and fierce swordsmanship of the early rulers of Bajwada especially Vishav Rai and Ballal Sen, and consist of verses that also glorify the damages inflicted by their armies on the Ghaznavid sultans, when the latter were on their way to or returning from raids of other Indian cities. Many names of the Lau clan in Mohyal folklore and records closely match names from the Sena dynasty of Bengal, like Ballal Sen and Lau Sen.

It is often used in discussions of ancient cast coinage of central Italy, especially Etruscan coins and Roman Republican coinage. The adjective libral is related to libra, the Ancient Roman unit of weight, and is not related to the word liberal. The libral standard began with the era of the so-called aes grave (heavy bronze) cast coinage of Rome, from circa 280 BC, where one as weighed one Roman pound (libra), or twelve Roman ounces (unciae). This changed when the weight of the aes grave was decreased to approximately 10 unciae (the \\"light libral standard\\") circa 265-217 BC, remaining at that level until about 217 BC. It then suddenly fell to 6 unciae (the \\"semi-libral standard\\") around the start of the second Punic war in about 217 BC, before finally falling still further until about 141 BC.Crawford 1974:131-236 The libral/semi-libral standards were followed by the triental standards and the sextantal standard. Many Greek city states (colonies) were founded on the Italian peninsula and Sicily during this time period; these are collectively referred to as Magna Graecia. The coinage of those city-states is more closely related to the rest of the ancient Greek world (which included many colonies along the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts), and generally has no relationship to the Etruscan/Roman units.

It holds approximately 32,000 pieces of weaponry, tools, suits of armour for battle and ones for parades. Between the 15th century and the 18th century, Styria was on the front line of almost continuous conflict with the Ottoman Empire and with rebels in Hungary. In order to defend itself it needed troops and these troops needed equipment. The Styrian Armoury results from the resulting need to store large quantities of armour and weapons, and was built from 1642 - 1645 by a Tyrolean architect called Antonio Solar. After about 100 years in use, Austrian empress Maria Theresia wanted to close down the armoury, as part of her centralisation of the defence of Austria. Nevertheless, Styria petitioned for the ongoing existence of the armoury for both practical and sentimental reasons. Their petition was accepted and the Armoury was left intact, but largely decommissioned. During World War II, the entire contents were moved to safety in three castles in remote parts of Styria, and no losses were recorded. After the end of the war, the objects were brought back into the undamaged original building. Armour in the Armory The armoury is situated in Graz's Inner City, a few steps from Hauptplatz at Herrengasse Nr. 16. The armoury is open six days a week, closed Mondays, throughout the year. In winter, it can only be visited through guided tours.

Keokuk's Reserve was a parcel of land in the present-day U.S. state of Iowa that was retained by the Sauk and Fox tribes in 1832 in the aftermath of the Black Hawk War. The tribes stayed on the reservation only until 1836 when the land was ceded to the United States, and the Native Americans were moved to a new reservation. Treaty terms The terms of the treaty that ended the Black Hawk War resulted in the United States' gaining a large section of present-day Iowa known as the Black Hawk Purchase. Keokuk's Reserve was carved out of this cession. The treaty stipulated that the reserve include Keokuk's Village, about from the Mississippi River, as well as equal portions of land on either side of the Iowa River. The reserve was a area along either side of the Iowa River. The boundary crossed the Iowa River and extended to the southeast where it terminated beyond Keokuk's Village.Kappler, Charles. ed. \\"Treaty with the Sauk and Foxes, 1832\\", 21 September 1832, Government Printing Office, Washington D.C.: 1904, Oklahoma State University: Digital Collections, accessed 23 April 2008.

Iowa: Its History and Its Foremost Citizens, \\"Part II: The Indians\\", (Google Books), (Online transcript), (Map) S.J. Clarke, 1918, Iowa History Project: Book transcriptions, accessed April 23, 2008. Life on the reservation After the attrition of the Black Hawk War, the Sauk and Fox peoples were forced onto Keokuk's Reservation per the treaty they signed following the war. From the beginning, the reservation was depleted of game and poor in resources. Keokuk's leadership declined as he increasingly consumed alcohol. Between 1833 and 1845 the Sauk and Fox population decreased more than 50 percent, from more than 6,000 to about 1,200 from each tribe. The community continued to decline as alcohol gained a stronger hold among the peoples. Political discord also tore the groups apart.Trask, Kerry A. Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, (Google Books), Henry Holt Publishers, New York City: 2007, pp. 303-05, (). Cession to the United States On September 28, 1836 a new treaty was signed which ceded all of the land within Keokuk's Reserve to the United States government. The treaty was signed near Davenport, Iowa and attended by Henry Dodge, and more than 1,000 chiefs and braves, including the aged Black Hawk, from the Sauk and Fox nations.Andreas, A.T. Illustrated Historical Atlas of the State of Iowa, 1875, (Google Books), State Historical Society, 1970, (Online transcript ), accessed April 23, 2008. The treaty text states that the reasoning behind the Sauk and Foxe's decision to cede the land was to \\"(obtain) additional means of support, and to pay their just creditors\\". The result for the Sauk and Fox living within Keokuk's Reserve was that they were removed to another reservation along the Des Moines River. An Indian Agency was established on that reservation at the present-day location of Agency, Iowa.Anonymous. History of Western Iowa, Its Settlement and Growth, (Google Books), Western Publishing Company, Sioux City, Iowa: 1882, pp. 33-36. In addition, the treaty stipulated payment to Sauk and Fox of US$30,000 in June 1837 and $10,000 per year for ten succeeding years. The treaty also made other stipulations including a $1,000 payment to the widow of Felix St. Vrain and about $48,000 for the Sauk and Fox to settle their debts.Kappler, Charles. ed. \\"Treaty with the Sauk and Foxes, 1836 \\", September 28, 1836, Government Printing Office, Washington D.C.: 1904, Oklahoma State University: Digital Collections, accessed April 23, 2007. After their removal to the new reservation along the Des Moines, Joseph M. Street, agent to the Winnebago, was appointed agent to the Sauk and Fox. A farmhouse was erected as well as two mills; one of the mills was destroyed by flood but the other remained for several years. Keokuk and two other chiefs, Wapello and Appanoose, tended farm fields on the reservation. According to the 1882 History of Western Iowa, Its Settlement and Growth, much of the community began to suffer from \\"dissipation\\" (drunkenness), including Keokuk.

Invertebrates  Color vision requires a number of opsin molecules with different absorbance peaks, and at least three opsins were present in the ancestor of chelicerates and pancrustaceans; members of both these groups today possess color vision.  Vertebrates  Researchers studying the opsin genes responsible for color-vision pigments have long known that four photopigment opsins exist in birds, reptiles and teleost fish.Yokoyama, S., and B. F. Radlwimmer. 2001. The molecular genetics and evolution of red and green color vision in vertebrates. Genetics Society of America. 158: 1697-1710. This indicates that the common ancestor of tetrapods and amniotes (‚âà360 million years ago) had tetrachromatic vision ‚Äî the ability to see four dimensions of color (or three not counting brightness).  Mammals  Today, most mammals possess dichromatic vision, corresponding to protanopia red‚Äìgreen color blindness. They can thus see violet, blue, green and yellow light, but cannot see ultraviolet, and deep red light. This was probably a feature of the first mammalian ancestors, which were likely small, nocturnal, and burrowing. At the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event million years ago, the burrowing ability probably helped mammals survive extinction. Mammalian species of the time had already started to differentiate, but were still generally small, comparable in size to shrews; this small size would have helped them to find shelter in protected environments.  Monotremes and marsupials  It is postulated that some early monotremes, marsupials, and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing, as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today. Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary environmental stresses. However, many such species evidently possessed poor color vision in comparison with non-mammalian vertebrate species of the time, including reptiles, birds, and amphibians.  Primates  Since the beginning of the Paleogene Period, surviving mammals enlarged, moving away by adaptive radiation from a burrowing existence and into the open, although most species kept their relatively poor color vision. Exceptions occur for some marsupials (which possibly kept their original color vision) and some primates‚Äîincluding humans. Primates, as an order of mammals, began to emerge around the beginning of the Paleogene Period. Primates have re-developed trichromatic color vision since that time, by the mechanism of gene duplication, being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard. Ability to perceive red and orange hues allows tree-dwelling primates to discern them from green. This is particularly important for primates in the detection of red and orange fruit, as well as nutrient-rich new foliage, in which the red and orange carotenoids have not yet been masked by chlorophyll. Another theory is that detecting skin flushing and thereby mood may have influenced the development of primate trichromate vision. The color red also has other effects on primate and human behavior, as discussed in the color psychology article.Diana Widermann, Robert A. Barton, and Russel A. Hill. Evolutionary perspectives on sport and competition. In Today, among simians, the catarrhines (Old World monkeys and apes, including humans) are routinely trichromatic‚Äîmeaning that both males and females possess three opsins, sensitive to short-wave, medium-wave, and long-wave light‚Äîwhile, conversely, only a small fraction of platyrrhine primates (New World monkeys) are trichromats.Surridge, A. K., and D. Osorio. 2003. Evolution and selection of trichromatic vision in primates. Trends in Ecol. and Evol. 18: 198-205.

She started her career with success in pop music in the sixties. She later became an interpreter of songs, composer, an actress and then finally an artistic researcher. She is primarily noted for being a singer in the Sardinian language, her native tongue. Sannia died in Cagliari at the age of 61 on April 14, 2008.  Biography  Having been a basketball player with good level in Cus Cagliari (which also called the national), Marisa Sannia began her musical career in the early sixties, winning a competition for new items that allowed her to get a record deal with the Cetra Fonit. Her talent was spotted by Sergio Endrigo and Luis Enriquez Bacalov that sought to tap into composing a piece for her debut recording \\"All or nothing\\" and promoting its participation in 1967, on television as \\"Scala Reale\\" and \\"Settevoci\\". The recognition received by the television appearances allowed her to participate the same year two musicarelli: \\"Kids of yellow flag\\", \\"Stasera mi butto\\", alongside Giancarlo Giannini. After a few small successes (A postcard, Be proud of me - award of record criticism), and participation in Festivalbar 1967 where she ranked in the third round for young artists, Sannia achieved wide popularity in 1968 when she finished second in the Sanremo Music Festival with the song \\"Casa Bianca\\", written by Don Backy and sung along with Ornella Vanoni, who became a great success, so as to be inserted in the soundtrack of the film \\"Alfredo Alfredo\\", by Pietro Germi. After the success Sanremo, Sannia published her first album. Followed by several successful songs: \\"A tear\\", \\"the company\\" (composed by Carlo Donida and Mogol and resumed in 1976 by Lucio Battisti and then in 2007 by Vasco Rossi), \\"Love is a dove\\", \\"How sweet the evening tonight\\" and \\"my land\\". Sannia also worked in film and participated in various events such as singing Canzonissima (1972, inter alia with a song by Nino Tristan, \\"A Kite\\"), the International Festival of Light Music of Venice, A Song for Europe in Switzerland and again in 1970 in San Remo in 1971 and 1984. In the early seventies she devoted herself to theater by participating in two musicals (Cain and Abel and stories suburbs) very successful alongside Tony Cucchiara and in some work directed by Giorgio Albertazzi. Still under the wing of Sergio Endrigo, she also participated in the album The Ark, a collection of songs by Vinicius de Moraes dedicated to children. In 1973 she published a disc with songs taken from the Walt Disney movie entitled Sannia Wonderland. In 1976 her first songwriting collection was published with the interesting title \\"The pasta sheet\\". In the early eighties Sannia also appeared in television drama \\"George Sand\\" with Albertazzi, Anna Proclemer and Paola Borboni and participated in the film by Pupi Avati \\"Help me to dream\\". In 1984 she returned to Sanremo with \\"love Love\\" that followed a long period of isolation from the scene. In 1993 she returned with a disc in the Sardinian language in which the verses of music Antioco Casula, Sardinian poet active in the first half of the twentieth century, entitled . Sannia later returned to the theater with Albertazzi in \\"memories of Adriano\\" - Portrait of an entry of 1995. In 1997 recorded the new disc Melagran√†da in collaboration with the contemporary poet writer Francesco Masala in a collection from the Poesias in duas limbas. In 2002 she participated in \\"songs for you\\", a tribute to Sergio Endrigo, interpreting \\"Hands holes\\". In 2003 she published a third collection in the Sardinian language, and \\"Nanas and Janas\\", with new words and music written by herself. This research is poetic and musical recital summarized in \\"Songs between two languages on the way of poetry\\" presented in important exhibitions in Italy and abroad as The Night of the Poets all'anfiteatro Nora Roman, at Taormina Film Festival and as part of the exhibition Rome Meets the World . In January 2006 she took part in the concert tribute to Sergio Endrigo, entitled \\"Hello Poet\\" and collected in a CD / DVD, which interprets \\"The White Rose\\" and \\"How ever tonight.\\" Her last work, posthumously published and distributed (Felmay - Egea distributions) in November 2008 (preview Premio Tenco) and Sannia \\"Rosa de papel\\" is dedicated to the life and poetry of Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. This is a collection of 12 songs, and is particularly dear to the singer/Songwriter who has put to music the poems of the great poet of youth. Among the songs are some real musical gems as: \\"El nino mudo\\", \\"Rosa de papel\\", \\"Laberytos y espeyos\\", \\"Hi cerrado my balcon\\". She also won the Festival della Canzone d'Autore for Children. Sannia was interested in the work of other artists. And some of her own compositions have been covered also in Spain by the singer Ester Formosa. Due to a sudden and serious illness Sannia died April 14, 2008. In August 2008, the \\"Maria Carta\\" award was established in her memory. In January 2009, the artist Maria Lai dedicated Sannia an exhibition of her works to Sannia.

Built as a private residence in 1875, it has served as the headquarters of the General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) since 1922. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1991 for its association with the federation, which serves as an umbrella organization for women's clubs, a social movement dating to the mid-19th century. and Tours of the headquarters, available by appointment, provide information about the activities of the GFWC and several historic rooms, including the 1734 entryway, the Julia Ward Howe Drawing Room, the dining room, music room and the GFWC International President's office. The headquarters also features changing exhibits of art, photographs and artifacts from its collections. Description and building history The GFWC headquarters is located southeast of Dupont Circle, on the south side of N Street between St. Matthew's Court and 17th Street. It is a four-story masonry structure, built out of ashlar stone in a Renaissance Revival style. The entrance is in a slightly raised basement level, sheltered by a splayed glass and iron marquee with supporting ironwork brackets. The main floor windows are elongated, with paired casement windows topped by transoms, and keystoned lintels. A polygonal bay projects from the first two floors on the left, and a shallower rectangular one projects to the right of the entrance; both are topped by lower balustrades. The interior has been adapted for the GFWC's use, but retains some original finishes. The house was built in 1875 by Rear Admiral William Radford, at a time when the Dupont Circle area was being developed as a fashionable residential neighborhood. In 1895 he sold the house to the state of Massachusetts, which gave it to General Nelson A. Miles in recognition for his military service. It was next owned by John Jay White, a big-game hunter who traveled with Theodore Roosevelt, and who commissioned the murals by Albert Herter that adorn some of its walls. In 1922 the house was purchased by the GFWC for use as its headquarters, a role it continues to play today. The GFWC represents the culmination of smaller-scale women's organizations that sprang up in the 19th century, generally to improve the conditions for working and single women. It was the first nationwide organization of this type, enabling a broader scope of influence by these local and regional organizations.

Cir. 2006), cert. denied by 127 S.Ct. 3054 (2007), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States protect the right of a student in the public schools to wear a shirt insulting the President of the United States and depicting images relating to drugs and alcohol.  Overview  The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibits Congress, among other things, from passing any law \\"abridging the freedom of speech.\\" The Fourteenth Amendment likewise prohibits State governments from \\"depriv[ing] any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\\" The courts have interpreted the \\"liberty\\" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to encompass the freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment. See, e.g., Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235 (1963); Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 707 (1931); Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 368 (1931).  Factual background  The plaintiff in this case, a student at Williamstown Middle High School in Vermont, had worn a T-shirt displaying the name \\"George W. Bush\\" and the words \\"Chicken-Hawk-In-Chief,\\" underneath of which there was \\"a large picture of the President's face, wearing a helmet, superimposed on the body of a chicken.\\"Guiles, 461 F.3d at 322. Alongside the picture of the President was a depiction of \\"three lines of cocaine and a razor blade.\\" The wings of the \\"chicken\\" were depicted holding a straw and an alcoholic beverage. At the bottom of and on the back of the T-shirt there was additional verbiage making fun of Bush and, among other things, accusing him of being addicted to cocaine. Depictions of Bush, cocaine and alcohol were also present on the sleeves. After plaintiff had worn this shirt several times over a period of weeks, another student complained to a teacher, but was informed that the shirt constituted political speech, protected by law. However, after receiving a complaint from a parent, the defendant in the case, a school employee, asked the student to cover up the parts of the shirt pertaining to drugs and alcohol, or turn the shirt inside-out, or wear a different shirt, in accordance with the school system's dress code, which prohibits \\"any aspect of a\\" student's \\"appearance, which constitutes a real hazard to the health and safety of self and others or is otherwise distracting,\\" (emphasis added) including \\"[c]lothing displaying alcohol, drugs, violence, obscenity, and racism.\\"Guiles, 461 F.3d at 322, quoting the WMHS Student/Parent Handbook 2003-2004. The student refused, and after the student's father had the opportunity to speak with the superintendent, the defendant school administrator completed a \\"discipline referral form\\" and sent the student home. After the student returned to school, he wore the T-shirt covered by duct tape (as required by the school), on top of which was written the word \\"censored.\\" The student sued the school administrators (the student support specialist, the principal and the superintendent) in order to have the disciplinary referral expunged from his record, and to enjoin the school from enforcing the dress code policy against him. The district court, applying the Supreme Court precedent set in Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser,. held that the images depicted on the shirt were \\"plainly offensive or inappropriate\\" and that the school was therefore entitled to enforce its dress-code policy, but also ordered the expungement of the offense from the student's disciplinary record. Both the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed.  The issue decided by the court  Can a school discipline a student for wearing a shirt that displays images of drugs and alcohol as part of a political message?  The decision of the court  The court of appeals held that the T-shirt, in spite of its depiction of drugs and alcohol, was protected speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. In its decision, the court analyzed the facts in light of the following three Supreme Court cases: Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503 (1969), Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675 (1986) and Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260 (1988). In Tinker, the United States Supreme Court held that a school may not ban students from wearing black armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. The Tinker case thus stands for the proposition that \\"a student may 'express his opinions, even on controversial subjects ... if he does so without materially and substantially interfer[ing] with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school and without colliding with the rights of others,' Tinker 393 U.S. at 513 (alteration in original). The rule of Tinker has come to mean that a school may not regulate student expression unless the regulation may be 'justified by a showing that the student['s] [speech] would materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.'\\"Guiles, 461 F.3d at 324-25. In Fraser, however, the Supreme Court held that a school could discipline a student for making a speech at a public assembly that \\"is 'vulgar,' 'lewd,' 'indecent,' or 'plainly offensive.'\\"Guiles, 461 F.3d at 324-25, quoting Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. at 683-85 Fraser can be thought of as an exception to the general rule set forth in Tinker: student speech is generally protected under the Constitution, but the protection does not apply if the speech is \\"plainly offensive.\\"See Guiles, 461 F.3d at 327-28. Whether Guiles' T-shirt was plainly offensive or not was a question of first impression in the Second Circuit; in this case, considering an analogous decision in Frederick v. Morse, 439 F.3d 1114 (9th Cir. 2006), the court held that the T-shirt is not \\"plainly offensive,\\" and therefore falls within the protection of the Constitution as interpreted in Tinker, rather than being subject to regulation in accordance with Fraser. [The holding in Frederick v. Morse was subsequently overruled by the Supreme Court, but this does not affect the precedential value of Guiles v. Marineau within the Second Circuit.See ] In Hazelwood, the Supreme Court permitted schools to regulate the content of a school newspaper, on the grounds that there is a \\"distinction between school-sponsored speech and student speech.\\".Guiles, 461 F.3d at 325. The student's T-shirt was not school-sponsored, nor was there any appearance of sponsorship by the school, and therefore Hazelwood was inapplicable in this case.Guiles, 461 F.3d at 327. Finally, the Guiles court held that the plaintiff's rights were violated even by the limited intervention of the school staff (who had given the plaintiff the choice of changing shirts, wearing the shirt inside out, or covering the depictions of drugs and alcohol). The court stated that \\"[t]he pictures\\" that the school administrators wanted the student to obscure \\"are an important part of the political message\\" that he \\"wished to convey, accentuating the anti- drug (and anti-Bush) message. By covering them defendants diluted the student's \\"message, blunting its force and impact. Such censorship may be justified under Tinker only when the substantial disruption test is satisfied.\\"Guiles, 461 F.3d at 331. As the student had worn the shirt on several days with no disruption to classroom activities, there are no grounds for the school to take any action against him.

It was discovered on 22 May 1980, by Belgian astronomer Henri Debehogne at ESO's La Silla Observatory in northern Chile. The V-type asteroid has a rotation period of 15.6 hours. It was named after Brazilian astronomer Ronaldo Rog√©rio de Freitas Mour√£o.  Orbit and classification  Mour√£o is a core member of the Vesta family. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite (HED meteorites) and are thought to have originated deep within 4 Vesta's crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere near the South pole, formed as a result of a subcatastrophic collision. I has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (Zappala; double classification by Nesvorny), one of the largest asteroid clans in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,309 days; semi-major axis of 2.34 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as ' at Uccle Observatory in November 1949. The body's observation arc begins with at precovery taken at Purple Mountain Observatory in October 1973, almost seven years prior to its official discovery observation at La Silla.  Naming  This minor planet was named in honor of Brazilian astronomer Ronaldo Rog√©rio de Freitas Mour√£o (1935‚Äì2014) at the National Observatory of Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro. His activities included the study of double stars, minor planets and comets. He participated extensively in ESO's discoverer program of observations of minor planets. Mour√£o also wrote several astronomical books and was the founder of the Brazilian Museum for Astronomy (). The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 July 1985 ().  Physical characteristics  Mour√£o has been characterized as a bright V-type asteroid. V-type asteroids are less common than the abundant S-type asteroids but similar in composition, except for their higher concentration of pyroxenes, an aluminium-rich silicate mineral. = Albedo = According to the survey carried out by the WISE and subsequent NEOWISE mission, the body's albedo amounts to 0.61, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a somewhat less extraordinary value of 0.4. = Lightcurves = Photometric observations of this asteroid by Slovak astronomer Adri√°n Gal√°d in September 2006, gave a rotational lightcurve with a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of magnitude (). A second, less secure lightcurve was obtained by Italian astronomers Roberto Crippa and Federico Manzini in September 2013, which gave a divergent period of hours with an amplitude of 0.46 magnitude ().

From 1701 to 1704 he studied philosophy in Lublin, earning a master's degree. In 1707 Niesiecki started his studies in theology at the Jagiellonian University, graduating in 1711. He undertook further study in Lutsk, Krosno, Bydgoszcz, Chojnice and Kalisz. Between 1715 and 1723 Niesiecki worked as a preacher in Masovia, Greater Poland, Lesser Poland and Ruthenia. He taught rhetoric in Bydgoszcz and Chojnice, and ethics and mathematics in Kalisz. From 1724 he lived in the monastery of Krasnystaw, where he engaged in his life's work, compiling the Herbarz Polski (Polish Armorial). Niesiecki died there on 9 July 1744. The first volume of Herbarz Polski was published in 1728 in Lw√≥w. Niesiecki wanted to write it in Latin, but his patron, Marianna from Potocki-Tar≈Çowa, specified that it was to be published in Polish. Because Niesiecki tried to not use unverified sources and legends, he was opposed by the szlachta (Polish nobility). He continued with the work; however, there were delays in printing the next volumes. After the fourth volume was published attacks by the nobles increased; they sent letters of protest to his Polish and Roman superiors. Work on the fifth volume was interrupted by his death; it was completed by Stanis≈Çaw Czapli≈Ñski, but never published. In the opinion of historians, the work of Niesiecki obeys all world-standards of genealogy.

The son of a wealthy leather merchant, Sladen was born near Halifax, Yorkshire on 30 June 1849. He was educated at Hipperholme Grammar School and Marlborough College, but received no university training. As a young man he indulged his hobby of natural history, but soon become fascinated with echinoderms. In 1876 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and the following year became a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. 1877 also saw the publication of his first paper, in which he split the sea-lily genus Poteriocrinus into four; in his lifetime, Sladen would gain a reputation as a \\"splitter\\" because of his proclivity for declaring specimens to belong to new genera or species. Late that year he began a long and fruitful collaboration with Duncan; which would see the publication of some 15 co-authored papers, many on fossils, over the course of twelve years. The Percy Sladen collection of echinoderms is one of the most significant outside any national collection. Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter From December 1878, Sladen spent three month at Naples under the auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. His work there, on echinoderm pedicellariae, established his reputation as a leading authority on echinoderms, and in 1881 he was invited to organise and write up an account of the starfishes collected during the Challenger expedition. This would take him a decade to complete, and comprise nearly 1000 pages and 118 plates. By 1890, Sladen married Constance Anderson of York. She was sister of Tempest Anderson the volcanologist, and Yarborough Anderson, a barrister. Her father William Charles Anderson was a surgeon and Sheriff of York. By that time Sladen was on the Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Zoological Secretary of the Linnean Society of London, and also active in the Zoological Society of London and the Geological Society of London. He therefore relocated to London, at least temporarily. Unfortunately much of Sladen's later life was interrupted by poor health. In 1895 he was elected Vice-President of the Linnean Society, but only a few months later he gave up both this and his secretarial position because of health problems. He completed only two more papers before retiring in 1898 to an Exeter estate inherited on the death of his uncle. He died there two years later, on 11 June 1900. Following his death, Sladen's wife helped preserve her husband's memory by donating his large collection of echinoderms to the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, and endowing the Percy Sladen Memorial Trust, to be administered by the Linnean Society to support scientific research.

It was discovered on 24 January 1982, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station in Arizona, United States. The likely S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 19.7 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named for English astronomers Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon.  Orbit and classification  Orbital diagram of Mason‚ÄìDixon Mason‚ÄìDixon is a core member of the Koronis family (), a very large asteroid family of almost 6,000 known asteroids with nearly co-planar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8‚Äì3.1 AU once every 5 years (1,825 days; semi-major axis of 2.92 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body was first observed at Heidelberg Observatory in February 1922. Its observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in July 1954. On 1 February 1907, Mason‚ÄìDixon made a close approach to one of the larger asteroids, 52 Europa. At its closest, it passed Europa within 1.1 million kilometers.  Naming  This minor planet was named by the discoverer in memory of English astronomers Charles Mason (1728‚Äì1786) and Jeremiah Dixon (1733‚Äì1779), who observed the 1761 transit of Venus from the Cape of Good Hope. Between 1763 and 1767 they surveyed the so-called Mason‚ÄìDixon line, the boundary between the US States of Pennsylvania and Maryland. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 June 1986 ().  Physical characteristics  The asteroid's spectral type has not been determined. Due its membership to the stony Koronis family, Mason‚ÄìDixon is likely a common S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In January 2012, a rotational lightcurve of Mason‚ÄìDixon was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of 0.70 magnitude (), indicative of an elongated, non-spherical shape. Another fragmentary lightcurve by Maurice Clark at Preston Gott Observatory in September 2014 gave a less accurate period of 10.20 hours with an amplitude of 0.75 magnitude. = Diameter and albedo = Assuming a typical albedo of 0.15 for members of the Koronis family, Mason‚ÄìDixon measures 14 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.00. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 18.6 kilometers.

A Republican and former actor and governor of California, he energized the conservative movement in the United States from 1964. His basic foreign policy was to equal and surpass the Soviet Union in military strength, and put it on the road to what he called \\"the ash heap of history\\". By 1985, he began to co-operate closely with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev‚Äìthey even became friends‚Äìand negotiated large-scale disarmament projects. The Cold War was fading away and suddenly ended as Soviets lost control of Eastern Europe almost overnight in October 1989, nine months after Reagan was replaced in the White House by his vice president George H. W. Bush, who was following Reagan's policies. The Soviet Union itself was dissolved in December 1991. In terms of the Reagan doctrine, he promoted military, financial, and diplomatic support for anti-Communist insurgencies in Afghanistan, Nicaragua, and numerous other countries. For the most part, local communist power collapsed when the Soviet Union collapsed. In domestic affairs, at a time of stagflation with high unemployment and high inflation, he took dramatic steps. They included a major tax cut, and large-scale deregulation of business activities. He took steps to weaken labor unions and found a bipartisan long-term fix to protect the Social Security system. Although he had the support from the Religious Right, he generally avoided or downplayed social issues such as abortion, homosexuality, and racial integration. He spoke out for prayers in public schools but did not promote a constitutional amendment to allow it. Fighting drugs was a high priority, He appointed the first women to the Supreme Court. He became an iconic figure who was often praised by future Republican candidates for the presidency. Leadership Ronald Reagan with a cowboy hat at Rancho Del Cielo. \\"Ronald Reagan was convivial, upbeat, courteous, respectful, self-confident, and humble. But he was also opaque, remote, distant, and inscrutable,\\" says historian Melvyn P. Leffler According to James P. Pfiffner, University Professor of Public Policy at George Mason University, Reagan was a larger-than-life character, a formidable politician, and an important president. His complexity produced a \\"presidency of paradoxes,\\" in which dramatic successes mingled with unfortunate failures. His strengths included broad vision and clear direction. Voters appreciated his optimism, geniality, and gracious nature, which made his ideals seem all that more attractive. He believed that all national problems were simple problems, and had faith in simple solutions. That strengthened his resolve but also led to failures when there were deep complications. Paradoxically, his victories depended on his willingness to make pragmatic compromises without forsaking his ideals. Reagan himself made the major policy decisions, and often overruled his top advisers in cases such as the Reykjav√≠k Summit in 1986, and his 1987 speech calling for tearing down the Berlin wall. He was concerned with very broad issues, as well as anecdotal evidence to support his beliefs. He paid very little attention to details and elaborate briefings. When senior officials did not work out, such as Secretary of State Al Haig, they were fired. Reagan went through a series of six national security advisers before settling on people he trusted. Indeed, the one of them John Poindexter was trusted too much.\\"In Poindexter's case, Reagan trusted a subordinate who... lacked the more elusive quality of sound political judgment.\\" Robert M. Collins, Transforming America: Politics and Culture During the Reagan Years (2009) p. 231. Poindexter and his aide Oliver North engaged in a secret deal with Iran called the Iran‚ÄìContra affair that seriously damaged Reagan's reputation. Reagan had rarely travelled abroad, and relied on an inner circle of advisers who were not foreign policy experts, including his wife, James Baker, Edwin Meese and Michael Deaver. Haig had the credentials to be Secretary of State, but he was arrogant and unable to get along with the other top aides. He was replaced by George P. Shultz, who proved much more collaborative, and has been generally admired by historians. Other key players included William J. Casey, director of the CIA, William P. Clark, national security advisor, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, Ambassador to the United Nations. Casper W. Weinberger, Secretary of Defense, successfully rebuilt and expanded the military, but did not coordinate well with the foreign policy leadership.H.W. Brands, Reagan: The Life (2015) 240-54, 378-81. Foreign policy Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev at Rancho del Cielo. =Cold War= Reagan served as President during the last part of the Cold War, an era of escalating ideological disagreements and preparations for war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Reagan in 1982 denounced the enemy as an \\"evil empire\\" that would be consigned to the \\"ash heap of history\\" and he later predicted that communism would collapse. He reversed the policy of d√©tente and massively built up the United States military. He proposed the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a defense project that planned to use ground and space-based missile defense systems to protect the United States from attack. Reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible.Beschloss, Michael (2007), p. 293 Reagan was convinced that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with. =Policy toward USSR= Reagan forcefully confronted the Soviet Union, marking a sharp departure from the d√©tente observed by his predecessors Nixon, Ford, and Carter. Under the assumption that the Soviet Union was financially unable to match the United States in a renewed arms race, he accelerated increases in defense spending begun during the Carter Administration and strove to make the Cold War economically and rhetorically hot.Andrew E. Busch, \\"Ronald Reagan and the Defeat of the Soviet Empire\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly (1997) 27#3 1997. pp 451-66. online Reagan had three motivations. First he agreed with the neoconservatives who argued that the Soviets had pulled ahead in military power and the U.S. had to race to catch up. Stansfield Turner, CIA director under Carter, warned in 1981 that, \\"in the last several years all of the best studies have shown that the balance of strategic nuclear capabilities has been tipping in favor of the Soviet Union.\\"Lou Cannon, President Reagan:The Role of a Lifetime (2000) p. 132. Second, Reagan believed the decrepit Soviet economy could not handle a high-tech weapons race based on computers; it was imperative to block them from gaining western technology.Garthoff, The great transition: American-Soviet relations and the end of the Cold War (1994) pp 38, 155 Third, was the moral certainty that Communism was evil and doomed to failure. Reagan was the first major world leader to declare that Communism would soon collapse.John Arquilla, The Reagan Imprint: Ideas in American Foreign Policy from the Collapse of Communism to the War on Terror (2006) p 38. On March 3, 1983, he was blunt to a religious group: the Soviet Union is \\"the focus of evil in the modern world\\" and could not last: \\"I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose ‚Äî last pages even now are being written.\\"Pemberton, Exit with Honor (1998) p. 130 His most detailed analysis came on June 8, 1982, to the British Parliament, stunning the Soviets and allies alike. Most experts assumed that the Soviet Union would be around for generations to come, and it was essential to recognize that and work with them. But Reagan ridiculed the USSR as an \\"evil empire\\" and argued that it was suffering a deep economic crisis, which he intended to make worse by cutting off western technology. He stated the Soviet Union \\"runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens.\\" Full speech at A year later in 1983 Reagan stunned the world with a totally new idea: the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), labeled \\"star wars\\" by the media, after the current movie. Reagan, following the ideas of Edward Teller (who invented the H-Bomb in 1950) called for a defensive missile umbrella over the U.S. that would intercept and destroy in space any hostile missiles. It was an unexpected, new idea, and supporters cheered, as SDI seemed to promise protection from nuclear destruction. To opponents, SDI meant a new arms race and the end of the Mutual Assured Destruction (\\"MAD\\") strategy that they believed had so far prevented nuclear war. The Soviets were stunned --they lacked basic computers and were unable to say whether it would work or not. Critics said it would cost a trillion dollars; yes said supporters, and the Soviets will go bankrupt if they try to match it. The SDI was in fact funded but was never operational.Pemberton, Exit with Honor (1998) p. 131Weinberger, Fighting for Peace, 291‚Äì97.Garthoff, The great transition: American-Soviet relations and the end of the Cold War (1994) pp 99ff =Defense spending= The Reagan administration made dramatic increases in defense spending one of their three main priorities on taking office. The transition to the new professional all-professional force was finalized, and the draft forgotten. A dramatic expansion of salary bases and benefits for both enlisted and officers made career service much more attractive. Under the aggressive leadership of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, the development of the B-1 bomber was reinstated, and there was funding for a new B-2 bomber, as well as cruise missiles, the MX missile, and a 600 ship Navy. The new weaponry was designed with Soviet targets in mind. In terms of real dollars after taxation, defense spending jump 34 percent between 1981 in 1985. Reagan's two terms, defense spending totaled about 2 trillion dollars, but even so it was a lower percentage of the federal budget or have the GDP, then before 1976.James T. Patterson, Restless Giant pp 200-203.Stephen J. Cimbala, The Reagan Defense Program: An Interim Assessment (1986) table of contents There were arms sales to build up allies as well. The most notable came in 1981, a $8.5 billion sale to Saudi Arabia involving aircraft, tanks, and Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS). Israel protested, since the AWACS would undermine its strategic attack capabilities. To mollify Israel and its powerful lobby in Washington, the United States promised to supply it with an additional F-15 squadron, a $600 million loan, and permission to export Israeli-made Kfir fighting aircraft to Latin American armies.Mitchell Bard, \\"Interest Groups, the President, and Foreign Policy: How Reagan Snatched Victory from the Jaws of Defeat on AWACS.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly (1988): 583-600. onlineArnon Gutfeld, \\"The 1981 AWACS Deal: AIPAC and Israel Challenge Reagan\\" (The Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, 2018) online In its first term administration looked at arms control measures with deep suspicion. However, after the massive buildup, and the second term it looked at them with favor and achieve major arms reductions with Mikhail Gorbachev.James K. Oliver, \\"An Early Assessment of Reagan Defense Policy and Programs.\\" Perspectives on Political Science 19.1 (1990): 51-56. =Nuclear weapons= According to several scholars and Reagan biographers, including, John Lewis Gaddis, Richard Reeves, Lou Cannon and Reagan himself in his autobiography, Reagan earnestly desired the abolition of all nuclear weapons. He proposed to Mikhail Gorbachev that if a missile shield could be built, all nuclear weapons be eliminated and the missile shield technology shared, the world would be much better off. Paul Lettow has argued that Reagan's opposition to nuclear weapons started at the dawn of the nuclear age and in December 1945 he was only prevented from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the Warner Brothers studio.\\"President Reagan's Legacy and U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy.\\" Reagan believed the mutually assured destruction policy formulated in the 1950s to be morally wrong. In his autobiography, Reagan wrote: :The Pentagon said at least 150 million American lives would be lost in a nuclear war with the Soviet Union‚Äîeven if we 'won.' For Americans who survived such a war, I couldn't imagine what life would be like. The planet would be so poisoned the 'survivors' would have no place to live. Even if a nuclear war did not mean the extinction of mankind, it would certainly mean the end of civilization as we knew it. No one could 'win' a nuclear war. Yet as long as nuclear weapons were in existence, there would always be risks they would be used, and once the first nuclear weapon was unleashed, who knew where it would end? My dream, then, became a world free of nuclear weapons. ... For the eight years I was president I never let my dream of a nuclear-free world fade from my mind. Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 (and ratified in 1988), which was the first in Cold War history to mandate the destruction of an entire class of nuclear weapons. =Iran-Iraq= Originally neutral in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of 1980 to 1988, the Reagan administration began supporting Iraq because an Iranian victory would not serve the interests of the United States. In 1983, Reagan issued a National Security Decision Directive memo which called for heightened regional military cooperation to defend oil facilities, measures to improve U.S. military capabilities in the Persian Gulf, directed the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to take appropriate measures to respond to tensions in the area. Economic policy Reagan gives a televised address from the Oval Office, outlining his plan for Tax Reduction Legislation in July 1981 =Economic plans, taxes and deficit= Reagan believed in policies based on supply-side economics and advocated a laissez-faire philosophy,Karaagac, John (2000), p. 113 seeking to stimulate the economy with large, across-the-board tax cuts.Cannon, Lou (2001) p. 99Appleby, Joyce (2003), pp. 923‚Äì24 Reagan pointed to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success. The policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment, which would then lead to increased economic growth, higher employment and wages. Reagan did not believe in raising income taxes. During his presidential tenure, the top federal income tax rates were lowered from 70% to 28%. However, it has also been acknowledged that Reagan did raise taxes on eleven occasions during his presidency in an effort to both preserve his defense agenda and combat the growing national debt and budget deficit. In order to cover the growing federal budget deficits and the decreased revenue that resulted from the cuts, the U.S. borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad, raising the national debt from $1.1 trillion to $2.7 trillion.Cannon, Lou (2001) p. 128 Reagan described the new debt as the \\"greatest disappointment\\" of his presidency. =Free trade= Reagan was a supporter of free trade. When running for President in 1979, Reagan proposed a \\"North American accord\\", in which goods could move freely throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Largely dismissed then, Reagan was serious in his proposal and once in office he signed an agreement with Canada to that effect. His \\"North American accord\\" later became the official North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by President George H. W. Bush and ratified by President Bill Clinton. Reagan understood free trade as including the use of tariffs to protect American jobs and industry against foreign competition. He imposed a temporary 100% tariff on Japanese electronics as well as other tariffs on a variety of industrial products, which resulted in some free market advocates criticizing his policies as protectionist in practice.http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa107.html =Healthcare= Reagan was opposed to socialized healthcare, universal health care, or publicly funded health care. In 1961, while still a member of the Democratic Party, Reagan voiced his opposition to single-payer healthcare in an 11-minute recording.See Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine The idea was beginning to be advocated by the Democratic Party. In it, Reagan stated: > One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people > has been by way of medicine. It is very easy to describe a medical program > as a humanitarian project ... Under the Truman administration, it was > proposed that we have a compulsory health insurance program for all people > in the United States, and of course, the American people unhesitatingly > rejected this ... In the last decade, 127 million of our citizens, in just > ten years, have come under the protection of some owned medical or hospital > insurance. The advocates of [socialized healthcare], when you try to oppose > it, challenge you on an emotional basis ... What can we do about this? Well > you and I can do a great deal. We can write to our [ Congressmen, to our > Senators. We can say right now that we want no further encroachment on these > individual liberties and freedoms. And at the moment, the key issue is we do > not want socialized medicine ... If you don't, this program I promise you > will pass just as surely as the sun will come up tomorrow. And behind it > will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as > well have known it in this country, until one day, as Norman Thomas said, we > will awake to find that we have socialism. If you don't do this and if I > don't do it, one of these days you and I are going to spend our sunset years > telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in > America when men were free. =Social Security= Reagan was in favor of making Social Security benefits voluntary. According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon: \\"I have no doubt that he shared the view that Social Security was a Ponzi scheme. He was intrigued with the idea of a voluntary plan that would have allowed workers to make their own investments. This idea would have undermined the system by depriving Social Security of the contributions of millions of the nation's highest-paid workers\\". Although Reagan was for a limited government and against the idea of a welfare state, Reagan continued to fully fund Social Security and Medicare because the elderly were dependent on those programs. Mounting concerns that rising Social Security benefits were causing a long-term deficit and were growing too fast resulted in a bipartisan compromise in 1983. Brokered by conservative Alan Greenspan and liberal Congressman Claude Pepper, the agreement lowered benefits over the next 75 years and brought the system into balance. Key provisions included a gradual increase over 25 years in the retirement age from 65 to 67, to take account of longer life expectancy. (People could retire younger, but at a reduced rate of benefits.) Millions of people were added to the system, especially employees of state governments and of nonprofit organizations.1983 Greenspan Commission on Social Security Reform (1983) online versionPaul Charles Light, Artful Work: The Politics of Social Security Reform (1985) = New Deal = Reagan wrote that he was never trying to undo the New Deal as he admired President Franklin D. Roosevelt and voted for him all four times. Social policy =Environment= Reagan dismissed acid rain and proposals to halt it as burdensome to industry. In the early 1980s, pollution had become an issue in Canada and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau objected to the pollution originating in U.S. factory smokestacks in the midwest. The Environmental Protection Agency implored Reagan to make a major budget commitment to reduce acid rain, but Reagan rejected the proposal and deemed it as wasteful government spending. He questioned scientific evidence on the causes of acid rain. =Abortion= Reagan was opposed to abortion, except in cases of rape, incest and life of the mother. He was quoted as saying: \\"If there is a question as to whether there is life or death, the doubt should be resolved in favor of life\\". In 1982, he stated: \\"Simple morality dictates that unless and until someone can prove the unborn human is not alive, we must give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is (alive). And, thus, it should be entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\\". As Governor of California, Reagan signed into law the Therapeutic Abortion Act in May 1967 in an effort to reduce the number of \\"back room abortions\\" performed in California.Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 50 As a result, approximately one million abortions would be performed and Reagan blamed this on doctors, arguing that they had deliberately misinterpreted the law. Just when the law was signed, Reagan stated that had he been more experienced as Governor, he would not have signed it.Cannon, Lou (2001), p. 51 Reagan then declared himself to be pro-life. During his presidency, though, Reagan never introduced legislation to congress regarding abortion. =Crime and capital punishment= Reagan was a supporter of capital punishment. As California's Governor, Reagan was beseeched to grant executive clemency to Aaron Mitchell, who had been sentenced to death for the murder of a Sacramento police officer, but he refused. Mitchell was executed the following morning. It was the only execution during his eight years as Governor‚Äîhe had previously granted executive clemency to one man on death row who had a history of brain damage. He approved the construction of three new prisons as President in 1982 as recommended by Attorney General William French Smith. =Drugs= Reagan firmly sought opposition to illegal drugs. He and his wife sought to reduce the use of illegal drugs through the Just Say No Drug Awareness campaign, an organization Nancy Reagan founded as first lady. In a 1986 address to the nation by Ronald and Nancy Reagan, the President said: \\"[W]hile drug and alcohol abuse cuts across all generations, it's especially damaging to the young people on whom our future depends ... Drugs are menacing our society. They're threatening our values and undercutting our institutions. They're killing our children.\\" Reagan also reacted to illegal drugs outside of Just Say No as the Federal Bureau Investigation added five hundred drug enforcement agents, began record drug crackdowns nationwide and established thirteen regional anti-drug task forces under Reagan. In the address with the first lady, President Reagan reported on the progress of his administration, saying: > Thirty-seven Federal agencies are working together in a vigorous national > effort, and by next year our spending for drug law enforcement will have > more than tripled from its 1981 levels. We have increased seizures of > illegal drugs. Shortages of marijuana are now being reported. Last year > alone over 10,000 drug criminals were convicted and nearly $250 million of > their assets were seized by the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration. > And in the most important area, individual use, we see progress. In 4 years > the number of high school seniors using marijuana on a daily basis has > dropped from 1 in 14 to 1 in 20. The U.S. military has cut the use of > illegal drugs among its personnel by 67 percent since 1980. These are a > measure of our commitment and emerging signs that we can defeat this enemy. =Civil rights= Women While running for President, Reagan pledged that if given the chance, he would appoint a woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.Reagan, Ronald (1990), p. 280 In 1981, he appointed Sandra Day O'Connor as the first female justice of the Supreme Court. As President, Reagan opposed the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) because he thought that women were already protected by the 14th Amendment, although he had supported the amendment and offered to help women's groups achieve its ratification while serving as Governor of California. Reagan pulled his support for the ERA shortly before announcing his 1976 candidacy for President. The 1976 Republican National Convention renewed the party's support for the amendment, but in 1980 the party qualified its 40-year support for ERA. Despite opposing the ERA, Reagan did not actively work against the amendment, which his daughter Maureen (who advised her father on various issues including women's rights) and most prominent Republicans supported. Reagan established a \\"Fifty States Project\\" and councils and commissions on women designed to find existing statutes at the federal and state levels and eradicate them, the latter through a liaison with the various state governors. Elizabeth Dole, a Republican feminist and former Federal Trade Commissioner and advisor to Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford (who would go on to become Reagan's Transportation Secretary) headed up his women's rights project. Black people Reagan did not support many civil rights bills throughout the years. He opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964Reagan, the South and Civil Rights: NPR and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson. In 1982, he signed a bill extending the Voting Rights Act for 25 years after a grass-roots lobbying and legislative campaign forced him to abandon his plan to ease that law's restrictions. In 1988, he vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act, but his veto was overridden by Congress. Reagan had argued that the legislation infringed on states' rights and the rights of churches and business owners. Reagan did not consider himself a racist and dismissed any attacks aimed at him relating to racism as attacks on his personal character and integrity. In July 2019, newly unearthed tapes were released of a 1971 phone call between Reagan, then Governor of California, and President Richard Nixon. Angered by African delegates at the UN siding against the U.S. in a vote, Reagan stated, ‚ÄúTo see those... monkeys from those African countries - damn them, they're still uncomfortable wearing shoes!\\"‚ÄúRonald Reagan called Africans at UN 'monkeys', tapes reveal‚Äú. BBC. Retrieved July 31, 2019 Critics claim that Reagan gave his 1980 presidential campaign speech about states' rights in Philadelphia, Mississippi in a calculated attempt to appeal to racist inclined southern voters. This location is near the place where three civil rights workers were killed in 1964. Others however point out that Reagan had given it at the Neshoba County Fair some distance away from where the murders took place. They also say that the vast majority of his speech had nothing to do with \\"states' rights\\" and that the fair was a popular campaigning spot. Presidential candidates John Glenn and Michael Dukakis both campaigned there as well years later.The Volokh Conspiracy, David Kopel, Reagan's Infamous Speech in Philadelphia, Mississippi, August 16, 2011 He also said (while campaigning in Georgia) that Confederate President Jefferson Davis was \\"a hero of mine\\". However, Reagan was offended that some accused him of racism. In 1980, Reagan said the Voting Rights Act was \\"humiliating to the South\\",\\"Why Republicans rip the Voting Rights Act\\", Hutchinson, Earl Ofari, The Chicago Defender, June 28, 2006 although he later supported extending the Act.The Voting Rights Act of 1965, Garrine P. Laney, p. 34 He opposed Fair Housing legislation in California (the Rumford Fair Housing Act),Pillar of Fire, Taylor Branch, p. 242 but in 1988 signed a law expanding the Fair Housing Act of 1968.The New York Times, Julie Johnson, \\"Reagan Signs Bill to Fight Housing Discrimination\\", September 14, 1988 Reagan engaged in a policy of Constructive engagement with South Africa in spite of apartheid due to the nation being a valuable anti-communist ally, He opposed pressure from Congress and his own party for tougher sanctions until his veto was overridden. Reagan opposed the Martin Luther King holiday at first and signed it only after an overwhelming veto-proof majority (338 to 90 in the House of Representatives and 78 to 22 in the Senate) voted in favor of it.HR 3706, \\"A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to make the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., a legal public holiday\\", Library of Congress. Martin Luther King Jr. once vowed to \\"hate all white people\\", making him a racist himself. =Education= School prayer Reagan was a supporter of prayer in U.S. schools. On February 25, 1984 in his weekly radio address, he said: \\"Sometimes I can't help but feel the first amendment is being turned on its head. Because ask yourselves: Can it really be true that the first amendment can permit Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen to march on public property, advocate the extermination of people of the Jewish faith and the subjugation of blacks, while the same amendment forbids our children from saying a prayer in school?\\". However, Reagan did not pursue a constitutional amendment requiring school prayer in public schools. Reagan mischaracterized the Supreme Court decisions on school prayer, as no decision of the Court has ever held that children are prohibited from praying on their own. The effect of the school prayer decisions is to prohibit public school authorities from requiring children to participate in prayer. Department of Education Reagan was particularly opposed to the establishment of the Department of Education, which had occurred under his predecessor, President Jimmy Carter. This view stemmed from his less- government intervention views. He had pledged to abolish the department, but did not pursue that goal as President. =Energy and oil= As President, Reagan removed controls on oil prices, resulting in lower prices and an oil glut. He did not reduce U.S. dependency on oil by imposing an oil-importing fee because of his opposition to taxation. He trusted the free marketplace. Lower global oil prices had the effect of reducing the income that the Soviet Union could earn from its oil exports. Footnotes References and further reading Bell, Coral.

Variations of Australian rules football are games or activities based on or similar to the game of Australian rules football, in which the player uses common Australian rules football skills. They range in player numbers from 2 (in the case of kick-to-kick) up to the minimum 38 required for a full Australian rules football. Some are essentially identical to Australian rules football, with only minor rule changes, while others are more distant and arguably not simple variations but distinct games. Others still have adapted to the unavailability of full-sized cricket fields. Other variations include children's games, contests or activities intended to help the player practice or reinforce skills, which may or may not have a competitive aspect. Most of the variations are played in informal settings, without the presence of umpires and sometimes without strict adherence to official game rules. Participatory varieties =Auskick= Auskick taking place during the half time break of an AFL game at Telstra Dome Auskick is a national program in Australia to develop and promote participation in Australian rules football amongst children. It has proven to be popular with both boys and girls. The program, devised in 1998 and begun in Victoria under the name \\"Vickick\\", it was supported by the Australian Football League, the national professional competition for the sport, which began to roll it out nationally. It has also seen variations overseas, including Viking Kick (Denmark). =Women's Australian rules football= A Melbourne University Mugars player jostles for best position in an overhead Marking contest, while a tackled Darebin Falcons player lies down Women's Australian rules football (also known as Women's Aussie Rules, Women's footy, Women's AFL or in areas where it is popular, simply \\"football\\") is a fast-growing sport. Although it is a contact sport, women's Australian rules is sometimes played with modified rules. It is less brutal on the body than women's American football, women's rugby league or women's rugby union and offers more physicality than women's soccer, as well as requiring both hand and foot co-ordination. It is a fast-paced team sport and is played by women of all shapes and sizes. The game is played at senior level in Australia, the United States, England, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. At junior level, it is also played in Papua New Guinea, Argentina and South Africa. At schoolgirls level, it is also played in Tonga and Samoa. =Masters Australian Football= Masters Australian Football (also known as \\"Superules\\") is a sport based on Australian rules football for players aged 35 years and over. The sport first commenced officially on 21 September 1981, after being founded by John Hammer in 1980 in Nhill, Victoria. Modifications to the rules reduce the physical impact of the game for older players. It is played by over 119 teams throughout Australia and around the world. The variation to the game is also dubbed \\"Superfools\\" by some followers and players. =Lightning football= Lightning football is a generic term to describe variations of the game played over a shortened length, usually about half of the length of a full match. Lightning football may be played under otherwise unchanged rules, but in recent lightning matches staged by the AFL, experimental rules such as awarding a free kick against the last player to touch the ball before it goes out of bounds have been trialled. Lightning matches are often used, particularly at junior or amateur level, to play an entire tournament inside a single day or weekend. These tournaments are typically known as \\"lightning premierships\\" or \\"lightning carnivals\\". Modified field or player numbers =9-a-side= 9-a-side Footy is played informally by Aussie Rules clubs but not yet an official sport in its own right. 9-a-side games are sometimes played on half size fields that are typically rectangular with 9 players on the field at any one time, typically consisting of three forwards, three backs and three centre players. Often two games are played at the same time on a single Australian rules or cricket field. At other times, 9-a-side makes use of the full space of the field when a full complement of players is not available. This variety is a more open and running variety of Australian rules. A minimum of 18 players are required in total, but many teams field unlimited interchange benches. Rules are the same as Australian rules football. Limited and non-contact versions of 9-a-side football are also played by both men's and women's leagues. Examples of official tournaments held under these rules include the EU Cup and Bali Nines. =Samoa Rules= Samoa Rules is a game derived from Australian rules football that has also been played in Samoa. The game is played on rugby fields and each team consists of 15 players per side. Unlike Australian rules football, player movement is restricted to zones (similarly to Rec Footy). There is a line across the centre that backs and forwards can not cross. Onballers are allowed to go anywhere. The Vailima Six-Shooters' Championship began in Samoa in 1998 under these rules, becoming known as \\"Samoa Rules\\". A number of Samoa Rules players went on to represent Samoa in the Samoan national Australian rules football team, known as the \\"Bulldogs\\". =Metro Footy= Metro Footy (or Metro Rules Footy) is a modified version of Australian rules football rules played on gridiron football, rugby or Association football fields, predominantly in the United States of America. The reasons for the development of Metro Footy was partly due to there being few grounds large enough for traditional Australian rules matches, but also to allow competitive football to be played with smaller playing numbers, allowing for better recruitment possibilities. Teams typically consist of 9-a-side on a field. The teams that play feed into larger 18-a-side Australian rules representative teams that participate in leagues such as the MAAFL or tournaments such as the USAFL National Championships and also provide the opportunity to introduce new American players to the game of Australian rules football. Several clubs from the United States Australian Football League participate in Metro Footy. =AFLX= Another prominent variation of the game is AFLX, an official Australian Football League sanctioned pre-season event. The game is played on soccer-sized pitches and features seven players a side, as well as several other rules designed to speed up the game. Historical variations =VFA rules (1938‚Äì1949)= VFA rules (or \\"Association rules\\" or \\"throw-pass rules\\") variation of Australian rules football was a distinct set of rules which was played in the Victorian Football Association, and several other smaller competitions which elected to switch to the new rules, between 1938 and 1949. Although there were several other small differences between the VFA's rules and the national rules, the primary distinguishing feature was that throwing the ball from below the shoulders with two hands was a legal form of handpass ‚Äì known as a throw-pass ‚Äì under the VFA's rules. The ease of throw-passing compared with traditional handpassing resulted in the VFA's code fostering a faster playing style with fewer stoppages and more run-and-carry than was seen under the traditional rules at the time. The VFA's code operated as a rival to the national code throughout the 1940s, and some innovations of the VFA's code were incorporated into the national code over that time. The VFA reverted to playing under the national rules from the 1950 season, and the throw-pass rules have not been seen since. Recreational varieties Recreational Football. =Rec Footy= Recreational Football (also known as Rec Footy or Recreational Footy) is a non-contact version of the Australian rules football game sanctioned by the Australian Football League. It is a more accessible version of Australian rules football that people can pick up and play with some degree of skill and ability and it is directly aligned to the traditional game of Australian rules football. It is a mixed competition, accessible to players of both sexes, all shapes and sizes and requires minimal equipment to play, but is suitable only for those above Auskick age. The after game kick- to-kick tradition at the Melbourne Cricket Ground is a rare sight. Following an AFL match between the Melbourne Demons and Port Adelaide Power, 16,000 fans were let onto the hallowed turf. =Kick-to-Kick= Kick-to-kick is a pastime, a well-known tradition of Australian rules football fans, and a recognised Australian term for kick and catch type games. A common format is for one person in a group to kick to a second group; whoever marks the ball kicks it back to the first group. In its \\"markers up\\" form, it is the usual casual version of Australian rules (similar to the relationship between backyard/beach cricket and the established forms of cricket). Although not a sport in itself, the term is used to describe a social exercise played in parks, fields, streets and back yards, and requires at least two people. =Touch Aussie Rules= Touch Aussie Rules is a non-tackle version of Australian rules football that is currently played in London, UK and organised by Aussie Rules UK. All skills are used in Touch Aussie Rules, including kicking, marking, handballing and bouncing. Hybrid codes An international rules football match at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne, Australia, between Australia and Ireland. =International Rules Football= International rules football (; also known as inter rules in Australia and compromise rules in Ireland) is a hybrid code of football, which was developed to facilitate international representative matches between Australian rules football players and Gaelic football players and is played between them worldwide. =Austus= Austus is a sport which was started in Australia during World War II when United States soldiers wanted to play football against the Australians. The game combined features of Australian rules football and American football. The rules of the game were mostly the same as Australian rules football, except that the American-style forward pass was allowed and afforded the same benefits as an Australian rules football kick, meaning that a thrown ball could be marked or used to score goals. The name comes from the first four letters of Australia (AUST) and the initials of the United States (US). The game has rarely, if ever, been played since the war. =Samoan rules= A hybrid of rugby union and Aussie rules. =Universal Football= Universal football was a proposed hybrid sport of Australian rules football and rugby league, as a means of unifying Australia under a single dominant football code. First codified in 1914, the game was originally designed to be played by teams of 15 on rectangular fields with rugby-style goalposts featuring a crossbar. The off-side rules of rugby league applied within in the forward quarter of the ground and did not apply elsewhere. Handpasses, which included throws, could only be made backwards. Rugby scrums were eliminated and replaced with the Australian rules football style ball-up. Players could be tackled anywhere between the knee and the shoulders. The Australian rules style of mark was kept. Tries were worth three points, conversions and goals from marks kicked over the crossbar were worth one point, and goals kicked on the run were worth two points. There was some progress towards amalgamating the two sports in 1915, but these were halted by the escalation of World War I and the new code was not revived after the war ended. The concept was briefly revisited in 1933 with similar rules, and a private trial match was played at the Sydney Showground, but it did not result in a lasting revival of the concept which has not been seen since.

It was then rewritten and appeared in the Vermilion Sands (1971) collection under its new name and later The Complete Short Stories of J. G. Ballard (2006). Like the rest of the Vermilion Sands collection, this story takes place in the fictional desert town of Vermilion Sands, and also features exotic technology.  Plot  \\"Venus Smiles\\" concerns the events surrounding a musical sculpture commissioned to be placed in the centre of Vermilion Sands. On the day of the unveiling, the statue causes outrage with the public ‚Äî as well as being aesthetically unpleasing, the music emitted from the sculpture tends to lean towards middle-eastern style quarter tones and is unpleasing to the ear. Instead of being scrapped, Mr Hamilton, one of the board members who commissioned it, decides to follow the wishes of the woman who sculpted it, and take it back to his home that he shares with his secretary. At first the narrator, Hamilton, finds the statue looks quite pleasant in his garden, and likes the new melodic classical music it starts to produce. One day, Hamilton and his secretary discover the statue is gently vibrating and moving, and the metal seems to be twisting and turning. As days continue to pass, they find the statue growing increasingly in height and girth, to an extent that is now twice its original size, and the twisting and forming of the new metal is developing at noticeable speed. After the statue has taken over the garden, the main characters and others begin to strip the metal off, which proves difficult as the rate at which the metal grows is the same as they can dismantle it. Eventually, the sculpture is completely demolished and the metal sold to a scrap yard. A legal battle then ensues, when the woman who originally sculpted the statue sues the board for damaging her reputation by openly and ungainly destroying one of her works. When the ruling is finally made in her favour, ten months have passed. When the lead characters have left the court building they remark on the fact that it is new and yet to be completed ‚Äî unplastered walls are visible and metal beams protrude from the building. The story ends when the narrator and supporting characters discover the unusual vibrations coming from the beams, and realise with horror that the statue's old metal has been recycled and distributed around Vermilion Sands in new buildings and motor vehicles.

The island is most famous for being the site of an Acadian refugee camp during the French and Indian War. The camp was under the command of leader of the Acadian resistance to the expulsion, Charles Deschamps de Boish√©bert et de Raffetot. The island is home to two National Historic Sites: # Beaubears Island Shipbuilding National Historic Site and # Boish√©bert National Historic Site The shipbuilding site occupies the eastern end of the island, while the Boish√©bert site comprises the rest of the island and adjacent Wilson's Point. The Wilson's Point portion is a New Brunswick provincial historic site, owned by the province and, while not national park land, Wilson's Point is part of the designated National Historic Site. With the exception of Wilson's Point, both sites are administered by Parks Canada in collaboration with the Friends of Beaubears Island. The sites retain 200-year-old Eastern White Pines; thus the parks are significant from the perspectives of both human and natural history.Boish√©bert and Beaubears Island Shipbuilding National Historic Sites of Canada, J.

Toward this end, to help Acadians evade capture, Boish√©bert set up an Acadian refugee camp on the Island. The Camp was named Camp de l' Esperance. The camp lasted between 1756 - 1759. After Louisbourg fell on 26 July 1758, French officer Boish√©bert withdrew, with the British in pursuit. Boishebert brought back a large number of Acadians from the region around Port-Toulouse (St. Peter's, Nova Scotia) to the security of his post at Beaubears Island on the Miramichi River. During the Ile Saint-Jean Campaign and the St. John River Campaign the number of Acadian refugees increased dramatically.Earle Lockerby. Deportation of the Prince Edward Island Acadians. Nimbus Publishing. 2008. p. 17 The camp had eventually 900 French refugees. Over 200 of the refugees died at the camp. During the war, the camp was protected by a battery of 16 French cannons at French Fort Cove.Murdoch. History of Nova Scotia. Vol. 2. p. 389 During the Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign, on September 15, 1758, Brigadier James Murray was at Miramichi and discovered that there were many Acadian refugees at a settlement about ten leagues up the Miramichi River which had fled during the Ile Saint-Jean Campaign. According to Murray, all of the Acadians were starving. They had sent most of their effects on to Canada and expected so to go there themselves.Earle Lockerby, p. 55 Camp d'Esp√©rance Memorial at Wilson's Point (IR Walker 2007) Beaubears (Boish√©bert) Island and nearby Wilson's Point (a.k.a.

Leonard O'Brien and Shipbuilding= The first shipyard was established by James Fraser and James Thom (1790). For the first half of the eighteenth century, the Fraser shipyard was considered the most important commercial establishment in New Brunswick. The 1850s were regarded as the golden age of Miramichi shipbuilding with yards in operation from Beaubears Island. Harley continued to build ships and in 1866 launched what is believed to be the last vessel constructed at Beaubears, the barque La Plata. By the end of the 19th century, the island appears to have been deserted. It was acquired by the O'Brien family in 1920 and willed to the government of Canada in 1973 following the death of Joseph Leonard O'Brien, a former lieutenant governor of New Brunswick. Beaubears Island Shipbuilding National Historic Site of Canada, also known as J. Leonard O'Brien Memorial, is the only known, undisturbed archaeological site associated with the national significance of the 19th century wooden shipbuilding industry in New Brunswick. In accordance with O'Brien's wishes, the island was willed to Parks Canada and remains an integral part of Canadian history as a whole.

The stern lies opposite the bow, the foremost part of a ship. Originally, the term only referred to the aft port section of the ship, but eventually came to refer to the entire back of a vessel. The stern end of a ship is indicated with a white navigation light at night. Sterns on European and American wooden sailing ships began with two principal forms: the square or transom stern and the elliptical, fantail, or merchant stern, and were developed in that order. The hull sections of a sailing ship located before the stern were composed of a series of U-shaped rib-like frames set in a sloped or \\"cant\\" arrangement, with the last frame before the stern being called the fashion timber(s) or fashion piece(s), so called for \\"fashioning\\" the after part of the ship. This frame is designed to support the various beams that make up the stern. In 1817 the British naval architect Sir Robert Seppings introduced the concept of the round or circular stern. The square stern had been an easy target for enemy cannon, and could not support the weight of heavy stern chase guns. But Seppings' design left the rudder head exposed, and was regarded by many as simply ugly‚Äîno American warships were designed with such sterns, and the round stern was quickly superseded by the elliptical stern. The United States began building the first elliptical stern warship in 1820, a decade before the British. became the first sailing ship to sport such a stern. Though a great improvement over the transom stern in terms of its vulnerability to attack when under fire, elliptical sterns still had obvious weaknesses which the next major stern development‚Äîthe iron-hulled cruiser stern‚Äîaddressed far better and with much different materials. Types =Transom= 1\\\\. Keel (light peach) 2. Skeg (dark purple) 3. Deadwood (olive drab) 4. Stern post (forest green) 5. Filling chock (bright yellow) 6. Filling transoms (pale yellow-green) 7. Wing transom (turquoise) 8. Helm port (orange) 9. Counter timbers (pale violet) 10. Margin (indigo) 11. Horn timber (green) 12. Stern timbers (apricot) 13. Side- counter timbers (pale yellow) 14. Quarter-timbers (red) 15. Fashion timber (fuchsia) 16. Cant frames (blue) 17. Square body frames (uncolored) In naval architecture, the term transom has two meanings. First, it can be any of the individual beams that run side-to-side or \\"athwart\\" the hull at any point abaft the fashion timber; second, it can refer specifically to the flat or slightly curved surface that is the very back panel of a transom stern. In this sense, a transom stern is the product of the use of a series of transoms, and hence the two terms have blended. The stern of a classical sailing ship housed the captain's quarters and became increasingly large and elaborate between the 15th and 18th centuries, especially in the baroque era, when such wedding-cake-like structures became so heavy that crews sometimes threw the decoration overboard rather than be burdened with its useless weight. Until a new form of stern appeared in the 19th century, the transom stern was a floating house‚Äîand required just as many timbers, walls, windows, and frames. The stern frame provided the foundational structure of the transom stern, and was composed of the sternpost, wing transom, and fashion piece. Abaft the fashion timber, the transom stern was composed of two different kinds of timbers: *Transoms ‚Äì These timbers extend across the low parts of the hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the sternpost. The transom located at the base of the stern, and the uppermost of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal transom below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling transoms. If the stern had transoms above the wing transom, they would no longer be affixed to the sternpost. The first of these might be called a counter transom; next up was the window sill transom; above that, the spar deck transom. The larger the vessel, the more numerous and wider the transoms required to support its stern. *Stern timbers (also called stern frames) ‚Äì These timbers are mounted vertically in a series; each timber typically rests or \\"steps\\" on the wing transom and then stretches out (aft) and upward. Those not reaching all the way to the taffrail are called short stern timbers, while those that do are called long stern timbers. The two outermost of these timbers, located at the corners of the stern, are called the side-counter timbers or outer stern timbers. It is the stern timbers collectively which determine the backward slope of the square stern, called its rake ‚Äì that is, if the stern timbers end up producing a final transom that falls vertically to the water, this is considered a transom with no rake; if the stern timbers produce a stern with some degree of slope; such a stern is considered a raked stern. The flat surface of any transom stern may begin either at or above the waterline of the vessel. The geometric line which stretches from the wing transom to the archboard is called the counter; a large vessel may have two such counters, called a lower counter and a second or upper counter. The lower counter stretches from directly above the wing transom to the lower counter rail, and the upper counter from the lower counter rail to the upper counter rail, immediately under the stern's lowest set of windows (which in naval parlance were called \\"lights\\"). =Elliptical= Sir Robert Seppings The visual unpopularity of Seppings's circular stern was soon rectified by Sir William Symonds. In this revised stern, a set of straight post timbers (also called \\"whiskers\\", \\"horn timbers\\", or \\"fan tail timbers\\") stretches from the keel diagonally aft and upward. It rests on the top of the sternpost and runs on either side of the rudder post (thus creating the \\"helm port\\" through which the rudder passes) to a point well above the vessel's waterline. Whereas the timbers of the transom stern all heeled on the wing transom, the timbers of the elliptical stern all heel on the whiskers, to which they are affixed at a 45¬∞ angle (i.e., \\"canted\\") when viewed from overhead and decrease in length as they are installed aft until the curvature is complete. The finished stern has a continuous curved edge around the outside and is raked aft. Other names for the elliptical stern include a \\"counter stern\\", in reference to its very long counter, and a \\"cutaway stern\\". The elliptical stern began use during the age of sail, but remained very popular for both merchant and warships well into the nautical age of steam and through the first eight decades of steamship construction (roughly 1840‚Äì1920), despite the design's leaving the rudder exposed and vulnerable in combat situations. =Cruiser= As ships of wooden construction gave way to iron and steel, the cruiser stern‚Äîanother design without transoms and known variously as the canoe stern, parabolic stern, and the double-ended stern‚Äîbecame the next prominent development in ship stern design, particularly in warships of the earlier half of the 20th century. The intent of this re- design was to protect the steering gear by bringing it below the armor deck. The stern now came to a point rather than a flat panel or a gentle curve, and the counter reached from the sternpost all the way to the taffrail in a continuous arch. It was soon discovered that vessels with cruiser sterns experienced less water resistance when under way than those with elliptical sterns, and between World War I and World War II most merchant ship designs soon followed suit. =Others= Illustrations of several kinds of stern: Fig. 21 Fantail; Fig. 22 Transom; Fig. 23 \\"Compromise\\"; Fig. 24 \\"V\\" stern; Fig. 25 Round; Fig. 26 Torpedo; Fig. 27 Canoe None of these three main types of stern has vanished from the modern naval architectural repertoire, and all three continue to be utilized in one form or another by different sets of designers and for a broad spectrum of uses. Variations on these basic designs have resulted in an outflow of \\"new\\" stern types and names, only some of which are itemized here. The reverse stern, reverse transom stern, sugar-scoop, or retrouss√© stern is a kind of transom stern that is raked backwards (common on modern yachts, rare on vessels before the 20th century); the vertical transom stern or plumb stern is raked neither forward nor back, but falls directly from the taffrail down to the wing transom. The rocket ship stern is a term for an extremely angled retrouss√© stern. A double ended ship with a very narrow square counter formed from the bulwarks or upper deck above the head of the rudder is said to have a pink stern or pinky stern. The torpedo stern or torpedo-boat stern describes a kind of stern with a low rounded shape that is nearly flat at the waterline, but which then slopes upward in a conical fashion towards the deck (practical for small high-speed power boats with very shallow drafts). A Costanzi stern is a type of stern designed for use on ocean-going vessels. It is a compromise between the 'spoon-shaped' stern usually found on ocean liners, and the flat transom, often required for fitting azimuth thrusters. The design allows for improved seagoing characteristics. It is the stern design on Queen Mary 2, and was originally proposed for SS Oceanic and Eugenio C, both constructed in the 1960s. The Costanzi stern of Queen Mary 2 A lute stern is to be found on inshore craft on the Sussex, England, shore. It comprises a watertight transom with the topside planking extended aft to form a non-watertight counter which is boarded across the fashion timbers curving outward aft from the transom. Some working boats and modern replicas have a similar form of counter, built to be water tight as described in the \\"transom stern\\" section above. These are being confused with lute sterns but as a lute is not watertight, a better term is needed. Chappelle in American Small Sailing Craft refers to a Bermudan boat with this form of counter, using the term \\"square tuck stern\\" to describe it. The term \\"tuck\\" is used in the northwest of England for this area of the hull at the sternpost, and for the bulkhead across the counter if one is fitted. The fantail stern describes a stern that starts at the water and widens as you go upwards. This is famous on many 19th century tea clippers and the ill-fated RMS Titanic. A bustle stern refers to any kind of stern (transom, elliptical, etc.) that has a large \\"bustle\\" or blister at the waterline below the stern to prevent the stern from \\"squatting\\" when getting underway. It only appears in sailboats, never in power-driven craft.

Its fortifications were renewed by Byzantine emperor Justinian I, and it was later a base for operations by Emperor Basil II in his wars against the Bulgarians. In the 11th century, the city was the center of a district (bandon) in the theme of Boleron, and Anna Komnene reports in her Alexiad that there were many Manichaeans living in Mosynopolis in the late 11th/early 12th centuries. The town was captured in 1185 by the Normans, while the monk Ephrem says that the city was captured in 1190 by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor.C√¶sares, V. 5695, in Patrologia Graeca, CXLIII, 216. The Battle of Messinopolis, in which the Bulgarians defeated Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat, took place nearby in 1207, and was speedily followed by the destruction of Mosynopolis by Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria. The fate of the town thereafter is somewhat obscure: it re-appears in 1317 as part of the theme of \\"Boleron and Mosynopolis\\", and its bishopric was still active, but the historian Catherine Asdracha, in her 1972 survey of the Rhodope area in the late Middle Ages, suggests that it never recovered from Kaloyan's sack and remained in ruins, proposing that it is to be identified with the town of Mesene, which the emperor and historian John VI Kantakouzenos reported as \\"destroyed many years ago\\". The town at some point had other names including Porsula or Porsulae, Corsulae, Impara and Pyrsoalis,Antonine Itinerary,  Ecclesiastical history  Bishops of Maximianopolis in Rhodope were present at the 5th and 6th-century ecumenical councils of Ephesus (431), Chalcedon (451), and Constantinople II (553) and in another council of 459. From the 7th to the 9th centuries, the see is referred to as archiepiscopal, giving it autocephalous status. In all these instances, the see appears under the name Maximianopolis, but in 879 it is under the name Mosynopolis that it is represented by a bishop called Paul at the Fourth Council of Constantinople. From the following century to the 12th, it appears with reduced status as a suffragan of Trajanopolis in Rhodope. In the 13th century it became a Latin bishopric. The see is mentioned under the name Mosynopolis also in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Leo the Wise, about 900;Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte ...

They were one of the most prominent national orchestras of the new country. Background The newly independent state of Guinea, led by president Sekou Toure, established a number of music groups, competitions and festivals throughout the country to play the traditional music of Guinea rather than the European styles that were popular in the colonial period. The first orchestra to be founded was the Syli Orchestre National, its musicians drawn from the finest talents of the new nation. Later the government decided to split the orchestra into smaller units and Keletigui et ses Tambourinis, led by saxophone and keyboard player Keletigui Traor√©, was one of these. Career Like their rivals, Balla et ses Balladins, who were also descended from the Syli Orchestre National, Keletigui and his group were based in a nightclub in Conakry (\\"La Paillote\\") and made a number of recordings for the state-owned Syliphone record label. The group was an organ of the state of Guinea and as such its working schedule, line-up and repertoire were strongly influenced by the officials of the state, as can be seen by the songs they recorded in praise of President Toure. After the demise of Syliphone in 1984 the group continued to play. Keletigui Traore died in 2008 and was buried in a state ceremony. His orchestra are now led by Linke Conde and continue to play regularly at La Paillote. Sterns. STCD 3031-3032.

Concepts Large scale planning of goals may be called strategy and are conducted at the \\"strategic level of war\\". Operations at a lower level which fulfil the strategic planning are conducted at the \\"operational level of war\\". The lowest level of planning which fulfills operational goals and strategy is called the \\"tactical level of war\\". =Based on planning= A tactical mission is one within the operational area which aims to complete the goals of the assigned mission or task given by \\"tactical control\\" and so a tactical victory would be the successful completion of that mission. Tactical missions contribute to the success or failure of the whole operation. Tactics include the handling of assetsPotter & Nimitz (1960) p.3 such as soldiers, vehicles, weapons, and munitions and tactics might be as simple as the combat maneuvering of an individual soldier in a skirmish with an enemy soldier. The definition of tactical victory may become blurred in large scale tactical maneuvering of troops in division-sized formations or the operational goals of company-sized units to exercise control of important positions as these contribute in different ways to the success or failure of operations and strategy. Nations may have differing strategic objectives for a conflict and their individual combat units may be made to believe in still different objectives. Survival, on an individual or unit level, may become an important objective in battle and these different objectives allow both sides to maintain morale by declarations of victory to justify the costs of combat. Many battles involving multiple units include elements of tactical success by both of the opposing forces. These individual tactical victories may not cause the force to be successful in that battle or in the larger goals of the conflict.Dunnigan (1982) pp.235‚Äì239 =Based on losses= Here the term is applied to a simple tally of the numbers of losses of each side. This may be complicated by the value attached to certain assets lost. An example of a naval tactical victory dependent on losses would be the Battle of the Coral Sea. The battle was considered a strategic victory for the Allies because they stopped a Japanese invasion but the latter lost fewer valuable ships. The Allies lost one aircraft carrier, one destroyer and one oil tanker while the Japanese lost one light carrier and one destroyer and so it was considered a tactical victory for the latter.Potter & Nimitz (1960) p.667, Potter (1976) p.76 Another example of a tactical victory is the Battle off Samar. U.S escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts prevented the Japanese Center Force (consisting of 23 ships, including the super battleship Yamato) from destroying the off-loading American transports in Leyte Gulf. During the battle, American ships sank 3 heavy cruisers (combined tonnage of 44,894 tons); damaged 3 heavy cruisers and 1 destroyer; shot down 52 aircraft; and killed more than 2,000 Japanese sailors (more than half of the rescued sailors were lost in the following days after being rescued from ships that would later sink from air strikes and surface action). Their American counterparts however, had 2 escort carriers, 2 destroyers, 1 destroyer escort all sunk (combined tonnage of 22,350 tons); 6 escort carriers, 1 destroyer, and 2 destroyer escorts damaged; lost 23 aircraft; and 1,583 sailors killed.

By 1865, it was listed as having 150 residents. A new Carlton & Weston Road railway station was built in 1885 on the east side of the CNR tracks. It was renamed West Toronto Station and additions were added in 1902 and 1912. It still stands.Byers and Myrvhold, pp. 16-18 Davenport Station in 1863. The station was a stop on the Northern Railway of Canada. Along Davenport at today's Perth Avenue, the settlement of Davenport developed. When the Northern Railway line was built, a Davenport Station was built. Davenport was also small, having only a population of 120 by 1875. The two villages grew steadily and more building lots were developed, all getting their water from wells. The neighbouring village of West Toronto Junction was incorporated in 1887. Rather than join the junction, villagers proposed to form a new merged village of 'Stanley', after Lord Stanley the Governor General of Canada at the time. The plan failed and Carlton and Davenport were later annexed into West Toronto Junction in 1889. Connolly Street in the area was first laid out as Carlton Avenue and renamed when West Toronto was annexed by the City of Toronto in 1909 (likely to avoid confusion with Carlton Street). At the centre of the neighbourhood is Wadsworth Park, named after long serving Alderman and Controller William J. Wadsworth. Most development dates from the era of the building of St. Clair Avenue after the annexation into Toronto. Demographics Carleton Village falls within the City of Toronto's \\"Weston- Pelham Park\\" neighborhood. According to the 2016 Neighborhood Profile, the median family income is $78,988 (5% below the City average of $82,859).https://www.toronto.ca/ext/sdfa/Neighbourhood%20Profiles/pdf/2016/pdf1/cpa91.pdf Census tract 0108.00 of the 2006 Canadian census overlaps exactly with Carleton Village. According to that census, the neighbourhood has 6,544 residents.

All three school boards operate a public elementary school within the neighbourhood. They include: * Blessed Pope Paul VI Catholic School (TCDSB) * Carleton Village Junior and Senior Sports Academy (TDSB) * √âcole √©l√©mentaire Charles-Sauriol (CSV) Previously, the TCDSB operated Brother Edmund Rice Catholic Secondary School from 1977 to 2001. In 2001, the south building of the school at 2054 Davenport Road closed. Some efforts were made by the local community to preserve elements of the old building, and as of 2009, early plans to completely demolish the existing structure and erect a new home for the local police division have been significantly altered. The architecture of the 1913 building will be preserved in the new plan for the station, with a contemporary wing replacing the addition from the 1960s.

An 8th Rifle Corps (but not made up of Estonian personnel) had been previously formed, taking part in the Soviet invasion of Poland as part of the 5th Army,–ú–µ–ª—å—Ç—é—Ö–æ–≤ –ú.–ò. –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ-–ø–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã. –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ-–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ 1918-1939 –≥–≥. ‚Äî –ú.: –í–µ—á–µ, 2001. and, on the outbreak of war on 22 June 1941, this first formation was part of the 26th Army in the Kiev Special Military District, consisting of the 99th, the 173rd, and the 72nd Mountain Rifle Divisions.Orbat.com/Niehorster, 26th Army 22 June 1941 The first formation of the 8th Rifle Corps was destroyed in the first three months of the German invasion and is not present on the Soviet order of battle after August 1941.–ë–û–ï–í–û–ô –°–û–°–¢–ê–í –í–û–ô–°–ö –Ω–∞ 1 –∞–≤–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞ 1941 –≥. The 8th Estonian Rifle Corps was formed of mobilized ethnic Estonians, who were at first brought in Russia (where many of them died because of poor conditions); the battalions created in Estonia and incorporated former officials of the Republic of Estonia's army. In the order of battle, the corps appears in the Stavka Reserves by 1 November 1942 and is subordinated to the Kalinin Front by 1 December 1942.–ë–û–ï–í–û–ô –°–û–°–¢–ê–í –í–û–ô–°–ö –ù–ê 1 –î–ï–ö–ê–ë–†–Ø 1942 –≥. When 2nd formation was formed in 1942, the corps' structure consisted of the 7th and 249th Rifle Divisions stationed in Estonia, reinforced by volunteers from the Estonian Communist Party organisation. In an effort to increase overall formation experience, the battle-hardened 19th Guards Rifle Division later joined the 8th Rifle Corps. As a result, the corps was briefly re-designated as 8th Guards Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 11 Throughout its entire existence, the rifle corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Lembit P√§rn. Over half of the formation consisted of non-Estonians or descendants of Indians, Germans who emigrated to Russia in the 19th century. War service The corps fought a total 916 days in the war, and at different times it was in service on the Kalinin, the Leningrad and the 2nd Baltic Front. For 344 days, parts of the corps were engaged with German forces, but no significant gains were made. For the next 123 days, the formation was engaging in the Battle of Velikiye Luki where 13,000 of the 27,000 men were killed or wounded. Then, 37 days were spent in the Battle of Narva, and the final 88 days were devoted to the Battle of Courland. During the Battle of Narva in 1944, the artillery of the rifle corps fired on the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian), consisting of Estonians fighting in the Waffen SS. The infantry of the corps was engaged in direct battle with the Estonians on the German side in the battles of Porkuni and Avinurme on 20 and 21 September 1944, where a detachment of the rifle corps murdered a number of wounded prisoners of war. On 22 September elements of the 7th Rifle Division, along with the 45th Estonian Tank Regiment and the 952nd SU Regiment (SU-76s), formed the forward detachment of the corps and entered Tallinn, for which all three units received the name of that city as a battle honor.Charles C.

Of the whole rifle corps, one division, six regiments, and one battalion were decorated with an order. The 8th Estonian Rifle Corps was also given the honorific \\"Tallinn\\", and on June 28, 1945, the corps was renamed the 41st Guards Estonian Tallinn Rifle Corps. The two component divisions were also honored; the 7th became the 118th Guards Rifle Division and the 249th became the 122nd Guards Rifle Division. In 1946, both divisions were inactivated to provide personnel for other Soviet activities in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.Feskov et al., –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –ê—Ä–º–∏—è –≤ –≥–æ–¥—ã ¬´—Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã¬ª (1945-1991), p. 47, Tomsk: Tomsk University Press, 2004 According to the 23 June 1945 decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, demobilization of the Red Army started. The first 8th Rifle Corps fighters were demobilized on 16 July 1945. By the end of 1946, 16,550 men were demobilized. Of those, 3,425 (20.7%) started to work in the administrative or legal bodies of the Soviet occupation regime (Communist Party, Komsomol, trade unions etc.).

Herpin is remembered for his extensive contributions made in the study of epilepsy. He examined hundreds of epileptic patients, and noticed that all epileptic episodes, whether they be complete or incomplete, started the same way, and surmised that they originated in the same location in the brain. Herpin's primary focus of epileptic research was to instruct other physicians to be able to recognize and treat the condition in its early stages. His pioneer research predated John Hughlings Jackson's (1835-1911) similar findings of the disorder. Herpin is also credited for his comprehensive description of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
