The dam covers an area of with maximum capacity of nearly .Barau, Aliyu Salisu (2007) The Great Attractions of Kano. Research and Documentation Directorate Government House Kano Water from the dam supplies the Kano River Irrigation Project as well as Kano City. Downstream impact Several studies have shown that the dam has delivered negative economic value when its effect on downstream communities was taken into account. On completion of the dam the river flow downstream at Gashua in Yobe State fell by about per year due to upstream irrigation and by more than due to evaporation from the reservoir. A study published in 1999 concluded that farmers in the downstream floodplain had adapted their agriculture, helped by new technology, but the increased level of production might not be sustainable. The Hadejia-Nguru wetlands further downstream have considerable economic and ecological importance. They are home to about one million people living by wet-season rice farming, agriculture at other seasons, fishing and cattle grazing by Fulani people. The dam has damaged the cycle, reducing fish catches and harvests of other wetland products. In August 2009, Senator Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan of Yobe North, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accounts, stated that the Tiga Dam had reduced water flow in the Kano River by about 50%. The senator was speaking in opposition to the proposed Kafin Zaki Dam on the Jama'are River, the other main tributary of the Yobe River. He said the Tiga and Challawa Dams had caused intense poverty, increased desert encroachment, migration and conflicts between arable farmers and herdsmen. He noted that the Yobe River no longer flows into Lake Chad. It is estimated that Lake Chad will dry up completely within 40 years. More than 30 million people derive their livelihood from the Lake Chad Basin through fishing, raising live stock and farming. A study group to examine the problem was established in November 2008, visiting the Tiga dam and other locations.

Irwin Suall, of the Anti-Defamation League, called Frankhouser \\"a thread that runs through the history of American hate groups\\". Biography=Early years Frankhouser was born in Reading, Pennsylvania. He attended Northwest Junior High School through the tenth grade, and became active in racist causes. As a teenager, he collected Nazi paraphernalia and uniforms. He joined the United States Army and served one year as a paratrooper before receiving an honorable discharge. He joined the American Nazi Party in 1960. When he was 19 he met George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. He was later described as a protege of Rockwell's. His first recorded arrest occurred at age 22, when he kicked a policeman in the shins during a 1961 protest in Atlanta. He participated in Nazi party rallies and Klan demonstrations, being arrested often for disorderly conduct. Fellow Klansman nicknamed him \\"Riot Roy\\". According to Frankhouser, he lost his eye in an attack by pipe-wielding Jews. In another version, he lost it during a fight with blacks in a Reading bar. A third story is that he lost it during the Bay of Pigs invasion. At a fundraising auction for the Klan, one of his glass eyes sold for $5. He also had a scar on his head which he said was from a brick thrown by a counter-demonstrator. Dan Burros, a prominent member of the American Nazi Party, committed suicide in Frankhouser's apartment in 1965 upon seeing the headline of a New York Times article revealing Burros's Jewish background. Frankhouser became the Grand Dragon of Pennsylvania in 1965. The following year he appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee as part of its investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. He reportedly pleaded the Fifth more than 30 times rather than answer their questions. In 1972, he marched down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan wearing a black storm trooper's uniform to defy a city ban on wearing Nazi outfits in public.King, Dennis (1989). Lyndon LaRouche and the new American fascism, Doubleday. That same year, Frankhouser approached the FBI about working as an informant, offering information on groups such as black militants, the Jewish Defense League, the Irish Republican Army and Black September. The National Security Council approved a mission in which he was sent to Canada to infiltrate Black September, but he was unsuccessful. Frankhouser was also an organizer of the Minutemen and a member of the National States' Rights Party, the National Renaissance Party, the Liberty Lobby, and the White Citizens Council. Frankhouser was convicted of conspiring to sell of stolen dynamite in 1975.Blum, Howard (1979). \\"U.S. Labor Party: Cult Surrounded by Controversy\\", New York Times, October 7, 1979. The charges included selling explosives which were used in the bombing of a school bus in Pontiac, Michigan that killed one man. During the trial he revealed he was a government informant, saying that he was acting on behalf of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). The government denied his assertion. Though he faced up to fifty-one years in prison, he was sentenced to two concurrent five-year probation terms as part of a plea agreement. Lyndon LaRouche initiated a legal defense on behalf of Frankhouser. When the LaRouche movement learned that Frankhouser was an informant, it saw that as evidence of the \\"FBI-CIA-Rockefeller-Buckley\\" control of the extreme Right, and an example of how government connections could immunize criminal behavior.Rose, Gregory F. (1979). \\"The Swarmy Life and Times of the NCLC\\", National Review, March 30, 1979. LaRouche trial Frankhouser became a security consultant for political activist Lyndon LaRouche in 1979 after Frankhouser convinced LaRouche that Frankhouser was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies. In a 1984 deposition, LaRouche described Frankhouser as \\"an expert in security matters\\" who can \\"detect nasties by their wiggle\\". In U.S. v. Frankhauser, Frankhouser testified that he and LaRouche security employee Forrest Lee Fick had invented a connection to the CIA in order to justify his $700 a week salary as a security consultant. He said that he had persuaded a friend to play a former top CIA official (named \\"Ed\\" by Frankhouser, after \\"Mister Ed\\") in meetings with LaRouche. When LaRouche found out about a grand jury investigation, he reportedly told Frankhouser to get the CIA to quash it. Frankhouser told LaRouche that the CIA wanted him to destroy evidence and hide witnesses. Frankhouser claimed that on another occasion LaRouche sent him to Boston to check on the grand jury investigation. Instead of going to Boston he went to a Star Trek convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania and called to warn LaRouche that the FBI had wiretapped his phones. During the grand jury investigation, documents were presented which showed Frankhouser had advised members of the organization that unless they handled matters correctly they could \\"start writing a concerto for canaries in B major.\\" He suggested destroying records, writing in a letter to LaRouche that \\"paper burns at 451 degrees Fahrenheit, a scientific fact.\\" As soon as he was arrested, he began cooperating with federal prosecutors. He testified that members of LaRouche's organization had asked him to assassinate former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, an enemy of the LaRouche movement. He also said that he had been ordered by Jeffrey Steinberg, LaRouche's head of counterintelligence, to organize pickets to disrupt the grand jury proceedings. LaRouche was called as a defense witness in Frankhouser's trial but he refused to testify, exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Frankhouser was found guilty on December 10, 1987 of obstruction of the federal investigation into credit card fraud. He was sentenced by US District Judge Robert E. Keeton to three years and a $50,000 fine. After his conviction, he was granted immunity against further prosecution and compelled to testify against LaRouche. Frankhouser appealed his conviction on April 3, 1989, arguing that his case should not have been severed from the main case, that his counsel had inadequate time to prepare, and that he was not provided with allegedly exculpatory evidence. The appeal was rejected in July. Clayton trial Starting in the 1980s he appeared regularly on Berks County public-access television with his white supremacist shows \\"Race and Reason\\" and \\"White Forum\\". He was arrested April 28, 1993, for stabbing a KKK guard at a Klan convention. He testified that he was ambushed by the guard and several skinheads, and that he defended himself with his Swiss Army knife. He was acquitted of the crime due to self-defense. In 1995 he was convicted in a federal court in Boston of advising the mother of Brian Clayton, the white supremacist head of the \\"New Dawn Hammerskins\\" gang, to destroy evidence linking her son to the desecration of synagogues and to attacks on black residents. Frankhouser had been harboring Clayton, who was sought by the FBI, for nine months. At the time, Frankhouser was described by the U.S. Attorney as the leader of the Pale Riders faction of the KKK. US District Court Judge Patti B. Saris sentenced him to 25-month in prison. On appeal one count of obstruction of justice was overturned while another was affirmed. Jouhari trial According to a 1997 complaint, Frankhouser, then Grand Dragon of the United Klans of America in Pennsylvania, had been harassing Bonnie Jouhari and her daughter. Jouhari was a white woman who worked at the Reading-Berks Human Relations Council, helping out people who had been discriminated against. After many unsuccessful attempts by Jouhari to get government agencies to act,David Bernstein. You Can't Say That! The Growing Threat to Civil Liberties from Antidiscrimination Laws. Cato Institute, 2003. page 74 she convinced the SPLC to take her case. Frankhouser eventually settled the case with terms set by the judge. Frankhouser had to complete 1000 hours of community service, make public apologies to Jouhari and her daughter on his \\"White Forum\\" TV show and local newspapers, pay them 10% of his income for a decade, and undergo \\"sensitivity training\\". The settlement was supported by HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Reverend Jesse Jackson at a press conference also attended by NAACP president Kweisi Mfume. Later years Frankhouser became the pastor of the Mountain Church of Jesus Christ, an arm of Robert E. Miles' movement. Frankhouser held services in his home, and sought a property tax exemption for the row house. The house reportedly had a small worship room with a makeshift altar, Klan flags, and pictures of Adolf Hitler and cross burnings. In 1998, Berks County tax officials refused to recognize it as a legitimate church on the grounds that Frankhouser could not provide adequate proof that he was an ordained minister. Frankhouser fought with Lancaster, Pennsylvania, officials in 2001 over their restrictions on demonstrations by the KKK. He called himself a spokesman for the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan; however, doubts were expressed in both the KKK and anti-hate communities over whether Frankhouser had any actual connection to the group. Death Frankhouser died of a heart attack at the Spruce Manor Nursing Home in West Reading, Pennsylvania, where he had resided since 2006. He had no known survivors.

The article lists what he did for the field of library science, including founding the library school at the University of Chicago, directing the library at the University of North Carolina/Chapel Hill, and as one of the ‚Äúinternationally oriented library leaders in the U.S. who contributed much of the early history of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.‚ÄùKniffel, L., Sullivan, P., & McCormick, E. (1999). 100 of the Most Important Leaders We Had in the 20th Century. American Libraries, 30(11), 47. The Louis Round Wilson Library is named after him. Background Louis Round Wilson was born on December 27, 1876, in Lenoir, North Carolina.Tauber, M. F. (1967). Louis Round Wilson: Librarian and Administrator. New York: Columbia University Press. Wilson was the youngest child of Jethro Reuben and Louisa Jane (Round) Wilson, who were both descendants from early English settlers. Growing up, Wilson frequented the local library in Lenoir, the Pioneer Library. His passion for the freedom to read led him to his important promotion of free public library services may have begun in his youth at the Pioneer Library. Wilson later worked on a newspaper, called the Topic, and was also a janitor at the local Methodist church. He became the church's Sunday school librarian, spending about an hour charging and discharging books. With this experience he was introduced to printing, publishing, administration, and handling books, which would encompass his life's work. Wilson entered Davenport College, a preparatory school in 1894, studying Greek and ancient history among the other essential subjects. In 1895, Wilson entered Haverford College, but \\"left on account of ill-health\\" at the end of his Junior year, 1898. His Senior year, he decided to attend the University of North Carolina, the location of a milder climate which would be more beneficial to his health. University of North Carolina Wilson received a letter from the dean of the University of North Carolina, asking if he would take the position of University Librarian, and was also provided the chance to continue his work on a master's degree. His Master's thesis was ‚ÄúThe Influence of Lyly and Green upon the Pastoral Comedy of Shakespeare,‚Äù and was published in the October 1902 issue of the University Magazine. During the beginning of his librarianship, he obtained copies of the Dewey abridged classification scheme, providing the rules and forms for cataloging, and widened his knowledge and expertise pertaining to the operation of libraries. Wilson also considered that the success of a librarian was dependent on both managerial skills and knowledge of books. Wilson succeeded W.S. Bernard as the librarian at University of North Carolina. Wilson also worked with Katherine McCall, a graduate of the New York State Library School at Albany, during the summer of 1901 changing the classification system from a fixed location to the more modern ‚Äúrelative‚Äù Dewey arrangement that was being adopted by librarians across the nation. The library at the University of North Carolina owned 38,593 volumes of books at that time. That same year, Wilson obtained his first grant for the university to establish two reading prizes open to students for consecutive reading during their sophomore and junior years. This was also a plan that was used at Haverford. In addition to these works, Wilson prepared an exhibit of early North Caroliniana for display at the State Fair, which won a gold medal for the library. Wilson's first annual report December 1901, Wilson prepared his first annual report for President Francis P. Venable, which was significant for his career as the new librarian as well as the fortunes of the university, and university libraries in general. Wilson stated that the ‚Äúgrowth and support of the university library was a matter of primary significance if teaching and research were to have a sound foundation‚Ä¶recognizing that the excellence of the library was not solely the responsibility of the librarian.\\" Wilson also urged the various academic departments to provide expertise in their fields by assisting the librarian in building the collections. The necessity of permanent assistants to help with the operations of the library was also stressed by Wilson, in addition to his emphasis on the careful treatment of rare items, and he was also concerned with building an extensive collection of North Carolina. In his report, Wilson came up with an important conclusion about the several short-term librarians that preceded his arrival as librarian at North Carolina. Wilson's statements in his report received the impressed attention of President Venable in which he wrote, ‚Äúthe salary of the Librarian should be increased so as to obtain the services of a skilled officer. Scarcely any instructor has the opportunity for more effective work among the students.‚Äù Important benchmarks Wilson received his Ph.D. in philology with a dissertation on Chaucer‚Äôs relative constructions in 1905 from the University of North Carolina as well. In 1905, he also joined the faculty as a German professor in 1905, and even began teaching courses in library science. Wilson helped found the North Carolina Library Association in 1904, and drafted the law establishing the North Carolina Library Commission in 1907. He co-founded the Southeastern Library Association and served as its president from 1924‚Äì1926, and also was president of the American Library Association in 1925.Silent Sentinels of Stone: Old Chapel Hill Cemetery.

In 1922 he founded the University of North Carolina Press, one of the most respected university publishing houses in the U.S., founded and edited Carolina‚Äôs Alumni Review magazine, helped construct UNC‚Äôs first student union, and organized a special department of the library with North Carolina Collection materials. University of Chicago Graduate Library School Wilson left Chapel Hill and became dean of the University of Chicago Graduate Library School in 1932. Edward G. Holley, during the Louis Round Wilson Centennial Day, stated that Wilson made the decade following his leadership at the University of Chicago, a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù for library education.Louis Round Wilson Centennial Day: Library Education in the Southeast Since World War II and University Libraries and Change.

The research and progress in the library science field under Wilson's leadership in Chicago has never been equaled. Wilson also later became a surveyor of libraries, helping several large libraries with impressive collections organize and catalog their materials to be more accessible.

Life and times Luna was born in Buenos Aires to a family originally from La Rioja Province in 1925. A grandfather had founded the La Rioja chapter of the newly established centrist Radical Civic Union (UCR) in 1892, and an uncle, Pelagio Luna, had been Vice President of Argentina for President Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen, between 1916 and 1919. He enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires and earned a law degree in 1951. He was first published in 1954 with his biographical work Yrigoyen. Opposed, as most in the UCR were, to the populist President Juan Per√≥n, Luna, after the 1955 overthrow of Per√≥n, was appointed Director of the Ministry of Labor's Employee Benefits Plan in 1956. Luna received his first literary prize in 1957 for his period tale La fusilaci√≥n (The Firing Squad); set in the nineteenth century, the work followed the controversial 1956 execution of General Juan Jos√© Valle and 27 others. This was followed by a biography of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, Yrigoyen's chief rival within the UCR, in 1958. He taught as Professor of the History of Institutions at his alma mater's law school between 1963 and 1976, and Contemporary History Professor at the private University of Belgrano between 1967 and 1986. Some of his best-known works from this period were Los caudillos, a look at provincial strongmen of the 19th and early 20th centuries (1966), El 45, referring to the pivotal year 1945 in Argentina (1968), and Argentina: de Per√≥n a Lanusse, an overview of the tumultuous generation between Per√≥n's 1945 advent and 1973. Vocalist Mercedes Sosa, Luna, and composer Ariel Ram√≠rez at work in 1972. Luna collaborated with pianist and composer Ariel Ram√≠rez as a lyricist for the Misa Criolla (Creole Mass), in 1964. This joint success was followed by Mujeres Argentinas (Argentine Women), in 1969, among whose themes Alfonsina y el mar (an ode to the ill-fated poet Alfonsina Storni) became particularly well-known. Ram√≠rez and Luna were joined by traditional folklore vocalist Mercedes Sosa for Cantata Sudamericana, a 1972 album which made the latter an iconic figure in the music of Argentina. As a historian, contributed weekly editorials on current events for Clar√≠n between 1964 and 1973, and as host of Hilando nuestra historia (Weaving Our History), an educational radio program, between 1977 and 1982.

They continued at a fast pace to climb Mount Abbot, Bear Creek Spire, Mount Dade, Turret Peak, Mount Darwin, The Hermit, Mount McGee, a first ascent of the (later named) Mount Mendel, Mount Goddard, Devils Crags, Mount Woodworth, Middle Palisade, Mount Sill, North Palisade, Polemonium Peak, Mount Winchell and Mount Agassiz. All of these climbs were completed in 24 days. Sierra Club Secretary Will Colby wrote, \\"Some youthful enthusiasts, including Glen Dawson, Jules Eichorn and John Olmstead, swarmed over everything that looked formidable in the way of a mountain peak.\\"Oliver, Bill, A Tribute to the Honorary Members of the Sierra Peaks Section - Past & Present: Norman Clyde, Glen Dawson and Jules Eichorn, The Sierra Echo, Volume 33 Number 6, Nov-Dec 1989  1931 season  On July 12, 1931, Francis P. Farquhar led a Sierra Club climbing school on Unicorn Peak near Yosemite National Park's Tuolumne Meadows. Dawson and Eichorn completed the first traverse of Unicorn Peak that day, and continued on to make the second ascent of Cockscomb Peak. They then joined up with young climber Walter (Bubs) Brem, hiked to Sawtooth Ridge and made a first ascent of Finger Peaks, a new route on the northwest face of Matterhorn Peak, and the first ascent of (later named) The Dragtooth. Returning to Tuolumne Meadows, Dawson and Eichorn climbed Cathedral Peak on July 24, and made the first ascent of its prominent west pinnacle, later named Eichorn Pinnacle. Joined by Brem, the trio then made the first ascent of Echo Ridge, later renamed Matthes Crest. The trio then moved south to the Minarets Range, and in a 14-hour effort, climbed Michael Minaret, Clyde Minaret, and the first ascent of Third Minaret (later renamed Eichorn Minaret). These are the three highest peaks in the Minarets. Sierra Club leader Farquhar had invited Harvard philosophy professor and Appalachian Mountain Club member Robert L. M. Underhill to come to the Sierra Nevada to teach the latest techniques of roped climbing. Underhill had learned these techniques in the Alps, and had used them earlier that summer in the Tetons and the Canadian Rockies. After the basic course was completed, the more advanced students, including Dawson, Eichorn, Norman Clyde, Lewis Clark, and Bestor Robinson, traveled south to the Palisades, the most rugged and alpine part of the Sierra Nevada. There, on August 13, 1931, the party completed the first ascent of the last unclimbed 14,000+ foot peak in California, which remained unnamed due to its remote location above the Palisade Glaciers. After a challenging ascent to the summit, the climbers were caught in an intense lightning storm, and Eichorn barely escaped electrocution when \\"a thunderbolt whizzed right by my ear\\". The mountain was named Thunderbolt Peak to commemorate that close call.Farquhar, Francis P., History of the Sierra Nevada (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1965) Underhill called Dawson and Eichorn \\"young natural-born rock climbers of the first water.\\" Jones, Chris, Climbing in North America (American Alpine Club & University of California Press, Berkeley, 1976) Photo of Jules Eichorn, Norman Clyde, Robert L. M. Underhill and Glen Dawson taken the day after the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney. Three days later on August 16, Dawson, Eichorn, Clyde, and Underhill completed the first ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the contiguous United States. The route was extremely exposed, especially the famous Fresh Air Traverse. Dawson was just 19 years old. Steve Roper called this route \\"one of the classic routes of the Sierra, partly because of its spectacular location and partly because it was the first really big wall to be climbed in the range.\\"Roper, Steve, The Climber's Guide to the High Sierra ( San Francisco, Sierra Club Books, 1976) Porcella & Burns wrote that \\"the climb heralded a new standard of technical competence in Californian rock climbing . . .\\"Porcella, Stephen P. & Burns, Cameron M., Climbing California's Fourteeners: 183 Routes to the Fifteen Highest Peaks (The Mountaineers, Seattle, 1998) , In Dawson's opinion, this was his most famous climb. At age 19, Dawson was already among the most accomplished mountaineers in California. Many years later, Dawson modestly wrote, \\"I am notable only as an historical curiosity or perhaps as a living fossil. My career as a rock climber spanned the years 1927 to about 1938. During my lifetime I have been an antiquarian bookseller and publisher but that one event of August 16, 1931 is my footnote in climbing history\\" Croft, Peter; Benti, Wynne; Contributors: Clyde, Norman; Dawson, Glen; Wheelock, Walt; Foreword by Glen Dawson, pages 7-9, Climbing Mt. Whitney (Spotted Dog Press, Bishop, CA, 2008) That fall, Dawson began his freshman year at UCLA as a history major.  1932 season  After four days of climbing, on June 15, 1932, Dawson, along with Clyde, Brem, Bestor Robinson and Dick Jones, reached the summit of El Picacho del Diablo, the highest peak in Baja California. They had thought that this was the first ascent, but they discovered a cairn on the summit. They later learned that mapmaker Donald McLain had made the first ascent in 1911. Returning to the Sierra Nevada, Dawson, Eichorn and Clyde joined the Sierra Club High Trip with 199 participants plus 25 mules with wranglers and horses. Dawson led a group to the summit of what was later named Mount Farquhar. Along with Thomas Rawles and Hans Helmut Leschke, he climbed the most difficult (#8) of the Kearsarge Pinnacles. A party of 16, including Dawson, Clyde, Farquhar and Eichorn then climbed Junction Peak. Dawson, Eichorn, Brem and Leschke then climbed a new route on Mount Russell, by way of the south face, west chute. Dawson then climbed the Red Kaweah and the Black Kaweah. Over the Labor Day weekend of 1932, Dawson and Dick Jones climbed Mount McAdie. Dawson served as Mountaineering Notes Editor for the Sierra Club Bulletin for 1932.  1933 season  On February 22, 1933 Dawson made the first ski ascent of Telegraph Peak in the San Gabriel Mountains. In 1933, Dawson, Eichorn and Dick Jones made the first ascent of what was later named Dawson Minaret in the Minarets. On the Sierra Club's annual High Trip, Dawson, along with Neil Ruge and Alfred Weiler, made a first ascent of the highest peak in The Pinnacles, two miles (3 km) west of Hutchison Meadow. With his sister Fern Dawson, he climbed Pilot Knob. With Bahlah Ballantine and Neil Ruge, he made a first ascent of unnamed Peak 13,332 near Mount Darwin. On July 25, 1933, he again surveyed the forbidding Devils Crags. In the days that followed, Dawson and other Sierra Club members made several successful ascents of the various summits. Later, he made a possible first ascent of Rambaud Peak, bringing his younger brother, Muir Dawson, along on the climb. With Eichorn, he pioneered a new route to Middle Palisade, climbing the (later named) Norman Clyde Peak along the way..\\"Oliver, Bill, A Tribute to the Honorary Members of the Sierra Peaks Section - Past & Present Part II - Beyond Whitney: Norman Clyde, Glen Dawson and Jules Eichorn, The Sierra Echo, Volume 36 Number 2, Mar-Apr 1992 Along with several other climbers, Dawson participated in the search for missing solo climber Walter A. Starr, Jr. in the Minarets in August, 1933, but was unsuccessful. This search was the last time that Dawson climbed on the same rope with Jules Eichorn. Norman Clyde later found Starr's body. Dawson wrote the foreword to the definitive book about this episode.Alsup, William, Missing in the Minarets: The Search for Walter A. Starr, Jr. (Yosemite Association, Yosemite national Park, CA, 2001) Dawson was among the founders of the Rock Climbing Section of the Southern California Chapter of the Sierra Club which began on November 5, 1933 with practice climbing at Eagle Rock. In December, 1933, the group completed challenging climbs on Castle Dome 20 miles north of Yuma, Arizona on the California side of the Colorado River. They also climbed Picacho Peak in Arizona.  1934‚Äì35 season  On the 4th of July weekend of 1934, Dawson along with Ted Waller completed the second ascent of the East Face of Mount Whitney, which he had first climbed in 1931. On July 11, 1934, Dawson, Jack Riegelhuth and Neil Ruge completed the first ascent of the Sierra Nevada peak later named Mount Ansel Adams. He also made the second ascent of Eichorn Pinnacle on that trip. In the Sawtooth Ridge area, he completed the first east to west traverse of The Three Teeth. With Riegelhuth and Ansel Adams, he made the first ascent of Blacksmith Peak, and then led a traverse from South Whorl to Whorl Peak. Heading north with Tony Charlton of the New Zealand Alpine Club, they climbed Mount Shasta, and in Oregon, Mount Thielsen, Three-Fingered Jack and Mount Washington. Continuing to Washington, they climbed Mount Rainier. They proceeded to the Canadian Rockies, where they climbed Mount Hungabee and Mount Temple in Banff National Park. On November 7, 1934, Dawson was part of the founding of the Ski Mountaineers of California. UCLA professor Walt Mosauer was the first president of the group, which later became the Ski Mountaineers Section of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club...\\"Oliver, Bill, A Tribute to the Honorary Members of the Sierra Peaks Section: Norman Clyde, Glen Dawson and Jules Eichorn - Part III, The Sierra Echo, Volume 51 Number 3, Jul-Sept 2007 In February, 1935 Dawson, Mosauer and several others attempted a number of winter ascents in the Bridgeport and Mammoth areas of the Sierra Nevada, but were turned back by storms. They finally succeeded in a ski ascent of Mammoth Mountain. This was many years before the downhill ski resort was established there.  1935 ‚Äì 1936 World Climbing Tour  In June 1935, after graduating from UCLA, Dawson set off on a long journey. Heading east by Greyhound bus, he visited Carlsbad Caverns and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. From Boston, he sailed on an Italian freighter to Trieste and then climbed in the Dolomites, including an ascent of the south wall of the Marmolata. In the Wetterstein of southern Bavaria, he climbed the Kubanek-Spiondler route on the south face of the Musterstein. He also climbed the Schusselkarspitze-Sudwand, probably the first ascent by an American. In all, he completed about 30 different climbs in the Alps in a six- week period. He continued to North Wales, where he climbed the Tennis Shoe route on the Idwal. He then traveled to the Soviet Union, where bad weather prevented a planned climb of Mount Elbrus. He crossed Siberia by train and arrived in Japan. There he completed several challenging climbs in the Mount Yari and Hodaka regions, and traversed Mount Fuji. Upon his return to the United States in 1936 after 14 months of overseas travel, he wrote, \\"After having climbed in a dozen different countries I can agree with John Muir and Clarence King that our own High Sierra is the finest and most friendly of all.\\" Oliver, Bill, A Tribute to the Honorary Members of the Sierra Peaks Section: Norman Clyde, Glen Dawson and Jules Eichorn - Part IV, The Sierra Echo, Volume 51 Number 4, Oct-Dec 2007  1937 season  In 1937, Dawson and Dick Jones led a first ascent of The Mechanic's Route on Tahquitz Rock, one of the first YDS 5.8 routes in the country. Tahquitz was then a new location for top Southern California rock climbers, since it is far closer to the Los Angeles area than Yosemite Valley. On September 5, 1937, Dawson, along with his brother Muir Dawson, Dick Jones, Bob Brinton and Howard Koster put up a new route on Mount Whitney, to the right of his 1931 East face route. This route, called the East Buttress route is rated YDS III 5.7, and is nicknamed the \\"Peewee Route\\".Croft, Peter; Benti, Wynne; Contributors: Clyde, Norman; Dawson, Glen; Wheelock, Walt; page 105, Climbing Mt. Whitney (Spotted Dog Press, Bishop, CA, 2008)  Later life  Dawson served as a Director of the Sierra Club from 1937 to 1951. His club service was interrupted from 1944 to 1947 because of military service. During World War II, Dawson served as a rock climbing and skiing instructor in the Tenth Mountain Division at Camp Hale, Colorado and in Italy. Outside Online Archives: Rock Legends , October 2000, retrieved October 2, 2009 He earned a Bronze Star in combat in Northern Italy. Dawson had a long career succeeding his father Ernest as proprietor of Dawson's Book Shop in Los Angeles, an antiquarian bookstore in business since 1905. His brother Muir also participated in the business. He has also published 370 collectible books, including miniatures. The business is still in operation and is now run by Michael, the third generation. Michael Dawson Gallery/Dawson's Book Shop - About, retrieved October 1, 2009 In 1990, Dawson was among a group of rare book experts who worked as consultants to the FBI on the case of Stephen Blumberg, a convicted thief who compulsively stole rare books. He helped determine the ownership of the books, which Blumberg had stolen from at least 327 libraries. He testified as an expert witness for the U. S. Government at Blumberg's trial, attesting for example that 271 items taken from the Connecticut State Library were worth $225,280. In 1973, Dawson was the winner of the Sierra Club's Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award, and in 2011, won the organization's Walter A. Starr Award for support of the club by a former director. Sierra Club Awards - List by Award Dawson stayed active in the mountaineering community, and willingly participated as a historical resource. In 2008, as the last surviving member of the climbing party that made the first ascent on Whitney's East Face in 1931, Glen wrote the foreword to the book, Climbing Mt. Whitney. In 2009, at the age of 97, he gave two public lectures on the occasion of the opening of an exhibit on the life of mountaineer Norman Clyde at the Eastern California Museum in Independence, California. On September 18, 2009, Dawson was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Azusa Pacific University for his accomplishments as a rare book expert, publisher and mountaineer. He was a resident of Pasadena, California and turned 100 in June 2012. At the time of his death, aged 103, Dawson had the longest tenure as a Sierra Club member, having been a club member for over 94 years.

It interacted with Typhoon Parma in the first week of October southeast of Taiwan. Meteorological historyPreparations Late on September 30, the island of Guam, was placed under a tropical storm warning, while the islands of Rota, Tinian and Saipan were placed under a typhoon watch. These warnings stayed in force until late on October 1, when the islands of Tinian and Saipan were placed under a typhoon warning. The warnings for the islands of Rota, Agrihan and Guam were also revised at this time with Rota and Agrihan placed under typhoon watches and tropical storm warnings, while Guam was placed under a tropical storm warning. Late the next day the warnings were once again revised with the tropical storm warning for Guam and while the typhoon watch was cancelled for both Rota and Agrihan, with Agrihan placed under a typhoon warning. Rotas remaining tropical storm warning was then cancelled early on October 3, before all of the warnings were cancelled later that day as Melor moved away from the Mariana Islands. Japan The Japan Meteorological Agency forecast that Typhoon Melor would make landfall near Tokyo on October 8 (Thursday). Weather forecasters issued warnings about strong winds and high waves on the sea. Melor moved with wind speeds of 252 kilometers per hour (156 mph) and bore down on the island of Minami Daito. Typhoon Melor, which was located at 512 km from the southeast of Naha in Okinawa on October 6 at 12 p.m. Japan time, was predicted to be on a path for Tokyo. The Japan Meteorological Agency forecast that the typhoon would have a speed of 180 km/h near its center. An official at the agency warned residents that the typhoon could bring very strong winds and high sea waves. \\"Typhoon Melor Japan\\" Impact=Mariana Islands Typhoon Melor near the Mariana Islands on October 3 Although a very powerful typhoon during its passage of the Mariana Islands, Melor produced little damage in the region. The main effects were minor flooded from heavy rainfall in Saipan. High winds also downed a few power lines and trees; however, no structural damage was reported. Roughly of rain fell on the island during the passage of Melor, including during a six-hour span. At the height of the storm, roughly 500 residences were without power on Tinian and Saipan; this was quickly reduced to 90 residences within several hours. Japan Typhoon Melor approaching Japan on October 7 As a weakened typhoon, Melor made landfall in Japan on October 7 with wind gusts over 155 km/h (100 mph), causing massive power outages. At the height of the storm, an estimated 500,000 residences, mainly around Tokyo, were without power. Trains were canceled during the storm as they were unable to travel in conditions produced by the storm. More than 2 million people, attempting to get to work, were stranded as transportation halted. According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, two people were killed during the storm and at least 100 other were injured throughout the country in various incidents. The first death occurred after a man on a motorcycle crashed into a downed tree and the other occurred after a man was struck by a broken tree limb. Roughly 400 homes were damaged or destroyed by Melor and monetary damages amounted to 130 billion yen ($1.5 billion USD). Another 64 people were injured, according to local media reports, after Melor reached landfall in Japan's Aichi prefecture early Thursday morning. Typhoon Melor landed south-west of Tokyo on the main island of Honsh≈´ on Thursday, October 8, causing at least two deaths and cutting electricity to thousands. Flights were also canceled and people evacuated amid flood and landslide warnings. Still, initial damage reports suggested the typhoon, while powerful, did not cause the type of widespread devastation initially warned. Meteorologists had been warning that the storm could be the most powerful to hit Japan in more than a decade. Melor was the first typhoon to reach landfall in Japan in two years. The storm was expected to drift off the country's eastern coast into the Pacific Ocean by Thursday evening. An official at Japan's meteorological agency said the storm weakened as it moved along the eastern coast, preventing heavier damage. The typhoon brought wind speeds of about 160 kilometers per hour while dumping 30 centimeters of rain in some regions, according to Japan Meteorological Agency. One 54-year-old man was killed while delivering newspapers when his bike hit a fallen tree in the early morning, while a 69-year-old man died in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo after a tree fell on him, according to local police officials. Many factories in the manufacturing-rich prefectures in central Japan were also shut from the storm. California The extratropical cyclone impacting California, after absorbing Melor's remnants. On October 14, 2009, the extratropical cyclone that had absorbed Melor's remnants impacted California, and broke several rainfall records.\\"List of California hurricanes\\" Local California media had reported that the remnant of Typhoon Melor was able to kick up winds to as high as 70 mph (110 km/h). Some trees and power lines were downed as a result of this storm. Melor's remnants produced up to 10 inches of rain in California's Santa Cruz Mountains. Aftermath=Japan The typhoon left 3 dead and caused $1.5 billion (2009 USD) in damage.

It was operated by Kerr-McGee Corporation (KMC) from 1965 to 1975. anadarko.com 2006 aug 10 press release Kerr-McGee Completes Separation of Tronox 2006 Mar 31 Jan 13, 2009 The Oklahoman via COMTEX  History  Some of the byproducts and waste from Kerr-McGee's uranium and thorium processing at its Cushing, Oklahoma refinery were transported to Cimarron in the 1960s. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) issued Radioactive Materials License SNM-928 in 1965 to Kerr-McGee Corporation for the uranium fuel fabrication facilities at the Cimarron site. Later, the AEC issued Radioactive Materials License SNM-1174 in 1970 to KMC for the mixed oxide fuel fabrication (MOFF) facilities at the Cimarron site. The plant made uranium fuel and MOX driver fuel pins for use in the Fast Flux Test Facility at the Hanford Site in Washington State. Along with NUMEC, between 1973 and 1975 Kerr-McGee made the fuel pins for FFTF cores 1 and 2. The pins were quality tested by the Plutonium Finishing Plant at Hanford. The MOX pins were created by the unusual co-precipitation of Plutonium Nitrate and Uranium Nitrate solution method. The plant shut down in 1976. In 1983 Kerr-McGee Nuclear split into Quivira Mining Corporation and Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, although both were still owned by Kerr-McGee. Sequoyah got the Cimarron plant. Sequoyah was then sold to General Atomics in 1988, but Kerr-McGee kept control of Cimarron under a subsidiary named the Cimarron Corporation. In 2005 Kerr- McGee formed a new subsidiary named Tronox, and it then gained ownership of Cimarron. Tronox was then spun off as an independent company in 2006, a few months before KMC was bought by Anadarko Petroleum. Tronox went bankrupt in 2008/2009, blaming in part the environmental debts it inherited from KMC. Tronox shareholders later sued Anadarko Petroleum (KMC's successor) for having misled investors. Investigations In 1975, the United States General Accounting Office published a report, Federal Investigations Into Certain Health, Safety, Quality Control and Criminal Allegations at Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation. In the report, the Comptroller General of the United States reported on working conditions at the Kerr-McGee Nuclear Corporation; radiological contamination and death of Karen Silkwood (an employee); and Kerr-McGee's quality assurance practices. The investigating agencies were the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atomic Energy Commission; the Energy Research and Development Administration, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These agencies studied Karen Silkwood's contamination with plutonium; the dispersion of uranium pellets on the grounds of the plant; and the unauthorized removal and possession of nuclear material from the plant. Karen Silkwood Karen Silkwood was employed by the facility when she died in a mysterious car crash after her union activism and whistleblowing. The summary of the abovementioned report of the US General Accounting Office concluded that Karen Silkwood was contaminated with plutonium on November 5, 6 and 7, 1974. On November 5, she was contaminated by the gloves of a laboratory glovebox used for working with plutonium. However, when Kerr-McGee examined and tested the gloves, no leaks were found. On November 6, she was again found to be contaminated. And on November 7, her nose and other parts of her body were found to be contaminated with plutonium, as was her apartment and roommate.

A large Indonesian contingent crossed the border and attacked the outpost at Long Jawai, about fifty miles into Borneo. A small mixed military and paramilitary force was defeated by the Indonesians but British Gurkha reinforcements were put into the jungle between the area and Indonesian Borneo. In a number of ambushes some of the withdrawing Indonesian force were killed. Background On 25 September 1963, Captain John Burlinson arrived at the village of Long Jawai, population of 500, and began setting up defences. His forces consisted of six Gurkhas led by Corporal Tejbahadur Gurung, two Police Field Force officers, and 21 local (paramilitary) Malaysian Border Scouts. However, an Indonesian reconnaissance party had been hiding in one of the village longhouses and was soon reinforced by a full-scale raiding party. The Gurkhas and Malaysians were oblivious to the danger. The Indonesians had moved into this area with 200 men and 300 porters. Battle On the early morning of September 28, a Malaysian border scout left his position to visit his sick wife in the village. While in the village, he spotted some Indonesian soldiers and raced back to warn his comrades. Corporal Gurung then rushed to the signallers and told them to call for support. He then grabbed a case of grenades and returned to the hill. As soon as he reached the top, the Indonesians fired 60mm mortars at them. As the signallers were trying to call in support from a school hut, the Indonesians raked the hut with gunfire, killing one Gurkha and one PFF operator. Another PFF operator was wounded but managed to stagger away back to his comrades. Meanwhile, the forces on the hill received heavy fire, but returned fire and put up a spirited defence. The fighting lasted for several hours. One Gurkha was killed by mortar fire, and another wounded by a bullet to the leg. Five Indonesians were killed. The Malaysian border scouts tried to slip away when they lost spirit. All but one were captured and frogmarched away. The remaining Gurkhas retreated. The Indonesians proceeded to execute ten of the captured border scouts, plunder the village, and bury their dead. Aftermath Other Gurkha units were soon airlifted in by helicopter and began attacking stragglers and small units broken off from the main force, all the while hunting for the main force. Helicopters enabled the Gurkhas to deploy ambush parties to likely withdrawal routes in orchestrated action that lasted until the end of October. The tortured bodies of seven Border Scouts were found. Twenty-six Indonesians were killed when their longboats were caught in an ambush on 1 October, the survivors of that attack were killed in an ambush on 10 October with 2 others being killed in separate ambushes. The battle had proved costly for both sides, with 13 British and Malaysian deaths and 33 Indonesian deaths. The local population lost all trust in the Indonesians after watching the killings of the captured border scouts. Tejbahadur Gurung was awarded the Military Medal for his leadership during the battle.

It is seen as one of a number of Vermeer's tronies ‚Äì depictions of models fancifully dressed that were not (as far as is known) intended to be portraits of specific, identifiable subjects. Others believe it is a portrait. Whether Vermeer chose family members as models or found them elsewhere in Delft is irrelevant to the appreciation of his paintings.W. Liedtke (2007) Dutch paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 890. Its attribution to Vermeer ‚Äì as it is on a (recycled) wood panel and not on canvas ‚Äì has been a matter of controversy with scholars on both sides of the argument.NGA catalog entry Provenance The painting, supposed to be executed 1665‚Äì1666, may have been among those owned by Vermeer's patron, Pieter Claesz van Ruijven and possibly, through inheritance it may have been passed on to his wife, Maria de Knuijt who died 1681; her daughter, Magdalena van Ruijven; and Magdalena's husband, Jacob Abrahamsz Dissius. It is thought to have been sold on an auction in Amsterdam on May 16, 1696 (probably no. 38, 39 or 40). It was bought at a sale at the H√¥tel de Bouillon, in Paris on December 10, 1822 (no. 28.) by Baron Louis Marie Baptiste Atthalin for 200 French francs. After his death it came to his nephew and adopted son, Laurent Atthalin; by inheritance to Baron Gaston Laurent-Atthelin and by inheritance to his wife, Baroness Laurent-Atthelin. The painting was sold by M. Knoedler & Co., New York and London, in November 1925 to Andrew W. Mellon for $290.000, who deeded it on March 30, 1932 to The A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust in Pittsburgh (a holding-place for Mellon's pictures while the National Gallery of Art was being established). The trust gave it to the NGA in 1937.

She was notable for being the first warship to use steam turbine propulsion Eric W. Osborne, Destroyers: An Illustrated History of Their Impact (ABC-CLIO, 2005) p36 and was manufactured by Parsons Marine. There were four shafts, with two propellers on each, one inboard and one outboard of the shaft A-bracket. Viper and another turbine-powered ship, the Armstrong Whitworth special-type were both lost to accidents in 1901: Viper foundered on rocks in fog during naval manoeuvres near Alderney on 3 August 1901, while Cobra broke her back in a storm in the North Sea on 18 September 1901. Since then the Royal Navy has not used snake names for destroyers. Construction and design A set of Viper turbines, showing (foreground) high-pressure turbine, and (background) low-pressure turbine and reversing engine mounted on the same shaft. Following the success of the turbine-powered yacht Turbinia, the British Admiralty, whose previous attempts at acquiring destroyers faster than the standard \\"thirty-Knotters\\", the reciprocating- engined Albatross, Express and Arab had been unsuccessful, placed an order on 4 March 1898 with Parsons Marine for a turbine-powered destroyer, HMS Viper. Parsons subcontracted the ship's hull to Hawthorn Leslie and Company of Tyneside, with Viper being laid down later that year.Lyon 2001, p. 30.Friedman 2009, p. 59. The turbines, supplied by Parsons, drove four shafts, with two propellers per shaft. The outer shafts were driven by high-pressure turbines and the inner shafts by low-pressure turbines, while the inner pair also was fitted with separate turbines for running astern. No cruising engines were fitted. Four Yarrow boilers fed the turbines, the uptakes from which were routed to three funnels.Manning 1961, p. 43. The ship had a contract speed of , although Parsons expected the ship to reach speeds of at least . Viper carried a gun armament of a single QF 12 pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun on a platform on the ship's conning tower (in practice the platform was also used as the ship's bridge) and five 6-pounder (57 mm) guns, together with two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, the standard armament for contemporary Royal Navy destroyers.Lyon 2001, pp. 98‚Äì99. Viper was launched on 6 September 1899. On trials, she comfortably met the contract speed, reaching during her fuel consumption trial on 16 August 1900, and over a measured mile during full speed trials on 31 August 1900, making her the fastest destroyer in the world. Reports indicate that Viper may have reached even higher speeds during trials, variously reported as or even . While the ship's turbines allowed the ship to reach very high speeds in trials, with low levels of vibration, fuel consumption was very high, and the ship's turbines, which had been optimised for high speed, were inefficient at slower speeds. This made Viper of limited use to the Fleet, being capable of patrolling off Alderney from her base at Portland for only 24 hours before being forced to return to base due to lack of fuel.Friedman 2009, pp. 59‚Äì61.Lyon 2001, pp. 30‚Äì31. Loss of Viper On 3 August 1901 Viper sailed from Portland to take part in a search as part of the annual fleet exercises. Arriving off Alderney's Casquet Rocks in mid- afternoon, she spent some time searching the area. Visibility was generally good, although there were patches of mist, and she was able to sight a vessel playing the 'enemy' in the exercise. By early evening the mist had become fog and she slowed to 10 knots. At 17:23 breakers were spotted on the starboard bow and she turned to port, but found rocks all around and soon grounded. The destroyer fought clear, but soon grounded again and lost her propellers, finally drifting broadside onto the rocks. By 18:45, with the engine room flooded and Viper heeling over, she was abandoned. A local pilot's launch arrived to offer assistance and towed the boats ashore with the crew. Daylight on the following day showed her on Renonquet Rocks and beyond recovery. The damage increased until her back was broken and the bow section sheared around perpendicular to the keel. The subsequent enquiry found that the commanding officer, Lieutenant William Speke, had failed to exercise proper precautions while steaming in fog. In particular, he had not ensured that an accurate record of the courses steered was maintained. He was reprimanded. The navigating officer, Sub-Lieutenant Kenneth Mackenzie Grieve, was informed that he had \\"incurred their Lordships' displeasure\\", having inserted the missing data into the log following the wreck. In December 1901 Vipers wreck was sold to Messrs. Agnes and Co., of Southampton, for ¬£100. ReferencesBibliography   Hepper, David (2006).

Blackstone is southeast of Streator and west of Dwight, Illinois. Blackstone has a post office with ZIP code 61313.ZIP Code Lookup It is part of the geographic region known as Streatorland. History The town was named after 19th-century railroad executive Timothy Blackstone, then president of the Alton Railroad.Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Livingston County, 1909, p. 830 A post office was established in 1870. Blackstone was situated on the western extension of the Chicago & Alton Railroad, nearly midway between the cities of Streator and Dwight. The land where the town was located originally belonged to R. B. Hamilton. About the time that the line of the railroad was completed, the land was purchased by William Shepard of Jersey County, Illinois. He commissioned A. C. Huetson to lay out the town which he completed on January 6, 1870. The original plat consisted of eighty acres.The History of Livingston County, Illinois, 1878, pp. 561-562 The first house within the limits of the town had been built by R. B. Hamilton prior to the arrival of the town and the railroad. Shortly after the survey was completed, Frank McIntosh built a general merchandise store and R. B. Hamilton erected a warehouse for storing grain. By 1878, the warehouse was idle, the business having been absorbed by the Kent Brothers who had built a grain elevator.The History of Livingston County, Illinois, 1878, pp. 561-562 Once Blackstone was established, the post office of Sunbury Township was moved to the town. Charles A. Holton was Blackstone's first Postmaster. Early settlers in Blackstone included J. L. Colier, Enoch Sherick, R. D. Gregg, J. T. Trainor and J. A. Fout. Colier was a blacksmith. Fout was a carpenter who built many of the early houses in Blackstone.The History of Livingston County, Illinois, 1878, pp. 561-562 In the early years of Blackstone, there were no organized churches. Sunday services of several denominations were held by turns in the two room schoolhouse on the north side of the village. The United Methodist Church in Blackstone was built in 1879 at the cost of $5,000.00. St. Bernard Catholic Church was located four miles east of Blackstone and began service in 1880. The first church was a frame wood building. The brick church was later built in 1895 at a cost of $7,000.00.A History of Livingston County, Illinois, 1991, pp. 14-15 NotesReferences *Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois and History of Livingston County, Edited by Newton Bateman, Paul Selby, Christopher C.

The limited populations and interactions between those populations (as compared to places like Europe) hampered the development of widespread, deadly diseases in the Americas. One notable disease of American origin is syphilisMartin, Debra L, and Alan H Goodman. ‚ÄúHealth conditions before Columbus: paleopathology of native North Americans.‚Äù The Western journal of medicinevol. 176,1 (2002): 65-8. doi:10.1136/ewjm.176.1.65; aside from that, most of the major epidemic diseases we are familiar with today originated in the Old World (Africa, Asia, and Europe). The American era of limited disease ended with the arrival of Europeans in the Americas and the Columbian exchange of organisms, including those that cause human diseases. European diseases and epidemics, while still present among Native American populations today, were especially influential in Native American life of the past. European diseases devastated entire tribes. In more modern times, these diseases still plague Native American populations. Current diseases and epidemics are being addressed by many different groups, both governmental and independent, through a multitude of programs. Because Native American populations were not previously exposed to most diseases introduced by European colonists, populations rarely had built up individual or population immunities to those diseases. In addition, Europe's position as a crossroads between many different peoples, many of whom were separated by hundreds, if not thousands, of miles‚Äîthrough things like constant war spreading afflictions throughout the continent and the Silk Road bringing diseases from the East‚Äîresulted in Europeans developing immunity to a large variety of diseases. Therefore, the diseases brought by the Europeans, which had little effect on them as a population, greatly affected, and often continue to affect, Native Americans. This phenomenon is known as the virgin soil effect. European contact A sick Native American in the 19th century, being cared for by a medicine man. The arrival of Europeans also brought on the Columbian exchange. During this period European settlers brought many different technologies and lifestyles with them. Arguably, the most harmful effect of this exchange was the arrival and spread of disease. Numerous diseases were brought to the Americas, including smallpox, bubonic plague, chickenpox, cholera, the common cold, diphtheria, influenza, malaria, measles, scarlet fever, sexually transmitted diseases, typhoid, typhus, tuberculosis, and pertussis. Each of these brought destruction through sweeping epidemics, involving disability, illness, and extensive deaths. Arriving Europeans infected with diseases either possessed them in a dormant state, were actively infected but asymptomatic, or only had mild symptoms because Europe had been subject to a selective process by these diseases, for centuries. They therefore often-unknowingly passed the diseases to natives, where they became epidemics. The trade of Native American captives and the use of commercial trade routes contributed to the spread of disease. The diseases brought by Europeans are not easily tracked, since there were numerous outbreaks and all were not equally recorded. Suzanne Austin Alchon writes that ‚Äúindirect evidence suggests that some serious illness may have arrived with the 1500 colonists who accompanied Columbus's second expedition in 1493. [...] And by the end of 1494, disease and famine had claimed two-thirds of the Spanish settlers.‚Äù The most destructive disease brought by Europeans was smallpox. The first well-documented smallpox epidemic happened in 1518. The Lakota Indians called the disease the running face sickness. Smallpox was lethal to many Native Americans, bringing sweeping epidemics and affecting the same tribes repeatedly. Certain cultural and biological traits made Native Americans more susceptible to these diseases. Emphasis placed on visiting the sick led to the spread of disease through continual contact. Native Americans first exposed to these diseases also had an approach to illness relating primarily to religious beliefs. Their societies typically believed that disease is caused by either a lack of charm use, an intrusion of an object by means of sorcery, or the free soul's absence from the body. Disease was understood to enter the body if one is not protected by the spirits, as it is a natural occurrence. Religious powers were called on to cure diseases in the practice of shamanism. Disease evolution and host‚Äìpathogen interactions may have influenced Native American disease history. Disease evolution is the result of the interaction of hosts, pathogens, and setting. One example of disease evolution is the direct biological effects of crowding that directly influence a host's susceptibility to disease. Power et al. (1998) demonstrated that, at low doses of the microbacterial pathogen, hosts are able to make an appropriate immune response and avoid tuberculosis; higher doses result in a less efficient form of vaccination. The crowding that was a result of widespread relocation and concentration of native groups by the expansion of European settlement greatly influenced the susceptibility of native people to foreign diseases.Ramenofsky, Ann. 2003.

Mary Jemison, a Seneca captive, was taken in 1755 in what is now Adams County, Pennsylvania. She married a Delaware, and later chose to remain with the Seneca. In James E. Seaver's (Jemison's biographer) interview, she described her many hardships, including travels to Fort Pitt. In 1762, her seventh year of captivity, she reported the death of her first husband from \\"sickness\\".Seaver James E.A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison(1824) Thomas Hutchins, in his August 1762 Journal entry among the Natives at Ohio's Fort Miami, named for the Mineamie people, reports: The Siege of Fort Pitt took place during June and July 1763 in what is now the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The siege was a part of Pontiac's War, an effort by Native Americans to remove the British from the Ohio Country and Allegheny Plateau after they refused to honor their promises and treaties to leave voluntarily after the defeat of the French. The Native American efforts to remove the British from Fort Pitt ultimately failed. This event is best known as an early instance of biological warfare, in which the British gave items from a smallpox infirmary as gifts to Native American emissaries Turtleheart and Mamaltee with the hope of spreading the deadly disease to nearby tribes, as documented in William Trent's journal.Ecuyer, Simeon: Fort Pitt and letters from the frontier (1892). Captain Simeon Ecuyer's Journal: Entry of June 24,1763 The effectiveness is unknown, although the method used is inefficient compared to respiratory transmission and any results of these attempts to spread the disease are difficult to differentiate from naturally occurring epidemics. Gershom Hicks, held captive by the Ohio Country Shawnee and Delaware between May 1763 and April 1764, reported to the 42nd Regiment Captain William Grant \\"that the Small pox has been very general & raging amongst the Indians since last spring and that 30 or 40 Mingoes, as many Delawares and some Shawneese Died all of the Small pox since that time, that it still continues amongst them\\".Burke, James P., Pioneers of Second Fork (pgs. 19‚Äì22) John McCullough, a Delaware captive since July, 1756, who was then 15 years old, wrote: \\"Soon after we got home to Mahoning, instead of taking me to Pittsburgh, agreeable to their promise, they set out on their Fall hunt, taking me along with them; we staid out till some time in the Winter before we returned.\\" He continues that, on June 2, 1763,McCullough, John: The Captivity of John McCullough Personally written after eight years of captivity.

Dixon, David, Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America (pg. 155) Between 1837 and 1870, at least four different epidemics struck the Plains tribes. When the Plains tribes began to learn of the \\"white man‚Äôs diseases\\", many intentionally avoided contact with them and their trade goods. But the lure of trade goods such as metal pots, skillets, and knives sometimes proved too strong, leading people to trade with the white newcomers anyway and inadvertently spread disease to their villages. Impact on population numbers Graph of population decline in central Mexico caused by successive epidemics Many Native American tribes experienced great depopulation, averaging 25‚Äì50% of the tribes' members lost to disease. Additionally, smaller tribes neared extinction after facing a severely destructive spread of disease. A specific example was Cort√©s' invasion of Mexico. Before his arrival, the Mexican population is estimated to have been around 25 to 30 million. Fifty years later, the Mexican population was reduced to 3 million, mainly by infectious disease. A 2018 study by Koch, Brierley, Maslin and Lewis concluded that an estimated \\"55 million indigenous people died following the European conquest of the Americas beginning in 1492.\\" Yale historian David Brion Davis describes this as \\"the greatest genocide in the history of man. Yet it's increasingly clear that most of the carnage had nothing to do with European barbarism. The worst of the suffering was caused not by swords or guns but by germs.\\" For example, by 1700, less than five thousand Native Americans remained in the southeastern coastal region of the United States. In Florida alone, there were 700,000 Native Americans in 1520, but by 1700 the number was around 2000. In summer 1639, a smallpox epidemic struck the Huron natives in the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes regions. The disease had reached the Huron tribes through traders returning from Qu√©bec and remained in the region throughout the winter. When the epidemic was over, the Huron population had been reduced to roughly 9000 people, about half of what it had been before 1634.Bruce Trigger. Natives and Newcomers: Canada‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeroic Age‚Äù Reconsidered. (Kingston: McGill- Queen‚Äôs University Press, 1985), 588‚Äì589. The Iroquois people faced similar losses. During the 1770s, smallpox killed at least 30% of the West Coast Native Americans.Smallpox, The Canadian Encyclopedia The smallpox epidemic of 1780‚Äì1782 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians. By 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans.Lewis Cass and the Politics of Disease: The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832. Muse.jhu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-06. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1839 reported on the casualties of the 1837 Great Plains smallpox epidemic: \\"No attempt has been made to count the victims, nor is it possible to reckon them in any of these tribes with accuracy; it is believed that if [the number 17,200 for the upper Missouri River Indians] was doubled, the aggregate would not be too large for those who have fallen east of the Rocky Mountains.\\"The Effect of Smallpox on the Destiny of the Amerindian; Esther Wagner Stearn, Allen Edwin Stearn; University of Minnesota; 1945; Pgs. 13-20, 73-94, 97 Disease had both direct and indirect impacts on deaths. Losses from disease weakened communities. There were fewer people to hunt, plant crops, and otherwise support their society through physical means. Loss of cultural knowledge transfer also impacted the population. Missing the right time to hunt or plant the crops affected the food supply, thus weakening the community and making it more vulnerable to the next epidemic. The communities under such crisis were often unable to care for the disabled, elderly, or young. Some climate scientists have suggested that a severe reduction of the indigenous population in the Americas and the accompanying reduction in cultivated lands during the 16th century may have contributed to a global cooling event known as the Little Ice Age. The loss of the population was so high that it was partially responsible for the myth of the Americas as \\"virgin wilderness\\", as by the time significant European colonisation was underway, native populations had already been reduced by 90%, leading to settlements vanishing, forests recovering and fields abandoned, giving the impression of an untamed wilderness.Denevan, William M. \\"The pristine myth: the landscape of the Americas in 1492.\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 82, no. 3 (1992): 369-385. Historian David Stannard asserts that by \\"focusing almost entirely on disease ... contemporary authors increasingly have created the impression that the eradication of those tens of millions of people was inadvertent‚Äîa sad, but both inevitable and \\"unintended consequence\\" of human migration and progress,\\" and adds that their destruction \\"was neither inadvertent nor inevitable,\\" but the result of microbial pestilence and purposeful genocide working in tandem. Historian Andr√©s Res√©ndez says that evidence suggests \\"among these human factors, slavery has emerged as a major killer\\" of the indigenous populations of the Caribbean between 1492 and 1550 rather than diseases such as smallpox, influenza and malaria. Disability Epidemics killed a large portion of people with disabilities and also created a large number of people with disabilities. The material and societal realities of disability for Native American communities were tangible. Scarlet fever could result in blindness or deafness, and sometimes both. Smallpox epidemics led to blindness and depigmented scars. Many Native American tribes prided themselves in their appearance, and the resulting skin disfigurement of smallpox deeply affected them psychologically. Unable to cope with this condition, tribe members were said to have committed suicide. Contemporary diseases The leading causes of death by percentage for Native Americans and Alaska Natives for 2005. Heart disease accounted for 25% of deaths, cancer 22%, accidents 19%, diabetes 7%, liver disease 6%, suicide 6%, respiratory diseases 6%, stroke 4%, homicide 3%, and influenza and pneumonia 3%. Native Americans share many of the same health concerns as their non-Native American, United States citizen counterparts. For instance, Native Americans leading causes of death include \\"heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries (accidents), diabetes, and stroke\\". Other health concerns include \\"high prevalence and risk factors for mental health and suicide, obesity, substance abuse, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), teenage pregnancy, liver disease, and hepatitis.\\" The leading causes of death for Native Americans include the following diseases: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic liver disease / cirrhosis.Barnes, P.M., P.F. Adams, and E. Powell-Griner. (2010). Health Characteristics of the Native American or Alaska Native Adult Population: United States, 2004‚Äì2008. Hyattsville, MD: U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics. Overall, Native American life expectancy at birth (as of 2008) is 73.7 years, 4.4 years shorter than the United States average. Though many of these appear to be concerns paralleling those of non-Native Americans, some of these diseases present a much greater threat to Native Americans' well-being. American Indians and Alaska Natives die at greater rates from: chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, unintentional injuries, assault/homicide, intentional self- harm/suicide, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. These discrepancies in disease patterns vary significantly between diseases, but have a significant impact on the population. The genetic composition of Native Americans and clans can have an influence on many diseases and their continuing presence. The commonly lower socioeconomic status limits the ability of many to receive adequate health care and make use of preventative measures. Also, certain behaviors that take place commonly in the Native American culture can increase risk of disease. When the period of tribal termination in the 20th century occurred, post termination many tribes could no longer afford to keep their hospitals open. Native Americans have higher rates of tobacco use than white, Asian, or black communities. Native American men are about as likely to be moderate to heavy drinkers as white men, but about 5‚Äì15% more likely to be moderate to heavy drinkers than black or Asian men. Native Americans are 10% less likely to be at a healthy weight than white adults, and 30% less likely to be at a healthy weight than Asian adults. On a similar note, they have far greater rates of obesity, and were also less likely to engage in regular physical activity than white adults. Data collected by means of secondary sources such as the US Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics showed that from 1999 to 2009 Alaska Natives and Native Americans had high mortality rates to infectious diseases when compared to the mortality rate of white Americans. Alaska natives from the age groups 0‚Äì19 and 20‚Äì49 had death rates 4 to 5 times higher than compared to whites. Native Americans from the 20‚Äì49 age group in the Northern Plains were also 4 to 5 times more likely to die to infectious diseases than whites. Also found was that Native American and Alaska Natives were 13 times more likely to contract tuberculosis than whites. Native Americans were at least twice as likely to have unmet medical needs due to cost and were much less likely to have seen a dentist within the last five years compared with white or Asian adults, putting them at risk for gingivitis and other oral diseases. As it stands, Native American/ Alaska Natives face high rates of health disparity compared to other ethnic groups.2005\\\\. Health Characteristics of the Native Americans and Alaska Native Adult Population: U.S., 19992003 : Advance Data: From Vital and Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics;2005 ASI 41468.357;PHS 20051250, No. 356. n.p.: Heart disease The leading cause of death of Native Americans is heart disease. In 2005, it claimed 2,659 Native American lives. Heart disease occurs in Native American populations at a rate 20 percent greater than all other United States races. Additionally, the demographic of Native Americans who die from heart disease is younger than other United States races, with 36% dying of heart disease before age 65. The highest heart disease death rates are located primarily in South Dakota and North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.(https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_aian.htm) Heart disease in Native Americans is not only due to diabetic complications; the increased risk is also due to higher rates of hypertension. Native American populations have been documented as being more likely to have high blood pressure than other groups, such as white Caucasians. Studies have also been conducted that associate the exposure to stress and trauma to an increased rate of heart disease. It has been documented in Native American populations that adverse childhood experiences, which are significantly more common in the Native American demographic, have a positively linear relationship with heart disease, as well an increasing influence on symptoms of heart disease. Cancer Cancer has a documented presence among Native Americans, and the rates of certain types of cancer exceed that of the general population of the United States. For instance, Native American males were twice as likely to have liver cancer than white males in 2001‚Äì05. Women are 2.4 times as likely to contract and die from liver cancer as their white counterparts. Rates of alcoholism of Native Americans are also greater than in the general population. Stomach cancer was also 1.8 times more common in Native American males than white males, in addition to being twice as likely to be fatal. Other cancers, such as kidney cancer, are more common among Native American populations. It is important to note that overall cancer rates are lower among Native Americans compared to the white population of the United States. For cancers that are more prevalent in Native Americans than the white United States population, death rates are higher. Diabetes The rates of death by diabetes for each race and ethnicity in the United States in 2005 Diabetes has posed a significant health risk to Native Americans. Type I diabetes is rare among Native Americans. Type II diabetes is a much more significant problem and is the type of diabetes referred to in the remainder of this section. The prevalence of diabetes began primarily in the middle of the twentieth century and has grown into an epidemic. This time frame coincides with the fact that Indians were now living on reservations. With the uprooting of Indians and their traditional way of life, and being put onto reservations, this removed not only their main source of exercise with hunting and gathering, but also the healthier food that they were used to eating. About 16.3% of Native American adults have been diagnosed with diabetes. Type two diabetes and the complications that follow have gone from being acute infectious diseases to chronic illnesses within Native American and Alaska Native communities. Native Americans and Alaska Natives experience high rates of end-stage renal disease, which is mainly driven by, and directly correlates with, the increase in diabetes within their communities. Native Americans are about 2.8 times more likely to have Type II diabetes than white individuals of comparable age. The rates of diabetes among Native Americans also continue to rise. During the eight-year span of 1990 to 1998, diabetes grew 65% among the Native American population. This is very significant growth, and this growth continues in the present day. The highest rates of diabetes in the world are also found among a Native American tribe. The Pima tribe of Arizona took part in a research study on diabetes which documented diabetes rates within the tribe. This study found that the Pimas had diabetes rates 13 times that of population of Rochester, Minnesota, a primarily white populace. Diabetes was documented in over one third of Pimas from ages 35‚Äì44, and in over sixty percent of those over 45 years of age. There are multiple causes for diabetes to cast such a presence on the Native American demographic: ; Genetic predisposition : Native Americans with the \\"least genetic admixture with other groups\\" have been found to be at a higher risk of developing diabetes. the genetic makeup of the American Indian allowed their bodies to store energy for use in times of famine. When food was plentiful, their bodies stored excess carbohydrates through an exaggerated secretion of insulin called hypersulinemia, and be able to use this stored energy when food was scarce. When feast or famine was no longer an issue, and food was always plentiful, with modern, high caloric foods, their bodies may not have been able to handle the excess fat and calories, resulting in type II diabetes. ; Obesity : Native Americans have a significant health problem with obesity, as they are 1.6 times more likely to be obese than a white American.;\\"Native American/Alaska Native Profile ‚Äì The Office of Minority Health.\\" Home Page ‚Äì The Office of Minority Health. 31 July 2009. Web. 01 Oct. 2009. Native Americans are as likely as black adults to be obese. Obesity is known as a general causative factor of diabetes, which is generally caused by Food Deserts, a lack of readily available nutritious foods, in reservations. ; Low birth weight : The correlation between low birth weight and increased risk of diabetes has been documented in Native American populations ; Diet : Changes in Native American diets have been associated with the increase in diabetes, as more high calorie and high fat foods are consumed, replacing the traditionally agriculturally driven diet. As time has gone there has been a push for Native Americans to return to their traditional ways; including growing and eating traditional foods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been a huge proponent of Native Americans returning to traditional diets. Even going as far as too make a PSA in 2013, which involved Cherokee actors discussing diabetes, and the impact diet has on their increased risk. In the past several years agencies such as the IHS (part of the U.S. Public Health Svc.) & the Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention (DDTP) have offered up 19 diabetes programs, 12 control officers, and 399 grant programs such as SDPI (Special Diabetes program for Indians), aimed at educating and helping Native Americans to hopefully one day abolish diabetes for good.  Mental health  Other issues that Native Americans are facing are mental health and suicide. Native Americans have the highest rate of suicide out of any ethnic group in the United States, in 2009 suicide was the leading cause of death among Native Americans and Native Alaskans between the ages of 10 and 34. 75% of deaths among Native Americans and Native Alaskans over the age of 10 are due to unintentional injury, homicide, and suicide. Suicide rates among Native American youths is significantly higher than the suicide rates among white youths. The head of the IHS, Mary L. Smith, says that there will be a new focus on mental health issues in Native American communities, and that since there is a tremendous amount of suicide among teens on the Pine Ridge reservation they are designating it a Promise Zone and sending extra help. A British Columbia study, published in 2007, observed the correlation between Indigenous youth suicide and the use of their heritage language. It was found that language use was more highly correlated to youth suicide than six other cultural continuity factors. The study also recorded the findings between bands with higher language use and lower language use of Indigenous language. Communities with lesser language knowledge estimated 96.59 suicides per 100,000 individuals; the bands with greater language knowledge estimated 13 suicides per 100,000 people. Indigenous youth‚Äôs mental health shares a relationship with the use of Indigenous language. Through this study language revitalization is proven to have a positive impact on Indigenous youth's mental well being. =Impact= The significant presence of diabetes also brings other health complications, such as end-stage renal disease. Each of these are more prevalent in the Native American population. Diabetes has caused premature death of Native Americans by vascular disease, especially in those diagnosed with diabetes later in life. It has been reported among the Pima Tribe to cause elevated urinary albumin excretion. Native Americans with diabetes have a significantly higher rate of heart disease than those without diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is the \\"leading underlying cause of death in diabetic adults\\" in Native Americans. Diabetes has caused nephropathy among Native Americans, leading to renal function deterioration, failure, and disease. Prior to the increase in cardiovascular disease among diabetic Native Americans, renal disease was the leading cause of death. Another complication documented in diabetic Native Americans, as well as other diabetic populations, is retinopathy. Lower extremity amputations are also higher among Native American populations with diabetes. In studies of the Pima tribes, those with diabetes were found to have much higher prevalence of periodontal disease. Additionally, those with diabetes have higher instances of bacterial and fungal infection. This is seen in statistics such as \\"diabetic Sioux (Lakota people) Tribes were four times as likely to have tuberculosis as those without diabetes.\\" Prior to the 1940s diabetes was virtually unheard of, but ever since the 1960s the prevalence has been on the rise. This rise is thought to be in part due to their food history and culture. Native Americans had a diverse food history prior to colonization, but after colonization the natives were forced to live on non-traditional lands and eat government hand-outs for food. Much of this food was of low quality, meaning that here is not much nutritional content for the caloric intake and led to many Natives being malnourished. Native Americans with diabetes have a death rate three times higher than those in the non-Native population. Diabetes can shorten a person's life by approximately 15 years. As of 2012, diabetes was not the leading cause of death for Native Americans itself but contributed significantly to the top leading causes of death. The barriers for Native Americans and Alaskan Natives to receive proper health care include the isolated locations of some tribes make traveling to facilities far too difficult to travel the distance, hazardous roads, high rates of poverty, and too few staff in hospitals near reservations. Another contributing factor is that Native people generally wait longer for organ transplants than white people. Diabetes is primary cause of end-stage renal disease, and dialysis treatments and kidney transplants remain the most effective methods of treatment Alcoholism Another significant concern in Native American health is alcoholism. From 2006 to 2010, alcohol-attributed deaths accounted for 11.7 percent of all Native American deaths, more than twice the rates of the general U.S. population. The median alcohol-attributed death rate for Native Americans (60.6 per 100,000) was twice as high as the rate for any other racial or ethnic group.CDC, \\"Alcohol-Attributable Deaths and Years of Potential Life Lost ‚Äî 11 States, 2006‚Äì2010,\\" MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2014 Mar 14; 63(10): 213‚Äì216. Published online 2014 Mar 14. Alcoholism is often approached using the disease model of addiction, with biological, neurological, genetic, and environmental sources of origin.Matamonasa-Bennett A. \\"The Poison That Ruined the Nation\\": Native American Men-Alcohol, Identity, and Traditional Healing. Am J Mens Health. 2017;11(4):1142‚Äì1154. This model has been challenged by research showing that Native American behavior is frequently affected by trauma resulting from domestic violence, racial discrimination, poverty, homelessness, historical trauma, disenfranchised grief, and internalized oppression. Statistically, the incidence of alcohol abuse among survivors of trauma is significantly elevated, with survivors of physical, emotional and sexual abuse in childhood having the highest rates of alcohol abuse.Buchwald, D., Tomita, S., Hartman, S., Furman, R., Dudden, M. & Manson, S. M. \\"Physical abuse of urban Native Americans.\\" Journal of General Internal Medicine, 2000;15, 562-564.Amanda Lechner, Michael Cavanaugh, Crystal Blyler. \\"Addressing Trauma in American Indian and Alaska Native Youth,\\" Research paper developed for the Dept. of Health & Human Services by Mathematica Policy Research, Washington, DC August 24, 2016. However, at least one recent study refutes the belief that Native Americans drink more than white Americans. Analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2009 to 2013 revealed that Native Americans compared to whites had lower or comparable rates across the range of alcohol measures examined. The survey included responses from 171,858 whites compared to 4,201 Native Americans. The majority (59.9%) of Native Americans abstained from drinking alcohol, whereas less than half (43.1%) of the white population surveyed abstained. Approximately 14.5% of Native Americans were light/moderate-only drinkers, versus 32.7% of whites. Native American and white binge drinking (5+ drinks on an occasion 1-4 days during the past month) estimates were similar: 17.3% and 16.7%, respectively. The two populations' heavy drinking (5+ drinks on an occasion 5+ days in the past month) estimates were also similar: 8.3% and 7.5%, respectively. Nonetheless, Native Americans may be more vulnerable to higher risks associated with drinking because of lack of access to health care, safe housing and clean water. After colonial contact, white drunkenness was interpreted by whites as the misbehavior of an individual. Native drunkenness was interpreted in terms of the inferiority of a race. What emerged was a set of beliefs known as \\"firewater myths\\" that misrepresented the history, nature, sources and potential solutions to Native alcohol problems.Gonzalez VM, Skewes MC. \\"Association of the firewater myth with drinking behavior among American Indian and Alaska Native college students.\\" Psychol Addict Behav. 2016 Dec; 30(8):838-849. Epub 2016 Oct 13.Gonzalez VM, Bravo AJ, Crouch MC, \\"Endorsement of the 'firewater myth' affects the use of protective behavioral strategies among American Indian and Alaska Native students.\\" Addict Behav. 2019 Jun; 93:78-85. Epub 2019 Jan 22. These myths claim that: * American Indians have an inborn, insatiable appetite for alcohol. * American Indians are hypersensitive to alcohol (cannot ‚Äúhold their liquor‚Äù) and are inordinately vulnerable to addiction to alcohol. * American Indians are inordinately prone to violence when intoxicated. * These very traits produced immediate, devastating effects when alcohol was introduced to Native tribes via European contact. * The solutions to alcohol problems in Native communities lie in resources outside these communities. Scientific literature has debunked many of these myths by documenting the wide variability of alcohol problems across and within Native tribes and the very different response that certain individuals have to alcohol as opposed to others.Coyhis, D. and White, W. (2002) \\"Addiction and Recovery in Native America: Lost History, Enduring Lessons.\\" Counselor, 3(5):16-20. The 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC- III) found that 19.2% of Native Americans surveyed had had an alcohol use disorder during the previous twelve months, and 43.4% had had an alcohol use disorder at some time during their lives (compared to 14.0% and 32.6% of whites, respectively).Grant BF, Goldstein RB, Saha TD, et al. \\"Epidemiology of DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder: Results From the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III.\\" JAMA Psychiatry. 2015;72(8):757‚Äì766. This contrasts sharply with the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which surveyed adolescents and adults receiving treatment and found that 9.7% of Native Americans surveyed had had an alcohol use disorder during the previous twelve months (compared to 6.1% of whites).\\"Behavioral Health Barometer: United States, Volume 4: Indicators, as measured through the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\\" HHS Publication No. SMA‚Äì17‚ÄìBaroUS‚Äì16. Rockville, MD: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2017. An analysis of surveys conducted between 2002 and 2016 determined that 34.4% of Native American adults used alcohol in 2016 (down from 44.7% in 2002).Table 50: Use of selected substances in the past month among persons aged 12 and over, by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin: United States, selected years 2002‚Äì2016. 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health and National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. Native American tribes with a higher level of traditional social integration and less pressure to modernize appear to have fewer alcohol-related problems. Tribes in which social interactions and family structure are disrupted by modernization and acculturative stress (i.e. young people leaving the community to find work) have higher rates of alcohol use and abuse. Native Americans living in urban areas have higher rates of alcohol use than those living in rural areas or on reservations, and more Native Americans living on reservations (where cultural cohesion tends to be stronger) abstain altogether from alcohol.Philip A. May, \\"Overview of Alcohol Abuse Epidemiology for American Indian Populations,\\" in Changing Numbers, Changing Needs: American Indian Demography and Public Health, Gary D. Sandefur, Ronald R. Rindfuss, Barney Cohen, Editors. Committee on Population, Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education National Research Council. National Academy Press: Washington, D.C. 1996 Alaska Natives who follow a more traditional lifestyle have reported greater happiness and less frequent alcohol use for coping with stress.Borowsky, I. W., Resnick, M. D., Ireland, M., & Blum, R. W. \\"Suicide attempts among American Indian and Alaska Native youth: risk and protective factors.\\" Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, 1999;153(6), 573‚Äì580. HIV/AIDS HIV and AIDS are growing concerns for the Native American population. The overall percentage of Native Americans diagnosed with either HIV or AIDS within the entire United States population is relatively small. Native American AIDS cases make up approximately 0.5% of the nation's cases, while they account for about 1.5% of the total population. Native Americans and Alaska Natives rank third in the United States in the rate of new HIV infections. Native Americans, when counted with Alaskan Natives, have a 40% higher rate of AIDS than white individuals. Also, Native American and Alaskan Native women have double the rate of AIDS of white women. These statistics have multiple suggested causes: ; Sexual behaviors : Previous studies of high rates of sexually transmitted diseases among Native Americans lead to the conclusion that the sexual tendencies of Native Americans lead to greater transmission ; Illicit drug use : The use of illicit drugs is documented to be very high among Native Americans, and not only does the involvement of individuals with illicit drugs correlate with greater rates of sexually transmitted disease, but it can facilitate the spread of diseases ; Socio- economic status : Due to the poverty and lower rates of education, the risk of getting AIDS or any other sexually transmitted disease can be increased indirectly or directly ; Testing and data collection : Native Americans may have limited access to testing for HIV/AIDS due to location away from certain health facilities; data collected on Native American sexually transmitted diseases may be limited for this same reason as well as for under-reporting and the Native American race being misclassified ; Culture and tradition : Native American culture is not always welcoming of open discussion of sexually transmitted diseases Stroke Stroke is the sixth-leading cause of death in the Native American population. Native Americans are sixty percent more likely than white adults in the United States to have a stroke. Native American women have double the rate of stroke of white women. About 3.6% of Native American and Alaska Native men and women over 18 have a stroke. The stroke death rate of Native Americans and Alaska Natives is 14 percent greater than among all races. Combating disease and epidemics Many initiatives have been put in place to combat Native American disease and improve the overall health of this demographic. One primary example of such initiative by the government is the Indian Health Service which works \\"to assure that comprehensive, culturally acceptable personal and public health services are available and accessible to Native American and Alaska Native people\\". There are many other governmental divisions and funding for health care programs relating to Native American diseases, as well as a multitude of programs administered by tribes themselves.  Legislature  Healthcare for Native Americans were provided through the Department of War (throughout the 1800s) until it became a focus of the Office of Indian Affairs in the late 1800s. It again switched government agencies in the early 1950s, going under the supervision of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Public Health Service (PHS). In 1955, the Indian Health Service division was created, which still enacts the majority of Native American specific healthcare. The Snyder Act of 1921 (23 U.S.C. 13) was one of the first formal legislative pieces to allow healthcare to be provided to Native Americans. In the 1970s, more legislation began passing to expand the healthcare access for Native Americans. Diabetes programs Eagle books are a book series produced by the CDC to inform Native American children about healthy lifestyles to prevent diabetes. As diabetes is one of the utmost concerns of the Native American population, many programs have been initiated to combat this disease. =Governmental programs= One such initiative has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Termed the \\"Native Diabetes Wellness Program\\", this program began in 2004 with the vision of an \\"Indian Country free of the devastation of diabetes\\". To realize this vision, the program works with Native American communities, governmental health institutions, other divisions of the CDC, and additional outside partners. Together they develop health programs and community efforts to combat health inequalities and in turn prevent diabetes. The four main goals of the Native Diabetes Wellness Program are to promote general health in Native communities (physical activity, traditional foods), spread narratives of traditional health and survival in all aspects of life, utilize and evaluate health programs and education, and promote productive interaction with the state and federal governments. Funding for these efforts is provided by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Public Law 105-33, and the Indian Health Service. One successful aim of this program is the Eagle Books series, which are books using animals as characters to depict a healthy lifestyle that prevents diabetes, including embracing physical activity and healthy food. These books were written by Georgia Perez, who worked with the University of New Mexico's Native American Diabetes Project. Other successful efforts include Diabetes Talking Circles to address diabetes and share a healthy living message and education in schools. The Native Diabetes Wellness Program also has worked with tribes to establish food programs that support the \\"use of traditional foods and sustainable ecological approaches\\" to prevent diabetes. The Indian Health Service has also worked to control the diabetes prevalence among Native Americans. The IHS National Diabetes Program was created in 1979 to combat the escalating diabetes epidemic. The current head of the IHS, Mary L. Smith, Cherokee, took the position in March 2016 and had pledged to improve the IHS and focus on comprehensive health care for all the tribes and people covered by the department. A sector of the service is the Division of Diabetes Treatment and Prevention, which \\"is responsible for developing, documenting, and sustaining clinical and public health efforts to treat and prevent diabetes in Native Americans and Alaska Natives\\". This division contains the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, as created by 1997 Congressional legislation. This program receives $150 million a year in order to work on \\"Community-Directed Diabetes Programs, Demonstration Projects, and strengthening the diabetes data infrastructure\\". The Community-Directed Diabetes Programs are programs designed specifically for Native American community needs to intervene in order to prevent and treat diabetes. Demonstration Projects \\"use the latest scientific findings and demonstrate new approaches to address diabetes prevention and cardiovascular risk reduction\\". Strengthening the diabetes data infrastructure is an effort to attain a greater base of health information, specifically for the IHS electronic health record. In addition to the Special Diabetes Program for Native Americans, the IHS combats diabetes with Model Diabetes Programs and the Integrated Diabetes Education Recognition Program. There are 19 Model Diabetes Programs which work to \\"develop effective approaches to diabetes care, provide diabetes education, and translate and develop new approaches to diabetes control\\". The Integrated Diabetes Education Recognition Program is an IHS program that works towards high-quality diabetes education programs by utilizing a three-staged accreditation scale. Native American programs in healthcare facilities can receive accreditation and guidance to effectively educate the community concerning diabetes self-management. =Tribal programs= Many tribes themselves have begun programs to address the diabetes epidemic, which can be specifically designed to address the concerns of the specific tribe. The Te- Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone have created their diabetes program. With this program, they hope to promote healthy lifestyles with exercise and modified eating and behavior. The means of achieving these ends including \\"a Walking Club, 5 a Day Fruits and Vegetable, Nutrition teaching, Exercise focusing, 28 day to Diabetes Control, and Children's Cookbook\\". Additionally, the Te-Moak tribe has constructed facilities to promote healthy lifestyles, such as a center to house the diabetes program and a park with a playground to promote active living. The Meskwaki Tribe of the Mississippi has also formed diabetes program to provide for the tribe's people. The Meskwaki Tribe facilitates their program to eliminate diabetes as a health concern through prevention and control of complications. The program has a team mentality, as community, education and clinical services are all involved as well as community organizations and members. There are many facets of this diabetes program, which include the distribution of diabetes information. This is achieved through bi-weekly articles in the Meskwaki Times educating the population about diabetes prevention and happenings in the program and additional educational materials available about diabetes topics. Other educational is spread through nutrition and diabetes classes, such as the Diabetes Prevention Intensive Lifestyle Curriculum Classes, and events like health fairs and walks. Medical care is also available. This includes bi-weekly diabetes clinics, screenings for diabetes and related health concerns and basic supplied. HIV-AIDS programs Official seal of the National Native HIV/AIDS Awareness Day Multiple programs exist to address the HIV and AIDS concerns for Native Americans. Within the Indian Health Service, an HIV/AIDS Principal Consultant heads an HIV/AIDS program. This program involves many different areas to address \\"treatment, prevention, policy, advocacy, monitoring, evaluation, and research\\". They work through many social outputs to prevent the masses from the epidemic and enlist the help of many facilities to spread this message. The Indian Health Service also works with Minority AIDS Initiative to use funding to establish AIDS projects. This funding has been used to create testing, chronic care, and quality care initiatives as well as training and camps. The Minority AIDS Initiative operates through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, under the Public Health Service Act. This is in recognition of the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on racial and ethnic minorities. There has also been a National Native HIV/AIDS Awareness Day held on March 20 for Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians, with 2009 marking its third year. This day is held to: # encourage Native people to get educated and to learn more about HIV/AIDS and its impact in their community; # work together to encourage testing options and HIV counseling in Native communities; and # help decrease the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. This day takes place across the United States with many groups working in coordination, groups like the CDC and the National Native Capacity Building Assistance Network. By putting out press releases, displaying posters, and holding community events, these groups hope to raise awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Heart disease and stroke programs The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contain a Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention, which collects data and specifically releases information to form policy for Native Americans. They have identified many areas in which lifestyles of Native Americans need to be changed in order to greatly decrease the prevalence of heart disease and stroke. One major concern to prevent is diabetes, which directly relates to the presence of heart disease. Many general health concerns also need to be addressed, according to the CDC's observations, including moderating alcohol use, eliminating tobacco use, maintaining health body weight, regularizing physical activity, diet, and nutrition, preventing and controlling high blood cholesterol, and preventing and controlling high blood pressure. The Indian Health Service works in collaboration with the University of Arizona College of Medicine to maintain the Native American Cardiology Program. This is a program that acknowledges the changes in lifestyle and economics in the recent past which have ultimately increased the prevalence of heart attacks, coronary disease, and cardiac deaths. The Native American Cardiology Program prides itself in its cultural understanding, which allows it to tailor health care for its patients. The program has many bases but has placed an emphasis on providing care to remote, rural areas in order for more people to be cared for. The Native American Cardiology Program's telemedicine component allows for health care to be made more accessible to Native Americans. This includes interpreting medical tests, offering specialist input and providing triage over the phone. The Native American Cardiology Program also has educational programs, such as lectures on cardiovascular disease and its impact, and outreach programs.  Alcohol treatment and prevention programs  SAMHSA's Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy= The Office of Tribal Affairs and Policy (OTAP) serves as primary point of contact between the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and tribal governments, tribal organizations, and federal agencies on behavioral health issues that impact tribal communities. OTAP supports SAMHSA's efforts to implement the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) of 2010 and the National Tribal Behavioral Health Agenda. The Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (OIASA), an organizational component of OTAP, coordinates federal partners and provides tribes with technical assistance and resources to develop and enhance prevention and treatment programs for substance use disorders, including alcohol. = Indian Health Services = The Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is a program for American Indian and Alaska Native individuals to reduce the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and substance abuse. These programs are administered in tribal communities, including emergency, inpatient and outpatient treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals covered under Indian Health Services. It addresses and treats alcoholism from a disease model perspective. = Tribal Action Plan = The Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1986 was updated in 2010 to make requirements that the Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (OIASA), a subdivision of SAMHSA, is to work with federal agencies to assist Native American communities in developing a Tribal Action Plan (TAP). The TAP coordinates resources and funding required to help mitigate levels of alcohol and substance abuse among the Native American population, as specified in the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Memorandum of Agreement of August 2011, and executed by OIASA.

The vessel was largely employed on the East Coast to Europe routes during her career before she was laid up in and eventually broken up for scrap in 1936. Design and construction After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1015 cargo ship was a standard cargo freighter of approximately 9,400 tons deadweight designed by Moore Shipbuilding Co. and adopted by USSB. Ozette was part of the order for ten vessels placed by USSB with Seattle North Pacific Shipbuilding Co. on 5 November 1917 and was laid down on 19 June 1918 and launched on 28 September 1918 (yard number 1), with Mrs. C.J. Erickson, wife of the shipyards's founder, being the sponsor. Just as with many other vessels being built for the Shipping Board, her name was picked by Mrs. Woodrow Wilson who often chose Native American words or local landmarks for naming purposes. The ship had two main decks as well as forecastle and poop deck and was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel. The freighter had four main holds and also possessed all the modern machinery for quick loading and unloading of cargo from five large hatches, including ten winches and a large number of derricks. She was also equipped with wireless apparatus, had submarine signal system installed and had electrical lights installed along the decks. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Ozette was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 9,519. The vessel had a steel hull with double bottom throughout with exception of her machine compartment, and a single 2,800 shp steam turbine, double-reduction geared to a single screw propeller that moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three Foster Water Tubes fitted for both coal and oil fuel. The sea trials were held on 2/3 April 1919 and after their successful completion the ship was turned over to the Shipping Board and officially commissioned three weeks later. Operational history While still under construction, the freighter together with several other vessels was allocated to W.R. Grace & Co. Upon commissioning, Ozette proceeded to load a total of 7,900 tons of cargo consisting of flour and Red Cross supplies destined for either Atlantic coast or Europe. The freighter left Seattle on 10 May 1919 bound for Newport News. Shortly after leaving port, a small fire was discovered in one of the holds, and subsequently she also developed problems with her engines. As a result, the ship was forced to put into San Francisco on May 15 to assess and repair the damage. While there it was discovered that her furnace-burning equipment was defective and alterations were ordered by local officials. The fire also caused damage to cargo of flour in her No. 3 hold estimated to be approximately 45,000. On further investigation it was also discovered some of the flour in hold No. 2 was also damaged by smoke due to faulty bulkheads. After undergoing repairs, and restocking of her cargo Ozette finally was able to leave San Francisco at the end of June. She reached the Panama Canal on July 10 where she spent about a week undergoing further repairs. The vessel finally reached Newport News on July 28 concluding her maiden voyage. The vessel was subsequently allocated by the USSB to Daniel Ripley & Co. to serve on their Gulf Coast to Europe route. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Galveston in mid-August to load a large cargo of cotton bound for Bremen, but that allocation was cancelled shortly thereafter. Instead, Ozette was allocated to Strachan Shipping Co. to carry general cargo from East Coast to Europe. That trip, however, did not materialize and the vessel remained berthed in Newport News until early December. The ship finally sailed on December 8 with a cargo of fuel for New York, and from there she proceeded to Florida. After loading a cargo of 4,000 tons of phosphate hard rock at Fernandina Ozette continued on to Savannah in early January 1920 where she additionally embarked 12,353 bales of cotton. Ozette cleared from Savannah on 28 January 1920 and took course to Bremen. Soon after leaving port the vessel ran aground on a bank of Savannah River and became stranded, but was quickly pulled off by US Coast Guard cutter and was able to resume her voyage. In the early morning of January 30 while about east of Savannah, the freighter encountered a lone lifeboat containing chief officer and seventeen other men from steam tanker SS Mielero which broke in two and sank four days earlier. The rescued crew was taken on board the vessel, and was subsequently transferred to Mieleros sister ship SS Sucrosa who safely landed them ashore at Baltimore on February 3. Ozette meanwhile continued her trip and arrived in Germany in mid-February. After unloading her cargo, the ship sailed out and reached East coast in April of the same year. The vessel made another similar trip in July-September 1920, loading 5,551 tons of phosphates at Jacksonville at the end of July and sailing for Hamburg reaching it in late September. Ozette returned to Charleston on November 1 and remained there until the end of January 1921 when she was ordered to Norfolk. After approximately five months of inactivity, the freighter was finally chartered to carry coal and departed on 15 June 1921 from Newport News with cargo of 7,800 tons of coal bound for England. On June 20, while about south of Halifax, the vessel became disabled after developing problems with her boilers. She was picked up and taken in tow by another steamer, SS Asabeth, who safely brought her to Halifax on June 25. After undergoing quick repairs the vessel was able to sail out a few days later. However, on July 16 her turbines broke down and she was forced to radio for help as the problem could not be fixed at sea. Ozette eventually arrived in Portland on July 19 in tow of another American steamer, SS Henry Clay. Upon unloading her cargo and undergoing repairs, Ozette departed Southampton on August 22 and reached Norfolk on September 8 after an uneventful journey. The vessel was subsequently laid up and remained berthed at the Fort Eustis anchorage for the rest of her career. In early September 1932 the Shipping Board decided to scrap 124 World War I era vessels in its possession, including Ozette, to alleviate significant tonnage overabundance. As a result, all the vessels were removed from the U.S register of shipping. In October 1932 it was announced the whole lot of these vessels was sold to the Boston Iron and Metal Company of Baltimore for $1.51/ton of recoverable material which was believed at the time to be over 350,000 tons. The disposition was estimated take about three years to complete and Ozette was eventually scrapped in April 1936.

The two albums precedent to Petula: These Are My Songs and The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener had been primarily produced by Sonny Burke with Tony Hatch, the producer/songwriter who'd established Clark as a top recording star in 1964, contributing only one track to each album. With Petula Hatch again became Clark's exclusive producer overseeing all the album's tracks. Petula would prove to be the last Petula Clark album of original material produced by Hatch. The first advance single from Petula: the Les Reed/Barry Mason composition \\"Kiss Me Goodbye\\" had reached #15 US in April 1968, becoming the first hit single for Clark produced but not written by Hatch. Of the eleven additional tracks which would comprise Petula, seven were written by Hatch and Jackie Trent. Hatch also had Clark cover \\"Days\\", \\"The Good Life\\" and \\"This Girl's in Love with You\\" and recorded Clark singing \\"Why Can't I Cry\\" which had been written by arranger Johnny Harris and wife Kim Clark. The song was also recorded by Tom Jones. The Hatch/Trent composition \\"Don't Give Up\\" - described by Hatch as a homage to \\"Can't Take My Eyes off You\\" \\\\- was released as the album's second advance single in July 1968 and failed to sustain Clark's Top 20 comeback peaking at #37 on the 'Billboard Hot 100 becoming Clark's final US Top 40 hit.2 \\"Billboard\\" reported that \\"Don't Give Up\\" was one of the most requested tunes at Las Vegas' Desert Inn Sky Room as of late 1968 and early 1969.

Humait√° was surrounded by land on 2 November 1867, by water on 19 February 1868, and surrendered on 25 July 1868. Fortress Defences The Fortress of Humaita was built on the strategic bend of the Paraguay River that would force ships to steam head first into artillery fire. The Allied Command assumed that because of that and the chains installed, the fortress as impassible. Encirclement Plan of fortress of Humait√°, detail. The red arrow indicates the position of chain boom; the blue arrow, of the church (seen in next image). On 1 August 1867, the Argentine general Bartolom√© Mitre commanded the Brazilian imperial fleet to secure a passage through Curupaiti and Humait√°. On 15 August, two divisions of five battleships passed Curupaiti without incident but the artillery fire forced them to stop at Humait√°. This news caused conflict in the Allied high command. The Brazilian commanders were determined that attacking the fortress from the river would be futile and withdrew their fleet, pending a land-based attack that began on 18 August. From Tuyucu√™, the Allies headed north and took the villages of S√£o Solano, Tayi and finally laid siege to Humait√° itself, isolating it from Asunci√≥n by November 1867.Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, On 19 February 1868, Marshal Caxias and Vice Admiral Baron de Inhauma ordered the fleet up the River Paraguay past Humait√°. There were few casualties and minimal damage caused to any of the ships. On 24 February, the Bahia, Barroso and Rio Grande do Sul shelled Asunci√≥n, which had been evacuated earlier. Paraguayan President Francisco Solano L√≥pez decided to evacuate Curupayti and Humaita. He crossed the Paraguay River to the Chaco side on 3 March 1868. Solano L√≥pez left Colonel Francisco Martinez in charge of a force of 3,000 men and 200 cannons. General Argollo attacked Sauce on 21 March, resulting in the Paraguayans retreating to Paso Pacu. Curupayti was abandoned the next day. The Bahia, Rio Grande and Para bombarded Humait√° on 23 and 24 March 1868. At the end of April, Allied forces had troops on the Chaco side of the river. Battle of Acayuaz√∫ Recognition of Humait√° by General Os√≥rio on 16 July 1868. The Allied army advanced on 16 July 1868, when it appeared Curupayti and Humait√° were abandoned. General Os√≥rio and 6,000 troops led an attack on the northeast side of Humait√°, unaware of the 46 concealed Paraguayan guns and over 2,000 men under the command of Colonel Pedro Hermosa. At the command of \\"Muerte a los cambas\\", the Brazilians retreated. The Brazilian casualties consisted of 279 dead, 754 wounded and 100 captured, while the Paraguayan casualties were 89 killed and 104 wounded. General Rivas ordered an attack on the Paraguayan Cora redoubt on 18 July, (year). An allied force of Argentinian and Brazilian infantry men were ambushed by a force led by Colonel Caballero. The Argentinian losses amounted to 90 killed, 87 wounded and 35 captured, while the Brazilians had 67 killed, 221 wounded and 2 captured. The Paraguayans suffered 120 casualties. Evacuation of Humait√° Esmerata, chaplain of the Brazilian Squadron, exhorting the Paraguayans to surrender. Col. Martinez asked Solano L√≥pez for permission to start evacuating Humait√° on 19 July. Solano L√≥pez ordered Martinez to hold out five more days, but the first wave of Paraguayan withdrawal started on the 24th with 1,200 men. The remainder left on the 25th after spiking their guns. The Allied force entered Humait√° ten hours later. Aftermath Col. Martinez, along with 1,228 men, 96 officers, and women and children, were caught trying to cross Laguna Vera on 5 August 1868 where he finally surrendered. Lopez branded Martinez a traitor and sought vengeance by murdering his wife. The allies captured 146 iron guns and 36, but most were unserviceable. A few men, Col. Alen among them, managed to escape the encirclement and make it back to Paraguayan lines via the jungle. However Col. Alen wasn't received with much adulation and was instead arrested for desertion.Kohn, Roger (2008). Weep, Grey Bird,Weep, p. 239. Author House, Milton Keynes. .

He was the leader of the House of Castro during the civil wars that followed the death of Sancho III of Castile and the succession of the infant Alfonso VIII. He was nicknamed el Castellano (\\"the Castilian\\") in Le√≥n and el Leon√©s (\\"the Leonese\\") in Castile.Esther Pascua Echegaray, \\"South of the Pyrenees: Kings, Magnates and Political Bargaining in Twelfth-century Spain,\\" Journal of Medieval History, 27 (2001), 110. Fernando was the eldest son of Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Castro and his wife, Eilo √Ålvarez. He led the Castro family in their dispute with the House of Lara over the custody and regency of the young Alfonso VIII after Sancho III's death in August 1158. Early in 1160 the Laras managed to exile him to the court of Ferdinand II of Le√≥n.Simon Barton, The Aristocracy in Twelfth-century Le√≥n and Castile (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 154‚Äì55. He returned to Castile in March with an army and defeated the Laras at the Battle of Lobregal, where his erstwhile father-in-law, Osorio Mart√≠nez, was killed fighting alongside his enemies, and Nu√±o P√©rez de Lara was captured. Nonetheless, he was unable to reestablish himself in his homeland. Shortly after 1160, with a mixed force of Christians and Muslims, Fernando besieged the recently founded city of Ciudad Rodrigo. Ferdinand II, with the militias of Salamanca and Zamora, came to its relief.James F. Powers (1987), A Society Organized for War: The Iberian Municipal Militias in the Central Middle Ages, 1000‚Äì1284 (Berkeley: University of California Press), 44. Fernando was soon reconciled to the king of Le√≥n, who appointed him governor first of Cu√©llar, Due√±as, Salamanca, Toro, Valladolid, and Zamora, and later of Asturias and Benavente.Barton (1997), 154 n35. He served Ferdinand II as majordomo, the highest court official in power, on two occasions: between 15 August 1162 and 6 September 1164 and between 19 October 1165 and 15 May 1166. In 1162 Ferdinand II conquered Toledo from Castile and placed it in the hands of Fernando Rodr√≠guez as governor. Toledo remained a Leonese possession until 1166.Simon Barton, \\"Two Catalan Magnates in the Courts of the Kings of Le√≥n-Castile: The Careers of Ponce de Cabrera and Ponce de Minerva Re-examined,\\" Journal of Medieval History, 18 (1992), 259. In 1164 Fernando returned to Castile a second time with an army and killed Manrique P√©rez de Lara in the Battle of Huete (June/July). In 1168 he was appointed alcalde in the city of Le√≥n, and controlled the city's fortifications (tenente turris Legionis, \\"held the towers of Le√≥n\\") until 1182.Barton (1997), 171. In the early summer of 1169, the Portuguese freebooter Gerald the Fearless took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the garrison took refuge in the alcazaba, the siege of which continued.Charles Julian Bishko, \\"The Spanish and Portuguese Reconquest, 1095-1492,\\" A History of the Crusades, vol. 3: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, Harry W. Hazard, ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1975), 414. Seeing an opportunity to add to his domains the chief city of the region at the expense of both his Muslim and Christian enemies, Afonso I of Portugal came with an army to Badajoz to relieve Gerald. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand of Le√≥n, who claimed Badajoz as his own and came south with an army at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 500 cavalry to assist the garrison.Francisco Cill√°n Cill√°n, \\"La fortaleza medieval de la Sierra de Santa Cruz,\\" Coloquios Hist√≥ricos de Extremadura (2006). Fernando Rodr√≠guez, then majordomo, was one of the Leonese leaders on this expedition. The besieging Portuguese were themselves besieged by the Leonese and fighting broke out in the streets. While trying to flee, Afonso was caught on the hinge of a gate and flung from his horse, breaking his leg. He was captured by Ferdinand's men, while Fernando captured Gerald. After the m√™l√©e the Leonese had control of the town and the alcazaba, which they soon relinquished to their Muslim allies. Several of Gerald's conquests were ceded to purchase his freedom.Powers (1987), 42. Ferdinand retained C√°ceres, but Trujillo, Mont√°nchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and Monfrag√ºe he gave to Fernando Ruiz.Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib al-·π¢alƒÅ states that three years after its conquest, between 17 October 1167 and 4 October 1168, Gerald was forced to cede Trujillo to a certain Ferdinand, called a brother-in-law of \\"Fernando el Baboso\\" (Ferdinand the Stupid), that is, the king of Le√≥n. The gift to Fernando is also recorded in a Christian source, the Chronica latina regum castellae. The date given by Ibn ·π¢ƒÅ·∏•ib conflicts with the dates of 1169 (cf. Bishko [1975], 414‚Äì15) or 1170 (cf. Juli√°n Clemente Ramos, \\"La Extremadura musulmana (1142‚Äì1248): Organizaci√≥n defensiva y sociedad,\\" Anuario de estudios medievales, 24 [1994], 649‚Äì50) found in other sources. Cf. F√©lix Hern√°ndez Gim√©nez, \\"Los caminos de C√≥rdoba hacia Noroeste en √©poca musulmana, I,\\" Al-Andalus, 32:1 (1967), 93. Fernando thus established a semi-independent lordship between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, with his seat at Trujillo. In 1171 he was granted the infantaticum of Le√≥n. Between 1172 and 1175 Fernando held Mayorga and Melgar de Arriba from the Crown, both had been fiefs of Osorio Mart√≠nez. He was for the remainder of his career a frequent attendee at both the Leonese and Castilian courts. The Annales compostellani record Fernando's death in the year 1185, sometime after August 16. Marriages Don Fernando Ruiz de Castro (Opening stanzas from a poem in El Drama Universal by Ram√≥n de Campoamor, with translation.) :Mi esposa Estefan√≠a, que est√° en gloria, :fue del S√©ptimo Alfonso hija querida; :desde hoy sabr√©is, al escuchar su historia, :que hay desgracias sin fin en nuestra vida. :Yo la mat√© celoso; y si, remiso, :no me mat√© tambi√©n la noche aquella, :fue por matar despu√©s, si era preciso, :a todo el que, cual yo, dudase de ella. My wife Estefan√≠a, who is in glory, / was of Alfonso VII a dear daughter; / after today you will know, upon listening to this story, / that there are disgraces without end in our life. // Jealous, I killed her; and if, reluctant, / I did not kill myself also that night, / it was to kill later, if it was necessary, / all who, even I, doubted her. Fernando's first wife was Constance (Constanza) Osorio, daughter of count Osorio Mart√≠nez killed at Lobregal. The couple had probably separated before the Battle of Lobregal. In February 1165 Constance married Pedro Arias de Limia as his second wife. In 1168 Fernando married his cousin Estefan√≠a Alfonso la Desdichada (\\"Stephanie the Unfortunate\\", born 1148), an illegitimate daughter of Alfonso VII and his mistress Urraca Fern√°ndez. She bore him a son, Pedro. On 1 July 1180 Fernando murdered her out of jealousy. She was buried in the monastery of San Isidoro de Le√≥n. Fernando also had an illegitimate son, Mart√≠n, by a woman named Mar√≠a √ç√±iguez, who is named in a document of Mart√≠n's son Pedro dated 1241.Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal (1919), Documentos ling√º√≠sticos de Espa√±a, vol. 1: Reino de Castilla (Madrid: Centro de Estudios Hist√≥ricos), 379, doc. 280.

In 1907, at age 17, she received her first commission, to sculpt the statue of Jere Baxter, organizer of the Tennessee Central Railway. Following her work at the Art Institute, Kinney maintained a studio in Greenwich Village, during which time she met Austrian-born sculptor Leopold F. Scholz (1877‚Äì1946). They married in 1921, and completed several other works together, including the Victory statue in the War Memorial Building court at Legislative Plaza, Nashville (1929) and the bronze figure of Victory for the World War I Memorial in Pelham Bay Park, Bronx, New York City (1933).

The majority of Bhat Sikhs originate from Punjab and were amongst the first followers of Guru Nanak. Bhat tradition and Sikh text states their ancestors came from Punjab, where the Raja Shivnabh and his kingdom became the original 16th century followers of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. The Raja's grandson Prince Baba Changa earned the title ‚ÄòBhat Rai‚Äô ‚Äì the ‚ÄòRaja of Poets, and then settled himself and his followers all over India as missionaries to spread the word of Guru Nanak, where many northern Indians became Bhat Sikhs.Haqiqat Rah Muqam shivnabh raje ki page 624 [p.1248]khari The majority were from the northern Brahmin caste (Bhat clan),(Bhat (surname)) as the Prince Baba Changa shared the Brahmin heritage. The sangat also had many members from different areas of the Sikh caste spectrum, such as the Hindu Rajputs and Hindu Jats who joined due to Bhat sikh missionary efforts. The Bhats also contributed 123 compositions in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (pp.1389‚Äì1409), known as the \\"Bhata de Savaiyye\\". There hereditary occupations consisted of bards, poets, missionaries, astrologists, genealogists, salesmen. According to John Nesfield as quoted in William Crooke's The Tribes and Castes of the North Western India (1896), Bhatts frequently visited the courts of princes and the camps of warriors, recited their praises in public, and kept records of their genealogies.  Bardic tradition as a source of Sikh history  These bards constantly attended upon or visited their patron families reciting panegyrics to them and receiving customary rewards. They also collected information about births, deaths and marriages in the families and recorded it in their scrolls. These scrolls containing information going back to several past centuries formed the valued part of the bards\` hereditary possessions. A group of Bhatts was introduced to Guru Arjan, Nanak V, by Bhatt Bhikha who had himself become a Sikh in the time of Guru Amar Das. According to Bhai Gurdas, Varan, XI. 21, and Bhai Mani Singh, Sikhan di Bhagat Mala, he had once visited Guru Arjan with the sangat of Sultanpur Lodhi. Some of the Bhatts who came into the Sikh fold composed hymns in honour of the Gurus which were entered in the Guru Granth Sahib by Guru Arjan. These Bhatts and their successors too maintained their vahis in which they recorded information concerning the Gurus, their families and some of the eminent Sikhs. These old vahis are still preserved in the descendant families, now scattered mostly in Haryana state. Their script is bhattakshari, a kind of family code like lande or mahajani. During the late 1950s, a researcher, Giani Garja Singh, obtained Gurmukhi transcripts of some of the entries pertaining to the Guru period, from Guru Hargobind (15951644) to Guru Gobind singh ji. Some of these were published as footnotes to Shahid Bilas Bhai Mani Singh, edited by Giani Garja Singh and published by Punjabi Sahitya Akademi, Ludhiana, in 1961. The rest are still in manuscript form lying in the Department of Punjab Historical Studies, Punjabi University, Patiala. These extracts provide valuable information regarding dates, places and events of the period.  Caution in use as historical source  As contemporary evidence, Bhat Vahis have to be used with caution however, for they are not diaries of the eyewitnesses. It was customary for the Bhatts to visit their hereditary patrons usually twice a year at harvest time to sing their praises and receive rewards or customary donations as well as to collect information for record in their vahfs. These records are, therefore, based on information gathered generally after the occurrence of events and, possibly, sometimes received at second hand. This may not apply to entries regarding the Gurus which were recorded by Bhatts who generally remained in attendance. For instance, an entry about the conferment of guruship upon the Guru Granth Sahib in 1708 is by Bhatt Narbud Singh (son of Keso Singh and grandson of Bhatt Kirat whose hymns are included in the Holy Book) who had accompanied Guru Gobind Singh to Nanded. On the whole, these Bhatt Vahis are a mine of information of historical and sociological value.

He was two years old when he was blinded by the Halifax Explosion on December 6, 1917. At the time of his death in 2009, Davidson was the penultimate living survivor with permanent injuries from the Halifax Explosion, which killed more than 1,600 people. Davidson was born to parents Georgina (n√©e Williams) and John William Davidson. He was blinded by shattered glass in the explosion, which occurred due to the collision between the SS Mont-Blanc and the SS Imo. At the time of the accident, Davidson was in his family's living room with his mother and sister. He was playing with his toy train on the window sill. The family was alerted to the collision by smoke rising from the harbour. Davidson was facing the glass windows when the blast occurred. The force of the explosion shattered the glass, completely blinding him. Davidson and his family moved to Halifax Commons, a makeshift camp set up for survivors of the Explosion. He attended the Halifax School for the Blind,Mr. John \\"Eric\\" Davidson 1915-2009 (Obituary) where he studied music. However, Davidson preferred to pursue a career in auto mechanics, following his interests in cars. His brothers would read him auto repair manuals and he would practise on old cars in his family's backyard, using his sense of touch and memory. He later took an apprenticeship with a car dealership in Halifax and earned his auto mechanic‚Äôs licence. Davidson was interviewed numerous times about his experience as a key eyewitness and survivor. Documented media coverage of Davidson spans decades, including a television interview in a CBC News piece first broadcast on December 1, 1957. Davidson also provided first person accounts of the attack to several books and publications, including The Survivors: The Children of the Halifax Explosion and Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery. Davidson, who lived in the city's north end, was employed by the City of Halifax as a mechanic until his retirement in 1980. According to Janet Kitz, author of the book Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion and the Road to Recovery which chronicles the disaster, Davidson's death left just one living survivor still receiving a pension for long-term injuries sustained in the explosion. Later life and death Davidson resided in Berwick for the last few years of his life. He died on September 9, 2009, at Grand View Manor in Berwick, Nova Scotia, at the age of 94. He was survived by his wife, Mary, three children and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His funeral was held at the United Memorial Church in Halifax.

The Speno company was founded by Frank Speno in 1960 and is now headquartered in Switzerland. It operates maintenance trains in many countries. The Speno trains are bright yellow in color. Main activities The activities of Speno are: :* grinding and re-profiling of tracks and points :* measuring rail surface faults and profiles :* checking for internal rail flaws with ultrasound. Grinding For railgrinding, Speno has developed a range of specialized trains and machines to support these activities. There are standard grinders for open tracks (normal train tracks), tramways, subways, regional railways (mixed train, tram, metro) and specialized areas like bridges, switches, etc. Measuring and inspection The other main activity for which specially designed Speno trains are used is measuring and inspecting railway tracks. With these trains the tracks can be inspected in \\"real time\\" while the train runs over the tracks: with video, infra-red recorders, acceleration equipment and other high-tech measuring tools the quality of the rails and points is monitored and recorded. After running over a specific route, the system generates reports containing all (potential) problems with the tracks. The straightness of the tracks in all dimensions (lat, long and height) is measured, as is wear and tear. The requirement for grinding and possible other repairs is reported and used to plan future maintenance. The same equipment can also be used after grinding or maintenance or renewing of a route to check that the builders have laid the tracks according to requirements. The measuring and inspection trains check not only the tracks and points but also, in the case of electrified routes, the overhead or third-rail power source. History The company was formed in 1960, while the current name Speno International SA was adopted in 1965. Speno has always developed its own equipment. In 1980 it introduced the first \\"road rail\\" grinding machines for urban railways. In 1985 it introduced the first inspection train that could find any flaws in the tracks in real time by simply having the inspection train run along the tracks at normal speeds. This allowed for inspection of the tracks without having to shut down or slow the other traffic on that route. Operations Speno not only sells its equipment to local track-maintenance companies but also offers complete services whereby Speno supplies both the equipment and the staff to operate it. The local company has to take care of the general overseeing and the actual driving of the trains, as most railways require that the operator of a train is locally trained and certified, speaks the local language and has good knowledge of the route. The rest of the workforce is generally employed by Speno and not for the local contractor. Accident in the Netherlands Dutch grinding-train similar to the one that ran through a shop in Stavoren In the Netherlands, builder BAM won the tender from the Dutch track-owner ProRail to grind the rails of the Dutch rail network. BAM uses for this the services (people and machines) from Speno. On 26 July 2010 a Speno Railgrinder train failed to stop at the end of a track in the Dutch city of Stavoren and the train drove straight through a shop, pushing an (empty) fuel-tank lorry along its way.Train drives through shop and stops on a square, News-site NU.NL, 26 July 2010. The shop was completely destroyed as was a roundabout behind the shop. The train stopped some 40 metres past the end of the track and the buffer stop. Initial investigation showed that the end of the track in this location was not marked with a light but only with some unlit signs. Also the (Dutch) train driver was a temporary worker and it might be that he did not know the local situation of the tracks. Circumstances that might have contributed to the accident: * no (flashing) red lights on the buffer stop at the end of the line * no orange or red signals along the track, only some static signs that were unlit * the train driver might not have had the required local knowledge of the track layout * the ATB automated security system in the Speno train was not compatible with the system used on the route. The Dutch traffic safety board (IVW) banned BAM from using Speno trains until it could prove that it could operate them in a safe manner. As this ban resulted in the tracks not being ground anymore, the ban was lifted on 4 August 2010 as long as BAM took extra precautions to run the trains safely.Speno Rail-Grinders are allowed back on the network, NU.NL, 4 August 2010.

He owns an artist management and consultancy company called Ferocious Talent and is a co-founder of Cr8ing Vision, a non-profit company that offers young people a range of educational programmes, seminars, workshops and opportunities in both the music and sport industries. Past and present artists managed by Kwaten include Laura Mvula, The Night VI, Steve Brown, Shannon Saunders and Kerry Leatham. In 1989, Kwaten was part of a band, D-Influence, who were opening acts for Michael Jackson, and produced tracks for a number of prominent musicians including Shola Ama, Jay-Z and Mick Jagger. Aside from running Ferocious Talent, Kwaten is involved in A&R; in Believe Records and is part of the new wave jazz movement in Europe and London. In July 2018, Kwaten took over from Diane Wagg as Vice-Chair of MMF UK (Music Managers Forum). Biography=Early years Kwaten started his artistic career in the middle of the eighties at the Warminster Athenaeum as part of the school band Outcry. He spent the next few years learning his trade in many different bands. One of these bands called Rebekkah was formed with his old school friend Andrew Ross from Outcry in 1984. Rebekkah led Kwaten and Andrew to a production deal at Courtyard Studios in Oxford, where they settled for a year learning the ins and outs of the studio. D‚ÄìInfluence (1989‚Äì1999) Steve Marston was a session saxophone player. Rebekkah used Steve for a session and it was then that Kwaten's friendship with Steve Marston started. Kwaten had started working at the Borderline Club in London as a comp√®re employed by Neil Conti of Prefab Sprout and Raye Cosbert when he and Steve formed the band D-Influence with Ed Baden Powell, Sarah Anne Webb and Ned Bigham (who was to leave the band after the release of the first album). D‚ÄìInfluence had taken their demos to record labels without any luck and so they decided to release their own music independently. The first of these recordings was I'm the One which they sold straight to record stores themselves out of the back of a van. Kwaten gave one of these records to London DJ Tim Westwood and it was he who played D‚ÄìInfluence first on Capital Radio. A record deal with Acid Jazz Records followed. D‚ÄìInfluence then signed to Atlantic Records and began recording their album Good 4 We. Their early support had mostly been through new London pirate station Kiss FM. There was no national radio airplay for music from the Acid Jazz scene at the time. This meant that the only way D‚ÄìInfluence could reach a fan base was through live music. So D‚ÄìInfluence toured for some time getting their break being offered the support slot on the Michael Jackson Dangerous Tour. This change in fortune led to many American acts requesting them as a support act. Michael Jackson, En Vogue, Prince, Naughty By Nature, James Brown all had D‚ÄìInfluence as an opening act. The band also played for Bj√∂rk on her Debut album performance on Later ... With Jools Holland. Production (1992‚Äì2001) With no huge hit but a large live following D‚ÄìInfluence own productions started to gain notoriety amongst other musicians and labels. After the release of their self-produced album Good 4 We, they started productions and remixes for artists such as Mick Jagger from The Rolling Stones, Seal, Jay-Z, Tom Jones, Beverley Knight, Lighthouse Family, Changing Faces or Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates. Shola Ama (1995‚Äì2002) Shola Ama was the discovery that broke D‚ÄìInfluence as mainstream producers. Kwaten was refused a cab at Hammersmith Station so he turned and walked in to catch a train. There he heard Shola Ama humming as she walked. He auditioned her on the platform and gave her his business card. She soon became a regular at D‚ÄìInfluence Studios where her first album Much Love was recorded. Shola was signed to D‚ÄìInfluence Productions own label, Freakstreet and licensed to Warner Bros in 1995‚Äì1996. Her first album, Much Love (1997), went on to sell more than a million copies worldwide. Although not as popular in the UK, her second album In Return, also produced by D‚ÄìInfluence, went on to break airplay records in France. Urban music seminar (1997‚Äì2004) Kwaten was the founder of the biggest European Urban Music Seminar. The seminar was set up to pass on much of what he and many others had learnt about the music business as they saw it. It was, as Kwaten describes it, a \\"harsh no frills edutainment spectacle\\" whose numbers swelled from 500 people in 1998 to 15 000 over two days at the Royal Festival Hall in 2004. Many stars from the music world spoke and gave free advice at these events such as Kanye West, Jazzie B, Tim Westwood, Kanya King, Trevor Nelson, Damon Dash, Mathew Knowles, Norman Jay. Mentoring and lecturing (2002‚Äìpresent) Kwaten was a carer for The Adolescent and Children's Trust and also does charity workshops for YESS, a London charity that dispenses educational advice for inner-city children. He also uses his music industry experience to teach music students as a lecturer at various institutions around London including the University of Westminster. One of his earlier mentees, Spitfire Audio CEO, Will Evans, has credited Kwaten as an enormous help in the early stages of his career development. Artist management (2006‚Äìpresent) In 2006, Kwaten joined ATC Management as a manager where he looked after Laura Mvula, The Night VI, Steve Brown, Shannon Saunders and Kerry Leatham. In 2010, Kwaten established Cre8ing Vision together with Andrea Euell and Nicola Charles. Since its conception, Kwaten and his team has been running an annual music business seminar, The Ultimate Seminar, that calls on both rising and established musicians and influential industry professionals to talk about the local music business and their individual journeys and struggles. It enables students to network with like-minded people and has called upon acts such as Kanye West, Stormzy and Darcus Beese from Island Records among others. In 2014, Kwaten started his own management company called Ferocious Talent, where he works with new acts like Sarah Walk, Blue Lab Beats and Caitlyn Scarlett. He also acts as an international consultant and manages and advises international acts, brands, actors and actresses on the music business in Europe. Awards In 1995, Kwaten won the UK Black Music Best New Live Act with his band. He was also the 2006 winner of Ghanaian Entrepreneur of the Year, and in 2013, Kwame won Artiste Manager of the Year at the Live UK Music Business Awards.

Her older brother, Ren√© Tasso (1897‚Äì1920), was also a poet of distinction who, however, died at the young age of twenty-two from tuberculosis.Four of Ren√© Tasso's poems can be found in J. Moscatelli, Po√®tes en Egypte, 1955, pp. 80‚Äì83. Her father was a middle class functionary of Lebanese extraction. Celine was the eldest of four girls, and lived her entire life in Alexandria, Egypt, leaving only for brief trips to the United States (once), Lebanon (generally to visit her son's family), and France. Three weeks before her eighteenth birthday Celine married George Salm (Salem), a wealthy landowner twice her age. They had one child, Joseph. The marriage was unhappy, and her husband absconded with the three-year-old boy and deposited him in a boarding school in Virginia. A divorce ensued, and the child (who was told his mother had died) was raised in a series of boarding schools and orphanages in America. Fifteen years passed before Celine saw her only child again. Because Mr. Salm had become an American citizen, the Egyptian government sued to expropriate his extensive landholdings. The American government funded Salm's defense, with the signature of President Herbert Hoover. The case, known as the Salem Claim, went to international arbitration in Vienna, Austria in 1931. The American side lost and Salm was dispossessed of all his Egyptian property.B. Hunt et al., \\"Salem claim. Claim of the United States of America on behalf of George J. Salem v. the royal government of Egypt under Protocol of January 20, 1931,\\" 7 vols., Washington, U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1932-35. In the final decades of her life, Celine Axelos retired from society and became increasingly introspective, relying on her deep Christian faith. \\"The ugliness of the world,\\" she wrote in a letter, \\"has become odious to me...\\" She wrote of seeking \\"a spiritual ascension, the source of all true happiness.\\"\\"R. Lackany, \\"Celine Axelos.\\" Alexandria: Publications de l'Atelier d'Alexandrie, 1987, p. 107. For many years the poet lived quietly in a small ninth-floor apartment on a busy Alexandria street, as her faithful maid of forty years, Sophie, brought food daily and did the housecleaning.  Work  Celine Axelos credited the awakening of her interest in poetry to the time when, as a child, she listened to the poems of her elder brother, Ren√© Tasso. Her medium was French, the language spoken by the upper classes in pre-World War II Egypt. Two books of Axelos' poems, in alexandrine metre, were published during the poet's lifetime. Les Deux Chapelles (\\"The Two Chapels,\\" Alexandria, Editions Cosmopolis, 1943), contains sixty-one poems from the years 1938‚Äì43. Her 1952 collection, Les Marches d'Ivoire (\\"The Ivory Steps,\\" Monte Carlo, Regain), contains one hundred and one poems in five sections. About Axelos' poetry, Parisian literary critic Yves Gandon noted: \\"Your great gift is that the mystic essence of your nature never borders on the insipid. You are a mystic attached to earthly glories, something rare among women poets.\\".J. Moscatelli, Po√®tes en Egypte, 1955, p. 220. In 1975, Axelos was awarded the title Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Leopold Senghor, President of the Republic of Senegal wrote Mme. Axelos in 1966: \\"In your poems I appreciate the eternal feminine and the melody of its cadence. Reading your work, I am often reminded of Marceline Desbordes-Valmore, whose work greatly affected me during my years in the Latin Quarter [of Paris].\\"R. Lackany, \\"Celine Axelos,\\" Publications de l'Atelier d'Alexandrie, Alexandria, 1987. Axelos was well known as a conferenci√®re . Her lectures on subjects and personalities of general interest were popular social events. Held at the Atelier d'Alexandrie, these lectures often were subsequently published as booklets.Publications of L'Atelier d'Alexandrie include: Femmes du Second Empire (1969), Franz Liszt et ses Amis (1971), and Une Ancienne Vous Parle (1981). Publications of the \\"Institut d'Etudes Orientales\\" include Le Greco de Tolede (Analecta No. 22, 1973). For many years, Axelos contributed a weekly column to the Journal d'Egypte entitled Le Coin de Soleil (\\"The Corner of Sunlight\\"). Her column contained comments on current affairs, especially those dealing with arts and letters. Unpublished are Celine Axelos' fairy tales. A manuscript collection of eight such stories remains in the possession of her heirs. Ren√© Joseph, Celine Axelos' grandson and a composer of music, has set five of his grandmother's poems to music. The collection Chansons d'apr√®s Celine Axelos (for soprano and piano) is available from Laureate Music (2008).Laureate Music, 1313 Lincoln St. #503, Eugene OR, USA 97401.

It is located south of Sint-Truiden (Limburg), approximately east of Brussels. History Sint-Truiden Air Base was a pre-World War II Belgian Air Force military airfield. It was captured during the Battle of Belgium by the invading German Wehrmacht in May 1940. It turned to civilian status in the early 21st century. German use during World War II During the occupation of Belgium by Nazi Germany, the facility was called \\"St. Trond\\" and became a major Luftwaffe air base during the Battle of France. Within a few days of its capture by German forces, the Luftwaffe moved in Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 (SKG 77), a Junkers Ju 87B Stuka dive bomber unit; Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 (ZG 26), a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter (Zerst√∂rer - German for \\"Destroyer\\") unit, and two Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter units Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) and also JG 27.The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 All of these units took part in the Blitzkrieg against French forces and the British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France in late May and June. All also moved forward to French bases by the end of June. With the combat on the Continent ended, Brustem became a Luftwaffe bomber base, with Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) flying Dornier Do 17 light bombers from the airfield. arrived at the end of June 1940 and took part in the Battle of Britain during the summer, then later, switching to night bombing of English targets, remaining until March 1941. Increasing numbers of night bombing raids on Germany by the Royal Air Force in 1941 caused the Luftwaffe to start transitioning from a purely offensive force, to performing night air defense. Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (NJG 1) arrived at Brustem in May 1941, and until March 1944 flew first Messerschmitt Bf 110s, then after March 1942, Radar-equipped Dornier Do 217 night interceptors against the RAF bombers. In August 1944, Jagdgeschwader 2 (JG 2) began flying Focke-Wulf Fw 190A day interceptors, remaining until September when the Luftwaffe was forcefully removed from the base by advancing Allied ground forces. Sint- Truiden Air Base was a frequent target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers. The medium bombers would attack in coordinated raids, usually in the mid-to-late afternoon, with Eighth Air Force heavy bombers returning from attacking their targets in Germany. The attack was timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the Luftwaffe interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also, the P-47 Thunderbolts of Ninth Air Force would be dispatched to perform fighter sweeps over Brustem after the Marauder raids, then meet up with the heavy bombers and provide fighter escort back to England. As the P-51 Mustang groups of Eighth Air Force began accompanying the heavy bombers all the way to their German targets by mid-1944, it was routine for them to also attack Brustem on their return to England with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) =Allied use= The airfield was seized from the Germans by Allied ground forces on 15 September 1944. Once in American hands, combat engineers of the IX Engineer Command 834th Engineer Aviation Battalion repaired the damaged airfield and applied numerous patches to the two concrete runways and taxiways of the field. It was declared operationally ready for combat units on 18 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as Advanced Landing Ground A-92 or \\"Saint Trond Airfield\\".IX Engineer Command Advanced Landing Grounds Although operationally usable, Brustem was a wrecked base from the numerous Allied air attacks since late 1942 and what was blown up by the Germans as they withdrew.

(1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. Under Allied control, the American Ninth Air Force used the base for several units from 7 September 1944 until closing it in July 1945.

The airfield was returned to Belgian control in September 1945. =Postwar/current use= Sint-Truiden Air Base took many years to rebuild after the war, however in 1946, military operations resumed from the base. A new jet runway (06/24) was laid down and the support area was completely rebuilt, although the wartime runways were resurfaced and remained in use for non-jet aircraft. From 1971 on, several training squadrons were based at Sint- Truiden. Initially, 7th Squadron and 9th Squadron operated the CM170 Fouga Magister, while 11th Squadron operated the Lockheed T-33.

This relatively new field is informed by traditional disciplines like child development research, anthropology, psychology, and pediatrics.Meredith Small, Our Babies, Ourselves: How Biology and Culture Shape the Way We Parent, Anchor, 1999,  Origins  In October 1994, Carol M. Worthman conducted a workshop at Emory University introducing this new field. The workshop was attended by participants from psychology, pediatrics, public health, and anthropology. The impetus was the growing understanding that health care improvements can be made more effective when all the affecting cultural influences are taken into account.Carol M. Worthman, 1995, \\"Ethnopediatrics: An outline .\\" Items 49:6-10.  Cultural analysis  The ethnopediatric perspective analyzes the effects of a culture on a child's health and well- being by asking these questions: * What are the culture's attitudes and beliefs towards illness and wellness? * What are the culture's patterns of addressing (or not addressing) symptoms of illness? * What are the culture's experiences and familiarity (or lack thereof) with a particular disease or a set of symptoms? * What are its ideas of the developmental stages that children move through? * How much does the culture value children? And which aspects of development are most valued (intellect, motor skills, verbal skills, etc.)  Specific aim  The specific aim of ethnopediatrics is to improve the welfare of children around the world in a way that is informed by and in harmony with the local culture. By promoting a biocultural framework for understanding the well-being and development of the child, facilitating cross-disciplinary dialog, and analyzing the interests of the individual child in the context of the surrounding cultural, social, and political framework, the field has the potential to better inform public health policy and even directly influence prevailing childcare practices.

It was first formulated to capture concentrated vortices shed from the wings, and later became popular in a wide range of research areas. During the 1990s and 2000s, it became widely used in the field of engineering. The method VC has a basic familiarity to solitary wave approach which is extensively used in many condensed matter physics applications. The effect of VC is to capture the small scale features over as few as 2 grid cells as they convect through the flow. The basic idea is similar to that of compression discontinuity in Eulerian shock capturing methods. The internal structure is maintained thin and so the details of the internal structure may not be important. Example Consider 2D Euler equations, modified using the confinement term, F: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf u + abla\\\\frac{P}{\\\\rho}=F_D (\\\\mathbf u) -F_C (\\\\mathbf u) The discretized Euler equations with the extra term can be solved on fairly coarse grids, with simple low order accurate numerical methods, but still yield concentrated vortices which convect without spreading. VC has different forms, one of which is VC1. It involves an added dissipation, F_D ,to the partial differential equation, which when balanced with inward convection, F_C , produce stable solutions. Another form is termed as VC2 in which dissipation is balanced with nonlinear anti-diffusion to produce stable solitary wave-like solutions. : F_D : Dissipation : F_C : Inward convection for VC1 and nonlinear anti-diffusion for VC2 The main difference between VC1 and VC2 is that in the latter the centroid of the vortex follows the local velocity moment weighted by vorticity. This should provide greater accuracy than VC1 in cases where the convecting field is weak compared to the self-induced velocity of the vortex. One drawback is that VC2 is not as robust as VC1 because while VC1 involves convection like inward propagation of vorticity balanced by an outward second order diffusion, VC2 involves a second order inward propagation of vorticity balanced by 4th order outward dissipation. This approach has been further extended to solve wave equation and is called Wave confinement (WC). Immersed boundary To enforce no-slip boundary conditions on immersed surfaces, first, the surface is represented implicitly by a smooth ‚Äúlevel set‚Äù function, ‚Äúf‚Äù, defined at each grid point. This is the (signed) distance from each grid point to the nearest point on the surface of an object ‚Äì positive outside, negative inside. Then, at each time step during the solution, velocities in the interior are set to zero. In a computation using VC, this results in a thin vortical region along the surface, which is smooth in the tangential direction, with no ‚Äústaircase‚Äù effects. The important point is that no special logic is required in the ‚Äúcut‚Äù cells, unlike many conventional schemes: only the same VC equations are applied, as in the rest of the grid, but with a different form for F. Also, unlike many conventional immersed surface schemes, which are inviscid because of cell size constraints, there is effectively a no-slip boundary condition, which results in a boundary layer with well-defined total vorticity and which, because of VC, remains thin, even after separation. The method is especially effective for complex configurations with separation from sharp corners. Also, even with constant coefficients, it can approximately treat separation from smooth surfaces. General blunt bodies, which typically shed turbulent vorticity that induces a velocity around an upstream body. It is inconsistent to use body fitted grids as the vorticity convects through a non fitted grid. Applications VC is used in many applications including rotor wake computations, computation of wing tip vortices, drag computations for vehicles, flow around urban layouts, smoke/contaminant propagation and special effects. Also, it is used in wave computations for communication purposes.

Alternate cover illustration \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier\\" is an American anti-war song that was influential within the pacifist movement that existed in the United States before it entered World War I. It is one of the first anti-war songs.Pelger, Martin, \\"Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War\\", Osprey Publishing, New York, 2014, p. 265 Lyricist Alfred Bryan collaborated with composer Al Piantadosi in writing the song, which inspired a sequel, some imitations, but also a number of scornful parodies. It was recorded by The Peerless Quartet in December 1914 and was a hit in 1915, selling 650,000 copies. Its expression of popular pacifist sentiment \\"helped make the pacifist movement a hard, quantifiable political reality to be reckoned with.\\" Themes The song gives the lament of a lonely mother whose son has been lost in the war: She comments on the irony of war being between different mothers' sons, killing each other with muskets. Conflict between nations should be resolved by arbitration, not by the sword and the gun. Victory is not enough to console a mother for the loss of her son, and the blighting of her home. War would end if all mothers said they would not raise their sons as soldiers. The song thus apparently connects the suffragist and pacificist movements. The somber nature of the lyrics also reflected the neutrality mentality that was common in the United States in early 1915. Impact and response \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier\\" helped solidify the anti-war movement enough to make it politically relevant on the national stage. The song was in the top 20 charts from January to July 1915 and reached number 1 in March and April.Paas, John Roger. 2014. America sings of war: American sheet music from World War I. . P.18 The song's success and its resulting political strength brought supporters to the pacifist movement whose main priority was other issues. Unreconstructed Southerners appealed to popular distaste for the war in Europe in order to argue that the Civil War had been no more justified, and suffragists joined the peace movement because of its political potential and leverage in the campaign for women's right to vote. As with the later 1930s hit \\"God's Country\\", it shows that American popular music \\"generally reflects the isolationist tendencies of the public\\" and that pro-war songwriters were rarely successful. \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier\\" was praised especially by Anti-Britain groups in the United States: Irish, German, and Church ministers of many denominations. The song became known in a number of countries which were already at war - in Britain and in Australia notably. Other versions In 1968 the Eli Radish Band recorded an updated Outlaw Country Rock version of the song to protest the Vietnam War. Their Capitol Records album bore the same title. Hamish Imlach released a version of the song on his 1987 album Sonny's Dream. The lyrics were altered for context, including reference to the British Empire. Political reaction Back in its day, prominent politicians attacked the song both for its pacifism and early feminism. Theodore Roosevelt remarked that \\"foolish people who applaud a song entitled 'I Didn't Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier' are just the people who would also in their hearts applaud a song entitled 'I Didn't Raise my Girl To Be A Mother'\\". Puck, October 1915. The cartoon satirizes opponents of female suffrage Harry Truman, then a captain in the National Guard, hated the song. He suggested that the place for women who opposed the war was in a harem, not in the United States. Many parodies of the song were produced, such as \\"I Did Not Raise My Boy to Be a Coward,\\" and \\"I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier, But I'll Send My Girl to Be a Nurse.\\" Parody poems and other responses were also produced such as \\"They Didn't Raise Their Son to Be a Soldier\\", \\"I Didn't Raise My Dog to Be a Sausage\\", and \\"I Didn't Raise My Ford to Be a Jitney.\\" According to Groucho Marx, a popular joke of the period concerned a poker game in which a cardplaying mother states, \\"I didn't raise my boy, he had the joker\\".

In 1951 he was deported to the Irkutsk region by the Soviet authorities, where he died.Raun 2001, p. 186. Life Victor Paul Hugo Raudsepp was born the son of a distiller of Vaimastvere Manor. He first attended the local village and parish schools, then until 1900 the city school of Tartu. Subsequently, he worked as a clerk in a small retail businesses in Rakke Parish. After 1907, he worked as a literary critic, journalist and columnist in various newspapers. Between 1917 and 1920, he was politically active, acting as deputy mayor of Viljandi and working at the Secretariat of the Estonian Constituent Assembly. Thereafter, his political involvement waned. From 1920 to 1924 Raudsepp was a literary critic for the newspaper Vaba Maa. In 1924, he contracted tuberculosis which took a year of recovery. He became a freelance writer in Elva, and in Tartu from 1936. After the end of World War II Raudsepp lived in Tallinn. While writing he became one of the leading writers of comedies and dramas in Estonia.Shipley 2007, p. 271. In 1950 Raudsepp became a \\"nonperson\\"O'Connor 2006, p. 192. and was deported in 1951 after being arrested by the Soviet occupation regime. He was sentenced to ten years of exile in Siberia with hard labor. In September 1952 he died there during construction of the Baikal-Amur Mainline.Hasselblatt, pp. 213‚Äì221. Literary work Hugo Raudsepp debuted after the First World War, with his anthology of short stories Sidemed ja s√µlmed (Neck ties and knots) published in 1919. However he was especially known for his twenty plays in Estonia, which were among the most popular of his time.Hasselblatt 2006, pp. 496‚Äì498. He often wrote under his pseudonym Milli Mallikas. Raudsepp's stage work began with Demobiliseeritud perekonnaisa (Demobilized Father) in 1923. The plays are mostly comedies, cryptically addressing the political issues of the day with satire. His breakthrough on the stage came with the piece Mikum√§rdi in 1929, a social parody that relentlessly exposed the ambitions and hollow self-esteem through the character of farmer Mikum√§rdi, the romantically adventurous female summer guests and a salesman from the city. It also achieved success in Finland and in Latvia.Gassner, Quinn 2002, p. 252. The subsequent drama Vedelvorst (The Idler) (1932) became a blockbuster.

The bridge is of Queen post truss design by an unknown builder. Description The Power House Covered Bridge is located east of the village of Johnson, on School Street just west of Vermont Route 100C. It cross the Gihon River, a tributary of the Lamoille River in a roughly east‚Äìwest orientation. It is a single-span Queen post truss structure, long and , with a roadway width of (one lane). The bridge rests on stone abutments faced in concrete, and is covered by a gabled metal roof. The exterior is clad in vertical board siding, which extends around to the insides of the portals. On the sides, the siding does not extend all the way to the roof, leaving an open strip. The trusses include iron rods for stability, and have had metal plates added to some of the joints for increased strength. with History The bridge was built in 1870, several decades before the eponymous power plant was built upriver. It is one of three surviving 19th-century bridges in Johnson. In 1960, minor repairs were conducted to the abutments, approaches and floor. In 1995, it was recommended to reinforce the deck due to the large number of trucks using the road as a short cut. Steel I beams were installed underneath. In 2000, the bridge was destroyed by a heavy snow load. The roof collapsed and the side walls fell outward into the river below. Because of the installation of the steel I beams, the deck was self-supporting and actually survived. Guardrails were put up on the sides of the deck to keep the bridge open while its fate was decided. In 2002, the contracting company of Blow & Cote was hired to reconstruct the bridge, which was reopened on June 29, 2002.Barna, Ed. Covered Bridges of Vermont. The Countryman Press, 1996.

Sewage or organic waste from food or fiber processing may be catabolized in a system of constructed ponds where adequate space is available to provide an average waste retention time exceeding a month. A series of ponds prevents mixing of untreated waste with treated wastewater and allows better control of waste residence time for uniform treatment efficiency. Facultative lagoon in Kenya.  Fundamentals =First pond 1\\\\. The facultative lagoon in the pond sequence functions like the primary clarifier of a conventional sewage treatment system. Heavy solids will settle to the bottom of the lagoon, and lighter solids will float. This facultative lagoon lacks the sludge removal capability of a primary clarifier, so a population of anaerobic organisms will colonize accumulated sludge on the bottom of the lagoon. The surface area of the lagoon should be large enough to provide an atmospheric oxygen transfer rate adequate to prevent anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface. Intermediate depths of the lagoon support facultative micro-organisms capable of oxidizing both the dissolved and suspended organics from the original wastewater and the products of anaerobic catabolism on the bottom of the lagoon.Metcalf & Eddy (1972) pp.552-554 Areas with a consistently cool, but frost-free, climate may sustain facultative conditions in the first stabilization pond when treating lightly polluted water at low temperatures favorable to high concentrations of dissolved oxygen with low metabolic rates. Facultative pond stratification becomes unstable during cold weather increasing release of malodorous gas when water temperatures drop below 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit); and formation of ice on the pond surface will effectively prevent transfer of atmospheric oxygen to the pond biome. Stabilization ponds in climates with significant seasonal temperature variation may release malodorous gas during the season of rising temperatures as the pond biome consumes wastes accumulated during cold weather with increasing metabolic rates exceeding the atmospheric oxygen transfer rate at the pond surface. Subsequent polishing ponds Facultative lagoon (polishing pond) providing tertiary treatment after a constructed wetland in Hamburg-Allerm√∂he, Germany Overflow from the facultative lagoon may be routed through one or more polishing ponds supporting lower populations of anaerobic micro-organisms and a higher proportion of aerobic organisms adapted to survival in lower concentrations of organic material. Effluent from the final polishing pond may be suitable for discharge to natural receiving waters.Hammer (1975) pp.399-402 Oxygen transfer and algae Objectionable odors are likely when the rate of oxygen transfer from the lagoon surface is less than the rate of oxygen consumption in the lower levels of the lagoon. A facultative lagoon might provide 50 pounds of oxygen per day (5 grams of oxygen per square meter per day) for biochemical catabolism. Biological activity within a facultative lagoon varies directly with temperature. Warm weather will require large oxygen transfer rates, and waste accumulation during cold weather can cause short-term warm weather oxygen requirements to exceed long-term waste loading rates. Algae can provide surface oxygen during daylight hours, but algal respiration can require additional oxygen during darkness.Fair, Geyer & Okun (1968) p.34-11 Ice or scum mats can reduce the oxygen transfer surface. Some facultative lagoons use mechanical surface aerators to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer, but aerator mixing depth should not re-suspend anaerobic sludge from the bottom of the lagoon. Aerator operation may be limited to periods of heavy waste loads, high temperatures, darkness, low wind velocity, or other conditions threatening to cause anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface. Facultative stabilization ponds stratify with an aerobic surface layer and an anaerobic layer below the surface. The aerobic surface layer limits release of malodorous gas from the anaerobic benthic zone. Algae and cyanobacteria typically grow in the aerobic zone and provide bacteria in the pond with plenty of oxygen during the daytime. However, algal photorespiration may consume oxygen during night time when it is dark. Waste stabilization ponds with large algal populations may show significant diurnal fluctuation in oxygen concentrations with a peak in the late afternoon, and a minimum at dawn. Kinds of algae growing in treatment ponds include green, red and brown algae.the environment.Cincinnati, O. (2010, June 29). NEPIS document display. Minimum temperature Vertical stratification including an aerobic surface layer, an anaerobic bottom layer, and a facultative intermediate layer is essential to proper functioning of a facultative lagoon ecosystem. Stratification is maintained by a thermal gradient of cool, dense water at the bottom of the lagoon overlain by warmer, less dense water on the surface. This thermal gradient becomes unstable when water reaches its maximum density at 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit). Facultative lagoons are impractical in cold climates, because the lagoons become non-functional when cooler air temperatures depress water temperatures below this critical value.Reid (1961) p.115 Design considerations Inert solids in wastewater will accumulate on the bottom of the lagoon and gradually reduce depth until there is inadequate room for the facultative zone. Lagoon depths between 2 and 5 feet (60 to 150 cm) are preferred for effective treatment. Parallel facultative lagoons with common polishing ponds allow wastewater treatment to continue while one lagoon is out of service for sludge removal. Precipitation falling on the surface of the lagoons and polishing ponds will increase the volume of wastewater requiring disposal. Conversely, the volume of wastewater may be reduced by evaporation from the water surface in arid climates. Wastewater nutrients may cause continuing growth of algae in the polishing ponds after the original wastes have been catabolized. Algae may cause measurable contribution to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations where discharge regulations include limitations on those concentrations. The TSS contribution of algae tends to peak in the summer months, but the long-term BOD of decomposing algae may not be evident within the typical 5-day test.Weston (1971) p.7-1 United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations describe facultative lagoons as providing \\"treatment equivalent to secondary treatment\\" when 65 percent of influent BOD and TSS are removed and effluent BOD and TSS concentrations do not exceed a 7-day average of 65 mg/L and a 30-day average of 45 mg/L. Individual States may establish alternative effluent limitations.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. \\"Treatment equivalent to secondary treatment.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, . Accessed 2013-05-04. Similar processes The facultative lagoon may be replaced by an aerated lagoon as the first pond of the series. Aerated lagoons have mechanical aerators which minimize anaerobic zones by completely mixing the lagoon to achieve catabolism through a process called extended aeration.

Together with her sister, they own Poil√¢ne bakery, which runs the world renowned, independent, family-owned Poil√¢ne bakery that has been based at 8 rue de Cherche-Midi in Paris, France since 1932. The Poil√¢ne bakery is reputed to be one of the world's best bakeries specializing in sourdough breads baked in wood-fired ovens and is considered Paris's most famous bakery. It is most well known for their nearly 4lb ‚Äúmiche Poil√¢ne¬Æ‚Äù ‚Äì a rustic, country style bread introduced to the bakery by Apollonia Poil√¢ne's grandfather, bakery founder Pierre L√©on Poil√¢ne.  Background and early life  Apollonia's mother, Irena Poil√¢ne was an architect and after moving to Paris considered herself a ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù focusing on interior architectural design, sculpting, and jewelry. She was considered a taste-maker throughout Paris and collaborated with the likes of Karl Lagerfield and Bernardeau ceramics. In his later years, Lionel Poil√¢ne was considered the most-famous and celebrated baker worldwide. Alongside bread baking, he was a celebrity in his own right for and stood as a champion for artisanal craftmanship throughout France. He also cultivated a passion for aeronautics, eventually becoming a helicopter pilot and the President of the Groupement Fran√ßais de l‚ÄôH√©licopt√®re (or G.F.H., the French Helicopter Pilot's Association). From a young age, he found himself collaborating with Salvador Dal√≠, C√©sar and other prominent artists using bread as an inspiration and source material. Apollonia Poil√¢ne grew up in this environment, educated in her mother's workshops in craftmanship and by her father's in the family's tradition of ‚Äúthe true taste of bread‚Äù ‚Äì which focused not only on bread as food, but how bread touches all aspects of life. Lionel Poil√¢ne had built the bakery into an internationally recognized name, known for the breads produced and his public persona. He is credited with being one of the leaders reviving a focus on artisan breadmaking at a time when industrialized breadmaking dominated and bread consumption was on a decline. He was considered as contemporary of the ‚Äúnouvelle cuisine‚Äù movement and the breads appreciated and utilized by France's top chefs, such as Joel Robuchon, Paul Bocuse. Together, Irena and Lionel Poil√¢ne, conceived of a ‚ÄúManufacture‚Äù (named for the ‚Äúmain‚Äù or ‚Äúhand‚Äù in French and ‚Äúfactory‚Äù for production‚Äù)just outside of Paris, which houses 24 100-tonne wood fired ovens built to replicate the bakehouse at 8 Rue de Cherche-Midi. By doing so, the bakery could produce up to 5,000 loaves of bread a day, each one baked by a single baker using traditional methods. As such, the bakery had clients worldwide as early as the 1970s, notably in The United States of America and parts of Asia.  Involvement with family business  Asked as child what she would like to be when she grew up, she responded ‚ÄúWhy not be a baker in the morning and an architect the afternoon?‚Äù Poil√¢ne grew up playing and working in her mother's workshop and the family's bakery. As a child, Poil√¢ne's spending money came from working at the historic bakery. She formally began working in the family bakery at 16 years old, when Apollonia Poil√¢ne began her apprenticeship as a baker in the bakery's 9-month bakers apprenticeship program. Poil√¢ne's bread baking is known for its physical nature, which relies on the baker to utilize all of their senses and body as the tools. For their sourdough, only mechanical materials are used in the baking process eschewing the use of thermometers or refrigeration ‚Äì save for use of an electric mixer designed to mimic the human arm movement. At age 18, on October 31, 2002, Apollonia Poil√¢ne's parents were killed in a helicopter crash. The next morning, the precocious Poil√¢ne entered the bakery and sat behind her father's former business desk, assuming the head of the family business at the age of 18. At the time, Poil√¢ne was already a 13 million euro/year business with three bakeries in Paris, one location in London, and an e-commerce website that had existed since 1997. It accounted between 1-2.5% of bread found in Paris and its surrounding areas restaurants as well as being a supplier to the Elys√©e Presidential Palace. In 2019, she published Poil√¢ne: The Secrets of the World-Famous Bread Bakery (), which includes recipes for several of the bakery's breads and pastries.  Education  A year after becoming the head of the family business, Apollonia started, and completed in 2007, a degree in economics at Harvard University. She used the time difference between Cambridge, Massachusetts and Paris, France in order to run the business while being a student at Harvard College.

While still in college, he won a seat as a write-in candidate for the Charleston County Constituent District No. 20 School Board using only campaigning on the Internet through Facebook; he did not spend any funds. He won with 22 votes. He represented the 20th District, downtown Charleston, for a four-year term, which ended in 2012. Shalosky is the first openly gay elected official in South Carolina history.http://polisci.cofc.edu/PDF/Political%20Science%20Annual%20report.pdf Page 19 When elected, Shalosky was the youngest openly gay elected official in the United States. He is an attorney in Charleston, SC. In October 2013 Shalosky was selected as a Diversity Fellow at the Charleston School of Law.  Personal life and education  Nick Shalosky grew up in Conway, South Carolina. He \\"came out\\" about his sexuality during his sophomore year of high school. His parents still live there. His mother is Vanessa Viles Shalosky. She spoke of her experiences raising a gay child at Charleston School of Law's \\"My Gay Child\\" forum. Nick Shalosky has been a public figure about his sexuality; he spoke at Myrtle Beach and South Carolina Pride gatherings; in 2009 he attended the National Equality March in Washington, D.C. He attended the College of Charleston where he was a political science major. In his undergraduate years, he was a member of the South Carolina Student Legislature, and the Charleston 40. He graduated in 2010 with a degree in Political Science and Geography. He went to Charleston School of Law, where he also served as a research assistant, and was a member of the Moot Court Board. He was a MUSC Presidential Scholar and served as the President of the Alliance for Equality. In March 2013 during his last semester of the Charleston School of Law, Shalosky traveled to Washington, DC to hear oral argument related to same-sex marriage cases at the US Supreme Court. California's Proposition 8 was assessed in terms of the constitutionality of marriage equality (or inequality) at the state level, while the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) case challenged federal law. He graduated in 2013 with a juris doctorate. Shalosky incorporated his experiences into a 2014 class offering at the Charleston School of Law, \\"Gender Issues and the Law,\\" which he developed as a Diversity Fellow. Marriage and family He and his partner Naylor Brownell, a medical resident, became engaged New Year's Eve in 2012 but could not legally marry in the state of South Carolina until November 2014.  Political career  Shalosky was involved in politics in the late 2000s and became the secretary of the SC Stonewall Democrats chapter; he was also one of the founding board members of the group. He learned about the Stonewall Democrats through Tom Chorlton, a professor and former executive director of the National Gay & Lesbian Democratic Club, a forerunner organization of the Stonewall Democrats. Shalosky participated in the 2008 presidential campaigns volunteering for Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and the successful candidate Barack Obama. At local events he questioned Republican candidates on their positions on gay rights. He also ran his own campaign as a write-in candidate for the Charleston County School Board. This resulted from his findings during an independent research project at the College of Charleston on the impacts of new technology and the Internet on local elections. Learning of a school board seat that had not attracted candidates 2 weeks before the election, Shalosky he established a moderate online presence using the social networking site Facebook to promote his candidacy. \\"I thought it would be interesting to see how students could use social networking sites to get one of their own elected.\\" He did not spend any money to campaign. At the time, Obama's campaign was being praised for its use of social media to engage younger voters. According to The Digitel, Shalosky said he was conducting a \\"social experiment\\" to see how use of Facebook could affect a local campaign. He wrote on Facebook: : \\"I am doing sort of an experiment to see how Facebook can really effect {sic} a local campaign. Write in my name Nicholas Shalosky and see if we can get any attention. If you think I'm being too egotistical I wouldn't mind deciding on a name to vote for, but I think it would be interesting to see what happens on election day!\\" Preliminary election results showed different winners, who were sworn in and attended meetings, than were ultimately certified by the election board following the count of votes for write-in candidates. Shalosky won a seat on the 7-member school board based on the 22 votes cast for him. He had no opponent for the seat. He represented downtown Charleston's 20th District for a four-year term, starting in November 2008. He said, \\"Such rapid mobilization might not have been possible only two years ago. But with a Facebook page and a knowledge of online organizing, I secured my winning margin without spending a penny.\\" Alt URL He was the only school board member elected who was under 40 years old. His professor Bill Moore said Shalosky would start an \\"independent study of Internet use in politics as part of his curriculum.\\" Post and Courier columnist Ken burger noted that while more traditional advertising of radio and television had also changed the way politicians get votes, those mediums were \\"top-to-bottom communication,\\" but the Internet allowed \\"grass-roots groups to dictate outcomes.\\" Burger believed that Shalosky's campaign was the beginning of what will likely be major change to local politics due to use of the Internet. During his term, in 2010 Shalosky was elected by the board members as vice-chairman of the District 20 Constituent Board. He later was elected by them as the board's chairperson, a rotating position. Honors * In March 2009 the local Charleston City Paper critics' awards honored Shalosky in their \\"Best of Charleston\\" issue with \\"Best Display of Gumption by a 20-something.\\" * In June 2009 Shalosky and six other openly LGBT politicos were named in The Advocate's annual 'Forty people under 40 years old to watch' list along with \\"out U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, D-Colo.; Obama administration staffer Jamie Citron; New York City mayoral aide James Anderson; fundraiser Aisha C. Mills; and DNC member Jason Rae.\\" * Shalosky was selected as a Diversity Fellow starting January 2014 at the Charleston School of Law.

Background The Nadar historian Samuel Sargunar claimed that the Nadars are the descendants of the ancient rulers of Pandyan kingdom and that when Nayak rulers captured the Pandya country, they divided the country into several Palayams (divisions) and appointed Palaiyakkars as rulers. The Nayak rulers of Tamil Nadu, as per the claims of Sargunar, imposed Deshaprashtam (ostracism) on the ancient Pandyas (Nadars), to ensure that their rise wouldn't ever happen.History of Tamil Nadu, 1565-1982 Page 277 By K. Rajayyan These claims are,however, not baseless. The traditions followed by the Nelamaikkarars and the existence of the ruins beneath the Teri palmrya forests of Tiruchendur and ancient Pandyan capital city of Korkai, where the Nadar population is predominant, suggest they could very well be the heirs of the Early Pandyas. Caste in Indian politics By Rajani Kothari Page103-104 However, there is little evidence to suggest that the Nadars were the descendants of later Pandya rulers. This belief, that the Nadars had been the kings of Tamil Nadu, became the dogma of the Nadar community in the 19th century. The Nadars were a community mostly engaged in the palmyra industry, including the production of toddy and were therefore considered lower than other middle castes, but relatively much higher than the low castes in the 19th century. A small endogamanous group of aristocratic Nadars, known as Nelamaikkarars, were wealthy landlords.Bishop Stephen Neill: from Edinburgh to South India By Dyron B. Daughrity Due to their association with toddy, the Nadars were not allowed enter temples built by castes above them. Some Nadar traders migrated to northern Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar to settle down in these regions. In course of time, these Nadars (Northern Nadars) became commercially skilled and therefore became upwardly mobile in the late 19th century. Mercantilism played crucial roles in facilitating their upward mobility. As the wealth of the Northern Nadars increased, they gradually began to adopt the customs of the North Indian Kshtriyas in order to improve their social status as well. This process is known as Sanskritisation. They also tried to disassociate themselves from their Nadar climber counterparts and many began to adopt the title ‚ÄòNadan‚Äô, a title which was before only used by the aristocratic Nelamaikkarars. To punctuate their wealthy and powerful position in the society, the Nadars of Sivakasi hired Maravars as their palanquin bearers. The upward mobility and Kshatriya pretensions of the Nadars of Six towns of Ramanad caused resentment among, castes above them, the Vellalars and especially the Maravars,the military caste just above the Nadars. Society in India: Change and continuity By David Goodman Mandelbaum,Pg-511 State and Society in India By A.R. Part of this change in the Nadar community resulted in some of them converting to Christianity, both Catholicism and Protestantism. However, a majority of almost 90% remained Hindus. Riots At the end of 1895, the Nadars of Sivakasi submitted a petition to the President of the Devasthanam so that a Nadar can get a footing in the management of a local Siva temple. The petition was declined by the committee. In the following years, a series of confrontations brought the Nadars against almost all the communities of Sivakasi. On 26 April 1899, a riot broke out in Sivakasi and the Maravar portion of the town was left almost completely destroyed. This event served as a precursor to the infamous Sivakasi riots. On 6th, June 1899, a group of 5,000 Maravars gathered into a mob from all parts of the surrounding villages and towns. During the night before the attack, the Nadars felled trees onto the roads which led to the town and constructed barricades leaving a few places open to draw the attackers together. The Maravars were opposed by about 1500 Nadars. The attack lasted for nearly two hours. The Maravars were sent into retreat, carrying their dead in the dozen carts brought to haul away the loot. Eight hundred and eighty-six Nadar houses were burnt. A total of 21 people were known dead. The Maravar retaliated by attacking the Nadars scattered around Sivakasi leaving 3 Nadars dead. Eventually, the riots came to an end after the intervention of the military in mid-July 1899. ReferencesFurther reading * Temple entry movement and the Sivakasi riots, B.

Her ethnographic themes drew upon her experience as a Greek-American in a small western community. Biography Helen Zeese was born in the mining community of Cameron (near Castle Gate) in Carbon County, Utah, to Greek immigrant parents George and Emily Zeese (originally Yiorgis and Emilia Zisimopoulos). The family moved to nearby Helper and, in 1933, to Salt Lake City, Utah where they established a chain of grocery stores. In her youth, Zeese attended Helper Central School and Carbon High School while living in Carbon County, and East High School in Salt Lake City. While attending the University of Utah, Zeese served as editor of the campus literary magazine Pen and associated with several other students who would become prominent in the field of western history. These included historian and archivist Dale Morgan. She graduated with a B.A. from the University in 1939. She married Nick E. Papanikolas and the couple had two children, Zeese and Thalia. In 1984, the University of Utah awarded Papanikolas an honorary doctorate. She and her husband established scholarship programs for minority students at the University of Utah and the College of Eastern Utah. Papanikolas died in November 2004. Career and cultural contributions In 1950, Papanikolas was asked to write about Greek communities for the Utah Historical Quarterly. The subsequent 1954 article The Greeks of Carbon County broadened the scope of published Utah history, which had previously focused on settlement and progress of the administration and membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). The article contributed to a fuller understanding of Utah‚Äôs cultural and ethnic heritage and served as a lasting example for local ethnic historians. For fifty years, her works on ethnic history were published in the Utah Historical Quarterly and Western Humanities Review. She wrote seven books, both fiction and non-fiction. Publications also include historical monographs and anthologies such as Toil and Rage in a New Land: The Greek Immigrants of Utah (1970) and The Peoples of Utah (1976). Papanikolas' skill as a novelist and storyteller was demonstrated in The Time of the Little Black Bird, which won the Utah Fiction Prize for 2000. During her research, Papanikolas collected numerous primary documents and conducted extensive interviews with immigrants and historians. She was instrumental in organizing and contributing to an ethnic archive at the Oral History Archives, Marriott Library, University of Utah. Selected papers are also held in The Helen Z. Papanikolas Oral Histories Collection, 1969‚Äì1974, Utah State Historical Society, in Salt Lake City and in the Immigration History Research Center, College of Liberal Arts, at the University of Minnesota. Her years of fieldwork and extensive archival work on Greek America led to Papanikolas‚Äô reputation as a leading authority on Greek immigrant life in the United States. She presented papers at national and international conferences and served as a consultant for television documentaries and other projects. In 1977, Papanikolas was a founder and first president of The Peoples of Utah Institute. As president, she located and identified artifacts associated with ethnic life, produced a major museum exhibit, and sponsored lectures and other programs. Her efforts at the institute led to the establishment of the Hellenic Cultural Museum in Salt Lake City. She also served on the Children's Service Society Board (1962‚Äì69); Advisory Board of Editors, Utah Historical Quarterly (1969‚Äì73); Board of State History (1973‚Äì85); and Utah Endowment for the Humanities State Committee (1973‚Äì79). Awards Awards for her contribution to cultural history include: : * Archbishop of the Americas Iakovos Saint Paul Medal (1972); * Fellow of the Utah State Historical Society (1975); * Japanese-American Citizens League Award (1976); * Brotherhood Award, National Conference of Christians and Jews, Utah Chapter (1978); * Distinguished Alumna Award, University of Utah (1983); and * Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters, University of Utah (1984).

She has released two albums, Sex & Poverty (May 2004) and Neska (2008). She was based in the United States from 2005 to 2010.  Biography  Morgan is a MƒÅori singer-songwriter and was born in Wellington, New Zealand. Her family moved to Sydney when she was 3-years- old. She was brought up in a musical family, her father was a singer in a funk band. She has three siblings and the family relocated to Newcastle, where she attended school. From the age of 15 she worked with her parents in a trio, Arkestra. At 24, in 2002, Morgan started writing her own music. She was signed to Gotham/BMG and her debut album, Sex & Poverty, appeared in May 2004. The album was recorded at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, it was produced by Don Was, which peaked at No. 98 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 10 on their Hitseekers Albums Chart. Its lead single, \\"Simple Kinda Woman\\", appeared in October, which peaked at No. 11 on the ARIA Hitseekers Singles Chart. Morgan supported Alicia Keys at a concert at the Enmore Theatre, in October. In March 2005 she appeared on SBS TV's music variety quiz show, RocKwiz episode 8, and besides being a celebrity contest she performed her song, \\"Simple Kinda Woman\\", and a duet with Ross Wilson on a cover version of \\"Take Me to the River\\". The latter was released on CD for a Various Artists' compilation album, RocKwiz Duets, in August 2006, and an associated DVD, RocKwiz Duets: Two for the Show. Morgan relocated to the United States where she established an independent label, ProBono Records, in Atlanta in 2005. She re-imaged herself as Neska and released a self-titled second album in November 2008. Marcie Konsoulas of Planet Urban reviewed the album, \\"What happened to the simple kind of woman who wants a simple kind of man? Her raw proud Aussie demeanor has been overcast by a bad-girl sex kitten image that not only doesn‚Äôt do her justice but is also far from believable.

Artificial surfing reefs can exist in many different configurations and be built from a variety of different materials. To date there have been fewer than ten attempts to build such a structure worldwide. Artificial surfing reefs are a variation of a long existing type of coastal structure known as a submerged breakwater. Submerged breakwaters have historically been used for coastal protection. If an offshore structure is specifically designed for both the improvement of a recreational resource (i.e. wave riding) and coastal protection or stabilization, it can be classified as a multi-purpose reef.  History  Artificial reefs have been developed for several centuries in Japan where fishermen noticed that around sunken fishing vessels their catch increased. As the vessels disintegrated, the fishermen started to deliberately place man-made (artificial) structures on the seabed to attract fish to catch. Since this time, a number of artificial reef projects have been developed and, since perhaps the 1970s the 'science' of artificial reefs has been more seriously investigated; although many still consider placing anything in the sea (or lakes for that matter) constitutes an effective artificial reef. Artificial reefs have historically been developed for one primary function, for example habitat creation, habitat defence, recreation (e.g. surfing, diving and sports fishing), coastal defence, and research and education. In regard to surfing reefs, in 1997, surfers from Burkitts Reef, in Bargara, Queensland participated in an effort to improve the quality of a surfing wave on a natural reef. While not a structure in and of itself, the effort consisted of shifting boulders which caused the wave to break irregularly and at time dangerously over shallow rock. Work was completed using heavy equipment to move the offending rocks during the low tide when the rocks were exposed. The first structure built specifically for the improvement of surfing was the Cable Station Reef constructed in 1999 in Perth, Western Australia. This structure was built from granite boulders placed on top of an existing limestone reef. The total volume of material placed was in the order of 3,500 m3. Monitoring of the reef indicates that it is used for surfing when wave conditions are large enough. The site is hampered by the presence of offshore islands and reefs which block a significant fraction of the wave energy before reaching the site. However, when the swell is large enough or strong enough the reef produces good quality surfing waves. Construction began on the Narrowneck or Gold Coast Reef in August 1999. This structure was much larger (70,000 m3) in size and scope than the Cable Station Reef. The reef was designed primarily as a shoreline stabilization structure with a secondary purpose as a surfing structure; as such it was the first true 'multipurpose reef' structure. The reef was built as part of the Gold Coast City Council's 'Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy' which included a large volume of beach nourishment to be placed on the beach in addition to the construction of the reef. The Gold Coast Reef was built from large, sand-filled geotextile containers ('sandbags') which were dropped into position from a split hull barge. In terms of its stated purpose as a coastal stabilization and sand retention structure, monitoring by the University of New South Wales Water Research Laboratory suggests that the reef has achieved its goal to produce a salient (wider beach) in the shadow of the structure. Further analysis of the shoreline changeTurner, I.L. (2006) Discriminating Modes of Shoreline Response to Offshore-Detached Structures, Journal of Waterway Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering quantified the beach response in relation to the reef as being approximately 20 m wider than areas unaffected by the presence of the reef. In September 2000, construction began on another artificial reef, this time along Dockweiler Beach in Los Angeles, California. The purpose of this structure was to mitigate for the loss of surfing amenities and resources resulting from the construction of rock groyne and an associated beach fill project which was completed along Dockweiler Beach in 1984. The project was named Pratte's Reef, in honor of Tom Pratte. Like Narrowneck, Pratte's Reef was constructed from sand-filled geotextile containers. However, the containers used on Pratte's Reef were much smaller than those used on the Narrowneck Reef (~8 m3 per container at Pratte's versus 140‚Äì320 m3 per container at Narrowneck). Additionally, the total volume of the Pratte's Reef design was only 1400 m3, approximately 50 times smaller than Narrowneck. Extensive monitoring of the Pratte's Reef projectBorrero J.C. showed that the reef had very little effect on the surfing conditions at Dockweiler Beach and that it had no measurable effect on the shoreline morphology. They attribute this to the very small structure volume and the instability of the reef construction units. Within two years from the initial construction, the reef had largely disintegrated. This was due to the rupture of the individual bags and due to wave scour and self-burial. The remains of the reef were removed in October 2009.Fontaine, E (2009) \\"SandbaggedAfter years of unspectacular closeouts, Pratte's Reef is removed from El Segundo\\", Surfline.com The next attempt to build an artificial surfing reef came in February 2005 when construction began on the Mount Reef in Mount Maunganui on the Bay of Plenty coast in New Zealand. The reef design called for a total volume of approximately 5,000 m3 to be contained in an arrangement of large sand-filled geotextile containers. The containers and material used on Mount Reef were similar to those used at Narrowneck, however with bigger diameters and longer lengths. The reef suffered through a series of snags in the construction process attributable to weather delays and equipment failure. Construction continued throughout 2005 and into 2006. Modifications to the reef were made as recently as late 2008. Like Cable Station, the Mount Reef was designed purely to improve surfing wave quality. While there have been numerous documented instances of surfers using the reef and of high quality surfing waves breaking on the reef, many users complain that it does not work often enough as a surf break. Although it was not designed as a shore stabilization structure, an analysis of beach width and offshore survey data suggest that the beach in the shadow of the reef is up to 20 m wider than sections of the beach away from the reef (Weppe et al., 2009).  Boscombe Surf Reef  The most recently constructed artificial surfing reef is the Boscombe Surf Reef located in Boscombe, Bournemouth on the south coast of England. This was the first Surfing Reef to be constructed in the northern hemisphere. The town of Boscombe opted to build a surfing reef to provide a unique focal point for the town's multimillion-pound waterfront redevelopment effort (Bournemouth Borough Council, 2008). According to the local council, \\"The reef will give Boscombe beach its own identity, raise the profile of Boscombe and attract a large number of visitors on an annual basis.\\" The reef which was originally suggested in the late 1990s suffered considerable delays before construction finally began in June 2008 by the New Zealand Company ASR Ltd and half was completed during the summer of that year. Construction was suspended for the winter season and resumed the following summer. The reef was officially declared open on 2 November 2009. Like most of the other reefs built to date, the Boscombe Reef was built from large sand- filled geotextile containers. With a total volume of 13,000 m3, the reef was designed purely as a surfing break. Since the reef was built, there have been a few documented instances of surfers riding waves breaking on the reef. As the season changes into the more energetic winter, it is expected that the reef will break more often. This has subsequently been removed due to damage, safety fears and performance issues.

Development  The HWK-11 came about at the request from the Mexican defense secretary for a new tracked armored troop carrying vehicle for the Mexican army. The HWK was mainly German designed although Mexico had some input in the design process in the form that Mexico set certain requirements and specifications for the vehicle and Mexico also designed the basic configuration of the hull.  Production  In 1964 the first 12 vehicles were manufactured in West Germany and delivered to the Mexican Army while facilities were set up in Mexico to manufacture the vehicle locally. Initially 350 HWK-11s were to be manufactured for the Mexican military but only 40 were manufactured in Mexico before production ceased in 1966 due to lack of interest from the Mexican government.  Specifications = First Version - 1965  The first versions of the HWK-11 were strictly troop transport vehicles with only a single turret mounted 7.62 MG3 machine gun that could be fired from within the vehicle. This initial version featured a 180 hp engine and a two image intensifiers, one for the driver and one for the machine gun operator.  Second Version - 1980  In 1980 one vehicle was used to test the use of a one-man Helio FVT900 turret with a 20 mm cannon and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun. The upgrade also included the upgrading of the vehicles engine to the 6V-53 Detroit Diesel which produced 210 hp and allowed the vehicle to reach up to 70 km/h.  Third Version - 1993  In 1993 the vehicle was upgraded one more time, given a more powerful engine (the type of which is unknown) and new German made M113 caterpillar road wheels. The most significant upgrade to this new version is the addition of a French design fully enclosed turret mounting a 7.62 mm machine gun.

They formed in 1985 and have released ten albums to date, nine studio and one live. An eleventh album was stated as planned to be released in 2019, although this did not happen. As of July 2020 Dare's facebook page informed work was progressing on the new album, and it would be completed soon. History Dare was formed in 1985 by former Thin Lizzy keyboard player Darren Wharton after Phil Lynott had dissolved the band. By 1987, Dare had gained a local following in Oldham and in 1987 were signed with a four-year deal by A&M.; The band's debut album, Out of the Silence, was released in 1988 on A&M; Records. It was recorded in Los Angeles at singer Joni Mitchell's private studio in Beverly Hills. The lineup for this album consisted of Darren Wharton (vocals/keyboards), Vinny Burns (guitars), Martin 'Shelley' Shelton (bass), James Ross (drums), and Brian Cox (keyboards). The follow-up album Blood from Stone was released in 1991, by which time Nigel Clutterbuck played bass guitar and Greg Morgan was on drums. With a much harder edge than the previous release, the second album was produced in Los Angeles by sound engineer Keith Olsen. Wharton has since commented that while he is \\"very proud of that album..., ...we should have stuck to our guns musically and not try and jump on the heavy metal band wagon.\\" He added, \\"Blood from Stone was written to please the rock press of the world.\\" Dare had minor success in Europe, but album sales flagged and the band was dropped from their label (which had been acquired by Polygram) after the second album, this despite Blood from Stone peaking at No. 48 UK in the UK Albums Chart. The band also had five songs in the UK Singles Chart: \\"Abandon\\" (#71, 1989), \\"Nothing Is Stronger Than Love\\" (#95, 1989) and \\"The Raindance\\" (#62, 1989) from Out of the Silence, and \\"We Don't Need a Reason\\" (#52, 1991) and \\"Real Love\\" (#67, 1991) from Blood from Stone. It would be 1998 before a third album was released - Calm Before the Storm, produced by Wharton. Wharton has since commented on the emergence of Dare's Celtic sound, stating, \\"I think that was mainly a part of my Thin Lizzy roots. Out of the Silence was quite Celtic in some of its stuff. You know, \\"The Raindance\\" and \\"King of Spades\\". You know, I spent my early career with Thin Lizzy, so that rubbed off me a great deal, working with Phil Lynott and Scott Gorham. And those Irish roots and the Celtic roots, where I live in Wales... You know, it's a very similar type of genre of folk music.\\" By the time Calm Before the Storm was released, in a further personnel reshuffle Vinny Burns, Brian Cox and Nigel Clutterbuck had all departed. Andrew Moore was credited with guitars, Martin Wilding with bass, and Julian Gardner with drums. Under 'additional musicians' Kevin Whitehead was credited with drums and Richard Dews with acoustic guitar and backing vocals. Of those departing, Brian Cox would play with D:Ream before becoming a particle physicist and science communicator.. Prior to returning to Dare in 2008, Burns (who departed in 1992 to join Asia) would play with a selection of other bands including Ultravox and Ten, as well as releasing a solo album The Journey in 1999. Clutterbuck returned to Dare in 2014. Belief was released in 2001. The first single from the album, \\"White Horses\\", was playlisted by Sir Terry Wogan on the UK's largest national radio station, BBC Radio 2. Tours throughout Europe and Scandinavia were to follow, including a 12 date tour with Asia in the UK. Line up for the album was Darren Wharton (vocals and keyboards), Richard Dews (acoustic guitar and lead), Andrew Moore (electric guitar and lead), and Julian Gardner (drums and percussion). In the summer of 2004, Beneath the Shining Water was released. The single \\"Sea of Roses\\" received considerable airplay on Radio 2. In 2008 Beneath the Shining Water and Belief were released as a double CD though Warner Music/ADA in the U.S. In October 2009, Arc of the Dawn was released on Wharton's own label, Legend Records. Line up for the album was Darren Wharton (vocals and keyboards), Richard Dews (guitars and backing vocals), and Kevin Whitehead (drums). Sleeve notes included 'Dare Live' which featured the addition of Vinny Burns on guitars. This set-up was retained for Calm Before the Storm 2 which was released in 2012, a re-record of the original Calm Before the Storm album with previously unreleased bonus tracks. Dare's sole live album to date, The Power of Nature: Live in Munich was released in 2005. The album was also available in DVD format. 2016 onwards Dare released their most recent album to date, Sacred Ground in July 2016. The album is often referred to as studio album seven, given that Calm Before The Storm 2 was essentially a re- record, and does include a '7' in the cover artwork design. Line up for Sacred Ground was Darren Wharton (vocals and keyboards), Vinny Burns (guitars), Kevin Whitehead (drums), Nigel Clutterbuck (bass). Sleeve notes featured the addition of Marc Roberts on keyboards for live shows. The album topped the Amazon Rock Charts in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy, and received predominantly positive reviews, albeit these usually genre-specific. A typical example might be MelodicRock.com which comments that: \\"[the album features some of Wharton‚Äôs most mature song writing to date. Thought provoking and passionate, whilst still retaining a dark rock edge\\". It continues: \\"...the return of the masterful Vinny Burns on guitar is certainly a stroke of brilliance. Vinny‚Äôs guitar takes the songs to the next level, delivering the rock edge that fans have wanted. Yes, tempo is far more ‚Äòup‚Äô than recent work and like past Dare albums, it does take several listens to get to know the tunes. The similar pacing makes it a little harder to separate the songs initially, but as always with Dare, it is all about mood. And no one does mood better than Darren Wharton and Vinny Burns\\". The summation includes: \\"There are no fillers here ‚Äì 11 great tracks of keyboard and guitar framed music; this is a wonderful album that takes a step back from the Celtic influences of recent times and a huge step back towards straight ahead moody AOR\\". In an interview for metalcovent.com in August 2016, Wharton commented that \\"I've got a new album almost ready to go for next year, so. So it won't be 4 years 'til the next one\\". Tour dates/venues during 2017 included the Oslo Hard Rock Caf√© in Norway, the Rockingham Festival at Nottingham Trent University, UK, Winter Storm in Scotland, and the H.E.A.T festival in Germany. The band continued to tour into 2018 and by September 2018 venues had included Hard Rock Heaven (UK), row Club (Athens, Greece), and Melodic Rock Festival (Sweden). The band had also co-headlined five UK shows with FM. On 4 May 2018, the band announced the Anniversary Special Edition of Out Of The Silence, Out Of The Silence II. The original album has been completely re-recorded and was released on 29 June that year, with pre-sales having started on 18 May. On 9 May 2018, the band announced the launch of a new official website. On 30 November 2018, Dare announced initial European tour details for 2019, which by 6 January 2019 had expanded to 22 dates in Belgium, Germany, Holland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. A new album was scheduled for release in 2019, but as of July 2020 this had not happened, but was pending according the Dare FaceAche page. Dare continued to tour into 2020 with their first appearance being on the King's call Cruise (4-5 January). Other confirmed dates for 2020 (as of January 2020) were at the Cascais Rock Fest on 25 Jan (with Cutting Crew and The Stranglers), and at the Rock of Ages Festival, Germany 31 July - 2 August. In line with official guidance/regulations, all 2020 show were halted from March 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

As a lobbyist for the City of Philadelphia, she is credited with driving legislation in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, including a rental-car and hotel tax, to help fund the construction of sports stadiums and to expand the Philadelphia International Airport. Details of her marriage and subsequent divorce to former Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Bill DeWeese garnered significant coverage in the media. Early years and education A native of Orinda, California, Kinser's father ran an executive search company. When Kinser was 17, her father became a personnel director for the Reagan White House and she moved with her family to Washington, DC. She took a summer job with the Republican National Committee, an organization where she worked until she graduated from Scripps College, where she majored in history and was the swim team captain. She took a position with International Paper, who sent her to Harrisburg in 1990 to open their lobbying office. A year later she began seeing Bill DeWeese socially, and they married in December 1992. Career in lobbying In 1992, DeWeese supplanted Robert W. O'Donnell as Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and in 1994 Kinser's allies Tom Ridge and Rick Santorum were elected. She then took a position with Greenlee Associates and began lobbying on behalf of Philadelphia and was able to help pass rental-car tax that helped fund the stadiums, the airport expansion funding, and the one percent hotel tax that fuels the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation. It was during this time that rumors of a relationship between her and then-Mayor of Philadelphia Ed Rendell began. Both Rendell and Kinser deny any impropriety in their relationship. Kinser and DeWeese separated in 1999. She began seeing Ed Linsley, a manager at Philadelphia Four Seasons Hotel. DeWeese, who was served the divorce papers on the House floor blamed Rendell for the dissolution of his marriage. In 2001, Kinser moved to Chicago and took a job with the small public-relations firm Kemper Lesnick when Linsley was assigned to the Chicago Four Seasons. In June 2002 Kinser sought to return to the Harrisburg lobbying community and DeWeese asked lobbyist Steve Wojdak not to hire Kinser. Later that year, Wojdak hired Kinser; accounts conflict on the specifics of what happened in the earlier meeting and whether Wojdak had actually broken any agreement. DeWeese penned a letter (eventually leaked to PoliticsPA and published to wide dissemination) calling Wojdak an \\"abject, ignoble, mendacious knave.\\" In relatiation, DeWeese sought to keep Wojdak off of the board of the Philadelphia Convention Center Authority. During the 2002 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, rumors spread that Republican Mike Fisher's campaign was preparing to air a negative television advertisement discussing her relationship with the Democratic nominee for Governor Ed Rendell. In two incidents in one evening, Kinser loudly and publicly confronted Fisher's television man, John Brabender, and campaign manager, Kent Gates regarding these rumors, reportedly telling Gates \\"I hate your guts\\". In a March 2003 article in the Philadelphia Magazine, Sabrina Rubin Erdely suggested that Kinser had confronted the Fisher staffers in a deliberate attempt to increase her public profile. Awards and accolades In 2003, she was named to the PoliticsPA \\"Power 50\\" list of politically influential personalities, where it was noted that her \\"lobbying talent speaks for itself.\\" In 2010, Politics Magazine named her one of the most influential Democrats in Pennsylvania.

It was directed by Mel Chionglo and written by Ricky Lee.Nagsimula sa Puso (1990) Production After the success of Sineserye Presents, ABS-CBN decided to make a new afternoon drama for daytime. Nagsimula Sa Puso was a 1990 film which earned Richard Gomez his first FAMAS awards and nominations. Richard Gomez played the role of a young college student in a heated affair with his college professor played by Hilda Koronel, who attempts revenge after being stricken with grief and resentment by his professor's mother, and takes revenge on his professor's now settled family only to obtain her for himself. Throughout its press conference, Maja Salvador takes the lead as Hilda Koronel's character Celina Hernandez, a role in which Maja took time to analyze carefully when offered the project, she decided to give the green light and allowed herself to play the role because she wanted to experience a role out of character and taken seriously because of many projects in which she played teeny-bopper roles. After she mostly played adult roles only on anthology episodes of MMK variously, she decided to take the lead and do a love scene with film and TV actor Coco Martin who was recently in the TV series in the same year Tayong Dalawa before Nagsimula Sa Puso's debut on October 12, 2009 which also caused Maja to work anxiously. The series also revolved on serious actors such as Gloria Diaz (actress and beauty queen), Jaclyn Jose (film actress and drama TV series versatile actress) and Buboy Garovillo (veteran TV host, actor and member of the APO Hiking Society) and newcomer Nikki Gil and Joseph Bitangcol and actress and film director Laurice Guilllen in a special role.

But she couldn‚Äôt take more of Minda‚Äôs unyielding influence. So as an act of defiance, Celina not only rejects her rich boyfriend, Jim(Jason Abalos) offer to take her with him abroad but also his marriage proposal. To make matters worse, her professional life also turns upside down starting the day she meets engineering scholar Carlo Pagdanganan (Coco Martin). She instantly dislikes him for coming in late during their first day of classes and for making her look incompetent in front of the dean who‚Äôs very lenient with him.

It is known by a variety of common names, including the painted slipperycap, the painted suillus or the red and yellow suillus. Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomical history, and is also frequently referred to as Suillus pictus in the literature. The readily identifiable fruit bodies have caps that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The stalk bears a grayish cottony ring, and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales. Suillus spraguei grows in a mycorrhizal association with several pine species, particularly eastern white pine, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a disjunct distribution, and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree. The mushroom is edible; opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other Suillus species, including the closely related S. decipiens; the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size. Taxonomy, phylogeny, and naming Suillus spraguei has had a complex taxonomic history. The first specimen was originally collected in New England in 1856 by Charles James Sprague, and a formal scientific description was published in 1872 when Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis called it Boletus spraguei. In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist Charles Horton Peck named the species Boletus pictus. Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species‚ÄîBoletus murraii‚Äîalthough this was later considered by Rolf Singer to be merely a younger version of their Boletus spraguei. Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, but the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural priority under the rules of fungal naming. In 1945 Singer reported that the name Boletus pictus was illegitimate because it was a homonym, already being used for a polypore mushroom described by Carl Friedrich Schultz in 1806. The name was officially switched to Suillus spraguei in 1986 (Otto Kuntze had previously transferred the taxon to Suillus in 1898). A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The results indicate that S. spraguei is most closely related to S. decipiens. The species S. granulatus and S. placidus lie on a branch sister to that containing S. spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S. spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S. spraguei and S. decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S. decipiens, U.S. S. spraguei, China (Yunnan) S. spraguei, and China (Jilin) S. spraguei. The specific epithet spraguei is an homage to the collector Sprague, while pictus means \\"painted\\" or \\"colored\\". Suillus spraguei is commonly known as the \\"painted slipperycap\\", the \\"painted suillus\\", or the \\"red and yellow suillus\\". It is also called the \\"eastern painted Suillus\\" to contrast with the \\"western painted Suillus\\" (Suillus lakei). Description The pores are large, angular, and arranged radially. The cap of the fruit body is in diameter, and depending on its age, is either conic to convex, to somewhat flattened at maturity. The cap margin is initially rolled downward before straightening out, often with hanging remnants of partial veil (appendiculate).Bessette et al. (2001), pp. 246‚Äì47. The cap surface is covered with densely matted filaments that are rough and scale-like. The scales are pink to brownish red, fading to a pale brown-gray or dull yellow in maturity. Under the scales, the cap surface is yellow to pale yellow-orange. While many other Suillus species have a sticky or slimy cap, S. spraguei is dry. The flesh is yellow. The pores on the underside of the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring wide, and formed by tubes that extend deep. These pores have a slightly decurrent attachment to the stem (extending down its length). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous partial veil that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it rips the veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the stem. The stem is long, and thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped. The stem surface is tomentose, with scales at the top, and a ring on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color. The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow. The tissue of all parts of the fruit body‚Äîcap, pores, and stem‚Äîwill turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured. In deposit, such as with a spore print, the spores of S. spraguei appear olive-brown in color; this changes to clay or tawny- olive after drying. Microscopically, the spores have smooth surfaces, measuring 9‚Äì11 by 3‚Äì4.5 ¬µm; in side profile they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore attaches to the basidia), while in face view they appear oblong. The spores are not amyloid, meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are thin- walled, four-spored, and have dimensions of 17‚Äì19 by 5‚Äì7.8 ¬µm. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, they appear hyaline (translucent), and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer's reagent. Various parts of the mushroom display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with the application of a drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH. Edibility Suillus spraguei is an edible mushroom. Its taste is not distinctive, and the odor has been described as \\"slightly fruity\\". It turns a blackish color when cooked, and some consider it choice, and \\"among the better edibles in the genus Suillus\\". In contrast, another source on mushrooms of Qu√©bec described the mushroom as a poor edible (\\"comestible m√©diocre\\"), and warned of a slightly acidic taste and disagreeable flavor. Michael Kuo's 2007 book 100 Edible Mushrooms rates the taste as mediocre, suggesting \\"its sluglike consistency has all the palatability of unflavored gelatin.\\" The book recommends frying the thinly sliced mushroom in butter or oil until it acquires a crispy texture. Similar species S. decipiens is a lookalike species. S. spraguei is a popular edible among novice mushroom hunters as it is readily identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with white pine. This renders it unlikely to be confused with other species, but it shares similar characteristics with several other Suillus species. S. spraguei bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete (S. ochraceoroseus),Given in the source as Fuscoboletinus ochraceoroseus, but this species has since been transferred to the genus Suillus. See Suillus ochraceoroseus at Index Fungorum. but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with larch. S. cavipes, another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk.Bessette et al. (2001), p. 233. S. lakei is less brightly colored than S. spraguei, has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with Douglas fir.Bessette et al. (2001), pp. 242‚Äì43. S. decipiens has a less intensely red cap when young, but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble S. spraguei. S. decipiens generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from in diameter, and stem that is typically long by thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5‚Äì1 mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of hazel rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from New Jersey south to Florida and west to Texas.Bessette et al. (2001), p. 234. Ecology, habitat and distribution The eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) is the predominant North American mycorrhizal associate of Suillus spraguei. In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S. spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. Under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S. spraguei has also been shown to form associations with red pine, pitch pine, and loblolly pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean pine, Chinese white pine, Siberian dwarf pine and Japanese white pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July‚ÄìSeptember),Bessette et al. (2001). but they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H. completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci- containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture. The S. spraguei fruit body on the right is being attacked by the bolete mold Hypomyces completus. A Japanese field study found that S. spraguei was the dominant fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean pine, both in terms of ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S. spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random‚Äîthe location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S. spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores. Suillus spraguei has a disjunct distribution and is known from several localities in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In North America, its range extends from eastern Canada (Nova Scotia) south to the Carolinas, and west to Minnesota. It has also been collected in Mexico (Coahuila and Durango). Furthermore, the species has been introduced to Europe (Germany, Lower Saxony; Netherlands).

It has been used by Berry and collaborators to understand both weakly and strongly correlated systems and to suggest an \\"alternating\\" version of Hund's rule. Seidl studies this system in the context of density functional theory (DFT) to develop new correlation functionals within the adiabatic connection.  Definition and solution  The electronic Hamiltonian in atomic units is :\\\\hat{H} = - \\\\frac{ abla_1^2}{2} - \\\\frac{ abla_2^2}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{u} where u is the interelectronic distance. For the singlet S states, it can be then shown that the wave function S(u) satisfies the Schr√∂dinger equation :\\\\left( \\\\frac{u^2}{4R^2} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\frac{d^2S(u)}{du^2} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{3u}{4R^2} - \\\\frac{1}{u} \\\\right) \\\\frac{dS(u)}{du} + \\\\frac{1}{u} S(u)= E S(u) By introducing the dimensionless variable x = u/2R, this becomes a Heun equation with singular points at x = -1, 0, +1. Based on the known solutions of the Heun equation, we seek wave functions of the form :S(u) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty s_k\\\\,u^k and substitution into the previous equation yields the recurrence relation :s_{k+2} = \\\\frac{ s_{k+1} + \\\\left[ k(k+2) \\\\frac{1}{4R^2} - E \\\\right] s_k }{(k+2)^2} with the starting values s_0 = s_1 = 1 . Thus, the Kato cusp condition is : \\\\frac{S'(0)}{S(0)} = 1 . The wave function reduces to the polynomial :S_{n,m}(u) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n s_k\\\\,u^k (where m the number of roots between 0 and 2R) if, and only if, s_{n+1} = s_{n+2} = 0. Thus, the energy E_{n,m} is a root of the polynomial equation s_{n+1} = 0 (where \\\\deg s_{n+1} = \\\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\\\rfloor) and the corresponding radius R_{n,m} is found from the previous equation which yields : R_{n,m}^2 E_{n,m} = \\\\frac{n}{2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{2}+1\\\\right) S_{n,m}(u) is the exact wave function of the m-th excited state of singlet S symmetry for the radius R_{n,m}. We know from the work of Loos and Gill that the HF energy of the lowest singlet S state is E_{\\\\rm HF} = 1/R. It follows that the exact correlation energy for R = \\\\sqrt{3}/2 is E_{\\\\rm corr} = 1-2/\\\\sqrt{3} \\\\approx -0.1547 which is much larger than the limiting correlation energies of the helium-like ions (-0.0467) or Hooke's atoms (-0.0497). This confirms the view that electron correlation on the surface of a sphere is qualitatively different from that in three-dimensional physical space. Spherium on a 3-sphere Loos and Gill considered the case of two electrons confined to a 3-sphere repelling Coulombically. They report a ground state energy of (-.0476).

American Libraries includes Caroline Hewins as one of the 100 Most Important Leaders we had in the 20th Century for her work as a librarian, where she is noted for her contributions to children's library services Kniffel, L.,Sullivan,P., & McCormick,.E (1999). 100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century. American Libraries, 30(11), 38. She was a librarian at the Hartford Young Men's Institute, which is now known as the Hartford Public Library in Hartford, Connecticut for more than fifty years. An author as well as librarian, she contributed not only to the expansion of children's library services across the U.S., but also the expansion of her library's membership, as well as its transformation from a subscription library to a free public library. Early life Caroline Hewins was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts on October 10, 1846.Lindquist, J. D. (1950). In the autobiographical book, A Mid-Century Child and Her Books, Hewins writes that after a bit of moving around, her family settled in West Roxbury when she was about seven years old.Hewins, C. M. (1926). A Mid-Century Child and Her Books. p.p.5-6 Detroit: Singing Tree Press, Book Tower. She was the oldest of nine children.Aller, S. B. (2007). Hartford's First Lady of the Library. Hog River Journal, 5, 7. Her father was a wealthy Boston merchant who provided a comfortable home for his wife, children, and an extended family of aunts, uncles, and grandmothers. Caroline learned to read by the age of four. Her love for books increased as she read to her younger siblings and as she progressed to reading folk and fairy tales, the English classics, and the stories from Greek, Roman, and European literary traditions. Education Caroline Hewin's childhood education consisted of private schooling, before attending Eliot High School. After receiving her high school diploma, she attended the Girls‚Äô High and Normal School where she graduated, although at first she described having some difficulty adjusting to her new educational environment.Hewins, C. M. (1926). A Mid-Century Child and Her Books. p. 37. Detroit: Singing Tree Press, Book Tower. After graduation, she was hired to do Civil War research at the Boston Athenaeum. This is where she received her brief library training, learning sound bibliographic practice while working for one year under William Frederick Poole. She briefly describes that during this time she learned about the inner-workings of the library and how it was managed and funded.Hewins, C. M. (1926). A Mid-Century Child and Her Books. p.38-40. Detroit: Singing Tree Press, Book Tower. In 1911, Hewins was awarded an honorary master of arts degree from Hartford's Trinity College in recognition of her 51 years of service at the library. She was the first woman so honored by the college. Career Caroline Hewins left the Boston Athenaeum to take a job as librarian at the Young Men's Institute of Hartford where she was employed from 1875 until her death in 1926. When she was hired at age 29, the Young Men's Institute was a subscription library with 600 members. It was a private association dedicated to informal learning, lectures, and debates. Hewins shepherded the library through a number of important changes. In 1878, the Young Men's Institute was merged with the Hartford Library Association and, ten years later, a generous grant enabled the library to undertake a large expansion project. In 1892, Hewins oversaw the library's change from a private, subscription service to a free public library, and the Hartford Public Library was born. Suddenly the library went from its 600 paying members to thousands of patrons with free access. In order to better serve the community, Hewins expanded the library's hours to include Sunday afternoons so that working people could take advantage of the institution's resources. In 1895 she opened the first branch library in the North Street Settlement House where she lived, staffing it herself one hour each evening. Her commitment to the success of the branch and her appreciation of the work going on there was so strong that she moved in and resided there for twelve years.Lindquist, J. D. (1950). Caroline M. Hewins and Books for Children. In S. Andrews (Ed.), The hewins Lectures: 1947-1962. p.73: The Horn Book, Inc. Contributions to the field of library science=Contributions to children's library services Caroline Hewins is most often credited for her contributions to children's library services. Hewins's programs for children, along with her scholarly articles and lists of recommended children's books, influenced generations of children's librarians as well as publishers of children's books and bookstores. Before her time, library services to children barely existed. Children younger than 12 years old were often not allowed to patron libraries when she began her career as a librarian.Rathbone, J. A. (1949). Pioneers of the library profession. [Feature]. Wilson Library Bulletin, 23, 775-779. Despite this, one of her most significant accomplishments was her success in adding a children's room in 1904 before the end of her career at the Hartford Public Library.Lindquist, J. D. (1950). Caroline M. Hewins and Books for Children. In S. Andrews (Ed.), The hewins Lectures: 1947-1962. p.76: The Horn Book, Inc. The idea of having a children's room at a library was very influential. Soon after, other libraries followed her example and began the addition of children's rooms. She also hired the library's first dedicated children's librarian in 1907. =Advocate for children= Soon after accepting the librarian position at the Hartford Young Men's Institute in 1876, she began inviting children to the library.Bush, M. (1996). New England book women: their increasing influence. (Caroline Hewins, Anne Carroll Moore, Alice Jordan, and Bertha Mahony)(Imagination and Scholarship: The Contributions of Women to American Youth Services and Literature). Library Trends, v44(n4), p719(717). The Institute Library had not welcomed children, but Hewins quickly changed that, and gathered together books by Grimm, Andersen, Hawthorne, Thackeray and Dickens to furnish a corner for them. Three years after arriving at the Young Men's Institute of Hartford, she began to include reading lists for children in the libraries news bulletin.Lindquist, J. D. (1950). Caroline M. Hewins and Books for Children. In S. Andrews (Ed.), The hewins Lectures: 1947-1962. p.71: The Horn Book, Inc. Opinionated, iconoclastic and not a follower of rules established by others, she believed that children deserved better books than the formulaic and often violent Horatio Alger stories and weekly novels of the penny press. The Children's Room she established had furniture suitable for different ages of children, pictures of flowers, much light and a resident dog the children helped name. She used the power of the local press and professional library periodicals to encourage parents to bring their children to libraries, to read with them, and to choose quality books that would inspire the young imagination. Hewins also fought against \\"literary prudery.\\" In a 1905 controversy over the books The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer the Brooklyn Public Library banned both works from the children's section. They were widely criticized for this action in newspapers across the country. As chief librarian at Hartford Public, Hewins refused to ban them from the newly opened children's library. =Linking libraries and schools= Hewins was far ahead of her time in regards to building connections between the library and local schools. She partnered with local schools, often serving them tea at her house, so that children would have better access to library resources. Hewins also founded an Education Club for parents and teachers, which would later come to be known as the Parent- Teacher Association. She collected books to be used in city classrooms, and made the library a place for book groups, theatrical skits, exhibits and parties. She extended the services of the Institute to local schools by persuading them to find the means to pay the yearly fee for membership, that way the schools could have books from the library brought to them, allowing students to take advantage of the library right from the classroom.Lindquist, J. D. (1950). Caroline M. Hewins and Books for Children. In S. Andrews (Ed.), The hewins Lectures: 1947-1962. p.72: The Horn Book, Inc. During the time when a paid subscription to the library was $3 per year to borrow one book at a time, Hewins worked with local Hartford schools to provide subscription cards for the children, at pennies per card. By the time the library became a free service in 1892, Miss Hewins had already lowered the annual subscription fee to $1 and doubled the membership. =Writing for children= Hewins was an avid writer and in 1882, she published ‚ÄúBooks for the Young‚Äù, an influential guide and list of recommended books for libraries to have available for children. This was the first bibliography intended for children and it has been used by many librarians and booksellers. The book was so influential that it was picked up and revised by the American Library Association for later use.Melcher, F. G. (1962). Introduction to Caroline M. Hewins and Books for Children. In S. Andrews (Ed.), The Hewins Lectures: 1947-1962: p.p.65-66: The Horn Books, Inc. Six years later her article in the January 1888 Atlantic Monthly on the history of children's books elevated the subject to the status of children's literature, worthy of scholarly attention. Hewins was always thinking of ways to reach children and so when she traveled, particularly abroad, she wrote extensive letters to the library's young patrons. These letters were gathered and published in 1923 as A Traveler's Letters to Boys and Girls. American Library Association affiliation When the American Library Association (ALA) was founded in 1876, Caroline joined, becoming one of the early members. She was the first woman to give an address at its annual conference. She also helped found the ALA's Children's Section in 1900. In 1882, through the ALA, Hewins sent a questionnaire to twenty-five libraries around the country and asked: ‚ÄúWhat are you doing to encourage a love of reading in boys and girls?‚Äù Based on the discouraging answers, which revealed that little was being done to encourage early readership, she made an impassioned report to the ALA that galvanized their attention. Within a few years, the ALA had established a Children's Section so that members could exchange ideas on how to best serve young readers and it was supporting professional training schools for children's librarians. Connecticut state library committee In 1891 Caroline founded the first Connecticut State Library Committee (precursor of the state library commission), becoming its executive secretary. Hewins writes that among her duties as secretary of the library committee, she would oversee the operations of the West Roxbury library in the absence of the regular librarian. Hewins would also drive her horse and buggy throughout the state to encourage cooperation between schools and libraries for the benefit of children. Over the next decade, Hartford's ‚ÄúFirst Lady of the Library‚Äù set up traveling libraries and book depositories all around the state at settlement houses, schools, and factories, setting the stage for today's modern branch library system. A nationally respected expert on library management, Hewins oversaw the quickly growing Hartford Public Library system‚Äîa rarity for a woman at the time, as most libraries were headed by men. Campaigning for free public libraries In Caroline M. Hewins and Books for Children, Jennie D. Lindquist writes that when Caroline Hewins first began working at the Young Men's Institute of Hartford, the library charged a fee of at least several dollars per year for membership. At the time, membership was the only way at the time to take advantage of the services of the library. In the late 19th century, several dollars was not a small amount of money, and as a consequence the library did not have a very large membership. But she worked at reducing the fee to one dollar per year, and library membership increased dramatically. And finally in 1892 membership became free. Aside from her contributions to children's library services, Caroline Hewins also campaigned for the creation of public libraries and spoke of the importance of free libraries throughout Connecticut. In New England Women: Their Increasing Influence, Margaret Bush writes that Caroline traveled in Connecticut to encourage the creation of libraries and talked to people about the importance of children's services. Death Caroline Hewins died on November 4, 1926, from pneumonia at the age of 80. She died at her home in Hartford just months after publishing her memoir, A Mid-Century Child and Her Books. Upon her death, the Library Journal wrote that she ‚Äúwas one of the beloved in the library profession. She made of herself a center from which radiated an immeasurable influence, especially in the great revolution in the library world which, instead of banning the children, made them the first thought of the librarian who could look at the future as well as the present.‚Äù Legacy The legacy of Caroline Hewins continued through the Caroline M. Hewins Lectures, so named by Frederic G. Melcher. The lectures began in 1947 and continued until 1962.Melcher, F. G. (1962). The Caroline M. Hewins Lectures. In S. Andrews (Ed.), The Hewins Lectures: 1947-1962: p.vii: The Horn Books, Inc. She is also remembered through the Hewins scholarship, available to assist women who want to become children's librarians to attain their educational goals. In late 1925, shortly before her death, she started the scholarship and it continues today.Caroline M. Hewins Scholarship: A Scholarship for Children's Librarians. Retrieved September 22, 2009, from Posthumous honors to Hewins include induction into the American Library Association's Library Hall of Fame (1951) and the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame (1995). American Libraries includes Caroline Hewins as one of the 100 Most Important Leaders we had in the 20th Century. Collection In addition to her work inside the library, Hewins was an avid personal collector of books and she searched for works that would re-create her childhood library, eventually greatly exceeding it. Her collection of more than 4,000 volumes is now preserved as the Hewins Collection at the Connecticut Historical Society and the Hartford Public Library. During her travels, Hewins acquired costumed dolls from every country she visited. At the library she would hold a New Year's Day reception with her collection, hosting little girls and their Christmas dolls. Today, the Hartford History Center at Hartford Public Library is home to her collection of more than 100 dolls, as well as originals of some of the letters she wrote to Hartford children from Europe, correspondence and newspaper clippings, and an extraordinary collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century European and American children's books.

(2002). Advanced English Idioms for Effective Communication, p. 52.Jewell, Elizabeth, ed. (2006). The Pocket Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus (2nd edition), p. 53. A slightly different explanation suggests this flexible catchphrase has to do with discarding the essential while retaining the superfluous because of excessive zeal. The World Book Dictionary, Vol. 1, p. 146.  History  This idiom derives from a German proverb, das Kind mit dem Bade aussch√ºtten. The earliest record of this phrase is in 1512, in Narrenbeschw√∂rung (Appeal to Fools) by Thomas Murner; this book includes a woodcut illustration showing a woman tossing a baby out with waste water. It is a common catchphrase in German, with examples of its use in work by Martin Luther, Johannes Kepler, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Otto von Bismarck, Thomas Mann, and G√ºnter Grass.Wilton, David. (2004). Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends, pp. 66-67. Thomas Carlyle adapted the concept in an 1849 essay on slavery: Carlyle is urging his readers to join in the struggle to end slavery, but he also encourages them to be mindful of the need to try to avoid harming the slaves in the process.

Signatories of the Covenant of Mayors voluntarily commit to increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources on their territories. By their commitment, they support the European Union 20% reduction objective to be reached by 2020. After the European Union climate and energy package was adopted in 2008, the European Commission launched the Covenant of Mayors to endorse and support the efforts deployed by local authorities in the implementation of sustainable energy policies. (archive)  Covenant of Mayors Signatories  European local authorities of all sizes ‚Äì from small villages to capitals and major metropolitan areas ‚Äì are eligible to sign up as Covenant of Mayors Signatories.https://www.eumayors.eu/about/covenant- community/signatories.html Cities, towns and other urban areas have a crucial role to play in mitigating climate change, as they consume three quarter of the energy produced in the European Union and are responsible for a similar share of emissions. Local authorities are also in a position to change citizens' behaviour and address climate and energy questions in a comprehensive manner, notably by conciliating public and private interests and by integrating sustainable energy issues into overall local development goals.  Formal undertakings  To meet the reduction targets they set themselves, signatories commit to a series of steps and accept to report and be monitored on their actions. Within predefined time frames, they formally undertake to fulfil the following: * Develop adequate administrative structures, including allocation of sufficient human resources, in order to undertake the necessary actions; * Prepare a Baseline Emission Inventory; * Submit a Sustainable Energy Action Plan within the year following the official adhesion to the Covenant of Mayors initiative, and including concrete measures leading to at least 20% reduction of emissions by 2020; * Submit an implementation report at least every second year after submission of their Sustainable Energy Action Plan for evaluation, monitoring and verification purposes To comply with the crucial necessity of mobilising local stakeholders in the development of the Sustainable Energy Action Plans, signatories also undertake to: * Share experience and know-how with other local authorities; * Organise Local Energy Days to raise citizens awareness of sustainable development and energy efficiency; * Attend or contribute to the Covenant of Mayors annual ceremony, thematic workshops and discussion group meetings; * Spread the message of the Covenant in the appropriate fora and, in particular, encourage other mayors to join the Covenant.  Sustainable Energy Action Plans  To reach and try to exceed the European Union energy and climate objectives, Covenant of Mayors signatories commit to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), within a year following their adhesion to the initiative. This action plan, approved by the municipal council, outlines the activities and measures foreseen by signatories to fulfil their commitments, with corresponding time frames and assigned responsibilities. Various technical and methodological supporting materials (including the \\"SEAP Guidebook\\" http://www.eumayors.eu/IMG/pdf/seap_guidelines_en-2.pdf and template, reports on existing methodologies and tools, etc.) offer practical guidance and clear recommendations on the whole SEAP development process. Based on the practical experiences of local authorities and developed in close co-operation with the European Commission Joint Research Centre, this support package provides Covenant signatories with key principles and a clear step-by-step approach. All documents are downloadable on the www.eumayors.eu website library.  Coordination and support = Covenant Coordinators and Supporters  Covenant Signatories do not always possess the adequate tools and resources to prepare a Baseline Emission Inventory, draft the related Sustainable Energy Action Plan and finance the actions featured in the latter. In light of this, provinces, regions, networks and groupings of municipalities have a crucial role to play in helping signatories honour their commitments. Covenant Coordinators are public authorities from different government levels (national, regional, provincial) which provide strategic guidance to signatories, as well as financial and technical support in the development and implementation of their Sustainable Energy Action Plans. The Commission distinguishes between \\"Territorial Coordinators\\", which are sub-national decentralised authorities ‚Äì including provinces, regions and public groupings of municipalities -, and \\"National Coordinators\\", which include national public bodies ‚Äì such as national energy agencies and ministries of energy. Covenant Supporters are European, national and regional networks and associations of local authorities which leverage their lobbying, communication and networking activities to promote the Covenant of Mayors initiative and support the commitments of its signatories.  Covenant of Mayors Office  Promotional, technical and administrative assistance is provided on a daily basis to Covenant signatories and stakeholders by the Covenant of Mayors Office (CoMO), managed by a consortium of local and regional authorities' networks, led by Energy Cities and composed of CEMR, Climate Alliance, Eurocities and FEDARENE. Funded by the European Commission, the CoMO is responsible for the overall co-ordination of the initiative.  Institutions of the European Union  To support the elaboration and implementation the signatories' Sustainable Energy Action Plans, the European Commission has contributed to the development of financial facilities particularly targeting Covenant of Mayors signatories, among which the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) facility, set up in co-operation with the European Investment Bank, for large-scale projects, and ELENA-KfW which, established in partnership with the German Group KfW, offers a complementary approach to mobilise sustainable investments of small and medium-sized municipalities. Alongside the European Commission, the Covenant benefits from full institutional support, including from the Committee of the Regions, which has supported the initiative since its inception; the European Parliament, where the two first signing ceremonies were held; and the European Investment Bank, which assists local authorities in unlocking their investment potentials.  Joint Research Centre  The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission is responsible for providing technical and scientific support to the initiative. It works in close collaboration with the Covenant of Mayors Office to equip signatories with clear technical guidelines and templates to assist delivery of their Covenant of Mayors commitments, as well as to monitor implementation and results.

Life and family Walter was born in 1196, the fourth son and one of the ten children of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke. His mother was one of the wealthiest heiresses in the kingdom when she married Walter's father. Upon William Marshal's death in 1219, the earldom passed in succession to Walter's three elder brothers, William, Richard, and Gilbert, all of whom died childless.

He did not succeed to his titles until 1242 due to King Henry III's anger towards Walter for having disobeyed royal orders which had forbidden tournaments on the grounds that he did not want any of his subjects killing one another in sport.Costain, p.112 Walter who had attended the tournament which had killed Gilbert shared in his brother's guilt, so had to wait a year before he was invested with the earldom and hereditary post of Earl Marshal. That same year he accompanied King Henry to Gascony. On 6 January 1242 Walter married the wealthy widow Margaret de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln. Margaret did not bear Walter any children, and when he died suddenly at Goodrich Castle on 24 November 1245, the earldom passed to his younger brother, Anselm Marshal, 6th Earl of Pembroke, who followed him to the grave a month later. Like his four elder brothers, Anselm was also childless. Walter's widow, Margaret received a dower third from the Pembroke earldom and lordships, and as such she controlled most of the extensive Pembroke estates as her third outweighed the individual holdings of the 13 different co-heirs of his five sisters.

It is a single-span queen post truss, long and wide, with a roadway width of (one lane). It is covered by a gabled metal roof, and its exterior is clad in vertical board siding, which extends around to the insides of the portals. On the sides, the siding ends short of the roof, leaving an open strip. The bridge rests on concrete abutments that date to 1960. The trusses are unusually short and lack internal bracing, and their corner joints have been reinforced with metal plates. with The bridge's construction date and builder are not known. It has been determined that the bridge was originally an uncovered Pony truss bridge, due to the relatively low height of the queen post trusses and the discovery of supporting documents.Barna, Ed.

The reserve is an important although isolated cloud forest which supports a number of faunal species including some endemics. The area was designated a strict nature reserve on 25 February 1938. The reserve is adjacent to and contiguous with the Hakgala Botanical Garden which was founded in 1860. Physical features The Hakgala reserve covers an area of the altitude of which ranges from to at the summit of Hakgala peak. The reserve receives of mean annual rainfall with rain falling on 211 days of the year. The soil of the reserve consists of red-yellow podsols this is due to the bookly. The reserve is situated on the south bank of Sita-Eliya and includes most of the Hakgala massif. The name of this range is derived from several of the peaks being said to have the shape of an elephant's jaw. In the Sinhala language Hak is jaw and Gala is rock. Folklore The nearby Sita Amman Hindu temple of Sita Eliya has a tradition that goes back to the legend of Ramayana. According to folk legends, the demon king of Lanka, Ravana, kept Sita hidden in this area. Flora Vegetation of the reserve consists of montane cloud forests. These forests are noted for endemic archaic Hortonia floribunda and many orchids. Endemics of Calophyllum walkeri, Syzygium rotundifolium, Elaeocarpus montanus are the common floral species of the reserve. In the undergrowth many Strobilanthes species are common. According to height, the forest is categorised into two types; dwarf forests which is dominated by low growing Osbeckia buxifolia while taller forests featured by Rhododendron zeylanicum and Actinodaphne speciosa. Fauna The reserve harbours many species of endemic mammals such as purple-faced langur, toque macaque, mayor's mouse, Ohiya rat, Kelaart's long-clawed shrew, Sri Lankan long-tailed shrew, and Pearson's long-clawed shrew. Some of these mammals are strictly endemic to this region. Sri Lanka leopard, fishing cat, wild boar, Sri Lankan sambar deer, grizzled giant squirrel, red giant flying squirrel, and pungent pipistrelle are some of the other mammals found in the reserve. The Sri Lankan elephant was reported to be present in 1939. Avifauna of the reserve exhibits a high degree of variety and endemicity. Some of the noteworthy species include mountain hawk-eagle, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, jungle nightjar, Sri Lanka blue magpie, yellow-eared bulbul, brown-capped babbler, orange-billed babbler, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka bush warbler, Sri Lanka whistling thrush, spot-winged thrush, common blackbird, and Sri Lanka white-eye. All five species of bird which are strictly endemic to this ecoregion are present in the reserve. Common birds are scarlet minivet, small minivet, black bulbul, Sri Lanka scimitar babbler, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, pied bushchat, and Sri Lanka scaly thrush. Indian pitta, Asian brown flycatcher, Kashmir flycatcher, Indian blue robin, pied thrush, black-throated munia, and large-billed leaf warbler are amongst the large number of migratory species. Many endemic amphibians including Adenomus kelaartii, Polypedates cruciger, Philautus microtympanum, Philautus schmarda, Ramanella palmata, and Microhyla zeylanica together with Fejervarya limnocharis and bronzed frog inhabit the reserve. Notable reptiles include Uropeltis melanogaster, Rhinophis blythii, Aspidura brachyorrhos, A. trachyprocta, Hypnale nepa, geckos such as Calotes nigrilabris, Cophotis ceylanica, rhino horn lizard, and skink species Sphenomorphus striatopunctatum. Conservation Hakgala reserve is an important and isolated cloud forest, which supports a number of endemics; however, its small size and isolation is jeopardizing its long-term survival. Illegal logging by the farmers and dieback of the forest are the two major threats to the reserve. The reserve is one of the sites where academic research is conducted. One study conducted within the reserve has revealed that soil toxicity is a probable cause of forest dieback. In addition to the above factors it is known that up to 25 percent of the area of the reserve has been encroached upon.

The historic hotel in the national historic district at French Lick was initially known as a mineral spring health spa and for its trademarked Pluto Water. During the period 1901 to 1946, when Thomas Taggart, a former mayor of Indianapolis, and his son, Thomas D. Taggart, were its owners and operators, the popular hotel attracted many fashionable, wealthy, and notable guests. The resort was a major employer of African-American labor, which mostly came from Kentucky. In the early 1900s, the hotel had a Negro league baseball team, the French Lick Plutos, and until the 1940s French Lick was a venue for spring training for professional baseball teams. In the 1920s and into the 1930s, the resort became known for its recreational sports, most notably golf, but the French Lick area also had a reputation for illegal gambling. After a series of subsequent owners and renovations, the hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. The restored hotel, with its exteriors of distinctive, buff-colored brick, reopened in 2006.  History  Hotel in the 1880s  Origins  The hotel site was located near a salt lick that wild animals once visited as they traveled along the Buffalo Trace in southern Indiana. Native Americans also used the area as hunting grounds. It became known as French Lick in reference to the French traders and settlers who lived in the vicinity of the salt lick. Some sources have cited a legend that suggests George Rogers Clark, who camped in the area during an expedition in 1786‚Äì87, may have named it after a site along the Cumberland River in Tennessee.  Early development  In 1826, encouraged by the presence of salt deposits near French Lick, Indiana's state government authorized the land to be mined for quantities of salt, but the saline content was insufficient to support large-scale salt mining and the property was offered for sale. In 1832 Thomas Bowles and his brother, William A., a Paoli, Indiana, physician and early land speculator, purchased of land that included the site near the mineral springs. Doctor Bowles eventually built an inn on the property; it became known as the French Lick Springs Hotel. Although the specific date of the hotel's opening is not known, it is believed that Bowles built the first hotel on his French Lick property sometime around 1845.Fadely, p. 61. (Some sources believe the narrow, three-story hotel, measuring an estimated to in length, may have been built prior to 1840, but most report that it opened in 1845.Rhodes, pp. 17‚Äì18.) The early hotel, which operated during the summer months, was a modest success. In 1846, prior to his departure for military service as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Bowles leased the property to John A. Lane, a physician/patent medicine salesman, for at least five years. Under the terms of the lease Lane agreed to enlarge and improve the facility. Reprint of History of Lawrence, Orange and Washington Counties (1884).O'Malley, p. 367. In the early 1850s Bowles resumed management of the French Lick hotel at the end of the lease and continued to improve the property. Lane purchased of land from Bowles that included mineral springs at Mile Lick, north of French Lick. Lane assembled a sawmill, erected a bridge to traverse Lick Creek, and built the West Baden Springs Hotel. Competition from Lane's new hotel, which opened in the mid-1850s, began a decades-long rivalry between the two Orange County sites.Rhodes, pp. 8‚Äì9.O'Malley, p. 368. In the 1860s Bowles leased the French Lick hotel to Doctor Samuel Ryan, who operated it for Bowles and the heirs of Bowles's estate following the owner's death in 1873. Joseph G. Rogers, a physician from Madison, Indiana, named the French Lick hotel's largest mineral spring Pluto's Well in 1869. (Pluto is the classical mythological god of the underworld.)Steelwater, p. 52. The original French Lick hotel, which was rebuilt or enlarged as a -story frame building with a wrap-around veranda in the Gothic Revival style, underwent few additional changes until the early 1880s, when it was sold to Hiram E. Wells and James M. Andrews. (The hotel and mineral springs were sold at a sheriff's sale organized to settle a legal dispute over Bowles's estate.)Steelwater, p. 53. Wells and Andrews enlarged and improved the property in the 1880s and 1890s, developing it into a popular mineral springs health resort.Rhodes, p. 8. Wells acquired Andrews's interest in the property in 1887 for $61,000, and immediately sold the hotel to a group of Louisville, Kentucky, investors for $122,000 in cash and $100,000 in the French Lick Springs Company's stock. Wells retained a one-quarter interest in the property until 1891, when he sold his interest to the investment group. The new owners made major improvements to the hotel, including the addition of two wings (Cliftonand Pavillion [sic]) to the main hotel (Windsor). They also expanded the hotel's operation from a seasonal business to a year-round resort.Steelwater, pp. 53‚Äì54. In 1887 the Monon Railroad built an extension of its line to transport guests to the hotels and mineral springs at French Lick and West Baden. In 1888 the hotel's owners granted the railroad a right of way on the hotel property. The main hotel building (Windsor) was destroyed by a fire in 1897. Rebuilt on an even grander scale, a major resort that catered to guests seeking the advertised health benefits of the town's sulfur springs. Three major springs were located on the French Lick resort's property: Bowles (renamed Lithia), Proserpine, and the better-known Pluto. The area's mineral water and baths were alleged to cure more than fifty ailments, including gout, alcoholism, and rheumatism, among others.O'Malley, p. 374.  Taggart era  Turn of the century In 1901 the property was sold to an investment group that included Thomas Taggart, a politician and former mayor of Indianapolis. Taggart served three terms as mayor of Indianapolis (1895 to 1901), as a chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and briefly in the U.S. Senate (1916).Steelwater, pp. 56.Fadely, pp. xii and 57. Other members of the investment group included William McDoel, president of the Monon Railroad; Crawford Fairbanks, a Terre Haute brewery owner; and Livingston T. Dickson, a limestone quarry owner. The new owners spent more than $200,000 on improvements, including a redesign and enlargement of the main wing (1901‚Äì02), sometimes called the front or east wing, designed by architect William Homer Floyd. The main wing's new design overlaid the hotel's Late Victorian architecture with Mediterranean Revival architecture, most notably the Italian Renaissance style that was popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The exteriors of the main wing and later additions were unified with similar proportions, a consistent roofline, and the hotel's distinctive buff- colored brick.Steelwater, pp. 5‚Äì6. Note: This includes , Site map, and accompanying photographs. Around 1905 Taggart bought out his partners to become the hotel's sole owner. Under his direction, the hotel was transformed into a first-class resort that included the main wing (1901‚Äì1902), a recreation center (formerly the bath house, 1910‚Äì11), and four connected wings: annex (1905, remodeled 1911), west (1910‚Äì11), deluxe (1914‚Äì15), and north (1924‚Äì25). These facilities housed lobbies and guest room, dining rooms and bars, offices, shops, and a spa. The annex wing provided offices and guest rooms. The west wing, the hotel's first fireproof wing, included an elaborate Italian Renaissance Revival-style pavilion, originally named the Pluto Bar. The seven-story deluxe wing housed guest rooms and suites, including accommodations for the Taggart family when they resided at the hotel. The hotel's six-story north wing provided the hotel with conference and exhibition spaces.Steelwater, pp. 12‚Äì15; 18‚Äì20.Fadely, pp. 65‚Äì68. Taggart made additional improvements at the mineral springs that included the construction of pavilions, including the Pluto spring house (circa 1911), to shelter the springs. A new mineral spring bath was built at the site of the present-day spa facility. In addition, Taggart is credited with modernizing the hotel, which included bringing in electricity, adding a fresh water system, and establishing trolley service to French Lick. The hotel's service buildings included a kitchen complex (1897, 1910‚Äì11, c. 1925), power station (1902, expanded 1905), its first bottling plant (circa 1900) for Pluto Water, and a hotel laundry (circa 1911‚Äì13). He also convinced the Monon Railroad to lay a spur track to the hotel's grounds and run daily passenger service to Chicago.Steelwater, pp. 5‚Äì6; 22‚Äì26.Bunting, p, 43. The hotel also had three distinct gardens on it grounds: a Japanese garden (circa 1920; later redesigned and replanted), a Fresh Water Spring garden (circa 1900‚Äì15), and an Italian-style formal garden (circa 1915; later redesigned and altered).Steelwater, pp. 27‚Äì29. Recreational facilities included horseback riding, tennis, swimming, bowling, billiards, and a gym, as well as fine dining and dancing to music from the hotel's orchestra.Fadely, p. 72. At the height of the resort's popularity, which occurred during Taggart's ownership of the hotel, approximately 150 to 200 guests checked into the hotel each day. The resort provided Taggart with more than $2 million in annual profits.Bunting, p. 45. Following Taggart's death in 1929, Thomas Douglas Taggart, the politician's son, became owner of the hotel property, which included approximately and buildings valued at nearly $2 million.Steelwater, p. 57.  Decline  In the years following the Wall Street stock market crash of 1929, the resort went into a steady decline, but it did not close. To survive the financial challenges of the Great Depression and an increase in completion from other resorts in the United States, the French Lick hotel was promoted as a recreational resort with an emphasis on golf and convention business instead of a health spa.Bunting, p. 46. After a brief revival during World War II, it fell into another decline. Thomas D. Taggart sold the hotel to a group of New York City investors in 1946 Pluto Water operations were separated from the resort's operations in 1948. The resort was sold to Sheraton Hotels in 1954 and renamed the French Lick-Sheraton Hotel. Although the Sheraton chain spent \\"millions of dollars\\" to improve the facilities, French Lick's physical condition continued to decline. Sheraton sold the hotel to Cox Hotel Corporation of New York in 1979. Cox returned the resort to its original name and sold the property to Kenwood Financial in 1986. The Luther James family of Louisville, Kentucky, acquired the hotel in 1991, and Boykin Lodging of Cleveland, Ohio, bought it in 1997. The Cook Group, headquartered in Bloomington, Indiana, purchased the hotel on April 13, 2005.  Casino resort  Pluto Spring Revitalization of the hotel in the early twenty-first century began after considerable campaigning by Orange County residents, the Cook Group, Boykin Lodging (the hotel‚Äôs owner), and Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, who lobbied the Indiana General Assembly to allow casino gambling in the area. Legislation was finally approved in 2003 and the required local referendum easily passed. The Indiana Gaming Commission granted the long-promised operating license for a riverboat casino to The Trump Organization, headed by businessman Donald Trump, but a variety of reasons caused the selection process to begin again. A partnership of business interests from within Indiana, including billionaire Bill Cook, submitted an application for a gambling license before purchasing the French Lick Springs Hotel from Boykin Lodging. The partnership was awarded the license during the summer of 2005. (Cook later bought out the partners after a legal dispute.) The French Lick Resort Casino complex includes the French Lick Springs Hotel, adjacent casino, and the nearby West Baden Springs Hotel. The French Lick hotel was restored as part of a $382 million project that included construction of the new casino. Refurbishments to the multi-structure French Lick hotel included updating its 443 guest rooms and restoration of the lobby, among other improvements. The renovated hotel and new casino complex opened together on November 3, 2006. The French Lick resort, which is located on approximately , includes the hotel, a casino, restaurants, boutique shops, a spa, and a conference center. Its recreational facilities offer guests swimming pools, three golf courses, a bowling alley, fitness center, stables for horses, and more than thirty miles of hiking trails.  Pluto Water  Antique bottle of Pluto Water French Lick's spring water, trademarked as Pluto Water, was served to guests at the hotel's Pluto Bar, just off the main entrance. The water was bottled at a plant across the street from the hotel for consumption on the property and for commercial distribution nationally and internationally. Pluto Water's slogan, \\"If Nature Won't, Pluto Will,\\" promoted its effectiveness as a laxative.  Notable guests  Chris Bundy, author of West Baden Springs: Legacy of Dreams, explained that in their heyday from the 1880s to the 1920s the resort hotels at French Lick and West Baden \\"were the Disney World of their time. In those days, it was assumed that if you could afford to come to America [for vacation], you would go to French Lick. It was that well-known overseas.\\" Over the years many of the country's rich and famous came as guests or gave performances at the resort. French Lick's visitors included moguls, movie stars, and entertainers such as John Barrymore, Howard Hughes, Lana Turner, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Hoagy Carmichael, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, and Louis Armstrong; noted politicians such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S Truman, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan; wealthy socialites, such as members of the Vanderbilt family; and numerous others.  Gambling  Although casino gambling at French Lick and West Baden Springs was illegal under Indiana law until the early 2000s, it flourished in the area from the early 1900s until the mid-1940s, during the Taggart family's management of the resort. Thomas Taggart disassociated himself with any connection to gambling establishments, but there were several casinos in operation within Orange County, including Ed Ballard's casino at West Baden Springs, Al Brown's casino at French Lick, and one named The Gorge, among several others.Fadely, p. 74. A two-story, wood-framed structure in the middle of the French Lick hotel's Japanese gardens may have been used as a casino in the early twentieth century, although the building was identified in promotional materials as a place for bowling and dice games.It is unclear what happened to the structure in later years. See Fadely, pp. 75‚Äì76, and Steelwater, pp. 62‚Äì63. Taggart denied any connections to illegal gambling operations.Fadely, pp. 74‚Äì76. In 1904 Indiana's Republican governor, Frank Hanly, instigated a raid at the hotel and seized its gambling equipment. The state brought suit against Taggart, French Lick's owner, and Lee Sinclair, owner of the West Baden Springs Hotel, but the court case bogged down when Hanley's Democratic successor, Thomas R. Marshall, became Indiana's governor in 1908 and the suit was dropped. After the raid, gambling operations moved offsite to Brown's hotel, across the street from the French Lick Hotel. Illegal gambling continued away from the resort until 1949, when Indiana's governor, Henry Schricker, succeeded in getting the authorities to raid illegal gambling operations at French Lick, and Brown's casino was finally closed.Steelwater, pp. 62‚Äì63.Fadely, p. 78. Legalized casino gambling came to French Lick in 2006, when the new French Lick Resort Casino opened as a part of the resort complex. Negro league baseball club: French Lick Plutos The French Lick Plutos were an independent Negro league baseball club from 1912 to 1914. Likely consisting for a large part of waiters at the resort, they had started off as a mixed team in 1908 but were all-Black the next year; their main rival was the team from the nearby West Baden Springs Hotel, the West Baden Sprudels. Games were played at the resort to amuse the spectators, but were fiercely competitive nonetheless. Negro league clubs including the Indianapolis ABCs would frequently come and play at French Lick. Historian Paul Debono notes the connection between African-American baseball players, employment, and local demographics: when the resorts in the area were booming, the owners needed laborers and frequently those were African-Americans from nearby Kentucky; the local African-American population increased greatly between 1880 and 1900, from one to 124, and in 1920 there were 325, of which over 100 \\"listed their occupation as waiter\\", followed by bell-boy and porter; 2/3 of the town's African-American population hailed from Kentucky. According to Debono, \\"the tradition of black baseball teams continued until the Great Depression, when most of the blacks at the resort lost their jobs\\". In the 1940s still, French Lick was a venue for spring training for professional baseball teams.  Golf  In the early twentieth century, when golf was beginning to gain popularity, the resort expanded its modest golf facilities. Around 1907 it is believed that Thomas Taggart hired Tom Bendelow to enlarge the Valley Course, the resort's first golf course, to an eighteen-hole course on . The course design, attributed to Bendelow, featured a combination of wooded hills and flat turf.Steelwater, p. 58. The one-story Valley clubhouse (circa 1915) was built during Taggart's tenure as the resort's owner. The painted brick, American Craftsman-style bungalow, which replaced an earlier building, is located northeast of the hotel's north wing. Caddies waited in the clubhouse's lower level for their turn to serve the course's patrons.Steelwater, pp. 30‚Äì33; 64. Around 1917 Donald Ross and his associates designed the eighteen -hole Hill Course, the resort's second golf course. Completed in 1920 on approximately , the championship course was located about from the hotel. At the time of its construction, the hilly terrain was modified to create challenges for golfers by varying elevations and adding hazards. The course hosted the PGA Championship tournament in 1924, which Walter Hagen won. The course's -story, wood-framed clubhouse with verandas along two sides was built in 1940 as a replacement for an earlier brick clubhouse. Its main floor was used for dining, socializing, equipment sales, and office space; the lower level contained locker rooms and rest rooms.Steelwater, pp. 33‚Äì36; 59‚Äì60.  Notable events  * Tomato juice is said to have been served for the first time at the hotel in 1917 when the chef Louis Perrin ran out of orange juice and needed an alternative. * When Taggart served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the hotel became its unofficial headquarters. In 1931, during a Democratic governors' conference held at the hotel, Franklin D. Roosevelt came to find support among its attendees in his bid to become the Democratic Party's nominee for U.S. president. * National conventions of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity were held at the hotel in 1940, 1953, and 1968. * Production of Pluto Water ceased in 1971, after lithium, a natural occurrence in the water, became classified as a controlled substance used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.  Recognition  * The French Lick Springs Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. * The National Trust for Historic Preservation has included the hotel in its Historic Hotels of America program.

Bergelson, Markish and Hofstein were later executed on Joseph Stalin's orders during the Night of the Murdered Poets, in 1952. Artists like Ryback and Lissitzky who were members of the group tried to develop a distinctively Jewish form of modernism in which abstract forms would be used as a means of expressing and disseminating popular culture. The manifesto of the group, published in November 1919, stated: :\\"The goal of the Kulturlige is to assist in creating a new Yiddish secular culture in the Yiddish language, in Jewish national forms, with the living forces of the broad Jewish masses, in the spirit of the working man and in harmony with their ideals of the future.\\"Victor Margolin, \\"The struggle for utopia: Rodchenko, Lissitzky, Moholy-Nagy, 1917-1946\\", University of Chicago Press, 1997, p. 27, It also listed the \\"three pillars\\" of the Kultur Lige as Yiddish education for the people, Yiddish literature, and Jewish art.Benjamin Harshav, \\"The Moscow Yiddish Theater: art on stage in the time of revolution\\", Yale University Press, 2008, p. 6, In 1919 members of the group, Victor Alter and Henryk Berlewi, organized a major exhibition of Polish-Jewish art in Bia≈Çystok under the name \\"First Exhibition of Jewish Painting and Sculpture\\". The exhibition was targeted at the Yiddish speaking Jewish community, as well as the Polish workers of the city. During the same year, the organization helped to sponsor sixty three Yiddish schools, fifty four libraries and many other cultural and educational institutions.David E. Fishman, \\"The rise of modern Yiddish culture\\", Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2005, p. 83, In 1920 the Kiev branch of the organization was taken over by the Bolsheviks and the Jewish section of the Soviet Communist party, Yevsektsiya, and subjected to the bureaucracy of the Soviet state. Its printing presses were taken away, it was denied paper for publishing and its central committee was forcefully disbanded. As a result, the Warsaw branch became the main center for the organization. Afterward, the remains of the Kultur Lige in the Soviet Union continued under the auspices of the Yevsektsiya as a publishing house, mostly focusing on Yiddish textbooks for children. In Poland, the League established offices in other cities such as Wilno and ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In 1924, it began to issue the Literarishe Bleter magazine (based on the Polish Wiadomosci Literackie) (Literature News) which became the main forum for discussions by the Yiddish intelligentsia on subjects of art, literature and theater.

Later Portuguese genealogy records indicate that his father could have been a Fern√£o Rodrigues Alardo, the main alcaide of Leiria and √ìbidos. These differences are perhaps attributable to the efforts of subsequent genealogists to \\"Christianise\\" his ancestral lines, however no evidence is found to conclusively support or disprove this attribution. Life in England Born in about 1440, to the Portuguese Jewish community, Duarte emigrated to England during the late 1450s. In order to be accepted at court, he converted to Catholic Christianity, with King Edward IV standing as his sponsor. Upon his conversion he adopted the English name of Edward Brampton in honour of his Sponsors. Brampton was an adventurer, soldier, and ship's commander, who and fought in several engagements during the War of the Roses, including the Battle of Tewkesbury, and was eventually awarded the position of Governor of Guernsey. With the help of his wife Lady Margaret Brampton, he won favours in both the Portuguese and English royal courts and was knighted in August 1484 by Richard III. Following the defeat of Richard III, Brampton left England for the court of Margaret of Burgundy, where it is presumed he met Perkin Warbeck, a pretender to the throne of England, who he later employed. From his marriage to Lady Margaret Beaumont, he had six children: Jo√£o, Jorge, Henrique, Isabel, Maria and Joana.

A practiced theory in response to the ever changing needs of the public and how institutions and administrations go about solving them. Focus is on the role of government and how it can provide these services to citizens who are a part of the public interest, by means of, but not limited to, public policy.  History  New Public Administration traces its origins to the first Minnowbrook Conference held in 1968 under the patronage of Dwight Waldo. This conference brought together the top scholars in public administration and management to discuss and reflect on the state of the field and its future.O'Leary, Rosemary. & Slyke, David M. Van. & Kim, Soonhee. The Future of Public Administration around the World: The Minnowbrook Perspective. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2010. The 1960s in the USA was a time of unusual social and political turbulence and upheaval. In this context, Waldo concluded that neither the study nor the practice of public administration was responding suitably to the escalating turmoil and the complications that arose from those conditions. Part of the reasoning for this Waldo argued, was the general mistrust that had become associated with public administration itself. A call to revamp the ethical obligations of the service sector was necessary in rebuilding the public's trust of government and bureaucracy in which had been plagued by corruption and the narrow self interests of others. Moving toward a more ethical public service, then, required attention to the underlying values that support public service-and public servants-in any sector. The new public management(npm) did not offer public servants an alternative model to help them resolve emerging conflicts and tensions. Concepts of citizenship, democracy or public interest have evolved over time and they are continuing to evolve. Consequently, the role of government and the role of the public service are being transformed in ways that push beyond the constraints of the Classic model he lenses of varying perspectives can challenge, clarify, and create a history that boasts enough depth to serve as not only a history in a traditional sense but also an interactive timeline that ignites constant improvement. At its core, public service requires a vision that extends beyond narrow self-interest. Waldo sees public administration and bureaucracy as integrally bound to civilization and to our culture in two senses: the evolution of civilization itself was dependent upon public administration and related concepts are constitutive elements within out specific civilization and culture. New Public Administration theory deals with the following issues: * Democratic citizenship; Refers directly to the belief in creating a government where the \\"common man\\" has a voice in politics. For such an approach to work, citizens must become aware, knowledgeable, and active in their communities and nations. True democratic citizenship requires more than voting for representatives. It requires using one's own mind, voice, and actions. * Public interest; Refers to the collective common good within society, to which is the main objective of public interest. * Public policy; The means by which new public policy is enacted, and introduced. Not limited in participation of the public but encouraged involvement. *Services to citizens; Providing and upholding the moral and ethical standard in regards to meeting the needs of citizens through institutions and bureaucracies. First, a ‚Äònew‚Äô theory should start with the ideal of democratic citizenship. The public service derives its true meaning from its mandate to serve citizens to advance the public good. This is the raison d‚Äô√™tre of the institution, the source of motivation and pride of all those who choose to make it their life, whether for a season or for an entire career.  Main Features of new public administration  These are: # Responsiveness: The administration should bring about certain internal as well as external changes so that public administration could be made more relevant to the social, economic, political and technological environment. For this to happen the administration has to be more flexible and adaptable to the various changes. # Client Centricity: this means that the effectiveness of the administrator should be judged not only from the point of view of the government, but from that of the citizens. If the administrative actions did not improve the quality of life of citizens then they are not effective notwithstanding whatsoever rationality and efficiency they may have. # Structural Changes in Administration: the new public administration approach calls for small, flexible and less hierarchical structures In administration so that the citizens administration interface could become more flexible and comfortable. The organizational structure should be in with the socially relevant conditions. # Multi-disciplinary Nature of Public Administration: knowledge from several disciplines and not just one dominating paradigm build the discipline of public administration. The political, social, economic, management and human relation approaches are needed to ensure the growth of discipline. # Politics-Administration Dichotomy: since administrators today are involved in policy formulation and policy implementation at all the stages. Dichotomy meaning \\"a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different\\". # Awareness: Bring attention to the works of a public administration and the task that public administrators carry out for the community and for the government. Jobs of public administrators affect communities and large numbers of people. The importance of the job should be highlighted. # Case Studies: Case studies help public administrators highlight situations and events where policies were not carried out as they should be. They set an example for what to do and what not to do. Case studies are a basic way to break down events in order to learn from other people‚Äôs mistakes and the affects those mistakes have had on the community. With public administration being a job devoted to the people; it is an obvious way to see the reality of the work you do in the community. While there are many cases where policies were not carried out as planned. There are also plenty of examples of executed policies that have benefited communities, and those are important to look at as well. # Structure Change: Public Administration is moving in many different directions, it is more often called Public Management now. This is because the job is moving towards a direction of not only implementing policy to people but also managing policies as it trickles down through the law process, so that it is realistic for communities and the people in them. # Jack of All Trades: the best public administrators tend to be someone who has knowledge in politics and law, but also has a hand in community functions. This allows for a smooth transition from policy to implementation. # Change: With the changes in the world, the job of public administration has changed. The job may be the same, but titles like Public Manager and Public Adviser have replaced the title Public Administrator.  Themes  #Relevance: Traditional public administration has too little interest in contemporary problems and issues. Social realities must be taken into consideration. i.e. people should see changes as relevant meaning thereby that changes should be specific to the needs of the area and the need of the people. Earlier approaches to NPA considered that rationality of the people was neglected. NPA suggests the inclusion of rationality of the people too in the process of policy formulation. #Values: Value-neutrality in public administration is an impossibility. The values being served through administrative action must be transparent. To practice transparency in public administration is to ensure citizens the availability of information which is deemed public. This should be an organizational goal, and is to be taken into account when conducting all public business regardless of one‚Äôs job title. If the goal of an organization is to serve the citizens to the best of their ability, then avoiding or failing to achieve transparency would cause significant damage to the relationship between them and the people they are aiming to serve. #Social Equity: Realization of social equity should be a chief goal of public administration. #Change: Skepticism toward the deeply rooted powers invested in permanent institutions and the status quo. Operational flexibility and organisational adaptability to meet the environmental changes should be in-built in the administrative system. #Client Focus: Positive, proactive, and responsive administrators rather than inaccessible and authoritarian \\"ivory tower\\" bureaucrats. #Management-Worker relations. There should be equal emphasis both on efficiency and humane considerations. The new approach has to satisfy both the efficiency and the human relations criterion in order to achieve success. NPA provides solutions for achieving these goals, popularly called 4 D's i.e. Decentralisation, Debureaucratisation, Delegation and Democratisation.  Criticism  Though New Public Administration brought public administration closer to political science, it was criticized as anti-theoretic and anti-management. Robert T. Golembiewski describes it as radicalism in words and status quo in skills and technologies. Further, it must be counted as only a cruel reminder of the gap in the field between aspiration and performance. Golembiewski considers it as a temporary and transitional phenomena. In other words, we can say that the solutions for achieving the goals and anti-goals were not provided by the NPA scholars explicitly. Secondly, how much one should decentralize or delegate or debureaucratize or democratize in order to achieve the goals? On this front NPA is totally silent. As said in A New Synthesis of Public Administration, governments have always been called upon to make difficult decisions, undertake complicated initiatives and face complex problems characteristical of the period. This is not in dispute. Nonetheless, the current circumstances is to determine what can be handled in the traditional way and what must be done differently. Governments have always been called upon to face difficult problems. Setting priorities and making choices have always been difficult. For example, eliminating a sizable deficit is ‚Äúmerely‚Äù a difficult problem, although it is hard to believe when one is in the middle of such a heart- wrenching exercise. This entails making choices among equally deserving public purposes and making tough decisions about what should be preserved for the future. It requires reconciling future needs with what could garner a sufficient degree of public support in the short term to move forward. Academic public administration has lagged considerably behind practicing public administration. Improved curricula and a refocusing of emphasis upon the policy dynamics of government administration will be important factors in enticing more students to study of public administration. It is more important to increase the number and improving the geographic spread of universities with public affairs programs, integrating public affairs components into the curricula of other graduate and professional programs, developing many more in-service, mid-career educational programs for public servants, and utilizing existing resources to strengthen public affairs programs. The motives behind the promotion of New Public Administration is also in question in the case of Hong Kong. As Anthony Cheung argues, officials often employed the rhetoric of New Public Administration to roll back public expenditure and decrease welfare provision in the 1990s. Governors at that time used the excuse of administrative efficiency to curtail the power of the bureaucracy.  Significance  Felix and Lloyd Nigro observe that New Public Administration has seriously jolted the traditional concepts and outlook of the discipline and enriched the subject by imparting a wider perspective by linking it closely to the society. The overall focus in NPA movement seems to be to make administration to be less \\"generic\\" and more \\"public\\", less \\"descriptive\\" and more \\"prescriptive\\", less \\"institution-oriented\\" and more \\"client-oriented\\", less \\"neutral\\" and more \\"normative\\" but should be no less scientific all the same. *  References  * Category:Public administration ","title":"New Public Administration"},{"id":"24547582","text":"Jo√£o Soares Almeida Filho (born 15 February 1954) is a former Brazilian footballer.

John Thomas Rees was born 14 November 1857 at Llwynbedw. The son of Thomas and Hannah (n√©e Morgan) Rees, he began working as a mine pit boy at age nine. During the time he worked in the mines, Rees studied the Tonic-Solfa system, earning an advanced certificate. Rees also taught music while he was a colliery worker; one of his pupils was Daniel Protheroe. Rees worked in the mines until the age of twenty-one; at that time, he gained some notability as the composer of a cantata he entered into a Treherbert eisteddfod competition. A small fund was established by Rees' friends for his studies at Aberystwyth with Joseph Parry. When these funds ran low, Rees was faced with the possibility of leaving the university until David Jenkins arranged for him to teach Solfa classes in Pen-y-garn. Rees travelled to Emporia, Kansas in 1882; he then entered the University of Toronto, where he received a Bachelor of Music degree in 1889. Rees later held a teaching position at the university while he again visited North America. Rees settled in Pen-y-Garn; he married Elizabeth Davies there in 1881. He taught adult music classes, conducted local choirs, was a part-time music teacher in nearby Tregaron and a part-time lecturer at University of Wales, Aberystwyth. While teaching at Pen-y-garn, Rees continued composing. His composition for string quartet won the top prize at the national eisteddfod at Aberdare, with the judges declaring it to be the best composition ever submitted there. He again won first prize at a national competition for the best musical arrangement of a Psalm for orchestra, soli and chorus. Rees also edited various collections of hymns and songs. He died on 14 October 1949.

Life He was born in Lancashire, and entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1571. There he was elected fellow in 1573, graduated B.A. on 10 December 1574, M.A. on 29 January 1578, and B.D. on 4 July 1586. He took holy orders, and was known as a preacher at Oxford and elsewhere. On 24 July 1584 he asked the university authorities for a preaching licence, to enable him to preach at St. Paul's Cross. In 1586 he was presented by Bishop William Chaderton to the rectory of Standish, near Wigan, Lancashire, which he held till his death. He was made a justice of the peace, and led an active public life. He was also chaplain to Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby, and often preached before his patron. Soon after the accession of James I he preached before the court, and the king appointed him tutor to his eldest son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. In June 1608 Lord Chancellor Egerton gave him the mastership of Ewelme Hospital, Oxfordshire; this sinecure position was made from 1617 to support the Oxford Professor of Physic,http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40209 but the transition was the tenure of his successor William White from 1611 to 1628., at p. 2. As a parish priest he continued the restoration of the church, which was begun by his predecessor, and gave an oak pulpit in 1616. He died on 26 November 1639, aged 89, and was buried in the chancel of Standish Church, where there is a brass, with Latin inscription, to his memory.

Between 1920 and 1948, he held the Beit Professorship of Colonial History at the University of Oxford. Coupland is known for his scholarship on African history, and as a member of the 1936‚Äì1937 Royal Commission on Palestine. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1948. Life He was the son of Sidney Coupland, a physician at Middlesex Hospital, and his wife Bessie Potter, daughter of Thomas Potter of Great Bedwin, born in London. He was educated at Winchester College, and went on New College, Oxford, where he was taught by Alfred Zimmern, among others. He graduated in 1907, with a first class in Greats. That year he was elected a Fellow at Trinity College where he lectured in ancient history. Under the influence of Lionel Curtis, Beit lecturer in colonial history 1912‚Äì1913, Coupland joined the Round Table movement, and succeeded Curtis as Beit lecturer. He became Beit Professor in 1920, succeeding Hugh Edward Egerton, despite a lack of finished work in print. The choice is accounted for by the electors' wish to have a \\"first-class mind\\" rather than a scholarly specialist. With Curtis, Coupland tried to set up an African institution in Rhodes House in the early 1930s; but they were unsuccessful in getting funding. From 1938 to 1943 Coupland assisted Lord Lugard and Hanns Vischer with the running of the International African Institute.Sir Reginald Coupland, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, Vol. 23, No. 1 (Jan., 1953), p. 1. Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International African Institute Coupland took part in the Cripps Mission of 1942 to Indian leaders. His diary of 1941‚Äì1942 is a significant source for the activities and thinking of Sir Stafford Cripps. It also discusses the Indian political groups. He was closely involved with Graham Spry in contradicting the account published by Louis Fischer in The Nation of political undertakings given by Cripps to Abul Kalam Azad, Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1944 Coupland became a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. He retired from the Beit Chair in 1948, which went to Vincent Harlow. He became a Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford in 1952, dying later that year in Southampton, bound for South Africa. He did not marry. Reputation Coupland wrote about abolitionism in his books Wilberforce and The British Anti-slavery Movement. Eric Williams objected to Coupland's account of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, for the way it was used to justify the contemporary domination of the British Empire. Coupland was one of the examiners of the 1938 Oxford D.Phil. dissertation by Williams written under Victor Harlow, on a topic suggested by C. L. R. James. It was \\"deferential\\" in comparison with the 1944 published version, the book Capitalism and Slavery, which relied on economic reasoning going back to Lowell Joseph Ragatz, to whom it was dedicated. Williams made a number of points directly criticising Coupland in Capitalism and Slavery, including: * From the \\"Conclusion\\": \\"But historians, writing a hundred years after, have no excuse for continuing to wrap the real interests in confusion.\\" Footnoted as: \\"Of this deplorable tendency Professor Coupland of Oxford University is a notable example.\\" * \\"Professor Coupland contends that behind the legal judgement lay the moral judgement, and that the Somersett case was the beginning of the end of slavery throughout the British Empire. This is merely poetic sentimentality translated into modern history.\\" The Oxford History of the British Empire considers that Coupland had a \\"distinguished career\\", but that this attack by Williams \\"clouded\\" its later part.

It was directed by Natasa Urban and Lucian Muntean (aka Lunam Docs), a Serbian independent documentary production duo specializing in telling the stories of working children. Synopsis The child's voice of nine‚Äìyear‚Äìold Punam Tamang transports us to the Nepal city of Bhaktapur. There we are presented with a stark description of the hard life of this young girl and the dismal social conditions in which she lives. Punam's mother died when she was only five. She was left with her father, her newborn sister Rabina and her two‚Äìyear‚Äìold brother Krishna. The Tamang children see little of their father because he works from sunrise to sundown in a rice factory, in order to earn enough money for their school fees (US$1.50 per month/student), and so during the daytime Punam assumes the roles of head of the family, caregiver and homemaker. The film also takes us into the world of Punam's friends whose families do not make enough money to afford the school fee. Instead of studying, these children have to work in a stone quarry or brick‚Äìmaking factory to help their families get by. The film captures the hard work the children are required to perform and also takes a peek into the poor five‚Äìgrade school that represents Punam's symbol of hope. She believes that education ushers in progress and is the only opportunity for improving their situation ‚Äì perhaps bringing about new job opportunities in better conditions. We look at the situation through the eyes of this young Asian girl, who dreams of becoming a teacher and helping other children in situations like hers. Activism The PUNAM FUND, a non-profit organisation, founded by Natasa Urban and Lucian Muntean, was established in September 2007 as a result of the enormous positive feedback regarding the documentary film Punam, which inspired people from all over the world to help the children presented in the film. The PUNAM FUND is dedicated to the elimination of and fight against child labour. For the time being, the activities of the PUNAM FUND are aimed at the children featured in the films Punam and Journey of a Red Fridge. Its main goal is to reduce the number of illiterate working children by providing scholarships for the children who work in stone quarries, brick kilns and carpet factories in the Bhaktapur region and for child porters working in Himalayan Mountains of Nepal.

Since then, Punam has been screened at more than 50 international festivals and received 8 awards, one of them the UNICEF Award for Children Rights. In 2006, Punam was voted the most popular film among teachers in the Czech Republic. Punam was offered, for educational purposes, to more than 250 primary and secondary schools. About 10,000 children had the opportunity to view the documentary film Punam and debate on child labour issues. What is more, Human Rights Watch included it into its High School Program in the United States. On 10 December 2006, on the occasion of the International Human Rights Day, Punam was screened at the UN Headquarters in New York City. Punam was released on DVD in March 2009. Sequel In March 2009, Natasa Urban and Lucian Muntean (Lunam Docs) returned to Bhaktapur, Nepal for the shooting of Punam sequel.

The Zuma Must Fall campaign, whose organisers included members of the DA, EFF, African People's Convention and United Democratic Movement planned further demonstrations in the days leading up to Zuma's birthday. 50,000 South Africans, many of whom were black, expressed their anger at corruption within the ANC government, unfair trade deals by the government that favoured the powerful Gupta family, and economic problems that had resulted in the downgrading of South Africa's credit rating. More demonstrations occurred from April 12 onwards, with Julius Malema addressing the crowd in Pretoria before they marched on the Union buildings.

Born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, Disch has dedicated particular focus to regional renewable and sustainable energy. As head of his own architecture firm, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture, Disch is committed to advance Germany's usage of solar energy in respect to residential, retail and commercial building and design. In 1994, Rolf Disch built the Heliotrope in Freiburg which was the world‚Äôs first home to create more energy than it uses, as it physically rotates with the sun to maximize its solar intake. Disch then developed the concept PlusEnergy, simply making it a permanent goal for his buildings to produce more energy than they consume in order to sell the surplus solar energy back into the grid for profit. Rolf Disch‚Äôs biggest venture was completed in 2004 with the 59 PlusEnergy home Solar Settlement and the . PlusEnergy Sun Ship. In June 2009, Disch launched the 100% GmbH organization, with the aim to make Freiburg and its surrounding district the first 100% sustainable renewable energy region in the world. Biography=Early years Rolf Disch was born in Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany in 1944. Disch first studied cabinetmaking in 1958 until later switching to masonry in 1961. In 1962 he enrolled at the Structural Engineering School in Freiburg as a structural engineer. Disch knew he was passionate about building, although he found his true heart lied in architecture and after only one year, in 1963, he transferred as an architect to the University of Applied Sciences in Konstanz, Germany. After his graduation in 1967 Disch worked as an architect for two years and established his own firm in 1969, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture. Activism Rolf Disch became an environmental activist during the protest against the construction of a nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. As an educated environmentalist Disch saw this form of energy as destructive, seeking renewable energy as an alternative to achieve sustainable development. The protesters in Wyhl succeeded and the nuclear power plant was never built which fueled the anti- nuclear movement. This success in mind, Disch applied his architectural knowledge to the advancement of renewable and sustainable energy systems in building. The ‚ÄúDisch Design‚Äù was a concept he worked on from 1985 to 1988 building solar powered vessels of all sorts. During this period, in 1987, Disch raced a self-designed solar powered automobile in the World Solar Challenge, a race using only solar powered vehicles from Darwin, Australia to Adelaide, Australia. Disch cofounded three organizations promoting the use of renewable energy: Energie in B√ºrgerhand (Energy in citizens‚Äô hands), 100% GmbH and FESA ‚Äì F√∂rderverein Energie- und Solaragentur Regio Freiburg (Development association for energy and solar businesses in the Freiburg region). Disch is an active member of the associations Eurosolar, Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Sonnenenergie (German society for solar energy), Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.(German sustainable building council). Rolf Disch and his team during the World Solar Challenge race in Australia in 1987. Built with the Sun With a focus on solar power use in his designs, in 1993 Disch started an initiative to make Sport-Club Freiburg the first solar soccer team in Germany with photovoltaic panels to power their stadium. Together with Coach Volker Finke, the Dreisam stadium in Freiburg was the first soccer stadium in Germany to install solar power. In 1995 Disch designed the Heliotrope building, a house that physically rotates with the sun to maximize sunlight and natural heat use. The Heliotrope was the first building worldwide to have a positive energy balance, meaning it generates more energy than it consumes. Different types of renewable and sustainable energy concepts in addition to solar power are used in the original Heliotrope, built in Freiburg‚Äôs Vauban quarter. It was the first of three such structures to be built in Germany. After the design of the Heliotrope Disch has been promoting the use of Energy-plus-houses. His office Rolf Disch Solar Architecture is using the brand name PlusEnergy to describe these structures which produce more energy from renewable energy sources, over the course of a year, than they import from external sources.http://www.rolfdisch.de It has designed several such buildings since, including the residential project Solar Settlement.

Led by solar pioneer Rolf Disch, who has been building with the sun for more than 40 years, this architecture office's prolific portfolio also includes such successful projects as the Solar Settlement and the Sun Ship. As winners of the 2002 European Solar Prize and the 2003 Global Energy Award these projects demonstrate the power of solar architecture; harness the sun both passively and actively. Lying at the base of the Black Forest, in the sunniest city in Germany, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture offers a premium design that exceeds the highest ecological standards while creating profitable opportunities for their investors. Background Led by Germany‚Äôs solar architecture pioneer Rolf Disch, this architecture firm has built with the sun as its foundation since 1969. Rolf Disch Solar Architecture has implemented the most up-to-date technology to design sustainable buildings from churches and schools, to homes and commercial developments. With the creation of the PlusEnergy concept, their design has focused more and more specifically on positive energy balanced buildings, which generate more power than the consume through extremely efficient energy use and photovoltaic panel use. In 1994 they created the Heliotrope, the first building worldwide to create more energy than it uses. With the application of this PlusEnergy concept, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture further developed the concept into homes that use acute energy efficiency and have roofs made entirely of photovoltaic panels. 59 of these PlusEnergy homes were built as the Solar Settlement between 2002 and 2004, later to be followed by the Sun Ship. The Sun Ship, finished in 2006, is a retail, commercial/office and residential building with . that also produces more energy than it consumes. Also the first building of its kind worldwide, the Sun Ship was truly the most extensive example of sustainable and renewable energy building by Rolf Disch Solar Architecture. PlusEnergy PlusEnergy is a coined concept developed by Rolf Disch that indicates a structure's extreme energy efficiency so that it holds a positive energy balance, actually producing more energy than it uses. With the completion of his private residence, the Heliotrope, in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house in the world. The sheer logic of a home that creates more energy than it consumes made perfect sense to Disch. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space. As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications. PlusEnergy is a simple concept that has been materialized in a technical design. ‚ÄúPlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,‚Äù Disch claims.http://www.rolfdisch.de Disch believes that passive building isn't enough because passive homes still emit CO2 into the atmosphere ‚Äì we can solar activate our homes! Heliotrope Built originally in 1994 as the private residence and special project of Rolf Disch, the Heliotrope is a one-of-a-kind design. The Heliotrope in Freiburg was the first building in the world to create more energy than it uses, of which is entirely renewable, emissions free and CO2 neutral. The structure physically rotates to track the sun, which allows it to harness the maximum natural sunlight and warmth possible from the sun. Several different energy generation modules are used in the building including a dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel, a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar-thermal balcony railing to provide heat and warm water. These innovations in combination with the superior insulation of the residence allow the Heliotrope to produce anywhere between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year. The Heliotrope is also fitted with a grey-water cleansing system and built-in natural waste composting. After the success of Freiburg's Heliotrope, Hansgrohe contracted Rolf Disch Solar Architecture to design and built another Heliotrope to be used as a visitor's center and showroom in Offenburg, Germany. A third Heliotrope was then contracted and built in Hilpoltstein, Bavaria to be used as a technical dental laboratory. Disch's unique design accommodates different utilization from private residences to laboratories, all the while maintaining the structure's positive energy balance. In addition to the original Heliotrope design, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture has drawn plans for larger versions of the project to be built as rotating hotels, which give every guest a beautiful view, as well as administrative buildings and even an exhibition pavilion for the EXPO 2010 in Shanghai. File: Heliotrop_Freiburg.jpgHeliotrope in Freiburg File: LuftHeliotrop.JPGBird's eye view of the Heliotrope in Freiburg File: Heliotrophotel_ansicht.jpgHeliotrope-Hotel Schloss Waretenstein Solar Settlement With the success of the Heliotrope, Rolf Disch Solar Architecture wanted to apply their PlusEnergy concept to mass residential production. The new design for the PlusEnergy house gave way to the development of the Solar Settlement, a 50 PlusEnergy home housing community. This residential complex won such awards as 2002 House of the Year, 2002 residential PV solar integration award, 2006 Germany's most beautiful housing community. It is the first housing community in the world in which all the homes produce a positive energy balance and which is emissions-free and CO2 neutral. Built between 2000 and 2005 in the Vauban quarter of Freiburg, the Solar Settlement has proved Disch's vision of a ‚Äúfundamental environmental imperative‚Äù as these homes have exhibited more than 8 years of full occupancy and each produced more than 4,000 Euros ($5,600) each year. The design of each home offers maximum energy efficiency and turns energy bills into energy income. Rolf Disch Solar Architecture considers the image such a community exhibits is equally as important as the eco-savings it brings. The tenants at the Solar Settlement do not claim to have made any compromises in their living situations but rather that they have both environmentally and economically improved. Made from Black Forest timber, the wood interior and natural lighting provide for happily lit spaces and a natural flow from room to room. Sun Ship Rolf Disch Solar Architecture then morphed the PlusEnergy design concept into a large integrated office/retail building. The Sun Ship, located directly next to the Solar Settlement in Freiburg, uses its . for retail, commercial and residential space. The Sun Ship houses a supermarket, convenience store and bakery-caf√© on the first floor, offices and work spaces on the 2-4 floors and 9 penthouses on its roof. As a whole, this building produces more energy than it consumes per year and utilizes the most up-to- date building technology. Some aspects that make this building particularly unique are its vacuum insulated walls, ventilation with 95% heat recovery, triple paned windows and its energy fa√ßade. As the first positive energy office building worldwide, the Sun Ship exhibits not only extreme efficiency but also a warm environment to work in. The office spaces are flanked on both the North and South ends entirely with windows, which maximizes natural sunlight, employee views and minimizes the energy wasted by artificial light. In addition to the office and retail space, two conference rooms, one large and one small, provide space for lectures, meetings and as a showroom. Community Planning Community planning goes hand in hand with sustainable development and thus Rolf Disch Solar Architecture dedicates much if their design and planning to the symbiosis of their projects surroundings. A solar community generates identification and an enormous public image. Disch says he attracts great tenants, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his design. Rolf Disch Solar Architecture always aims to create a community with combined uses for an ecological urban planning concept like traffic management ‚Äì with wide, attractive walkways, bike routes and connections to public transportation. At the Solar Settlement for example, tenants and owners incorporate bike- and car-sharing and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections. Rolf Disch Solar Architecture also has incorporated community solutions for energy. For example, a biomass cogeneration unit is extremely expedient, which meets the (reduced) additional heating demands for his PlusEnergy homes.

James Hadley (August 1837 - 23 December 1903) was an English potter and artist associated with the Worcester Royal Porcelain Company.http://www.antique-marks.com/james- hadley.html Until 1895 his work was produced almost exclusively by Royal Worcester; he later set up his own factory. Life In the 1850s Hadley was apprenticed to Kerr and Binns of Worcester, proprietors of the Royal Worcester porcelain factory, where he worked in the modelling department. By 1870 he had become principal modeller there. In 1875, he left the company and set up his own modelling studio in Worcester High Street. Although no longer directly employed by Royal Worcester he sold almost his complete output of models for ornamental vases and figures to them. He has been described by John Sandon as \\"probably the finest English modeller of all time\\"Sandon 1993, p.123 Able to work in any form or style required, he is best known for his decorative figures, made in the 1870s and 1880s, when taste was shifting towards coloured models from the previous fashion for plain white Parian Ware. One of his most famous works was the \\"Aesthetic Teapot\\", modelled for Worcester after a design by R.W. Binns. Satirising Oscar Wilde and the aesthetic movement, it is formed as a soulful young man wearing a sunflower on one side, and lovelorn maiden with lily on the other; despite its sculptural form, it still functioned as a teapot. Hadley's contract to supply models to Royal Worcester was ended in November 1895 due to a decline in the luxury end of the market. For a while he rented some factory space at Shrub Hill, Worcester from Edward Locke, with whom he had worked at Royal Worcester . Then, in 1897, with the support of business partner Frank Littledale, Hadley set up a factory at Diglis Road in the city on land owned by his family. In 1900 Hadley & Sons became a limited company with the shares owned by Hadley and his four sons, and by Frank Littledale. Hadley died in 1903. In June 1905 Royal Worcester purchased his factory. Production of his wares was transferred to main site in Severn Street, Worcester, the next year.

Biography  He was born to an aristocratic family. His first art lessons came from a Piedmontese artist named Matthieu Ricco in Neuch√¢tel. Later, he studied with and Abraham Girardet. He originally intended to pursue a diplomatic career and studied law in Berlin, but continued his studies with the landscape painter, Janus Genelli. He returned home in 1803 and took a position with the Department of Foreign Affairs, but gave it up in 1808 to go to Paris. There he studied the Baroque art of Claude Lorrain und Nicolas Poussin. The following year, he and his friend, Gabriel Lory visited Italy. Once again home, in 1812, he began organizing a project to establish a \\"National Museum\\", setting up a subscription campaign, petitioning the legislature to provide a building, and donating some of his own works to start the collection. He spent 1818 and 1819 in the Bernese Highlands to paint mountain landscapes. In 1822, he held a showing at the Salon in Paris. The following year. he was elected to the Grand Conseil (legislature) of the Canton of Neuch√¢tel. In 1824, he participated in an exhibition at the Academy of Arts, Berlin, where some of his works were bought by King Friedrich Wilhelm. In 1825, he became an honorary member of the Academy, but declined the offer of a professorship. In 1826, he organized the first exhibition of \\"objets d‚Äôart et d‚Äôindustrie\\", which would be held again in 1828 and 1830. Following the suicide of Louis L√©opold Robert (whom he had been financially supporting) in 1835, he organized a major retrospective of Robert's works. Depressed after his eldest son, Maximilien, died unexpectedly, he gave up painting until 1842, when he did some sketching in Italy. He never went back to his previous habits, however, and spent the remainder of his life primarily involved in organizing exhibitions and promoting local artists.

History Gymnastics in Australia is thought to have originated in the early 20th century by eastern European immigrants. It wasn't until after World War I when Australia was in the Great Depression that people started turning to organisations like the YWCA for support. From these community-based groups, the sport started to flourish. Around the same time, gymnastics was included in the school curriculum at Geelong Grammar, Wesley College and Carey Grammar. Australians participated in the sport for the first time at an Olympic Games at the Melbourne Games in Melbourne. The body was founded on 8 September 1949 as the Australian Gymnastic Federation. Affiliation was accepted by the Australian Olympic Federation in 1951 and by the International Federation of Gymnastics in 1954. In 1999, the AGF changed to its current name of Gymnastics Australia. Present day Gymnastics Australia runs a head office in Melbourne, Victoria, and is the representative body to FIG.

United Nations Human Rights Council. Retrieved 17 October 2009. The other co-authors of the Report were Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers. Israel refused to cooperate with the investigation, citing anti-Israel bias in the UNHRC and the mission's one- sided founding resolution. The Goldstone Report accused both the Israel Defense Forces and the Palestinian militants of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. It recommended that each side openly investigate its own conduct, and to bring the allegations to the International Criminal Court if they failed to do so. The government of Israel rejected the report as prejudiced and full of errors, and also sharply rejected the charge that it had a policy of deliberately targeting civilians.'Syria, Somalia can't preach morality' The Jerusalem Post 16 September 2009 The militant Islamic group Hamas initially rejected some of the report's findings, but then urged world powers to embrace it.Haniyeh: World must back Goldstone's Gaza report , Ma'an, 20 September 2009. Goldstone stated that the mission \\"wasn't an investigation, it was a fact-finding mission\\" and that the conclusion that war crimes had been committed \\"was always intended as conditional\\". He described the allegations as \\"a useful road map\\" for independent investigations by Israel and the Palestinians.Goldstone: 'If This Was a Court Of Law, There Would Have Been Nothing Proven.' , The Forward, 16 October 2009 He later added that the mission did not conduct a judicial investigation, and stated that its findings did not amount to \\"the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt\\". He described it as a prima facie case, \\"reasonable on weighing the evidence\\" and said that the information obtained would not be admissible as evidence in a criminal court.'Probe by Israel would stop UN push', JPost, 20 October 2009 The controversial report received wide support among countries in the United Nations, while Western countries were split between supporters and opponents of the resolutions endorsing the report.Israel debates response to Gaza report , BBC News 24 October 2009Britain criticised for opting out of UN vote condemning Israel , The Times 17 October 2009'Middle East Peace Process Faces Paralysis' , Sky News 18 October 2009Israel to UN body: Come to your senses on Goldstone Report , Haaretz 1 October 2009 Critics of the report stated that it contained methodological failings, legal and factual errors, and falsehoods, and devoted insufficient attention to the allegations that Hamas was deliberately operating in heavily populated areas of Gaza.2009 Human Rights Report: Israel and the occupied territories. US Department of State. March 11, 2010. On 1 April 2011, Goldstone retracted his claim that it was Israeli government policy to deliberately target citizens, saying \\"While the investigations published by the Israeli military and recognized in the U.N. committee's report have established the validity of some incidents that we investigated in cases involving individual soldiers, they also indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy.\\" On 14 April 2011 the three other co-authors of the Report, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers, released a joint statement criticizing Goldstone's recantation of this aspect of the report. They all agreed that the report was valid and that Israel and Hamas had failed to investigate alleged war crimes satisfactorily. Mandate of mission On 3 January 2009, in response to the Gaza War, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference's executive committee asked UNHRC to send a fact-finding mission to Gaza.'OIC initiated Goldstone inquiry' , Al Jazeera, 28 October 2009 On 12 January, UNHRC adopted Resolution S-9/1: : to dispatch an urgent, independent international fact-finding mission, to be appointed by the President of the Council, to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian people throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, due to the current aggression, and calls upon Israel not to obstruct the process of investigation and to fully cooperate with the mission. Mary Robinson, former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, was asked by UNHRC President Martin Uhomoibhi to lead the Mission but expressed disappointment with the mandate and refused to head the Mission for that reason. She stated that the UNHRC resolution was one-sided and \\"guided not by human rights but by politics\\". She later expressed full support for the report. Richard Goldstone initially refused the appointment for the same reason, calling the mandate \\"biased\\" and \\"uneven-handed\\". In January 2011, Goldstone said that UNHRC \\"repeatedly rush to pass condemnatory resolutions in the face of alleged violations of human rights law by Israel but fail to take similar action in the face of even more serious violations by other States. Until the Gaza Report they failed to condemn the firing of rockets and mortars at Israeli civilian centers\\". Following Goldstone's objection, the mandate was informally widened to cover activities by Palestinian militants as well, and the revised mandate, as quoted by the final report, became: : to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after. Speaking at Brandeis University, Goldstone noted that the widened mandate was presented by UNHRC President to a plenary session, where it did not encounter a single objection. He later described as \\"tiresome and inept\\" allegations made by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that the mandate had not been broadened to cover violations by all parties. Despite Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, UNHRC never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.Text of Resolution S-9/1 - the appointment of the mission followed the adoption on 12 January 2009 Mission members According to the mission's report, \\"The President appointed Justice Richard Goldstone, former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,RICHARD J.

The other three appointed members were: Christine Chinkin, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who took part in a fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun in 2008; Hina Jilani, Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and a member of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur in 2004; and Desmond Travers, a former colonel in the Irish Defence Forces and member of the Board of Directors of the Institute for International Criminal Investigations.\\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) applauded the selection of Goldstone to head the mission, saying, \\"Justice Goldstone's reputation for fairness and integrity is unmatched, and his investigation provides the best opportunity to address alleged violations by both Hamas and Israel.\\" Goldstone was a board member of HRW at that time, which HRW noted in its article. Gerald Steinberg of the Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor and journalist Melanie Phillips said that even though Goldstone resigned from HRW after the inquiry began, his impartiality was compromised by his link to an organization that accused Israel of war crimes.NGO Monitor: Gaza war probe tainted by anti-Israel ideology , Haaretz, 8 September 2009From Gulag Liberators to Saudi Retainers , NRO, 21 July 2009The Goldstone show-trial , Spectator, 11 September 2009 In March 2009, Goldstone, Travers and Jilani signed an open letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations Security Council, calling for those who perpetrated \\"gross violations of the laws of war\\", \\"gross violations of international humanitarian law\\" and \\"targeting of civilians\\" to be brought to account.

According to Western media reports, Hamas was very cooperative;UN's Gaza war crimes investigation faces obstacles , Associated Press, 6 September 2009. nevertheless, Goldstone pointed out that in some areas of information the committee did not receive full cooperation from the Palestinians.

Goldstone announced that the team would hold public hearings with the war's victims later in June, in Gaza and Geneva.

Israeli lawyer Charles Abelsohn criticized the objectivity of the committee members, citing Travers who said during the public hearings that \\"there have been instances of the shooting of children in front of their parents.

One of them was Muhammad Srour, a member of the Popular Committee Against the Wall in Nilin, who testified before the Mission in Geneva; en route back to West Bank he was arrested. After UN intervention, he was released.

Last accessed: 10 August 2009. Report On 15 September 2009, a 574-page report was released. The report concluded that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian militant groups had committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity. While the report condemned violations by both sides, it differentiated between the moral and legal severity of the violations of the Israeli forces compared to those of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. Accusations against Israel=Blockade of Gaza allegations The report stated that the blockade constituted a violation of Israel's obligations as an occupying power in Gaza.p. 276ff Civilian targeting allegations The report disputes Israel's claim that the Gaza war would have been conducted as a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, saying that at least in part the war was targeted against the \\"people of Gaza as a whole\\". Intimidation against the population was seen as an aim of the war. The report also says that Israel's military assault on Gaza was designed to \\"humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force upon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability\\". The report focused on 36 cases that it said constituted a representative sample. In 11 of these episodes, it said the Israeli military carried out direct attacks against civilians, including some in which civilians were shot \\"while they were trying to leave their homes to walk to a safer place, waving white flags\\". Talking to Bill Moyers Journal, Goldstone said that the committee chose 36 incidents that represented the highest death toll, where there seemed to be little or no military justification for what happened. According to the report, another alleged war crime committed by IDF include \\"wanton\\" destruction of food production, water and sewerage facilities; the report also asserts that some attacks, which were supposedly aimed to kill small number of combatants amidst significant numbers of civilians, were disproportionate. The report concluded that Israel violated the Fourth Geneva Convention by targeting civilians, which it labeled \\"a grave breach\\". It also claimed that the violations were \\"systematic and deliberate\\", which placed the blame in the first place on those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw the operations.Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict Para 1692. The report recommended, inter alia, that Israel pay reparations to Palestinians living in Gaza for property damage caused during the conflict.http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48448 \\"the Goldstone team has recommended that the 192-member General Assembly set up an escrow fund so that Israel can compensate the Palestinians of Gaza.\\" http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys- files/Guardian/documents/2009/09/15/UNFFMGCReport.pdf para 1665 Al-Maqadmah mosque incident The report stated that the strike on the al-Maqadmah mosque on the outskirts of Jabilyah occurred when between 200 and 300 men and women attended for their evening prayer, with 15 people being killed and 40 wounded as a result of the attack. The Mission has established that the Israeli armed forces fired a missile that struck near the doorway of the mosque. The Mission found that the mosque was damaged and lodged in its interior walls with \\"small metal cubes\\", several of which were retrieved by the Mission when it inspected the site. The Mission concluded that the mosque had been hit by an air-to- ground missile fitted with a shrapnel fragmentation sleeve, fired from an aircraft. The Mission based its findings on investigation of the site, photographs and interviewing witnesses. The Mission found no indications that the mosque was used to launch rockets, store munitions or shelter combatants. The Mission also found that no other damage was done in the area at the time, making the attack an isolated incident. The Mission concluded that the Israelis intentionally bombed the mosque. Judge Goldstone said: \\"Assuming that weapons were stored in the mosque, it would not be a war crime to bomb it at night... It would be a war crime to bomb it during the day when 350 people are praying.\\" He further added that there is no other possible interpretation for what could have occurred other than a deliberate targeting of civilians. The report also reproduces a statement from the Israeli government concerning the attack, where the Israeli government both denies that the mosque was attacked and states that the casualties of the attack were Hamas operatives. The report says that the position of the Israeli government contains \\"apparent contradictions\\" and is \\"unsatisfactory\\" and \\"demonstrably false\\". Zeitoun incident According to interviews with family members, neighbors, Palestinian Red Crescent personnel, submissions from various NGOs and visits to the site, the extended al-Samouni family gathered together in one house after the fighting in the area was over, ordered there by Israeli soldiers patrolling their Gaza neighborhood of Zeytoun as part of the ground phase of the Gaza War; when five men stepped out of the house to collect firewood, a missile struck them, fired, possibly, from an Apache helicopter; several more missiles followed, this time aimed directly at the house. In all, 21 family members were killed, including women and children. When the surviving al- Samounis attempted to leave and make their way to Gaza City, they were told by an Israeli soldier to return to the house. In April 2011, Goldstone wrote that the shelling of the home was apparently the consequence of an Israeli commander's erroneous interpretation of a drone image. Al-Fakhura school incident The report says that IDF's mortar shelling near a United Nations- run Al-Fakhura school in the Jabaliya refugee camp, which was sheltering some 1,300 people, killed 35 and wounded up to 40 people. The investigation did not exclude the possibility that Israeli forces were responding to fire from an armed Palestinian group, as Israel said, but said that this and similar attacks \\"cannot meet the test of what a reasonable commander would have determined to be an acceptable loss of civilian life for the military advantage sought\\". The mission criticized IDF for the choice of the weapons for the supposed counterstrike and concluded that the IDF fire at the Al- Fakhura street violated the law of proportionality.Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict , UNHCR report, 25 September 2009, para. 696‚Äì698, late submission In 2012 Israeli officials acknowledged that contrary to earlier claims, no rockets were fired from schools operated by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) during the Gaza war. Abd Rabbo family incident According to the Mission's report, the committee found Khaled and Kawthar Abd Rabbo to be credible and reliable witnesses and it had no reason to doubt the veracity of the main elements of their testimony, which it says is consistent with the accounts it received from other eyewitnesses and NGOs.Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict , UNHRC, 25 September 2009, para. 777 The report concludes that the Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at the family members, as they could not perceive any danger from the house, its occupants or the surroundings. The report bases its conclusion on the premise that the family, consisting of a man, a young and an elderly woman and three small girls, some of them waving white flags, stepped out of the house and stood still for several minutes waiting for instructions from the soldiers. White phosphorus allegations The report says that Israeli forces were \\"systematically reckless\\" in determining the use of white phosphorus in built- up areas.Page 21 of the HUMAN RIGHTS IN PALESTINE AND OTHER OCCUPIED ARAB TERRITORIES , Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict The writers highlighted the Israeli attack on the UN Relief and Works Agency compound in Gaza City on 15 January, the attack on the Al Quds hospital, and the attack on the Al Wafa hospital, each of which involved using white phosphorus. They described its use as disproportionate or excessive under international law. More generally, the UN report recommended that \\"serious consideration should be given to banning the use of white phosphorus in built-up areas\\". Human shields allegations The report also accused Israel of using Palestinians as \\"human shields\\" and torturing detainees. The human shields accusations were supported in 2010, with Israel charging two soldiers with forcing a 9-year-old Palestinian boy to open bags suspected of containing bombs. Accusations against Palestinian militants The report also stated there is evidence that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity by deliberately launching rockets and firing mortars into Israel, calculated to kill civilians and damage civilian structures. The report accused Palestinian armed groups of causing psychological trauma to the civilians within the range of the rockets. It also concluded that killings and abuses of members of the Fatah political movement amount to a \\"serious violation of human rights\\". The Mission, however, found no evidence of Palestinian armed groups placing civilians in areas where attacks were being launched; of engaging in combat in civilian dress; or of using a mosque for military purposes or to shield military activities. Para 1750. This statement contrasted with media reports that Hamas fighters wore civilian clothes and concealed their weapons. In March 2009, the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (Malam) published a report that included material supplied by the IDF and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) as part of an effort to counter the Goldstone Report. It included videos and photographs reportedly showing that \\"dozens of mosques that were used by Hamas to store weapons, functioned as command centers or whose grounds were used to fire rockets into Israel.\\" While discussing an obligation of Palestinian armed groups to protect the civilian population in Gaza, the report notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups. The Mission does not discount that the interviewees' reluctance may have stemmed from a fear of reprisals.Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict , para. 440 The report also criticized the treatment of captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and called for his release. Reactions=Israel The Israeli government issued an initial 32-point formal response to the fact-finding mission's report on 24 September 2009. The response listed a series of what it argued were serious flaws and biases in the report, finally concluding that the report perverts international law to serve a political agenda. (See below.) Also in October 2009, Israel pressured the Palestinian president to postpone asking for a UN vote on the Goldstone report. Yuval Diskin, head of the Israeli Shin Bet security service, met in Ramallah with President Mahmud Abbas and informed him that if Abbas refuses to ask to postpone the UN vote on the Goldstone report then Israel will turn the West Bank into a \\"second Gaza\\": the Shin Bet chief told Abbas that if he did not ask for a deferral of the vote, Israel would withdraw permission for mobile phone company Wataniya to operate in the Palestinian Authority and threatened to revoke the easing of restrictions on movement within the West Bank that had been implemented earlier in 2009.Haaretz, 17 January 2010, \\"Diskin to Abbas: Defer UN Vote on Goldstone or Face 'Second Gaza,'\\" http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1143038.html Israeli President Shimon Peres said the mission's report \\"makes a mockery of history\\". Israeli President Shimon Peres said that the report \\"makes a mockery of history\\" and that \\"it does not distinguish between the aggressor and the defender.

Hamas has used terrorism for years against Israeli children.\\" Peres also stated that \\"the report gives de facto legitimacy to terrorist initiatives and ignores the obligation and right of every country to defend itself, as the UN itself had clearly stated.\\" He added that the report \\"Failed to supply any other way for Hamas fire to stop. The IDF's operations have boosted the West Bank's economy, liberated Lebanon from Hezbollah terror and allowed Gazans to resume normalcy.

The main arguments in the analysis were the following. The analysis concludes that the report claims to represent international law but perverts it to serve a political agenda; that it sends a \\"legally unfounded message to states everywhere confronting terrorism that international law has no effective response to offer them\\", and that it signals to terrorist groups \\"that the cynical tactics of seeking to exploit civilian suffering for political ends actually pays dividends\\".Initial Response to Report of the Fact Finding Mission on Gaza , Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Palestinian National Authority Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Following the postponing of the vote on the resolution in UNHRC, the Palestinian National Authority came under heavy criticism for agreeing to defer the draft proposal endorsing all recommendations of the UN Fact Finding Mission.

Palestinian representative to the United Nations Ibrahim Khraishi called the report unbiased and professionally compiled.

Yael Stein, research director of B'Tselem, said that she does not accept the Goldstone conclusion of a systematic attack on civilian infrastructure, which she found unconvincing. At the same time, she urged to check out every incident and every policy by an independent body, because in her view the military cannot check itself and it has to be explained why so many people had been killed. The European Centre for Law and Justice (ECLJ) ‚Äì the international affiliate of the American Center for Law and Justice ‚Äì claimed in its analyses of the Report that among numerous flaws in it, the Mission misstated the International Humanitarian Law regarding the obligation of the fighters engaged in hostilities to distinguish themselves from the civilian population by uniform (perfidy violation per Article 37 of the Protocol I).Legal Memorandum in Opposition to Erroneous Allegations and Flawed Legal Conclusions Contained in the Goldstone Report , p. 46 of the report (p. 48 of the file), ECLJ, 26 January 2010.

It is time for Israel to demonstrate its own democratic strength.\\" The Economist (UK) denounced the report as \\"deeply flawed\\" and detrimental to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, arguing that it was tainted by anti-Israel prejudice in the UNHRC.

The Times (UK) criticized the report as \\"provocative bias\\" and described as dangerous and unreasonable the moral equivalence drawn in the report between Israel and Hamas.

WSJ wrote that the commission's members \\"were forced to make some astonishing claims of fact\\" in order to reach some of their conclusions. In particular, WSJ criticized the report's claim that the Gaza police force was a \\"civilian\\" agency and its inability to establish Palestinian use of mosques for military purposes despite evidence to the contrary. Military commentators Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, addressed the UNHRC in October 2009, speaking on behalf of UN Watch. He said that Hamas is \\"adept at staging and distorting incidents\\" and asserted that during the conflict the Israel Defense Forces \\"did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare\\" and that Palestinian civilian casualties were a consequence of Hamas' way of fighting, which involved using human shields as a matter of policy, and deliberate attempts to sacrifice their own civilians. He added that Israel took extraordinary measures to give Gaza civilians notice of targeted areas, aborted potentially effective missions in order to prevent civilian casualties, and took \\"unthinkable\\" risks by allowing huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Gaza during the fighting. Goldstone stated that Kemp was not interviewed \\"because the report did not deal with the issues he raised regarding the problems of conducting military operations in civilian areas\\".David E Kaplan, Richard Goldstone: Outcast, pg. 1, The Jerusalem Post, 15 October 2009 Australian Major General Jim Molan (retired), who served as chief of operations of the Iraq multinational force in 2004‚Äì05, stated that \\"The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices.

Legal commentators Writing in the Financial Times Italian Jurist Antonio Cassese who was the first President of the International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia argued that critics of the report were relying primarily on ad hominem and strawman attacks. He argued that \\"critics have given inaccurate descriptions of the report's findings\\" and that \\"those who claim the mission's mandate was biased against Israel seem to have ignored a significant fact: Justice Goldstone, whose mission was initially asked to look into alleged violations only by Israel, demanded‚Äîand received‚Äîa change of mandate to include attacks by Hamas.\\" Furthermore, he argued that many critics of the report \\"have launched personal attacks on Justice Goldstone's character\\" and some critics have even gone as far as labeling Goldstone, who is Jewish, \\"an 'anti-Semite' of a kind who 'despise and hate our own people'\\". Former Canadian Minister of Justice, Attorney General of Canada, former president of the Canadian Jewish Congress and former Director of the Human Rights Program at McGill University Professor Irwin Cotler called the inquiry \\"inherently tainted\\", agreeing with Mary Robinson and Richard Goldstone that its original mandate was \\"deeply one-sided and flawed\\" prior to being broadened, and stating that the UNHRC is \\"systematically and systemically biased against Israel\\".The Goldstone Mission ‚Äì Tainted to the core (part I), The Jerusalem Post 18 August 2009 He opposed the report, which he regarded as \\"tainted\\". At the same time, he is in favor of establishing an independent inquiry into the Gaza war, saying that Israel would set a precedent if it creates such an inquiry that according to his best knowledge \\"no other democracy\\" had.Cotler: Israel should probe Gaza war, The Jerusalem Post, 22 October 2009 Princeton professor emeritus of international law Richard Falk, appointed in 2008 by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to serve as a United Nations Special Rapporteur on \\"the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967\\", endorsed the report as \\"an historic contribution to the Palestinian struggle for justice, an impeccable documentation of a crucial chapter in their victimization under occupation\\". Writing in Electronic Intifada, Falk further commented that the report appeared to him to be \\"more sensitive\\" to Israel's contentions that Hamas was guilty of war crimes, and that the report in many ways \\"endorses the misleading main line of the Israeli narrative\\". Falk was critical of charges that the report, or the UNHRC, were biased and inferred that such criticism amounted to an attempt to \\"avoid any real look at the substance of the charges\\". York University scholar of human rights and humanitarian law Professor Anne Bayefsky said that the report, which claims to be a human rights document, never mentions the racist, genocidal intent of the enemy, which Israel confronted after years of restraint. She added that the report relies on testimonies from witnesses speaking under circumstances that gave rise to \\"a fear of reprisals\\" from Hamas should they have dared to tell the truth.Obama's new leverage ‚Äì against its ally , JPost, 6 October 2009 Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz wrote that the problem with the report is what its composers willfully and deliberately refused to see and hear. He said that the commission ignored easily accessible videotapes that show Hamas operatives routinely firing rockets from behind human shields, and the report dismissed eyewitness accounts published by reputable newspapers and admissions by Hamas leaders regarding Hamas military activities.Goldstone report is an ad hominem attack , JPost, 27 September 2009 University of Toronto professor of law Ed Morgan wrote in the Toronto Star that in dealing with the alleged use of human shielding of the Gaza civilian population by Hamas, the report \\"put its head in the sand\\", saying merely that \\"[t]he mission notes that those interviewed in Gaza appeared reluctant to speak about the presence of or conduct of hostilities by the Palestinian armed groups\\". The article also criticized the way the committee dismissed first-hand evidences from IDF soldiers implying that mosques were used as launching points for Hamas attacks and as weapons storage facilities.Goldstone report undermines faith in international law The Toronto Star, 22 October 2009 Professor Daniel Friedmann, who served as the Justice Minister of Israel during the Gaza War, criticized what he called the \\"reinterpretation\\" of evidence unfavorable to Hamas. As an example, he cites the statement of the Hamas police force spokesman saying that \\"police officers received clear orders from the leadership to face the [Israeli] enemy\\". He says that the committee uncritically accepted the explanation that the intention was that in the event of an invasion, the police would continue to uphold public order and ensure the movement of essential supplies.'Goldstone report ‚Äì the terrorists' Magna Carta', The Jerusalem Post, 29 October 2009 Writing in the JURIST, Laurie Blank of Emory Law's International Humanitarian Law Clinic and Gregory Gordon of the University of North Dakota School of Law said that the Goldstone Report's major flaw is that it fails the law. In their view, the Report incorrectly claims Israel disproportionately attacked civilians by relying on information gathered after the fact and discounting contemporaneous Israeli intentions or actions and the surrounding circumstances; the Report unjustly accuses Israel of a disproportionate response to eight years of Hamas's attacks, unfairly presenting Operation Cast Lead as disproportionate overall; the Report treats Israel and Hamas disproportionately by holding them to different standards, merely suggesting that Hamas's actions \\"would constitute\\" legal violations.Goldstone, Gaza and (Dis)Proportionality: Three Strikes , Jurist, 4 November 2009 Other Noam Shalit, father of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit held captive by Hamas, urged the UN to take all possible measures to implement the Goldstone report's recommendations on the status of his son. The Goldstone report calls for the immediate release of Gilad Shalit and, while Shalit is in captivity, for access to him by the International Red Cross.Haaretz, 1 March 2010, \\"Noam Shalit Urges UN to Implement Goldstone Report\\", http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1153080.html Residents of southern Israel who testified before the commission regarding Palestinian rocket attacks on the region said that their testimonies were largely ignored.Shmulik Hadad, Southern residents: Our testimonies were ignored by Goldstone , Ynet News, 16 September 2009. Noam Chomsky argued that the Goldstone report is biased in favour of Israel since the report failed to question Israel's contention that it was acting in self-defence. Chomsky stressed that the right to self-defence requires that peaceful means are first exhausted before resorting to military force, something Israel \\"did not even contemplate doing\\". The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the main federation of trade unions in the United Kingdom, \\"welcomed\\" the findings of the report. J street, a Liberal Jewish lobby in the United States, called on Israel to establish an independent state commission of inquiry to investigate the accusations detailed in the report. Richard Landes, who also maintains the \\"Understanding the Goldstone Report\\" site, published in the December 2009 volume of the Israeli MERIA Journal critical analyses of the Goldstone report. Landes argued that the report fails to investigate seriously the problem of Hamas embedding its war effort in the midst of civilian infrastructure in order to draw Israeli fire and then accuse Israel of war crimes; the report is credulous concerning all Palestinian claims, contrasted with a corresponding skepticism of all Israeli claims; the report harshly judges Israel for war crimes, contrasted with its resolute agnosticism concerning Hamas intentions. Landes concluded that Goldstone actually participates in Hamas' strategy, which, according to Landes, encourages the sacrificing of their own civilians.Goldstone's Gaza Report: Part One: a Failure of Intelligence , Meria Journal, Volume 13, No. 4 ‚Äì December 2009 In an interview on the independent U.S. news broadcaster Democracy Now, Norman Finkelstein questioned the way the report judged the events in Gaza based on the laws of war, saying that Gaza did not meet the criteria of a war zone, calling it instead a \\"massacre\\". He went on to say that there was no fighting in Gaza, and referred to quotes from the testimonies of the Israeli soldiers published in the report by NGO Breaking the Silence. Concerning the substance of the report, Finkelstein says the Goldstone report is in-line with reports compiled by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch in the findings that Israel had targeted civilians and the Palestinian infrastructure. Mission members' responses to criticism Goldstone dismissed accusations of anti-Israel bias in his report as \\"ridiculous\\"Guardian: UN Gaza report accuses Israel and Hamas of war crimes 'He rejected any suggestion of bias: \\"To accuse me of being anti-Israel is ridiculous.\\"' and invited \\"fair minded people\\" to read the report and \\"at the end of it, point out where it failed to be objective or even-handed\\". Speaking in the UNHRC, Goldstone rejected what he called a \\"barrage of criticism\\" about his findings and said the answers to such criticism are in the findings of the report. Goldstone said that the United States, for example, had failed to substantiate its charges that the report was biased. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Goldstone challenged the Obama administration to identify the flaws the U.S. said it has found in the report. Alan Dershowitz in his analyses of the Report responded that as of January 2010 Goldstone had generally refused to reply substantively to credible critics of the Report and declined Dershowitz's offer to publicly debate Goldstone about its contents.The Case Against Goldstone Report: Study in Evidentiary Bias , JPost, 31 January 2010; Case Against Goldstone Report , Alan Dershowitz Goldstone referred to his experiences of South Africa to reject Israeli PM Netanyahu's arguments that the report would make peacemaking more difficult, saying, \\"truth-telling and acknowledgement to victims can be a very important assistance to peace.\\" In an interview with The Jewish Daily Forward, published on 7 October 2009, Goldstone emphasized that his task was to conduct a \\"fact-finding mission\\" and not an \\"investigation\\". He acknowledged the reliance on Palestinian (Gazan and Hamas) testimonies, noting his mission cross-checked those accounts against each other and sought corroboration from photos, satellite photos, contemporaneous reports, forensic evidence and the mission's own inspections of the sites in question. He further acknowledged that \\"We had to do the best we could with the material we had. If this were a court of law there would have been nothing proven.... I would not consider it in any way embarrassing if many of the allegations turn out to be disproved.\\" Harper's Magazine published a brief telephone interview with Desmond Travers in which he was asked to respond to criticism of the mission and the report. He rejected the criticism that insufficient weight was given to the difficulties of fighting in the urban environment, and said that he was surprised by what he called \\"the intensity and viciousness of the personal attacks aimed at members of the Mission\\". He also said that the mission found no evidence that mosques were used to store munitions; in two cases investigated, neither was used as anything but a place of worship. He added that he had seen no credible criticism of the report itself or of the information in it.Six Questions for Desmond Travers on the Goldstone Report Harpers Magazine 29 October 2009. Travers' statement regarding the use of mosques was challenged by a researcher at JCPA Colonel (res.) Halevi. Halevi said that the use of mosques as munition storage is supported by photographs of weapons seized in the Salah a-Din mosque in Gaza City during the operation, and the committee did not explain why it chose to disregard the information completely.What happened at mosque? , YNET, 12 November 2009 Subsequent developments=Human Rights Council UN Human Rights Council vote on the resolution.

Israeli officials rejected the UN Human Rights Council decision to endorse the report. Israeli Arab MK Ahmed Tibi, Hamas, and Palestinian Authority representatives welcomed the vote. The report was adopted by a vote of 25 in favour, 6 against, and 11 abstentions at a meeting held on 16 October 2009. The vote was as follows: Goldstone criticized the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution for targeting only Israel, and failing to include Hamas: \\"This draft resolution saddens me as it includes only allegations against Israel. There is not a single phrase condemning Hamas as we have done in the report. I hope that the council can modify the text.\\"Israel faces potential embarrassment at UN , AFP (reprinted in Khaleej Times 16 October 2009) On 13 April 2011, the UNHCR recommended that the General Assembly reconsider the report at its sixty-sixth session (to be held in September 2011), and urges the Assembly to submit that report to the Security Council for its consideration and appropriate action, including consideration of referral of the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute. The resolution was drafted by the Palestinian Authority and adopted by the Human Rights Council with 27 states voting in favour, three against, and 16 abstentions. It followed the second report of a Committee of Independent Experts, established to monitor the domestic investigations into violations committed during the conflict, which was submitted to the Human Rights Council on 18 March 2011. The report concurred with Amnesty International's assessment that ‚Äì more than 18 months since the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict documented crimes under international law committed by both sides ‚Äì the Israeli authorities and the Hamas de facto administration have failed to conduct investigations meeting the required international standards of independence, impartiality, thoroughness, effectiveness and promptness. The General Assembly has already twice called on the domestic authorities to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law documented by the UN Fact-Finding Mission, in resolutions adopted in November 2009 and February 2010. Those calls appear to have been ignored meaning that the General Assembly would be entitled to submit the issue to the Security Council. General Assembly The United Nations General Assembly endorsed a resolution calling for independent investigations to be conducted by Israel and Hamas on allegations of war crimes described in the Goldstone report. The resolution was passed by overwhelming numbers with 114 in favour and 18 against, and 44 abstentions. The resolution calls on the UN Secretary General to report to the General Assembly within three months \\"with a view to considering further action, if necessary, by the relevant United Nations organs and bodies\\", and to send the report to the Security Council.UN backs Gaza war crimes report (BBC, Nov. 5, 2009) POLITICS: U.N. Affirms Israeli-Hamas War Crimes Report (IPS Nov. 5, 2009) The resolution enjoyed wide support among the Non-Aligned Movement bloc and the Arab bloc that comprise a majority of 120 votes. Most developing countries voted in favor. The countries that voted against the resolution were: Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, the Netherlands, Palau, Panama, Poland, Slovakia, The Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine and the United States. Some European countries, namely Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, Malta, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland, voted in favor of the resolution. Other European countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Spain, abstained. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the vote showed that Israel has a \\"moral majority\\", adding: \\"[we] are pleased that 18 democratic 'premier league' states voted in line with Israel's position, while 44 South American and African states abstained\\".FM: UNGA vote shows Israel has moral majority, The Jerusalem Post 6 November 2009 The Palestinian ambassador to the UN stated that \\"the General Assembly sent a powerful message\\", adding that if Israelis do not comply, \\"we will go after them.\\" The General Assembly passed a second resolution on 26 February 2010 to call once more for credible investigations into war crimes allegations detailed in the report, giving both sides five months to report on their investigations. The resolution was passed by a vote of 98‚Äì7 with 31 abstentions, with several European countries changing their vote from against to abstaining or from abstaining to supporting relative to the first resolution. Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak attributed the change in voting partly to a negative reaction in Europe to an assassination carried out in Dubai, which was largely blamed on Israel. Security Council Libya requested an emergency session of the UN Security Council on 7 October to consider the content of the report by UNHRC fact-finding mission.PA's Goldstone block linked to tape , Al-Jazeera, 7 October 2009. The request was rejected, but the Security Council agreed to advance its periodical meeting on the Middle East from 20 to 14 October and to discuss the war crimes allegations raised in the report.UNSC rejects Goldstone session request. JPost, 8 October 2009. The report became the focus of the Security Council's monthly Mideast meeting on 14 October. Council diplomats say there is little chance that the Security Council will take any action, primarily because of objections by the United States, which said the report should be handled by the Human Rights Council.Palestinians urge Israeli punishment over Gaza The Washington Post, 14 October 2009. All of the permanent members of the Security Council, which wield veto powers, oppose involving the Security Council in the report. The ICC Prosecutor could seek a determination from the Judges of the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber on whether he can open an investigation into crimes committed during the conflict on the basis of a declaration issued by the Palestinian Authority in January 2009. That declaration accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC over crimes \\"committed on the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002\\". Legal experts dispute whether the Palestinian Authority is a \\"state\\" capable of making such a declaration under the Rome Statute. If the judges were to determine that the ICC could act on the declaration, a referral by the Security Council would not be required for the ICC to open an investigation. The ICC Prosecutor has not yet sought such a determination. Israeli internal investigations The UNHRC Mission's report recommended that both sides in the conflict open credible independent investigations into their own actions. The Israeli military opened about 100 internal investigations into its actions during the conflict, of which about 20 were criminal. The Prime Minister's Office released a statement on 24 October stating that the Israel Defense Forces had investigated most of the incidents and accusations of human rights abuses mentioned in the report.PM: Legal team will combat Goldstone, The Jerusalem Post 25 October 2009 Goldstone and human rights organizations said it was insufficient for the military to investigate itself, and the United States urged Israel to mount an independent inquiry. Goldstone also stated that an independent investigation in Israel \\"would really be the end of the matter, as far as Israel is concerned\\". In October, support grew within Israel for the launch of an independent inquiry, although the IDF and Defense Ministry argued that it would discredit the military's own internal investigations.Heather Sharp, Israel debates response to Gaza report , BBC News 24 October 2009 That month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the establishment of a commission headed by Justice Minister Yaakov Ne'eman that would reassemble and reevaluate material gathered by the IDF to ensure that the investigations were thorough and that no facts were covered up. According to the report, the team would not question soldiers and officers. Two professors, Moshe Halbertal and Avi Sagi, called for further investigation of incidents of Israeli troops opening fire on civilians carrying white flags, the destruction of homes in the final days of the operation and the destruction of power stations and water facilities.http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1126780.html Authors of IDF ethics code demand Gaza war probe (Haaretz) Former Israeli Supreme Court President Aharon Barak advised the Attorney General to establish a state committee endowed with investigative and subpoena powers to look into the claims raised by the Goldstone report. The chief legal officer of the IDF, Pnina Sharvit-Baruch, advocated establishing a commission of inquiry to respond to the Goldstone report, which she described as \\"very, very damaging\\" to Israel's international standing. She argued that an inquiry was needed to provide Israel with arguments that it had complied with the report's recommendations, rather than to uncover actual war crimes.http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1147186.html IDF legal official: Israel should probe Goldstone Gaza report (Haaretz, 3 February 2010) In January 2010, the Israeli military completed a rebuttal to the Goldstone report. The IDF affirmed that Gaza's sole flour mill was hit by tank shells in the course of a firefight with Hamas and that it was a legitimate military target because Hamas fighters were allegedly in its vicinity. The Goldstone Report informed that the mill had been hit by an aircraft bomb. Moreover, the Israeli military denied that the mill was a pre-planned target. (Photographs taken by a UN team to which The Guardian had access reportedly show, however, that the remains of a 500-pound Mk82 aircraft-dropped bomb were found in the midst of the mill's ruins.) Israel said it would present UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with its response to the Goldstone report by 28 January to meet the 5 February deadline set by the UN General Assembly.Israel to present response to Goldstone, 23 January 2009 Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi pushed for the establishment of a judicial investigative panel to review the internal IDF investigations and determine whether the investigations were thorough.Barak, Ashkenazi back Cast Lead panel, 25 January 2010 In January 2010, eight human rights organizations in Israel reissued a call to the government to establish an independent and impartial investigation. The call was issued by Adalah, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, B'Tselem, Gisha, Hamoked, Physicians for Human Rights ‚Äì Israel, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, Yesh Din and Rabbis for Human Rights. In April 2010, Human Rights Watch released a 62-page report on Israels and Hamas' investigations. Concerning Israel, HRW reported that Israel had until that point failed to conduct a credible and independent investigation into the alleged war crimes in Gaza. \\"Israel's investigations into serious laws-of-war violations by its forces during last year's Gaza war lack thoroughness and credibility,\\" HRW said in a release. In July 2010 Israel released second response to the report. Several soldiers were charged with misconduct, including manslaughter charges against a soldier for shooting at Palestinian women carrying white flags, as well as charges against use of a boy as a human shield. Brigadier General Eyal Eisenberg and Colonel Ilan Malca were reprimanded for authorizing an artillery attack that hit a UN compound. Hamas claims Addressing the report's allegations, initially a Hamas spokesman in Gaza said that the rockets fired at Israel were in self-defense, and were not intended to target civilians: \\"We were targeting military bases, but the primitive weapons make mistakes.\\" In what the Associated Press called \\"a rare deviation from Hamas' violent ideology\\", Hamas also initially said it regretted killing Israeli civilians. Ahmed Assaf, a spokesman for the rival Palestinian party Fatah, said he was \\"stunned\\" at the apology, and said Hamas should instead apologize rather to fellow Palestinians for the deaths and injuries Hamas caused during its violent struggle with Fatah over control in Gaza in 2007, which he called a \\"bloody coup\\".Rivals slam Hamas for \\"apology\\" to Israelis , Reuters 02-2010 HRW rejected Hamas's claim: > Hamas' claim that rockets were intended to hit Israeli military targets and > only accidentally harmed civilians is belied by the facts.

UN Panel assessment In September 2010, A UN Human Rights Council panel said Israel and Hamas had failed to conduct credible and adequate investigations into the war crimes allegations contained in the Goldstone report. The panel said Israel only investigated low-ranking officials and failed to investigate the role of \\"officials at the highest levels\\", while Hamas was criticised for not making serious efforts to investigate. Future ramifications Mustafa Barghouti, Palestinian democracy activist It has been suggested by some states, individuals, organisations and media outlets that the Goldstone report may have ramifications for other present and future conflicts, particularly conflicts between states and non-state actors such as terrorist organisations. Israel has said that the Goldstone report poses a challenge to the ability of states to defend themselves against terrorism, and warned that similar allegations could be made against other militaries fighting in comparable circumstances. In a statement released by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel claims that the report \\"[t]ies the hands of democratic countries fighting terror worldwide\\" and \\"[p]romotes criminal proceedings against forces confronting terrorism in foreign states\\".Goldstone Fact-Finding Report: A challenge to democracies fighting terror , Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs 17 September 2009.

In an interview conducted by Al-Jazeera, American Professor of law and former Lieutenant Colonel in the Israeli Defense Forces Amos N.

She also warned that if the Goldstone report were to set the international standards, the U.S. and many other countries might be accused of war crimes for their military operations.Clinton: Goldstone problematic for other countries , Ynetnews 26 February 2010. In the wake of the report, and following receipt of material from South African, International Criminal Court prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo stated he was considering opening an investigation into whether Lt. Col. David Benjamin, an IDF reserve officer, allowed war crimes to be committed during the Gaza War. Benjamin served in the Military Advocate General's international law department, but was actually abroad for most of the period of the conflict and already retired from active duty. Because of his dual Israeli-South African citizenship, he is according to Moreno Ocampo within the jurisdiction of the ICC. The European Initiative, a pro-Israeli group, lodged an itemized legal complaint with the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office and demanded that the top Hamas leadership in Gaza and Damascus be prosecuted for war crimes. The plaintiffs are Israelis who hold Belgian citizenship and live in the Gaza periphery communities that have been targeted by rockets. The suit is based on the Goldstone Report, as well as on reports by B'Tselem and Amnesty International.The foreign passports legion , Yehuda Shohat, Yediot, 24 December 2009 UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, wrote that the even-handed and impartial approach of the team led by Goldstone is indispensable in preventing future human-rights violations and in establishing a solid base for peace and security. Goldstone's retraction of claim Israel targeted civilians On 1 April 2011, Goldstone published a piece in The Washington Post titled 'Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and war crimes'. Goldstone noted that the subsequent investigations by Israel and recognized in the U.N. committee's report \\"indicate that civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy\\" while \\"the crimes allegedly committed by Hamas were intentional goes without saying.\\" The other principal authors of the UN report, Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers, have rejected Goldstone's reassessment arguing that there is \\"no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in anyway change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict\\". According to journalist Connie Bruck, writing in The New Yorker, \\"Goldstone came under such pressure that threats were made to ban him from his grandson‚Äôs bar mitzvah at a Johannesburg synagogue.\\" Goldstone's statement Goldstone further expressed regret \\"that our fact-finding mission did not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings about intentionality and war crimes\\". Goldstone's revised view concerned the intentional targeting of civilians, not other war crimes alleged in the report to have been committed by Israel. Such other crimes included causing civilian casualties by using a disproportionate level of force and attacks on buildings concerning which there was no indication they were legitimate military targets. Goldstone added: \\"That comparatively few Israelis have been killed by the unlawful rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza in no way minimizes the criminality. The U.N. Human Rights Council should condemn these heinous acts in the strongest terms.\\" Goldstone wrote that \\"If I had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would have been a different document.\\" He said that the lack of Israeli cooperation had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents that had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures e.g. to discontinue the use of white phosphorus (including as a smokescreen) in or near civilian areas. Goldstone also expressed that he initially hoped the \\"inquiry into all aspects of the Gaza conflict would begin a new era of evenhandedness at the U.N. Human Rights Council, whose history of bias against Israel cannot be doubted\\". Reactions Response in Israel to Goldstone's reappraisal of the report was harsh with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu releasing a statement saying that the report should be thrown \\"into the dustbin of history\\" and Jerusalem Post editor David Horovitz writing that Goldstone had \\"produced a report that has caused such irreversible damage to Israel's good name\\" that the very least that Goldstone now owes Israel \\"is to work unstintingly from now on to try to undo the damage he has caused\\".PM: Throw Goldstone Report into dustbin of history  By TOVAH LAZAROFF, YAAKOV KATZ  Jerusalem Post 04/02/2011 UN human rights council spokesman Cedric Sapey stated \\"The UN will not revoke a report on the basis of an article in a newspaper. The views Mr Goldstone expressed are his own personal views.\\" Sapey explained \\"A move to change or withdraw the report would either require a formal written complaint from Goldstone, backed unanimously by his three fellow authors, or a vote by the UN general assembly or the human rights council.\\" However, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri dismissed Goldstone's remarks saying, \\"his retreat does not change the fact war crimes had been committed against 1.5 million people in Gaza,\\" while Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said Goldstone's comments did not change a thing and that \\"The report was as clear as the crimes that Israel committed during the war.\\" Hina Jilani, one of the four writers of the \\"Goldstone Report\\", noted when asked if the report should allegedly be changed: \\"Absolutely not; no process or acceptable procedure would invalidate the UN Report; if it does happen, it would be seen as a 'suspect move'.\\"http://www.pakistantimes.net/pt/detail.php?newsId=20465 UN report on Gaza conflict stands unchanged: Hina Jilani (Pakistan Times, 6 April 2011) Also another of the four co-writers, Irish international criminal investigations expert Desmond Travers, noted: 'the tenor of the report in its entirety, in my opinion, stands'. Also Goldstone maintained that, although the one correction should be made, he had \\"no reason to believe any part of the report needs to be reconsidered at this time\\" and that he didn't plan to pursue nullifying the report.Goldstone won't seek Gaza report nullification (Associated Press, 6 April 2011) Human rights organizations said that much of the report remained valid. American Jewish Committee (AJC) Executive Director, David Harris, said that \\"Judge Goldstone should apologize to the State of Israel for the accusations of intentionally targeting civilians, which he now admits were unfounded. He should present his updated conclusions to the UN Human Rights Council, as well as to the General Assembly, which endorsed the skewed report, and press for its rejection.\\" In addition, NGO Monitor President Professor Gerald Steinberg said \\"with Goldstone's admission that 'our fact-finding mission had no evidence' and that 'civilians were not intentionally targeted as a matter of policy,' the politicized NGOs that supplied these allegations have been exposed again as biased and lacking credibility. As NGO Monitor demonstrated when the report was released, the so- called 'evidence' provided by these groups was at the core of the political war against Israel.\\" Statement issued by other members of UN mission On 14 April 2011, the other three authors of the Goldstone report released a statement regarding Goldstones article in The Washington Post. Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers claimed, \\"in recent days some articles and comments appearing in the press with respect to the report of the United Nations (UN) fact-finding mission on the Gaza conflict of 2008‚Äì2009 have misrepresented facts in an attempt to delegitimise the findings of this report and to cast doubts on its credibility.\\" The 3 coauthors of the report wanted to address the \\"aspersions cast on the findings of the report and challenge them. Members of the mission, signatories to this statement, find it necessary to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission's report unsubstantiated, erroneous or inaccurate\\". Hina Jilani, Christine Chinkin and Desmond Travers claimed there is \\"no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context, findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the Gaza conflict. Indeed, there is no UN procedure or precedent to that effect\\". They stated, \\"The report of the fact-finding mission contains the conclusions made after diligent, independent and objective consideration of the information related to the events within our mandate, and careful assessment of its reliability and credibility. We firmly stand by these conclusions.\\" They concluded that Israel and Hamas have yet to establish a convincing basis for any claims that contradict the findings of the mission's report contradicting Goldstones claims. They pointed out, \\"many of those calling for the nullification of our report imply that the final report by the follow-up committee's two members, Judge Mary McGowan Davis and Judge Lennart Aspergren, presented to the human rights council in March 2011, somehow contradicts the fact-finding mission's report or invalidates it. In the light of the observations of this committee such claims are completely misplaced, and a clear distortion of their findings\\". They criticized the findings of the Israeli inquiries. \\"The committee's report states that, according to available information, Israel has conducted some 400 command investigations into allegations by the fact-finding mission and other organisations. Command investigations are operational, not legal, inquiries and are conducted by personnel from the same command structure as those under investigation. Out of these, the committee reports that 52 criminal investigations into allegations of wrongdoings have been opened. Of these, three have been submitted for prosecution, with two of them resulting in convictions (one for theft of a credit card, resulting in a sentence of seven months' imprisonment, and another for using a Palestinian child as a human shield, which resulted in a suspended sentence of three months). The third case, related to allegations of deliberate targeting of an individual waving a white flag, is still ongoing.\\" \\"The committee has expressed serious concerns about the late start and slow pace of the proceedings, their insufficient transparency and the participation of victims and witnesses. Out of the 36 incidents relating to Gaza described in the fact-finding mission report, more than one third remain unresolved or without a clear status over two years after the conflict. The committee concluded that the slow progress could seriously impair the effectiveness of the investigations and prospects of achieving justice and accountability. Therefore, the mechanisms that are being used by the Israeli authorities to investigate the incidents are proving inadequate to genuinely ascertain the facts and any ensuing legal responsibility.\\" The authors also stated that \\"In addition, with regard to the issue of the policies guiding Operation Cast Lead, the committee states that there is \\"no indication that Israel has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed, planned, ordered and oversaw Operation Cast Lead\\". In other words, one of the most serious allegations about the conduct of Israel's military operations remains completely unaddressed.\\" They also criticized Hamas \\"We regret that no domestic investigations at all have been started into any of the allegations of international crimes committed by members of Palestinian armed groups in Gaza which have fired thousands of rockets into southern Israel. The committee observes the same in its report.\\" Their statement concluded with \\"We consider that calls to reconsider or even retract the report, as well as attempts at misrepresenting its nature and purpose, disregard the right of victims, Palestinian and Israeli, to truth and justice. They also ignore the responsibility of the relevant parties under international law to conduct prompt, thorough, effective and independent investigations. We regret the personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure placed on members of the fact- finding mission since we began our work in May 2009. This campaign has been clearly aimed at undermining the integrity of the report and its authors. Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitise our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade. \\"The report has triggered a process that is still under way and should continue until justice is done and respect for international human rights and humanitarian law by everyone is ensured.\\" See also *International Law and the Gaza War *Israel, Palestinians and the United Nations *Israeli judicial system *Israel Defense Forces Code of Conduct *Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel *Human rights in Israel *Human rights in the Palestinian National Authority ReferencesExternal links * Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 25 September 2009. * Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It was founded in 1932 by Walter R. Swann, J. A. Morton and D. Fairweather to make and sell razor blades.Swann-Morton History Founding principles Before they began trading, the founders drew up a list of four founding principles: *Claims of individuals producing in an industry came first, before anything else, and must always remain first. They are the human beings on which everything is built. *If the industry cannot pay the rightful reward of labour (while they are producing for profit for the owners) then a new policy is required on the part of the management to make it do so. *If the management can't do the job, then a new management is required, as well as a new policy. *Individuals in any industry have a perfect right to demand and see that this objective is reached, because they produce the goods. These four statements, written in W. R. Swann's handwriting, are displayed at Swann-Morton's head office. History Steel scalpel blade, manufactured by Swann Morton. When the Bard-Parker patent for a two-piece scalpel ran out in 1935, Swann-Morton expanded its product range in this direction. The company moved to its current site in the 1940s. Morton left the company around this time. The remaining directors took the decision to put the company in a trust where 50% was shared with the employees and the other 50% in a charitable trust. In the 1960s demand for sterilized surgical blades increased and Swann- Morton developed, with the expertise of The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at Wantage, a sterilisation process using cobalt-60 gamma radiation. It was one of the first commercial plants of its kind in the world and enabled Swann-Morton to be completely self-sufficient for all its sterilisation requirements. Today the irradiation and microbiological facilities are offered under contract to other healthcare manufacturers from Swann-Morton (Services) Limited and Swann-Morton (Microbiological Laboratory Services) Limited. At the turn of the new century Swann-Morton marked its progress and achievements by embarking on an extensive expansion programme involving major construction works to increase the size of dispatch, sterile storage, the laboratory and overall production facilities. The subsequent building of Cobb Works across from the main site in September 2006, providing purpose built space for the R&D; and engineering departments and then Cygnet works in October 2008, some 400 metres away, adding much needed storage for the raw material stock, underlines a policy of ongoing investment.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and became operational in November 2009. History Bure Prison was established on part of the domestic site of the former RAF Coltishall. Built during the Second World War, RAF Coltishall was used for night fighters, and then ground attack aircraft. In its latter years, the base was home to the 'Jaguar Force', its pink-painted Jaguars playing a major role in the 1991 Gulf War as part of Operation Granby. Due to defence cuts and reorganisation of the Royal Air Force, the station was formally closed on 30 November 2006. During January 2007, the Home Office expressed an interest in using the former RAF base. Initially earmarking the site for a new immigration detention facility, by the end of the year media reports suggested the Home Office were planning to establish a new prison at the site. In January 2009, North Norfolk District Council approved plans to establish a Category C prison at the former airbase. In August 2009, it was revealed that the new prison would be used primarily to hold sex offenders, with capacity for around 500 prisoners. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) took temporary control of the entire site of the base whilst building works were underway. Most of the prison is housed at part of the domestic site - in the former airmen's H-blocks, along with the junior ranks mess and NAAFI social club of the airbase. New dual perimeter fences have been constructed. Phase one of construction was completed in November 2009, and enabled the prison to hold 259 offenders. Phase two of construction was completed in March 2010, and increased the capacity of the prison to 523. A new wing Res 7 opened in November 2013 which provides accommodation for an additional 101 offenders increasing the capacity, yet again, to 624. In addition to this increase in accommodation a Regimes area is being built to provide additional activity places. Name The prison's name is taken from the nearby River Bure, and was selected in preference to the names of local towns, such as Aylsham, Coltishall and Wroxham after expressions of concern from parish councils and local government. The prison today HMP Bure opened in November 2009. The prison is largely used to hold Category C adult males from the East of England, convicted of sex offences. Residential units for prisoners consist of mainly single-cell accommodation. Bure's Learning Resource Centre offers various education courses to prisoners, as does the prison's horticulture and recycling departments. Vocational work offered to prisoners includes painting and decorating and industrial cleaning. Other services and organisations which offer support to inmates at the prison include Nacro, Citizens Advice Bureau, Jobcentre Plus and Alcoholics Anonymous. There is a Prison Visitor Centre operated by the Ormiston Children and Families Trust.

The fetishization of East Asians by people of other ethnicities is sometimes described by the derogatory term yellow fever.  Possible origins  Asian women are often stereotyped as being subservient, passive, and quiet. The image of the geisha, a sexually suggestive but silent woman, may have contributed to this. Asian women are often depicted giving suggestive gazes but remaining quiet while seducing a man. This portrayal persists today, along with the idea of Asian women‚Äîand, to a lesser extent, men‚Äîbeing exotic and submissive. Asian women are often referred to as a 'china doll', meaning they are dainty and beautiful, with the implication of absence of feelings and autonomy. These stereotypical depictions in mainstream media may have contributed to the fetishization of Asian peoples.  Terminology and usage  In the afterword to the 1988 play M. Butterfly, the writer David Henry Hwang, using the term \\"yellow fever\\", a derogatory pun on the disease of the same name, discusses Caucasian men with a \\"fetish\\" for (east) Asian women. The pun refers to the color terminology for race, in which persons of East and Southeast Asian heritage are sometimes described as \\"Yellow people\\". The term \\"yellow fever\\" describes someone who is inflicted with a disease, implying that someone with an Asian fetish has a sickness. Hwang argues that this phenomenon is caused by stereotyping of Asians in Western society. The term yellow fever is analogous to the term jungle fever, an offensive slang expression used for racial fetishism associated with Caucasian women whose sexual interests focus on black men. Other names used for those with an Asian fetish are rice kings, rice chasers and rice lovers. The slang term used for a gay man, usually Caucasian, who exclusively dates men of Asian descent is \\"rice queen\\".  Study on racial preferences in dating  In a two-year study on dating preferences among 400 Columbia University students, researchers did not find evidence of a general preference among Caucasian men for Asian women. Furthermore, the study found that there is a significantly higher pairing of Caucasian men with East Asian women because East Asian women are less likely to prefer African-American or Latino men. The study took data from \\"thousands of decisions made by more than 400 daters from Columbia University's various graduate and professional schools\\".  Effects  An Asian fetish places a psychological burden on Asian women, who may experience doubt and suspicion that men who find them attractive are primarily attracted to features related to ethnicity and culture rather than other traits or characteristics. Asian American women report both in popular media such as blogs, and in social scientific literature, that they are often uncertain whether people are only interested in them for their race. The doubt that targets of Asian fetish experience may be associated with feelings of depersonalization, which, it is argued, compound on the objectification Asian women already face as women, such that they may feel like interchangeable objects. The fetishized body of the Asian woman becomes a symbol of other people's desires; she may not be valued for who she is, but what she has come to represent. Racial depersonalization can be especially hurtful to Asian women in situations where being recognized as an individual is important, such as romantic relationships, because a person may feel unloved if they sense they could be replaced by someone with similar qualities. Another effect of Asian fetish is that it may cause its targets to feel like an Other, because they are isolated and held to different standards of beauty. Asian American women report being complimented in ways that imply they are attractive because they are Asian or despite being Asian. Because of Asian fetish, an Asian woman's racial difference is either seen as a failure to conform to mainstream Western standards of beauty, or as something that can be appreciated only on an alternative scale. This can cause insecurity, and affect a woman's self-worth and self-respect. Men with an Asian fetish are also affected by the stigma that accompanies the term. These men are viewed as inferior by those who assume that they date Asian women because they are unable to date Caucasian women. This logic holds that Asian women are lesser than Caucasian women. The stereotype that the Asian fetish perpetuates, about the sexual superiority of Asian women, may be perceived as reducing the status of Asian women to objects that are only valuable for sex and not as complete human beings. NPR correspondent Elise Hu offers that this can be a source of insecurity in Asian women's dating lives, asking: \\"Am I just loved because I'm part of an ethnic group that's assumed to be subservient, or do I have actual value as an individual, or is it both?\\". In the other direction, it has been argued that the notion of an Asian fetish creates the unnecessary and erroneous perception of multiracial relationships as being characterized by \\"patriarchal, racist power structures\\" in relationships. Writer Agness Kaku believes the mainstream Western culture undermines efforts to combat sexual harassment associated with Asian fetish. Noting how frequently women of Asian descent are subjected to verbal and online harassment, Kaku argues that Asian fetish \\"thrives on double standards that make light of racial bias against Asians\\" and states this downplaying leaves women vulnerable to stalking and violence. Asian Americans' body dissatisfaction has been linked to the way they are often portrayed in the media as sexual yet innocent, nerdy, and emotionally inept as well as the prevalence of White people in media. Asian Americans tend to have a wide range of body dissatisfaction, with some studies saying that they have less than White, Black, and Hispanic Americans while others say they range somewhere in between. However, unlike with many other non-White groups in America, Asian- Americans' body dissatisfaction does not relate to their levels of assimilation to American culture. This tends to be attributed to the fact that Asian-Americans are viewed as \\"Forever Foreigners.\\" This concept applies in different ways depending on the context. In this case, it means that the \\"true\\" American is considered to be the White American, and all other Americans are considered something else before they are considered Americans. These groups are referred to as African Americans, or Asian Americans, and rarely just as Americans. So, to try to fit in, some Asian Americans may attempt to achieve traits they consider White. According to an article from the Autumn 2003 edition of The Journal of Negro Education, many Asian American girls and women strive to achieve what they see as White traits, such as large breasts, green eyes, or light hair, which Asians are very rarely born with. In this article, Hmong high school girls were the main focus. These girls specified that they tried to achieve these traits because they were things that they believed White men and boys found attractive.  Asian women and Caucasian men  A 1998 article in The Washington Post states that 36% of young Asian Pacific American men born in the United States married Caucasian women, and 45% of U.S.-born Asian Pacific American women took Caucasian husbands during the year of publication. In 2008, 9.4% of Asian American men married to Caucasian American women while 26.4% of Asian American women were married to Caucasian American men. \\"Table 60.

Detailed data can be found in the Statistical Abstract of the United States, from 1979 to 2011. 7% of married Asian American men have a non-Asian spouse, 17.1% of married Asian American women are married to a Caucasian spouse, and 3.5% of married Asian men have a spouse classified as \\"other\\" according to U.S. census racial categories. 75% of Asian/Caucasian marriages involve an Asian woman and a Caucasian man. There was a spike in Caucasian male/Asian female marriages during and following the U.S.'s involvement with wars in Asia, including WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. In 2010, 219,000 Asian American men married Caucasian American women compared to 529,000 Caucasian American men who married Asian American women.Marrying Out One-in-Seven New U.S. Marriages is Interracial or Interethnic. Released June 4, 2010; Revised June 15, 2010 Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the Westerner's image of the Asian woman has been seen as subservient, loyal, and family oriented. After World War II, particularly feminine images of Asian women made interracial marriage between Asian American women and Caucasian men popular. Asian femininity and caucasian masculinity are seen as a sign of modern middle-class manhood. Postcolonial and model minority femininity may attract some Caucasian men to Asian and Asian American women and men see this femininity as the perfect marital dynamic. Some Caucasian men racialize Asian women as \\"good wives\\" or \\"model minorities\\" because of how Asian women are stereotyped as being particularly feminine. In preparation for a documentary on Asian fetish called Seeking Asian Female, Chinese-American filmmaker Debbie Lum interviewed non-Asian men who posted online personal ads exclusively seeking Asian women. Things that the men reported finding appealing in Asian women included subtlety and quietness, eye-catching long black hair, a mysterious look in dark eyes, and a propensity to give more consideration to how their partner feels than to themselves. Lum characterized the stereotype associated with an Asian fetish as an obsession with seeking \\"somebody submissive, traditional, docile... the perfect wife who is not going to talk back\\". Asian women may be viewed by Caucasian men with Asian fetish as \\"good wives\\", as in they are perceived to be able to properly take care of their children during the day and fulfill their partner's sexual desires at night. In interviews done by Bitna Kim, Caucasian men explain their fetish for Asian women. The Caucasian men interviewed fantasize that an Asian woman possesses both beauty and brains, that she is \\"sexy, intelligent, successful, professional, caring, and family oriented\\"; that she does not wear ‚Äúwhite girl clothes‚Äù and heavy makeup, and that they are not high maintenance. Hence, the men believe that Asian women have respectable mannerisms. These men see Asian women to be exotic, thus desirable, because of their supposed mysterious beauty and possession of a physical appearance perceived to be petite. Sexually, the men in these interviews had a commonality. They all believed that Asian women have submissive sex. They believed that an Asian woman did not mind putting her partner's pleasure above hers. These interviews show that some Caucasian men with Asian fetish believe that an Asian woman embodies a perfect wife as a \\"princess in public and a whore in the bedroom\\". A Caucasian woman is seen by some Caucasian men to lack the same femininity that an Asian woman has to offer. Since 2002, marriages between Swedish men and Thai women have become increasingly common. Historically, the number of Thai women marrying Caucasian men began to rise in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of Prime Minister Sarit Thanarat's economic policies which attracted foreign investment and Caucasian men to Thailand. There is a social stigma in the country against Thai women marrying Caucasian men, but research published in 2015 indicated that an increasing number of young middle-class Thai women were marrying foreign men. A generation earlier, Thai women marrying foreign men had mostly been working class. Sources indicate that Sri Lanka is popular among Western \\"marriage bureaus\\" which specialize in the pairing of Caucasian men with foreign women. The first and largest wave of Sri Lankan immigrants to Denmark were Sinhalese women who came to the country in the 1970s to marry Danish men they had met back in Sri Lanka. Statistics also show that marriages of Danish, Swedish and Norwegian men with Thai or Indian women tend to last longer than those of Indian men marrying Danish, Swedish or Norwegian wives. Filipino, Thai, and Sri Lankan women have traveled as mail-order brides to Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Statistics detailing the sponsorship of spouses and fianc√©es to Australia between 1988/1989 and 1990/1991 showed that more women from the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Korea, and India were sponsored for citizenship than men from the same countries. Data published in 1999 indicated that an estimated 200,000 to 400,000 German men annually travelled abroad for sex tourism, with the Philippines, Thailand, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong as their main destinations. For some Caucasian men, sex tourism to countries such as Thailand is built around a fantasy that includes the possibility of finding love and romance. This idea is based on the stereotype of \\"the Oriental woman\\" who is considered to be beautiful and sexually exciting as well as caring, compliant and submissive. Some Asian girls and women believe that their aspirations will be achieved if they marry a white man. Therefore, they may try to do what they can to look attractive to them. At the same time, Asian women have expressed preference for white men.  In media  There are relatively few representations of Asian people in Western media. Asian women in media tend to be portrayed in two ways: as exotic foreigners, docile and nonthreatening and sexual but also innocent, or as the nerd who is still aesthetically pleasing, but also emotionless and career oriented. This leads many Asian women to believe that they have to be in one of these boxes. It tends to convey the message that if they are smart, they cannot be sexual; or, if they are sexual, they tend to not be aware of it. Recently, movies such as Crazy Rich Asians and The Farewell have been breaking these boundaries, but they are movies that center around the Asian experience, allowing for more diversity across Asian characters. Media in America that features racial diversity tends to be Black- White centered. This means that, if the character is not White, they tend to be Black. For example, the Netflix adaptation of Dear White People largely juxtaposes race on a Black versus White spectrum. While there is the occasional Asian or Hispanic person, they are often there for comedic value rather than actual input into racial issues. This makes it seem as if America is full of only Black people and White people, therefore putting Asians in either a limbo space, or a bubble where Asians only exist among other Asians. For Asian Americans, the ideal body is influenced by the media they see. Women tend to lean towards traits that distinguish between Asian American women and White American women. For example, one trait that is held up in Asian American communities is the double eyelid. Many Asians are born with the single layered eyelid, but this ideal is so prevalent that people get surgery to achieve it. In her essay \\"Hateful Contraries: Media Images of Asian Women\\", British filmmaker Pratibha Parmar comments that the media's imagery of Asian women is \\"contradictory\\" in that it represents them as \\"completely dominated by their men, mute and oppressed\\" while also presenting them as \\"sexually erotic creatures\\". Asian women have traditionally been stereotyped in mass media in the United States. In her essay Lotus Blossoms Don't Bleed: Images of Asian Women, American filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pe√±a identifies two basic stereotypes. The Lotus Blossom Baby is a feminine and delicate sexual-romantic object. In contrast, the Dragon Lady is treacherous and devious, and in some cases a prostitute or madam. Tajima suggests that this view of Asian women contributes to the existence of the Asian mail-order bride industry in the US. It is argued that media may be furthering the progression of the Asian woman stereotype. This can be seen in movies, where the women are characterized by submissiveness. This trend is embodied within pornography, which focuses on an Asian women's stereotyped body type and her ability and desire to remain submissive to men. Asian pornography uprose when the United States government banned prostitution. But in other Asian countries, porn was supported, which lead to the accumulation and sexualization of Asian-based porn in the United States. The inability for one to truly understand another culture or production opens up more room for imagination and fantasy.

This is the only theatrical feature-length film starring the Wiggles, it was shown in cinemas in Australia on December 18, 1997. Amateur magician Wally the Great (Tony Harvey) tries to become a better magician by stealing Greg's magic wand, but is confronted by Dorothy the Dinosaur, who believes the Wiggles have forgotten her birthday, while in fact, they have been planning a surprise party. The film was released in North America as a direct-to-video film in 2003 from HIT Entertainment, under the title Magical Adventure! A Wiggly Movie. Plot Wally the Great (Tony Harvey), great-grandson of Waldo the Magnificent, is an amateur magician whose dream is to win the competition at the Magic Club for Best Magician. He is confronted with a rival, Roland the Remarkable (Dale Burridge), who believes Wally is a nobody. Meanwhile, children's entertainers the Wiggles, consisting of lead singer Greg Page, guitarist Murray Cook, drummer Anthony Field and keyboardist Jeff Fatt, are performing at a nearby school for Dorothy the Dinosaur's birthday. Mrs. Bingle (Joanne Samuel), the principal, had an accident with Anthony after she blew a whistle, causing him to act extremely silly. Wally, watching from behind a wall, sees Dorothy herself laying Greg's (who is a magician) wand on a table while sulking that everyone has forgotten her birthday but really they were trying to keep the surprise party for her a secret. Wally quickly snatches it but is caught by Dorothy. The two have a tug of war and the wand breaks in half. Meanwhile, the Wiggles decide to go out looking for Dorothy in their Big Red Car. After seeing Henry the Octopus and his Underwater Big Band, they happen upon Brrrrrrrrrr Street where they get frozen; since they have no luck finding Dorothy, they go to Wigglehouse. Meanwhile, the wand is broken to bits after an accident with Wags the Dog and his pups. During the adventures that Wally and Dorothy have, their friendship grows more and more. When they visit Captain Feathersword the Friendly Pirate, a crew member falls in the water and Wally saves him and is rewarded a medal with a mini feathersword planted on it. Dorothy leaves and sits on a bench, sadly, complaining to Wally that nobody remembers her birthday. Wally then says \\"I didn't forget your birthday\\" which makes Dorothy a little bit better. Wally begins to daydream about his grandfather, Waldo, saying to him to believe in himself. Wally forgets all about the Magic Competition and is almost late, but thanks to Dorothy, he makes it. Jimbo the Juggler blocks their way and say that Wally should put his vehicle in the full car park, but Wally thinks quick and says \\"You find a spot\\" and tosses his helmet at him, leaving Jimbo pinch-faced. He then signs in and runs into Roland, who clearly amuses the judges when his score is 9‚Äì9‚Äì9. Wally find his grandfather's old chest of magic supplies and grows confident in himself. Meanwhile, the Wiggles are waiting for Dorothy to come to the party but nobody shows up. After Wally does his magic act, the judges score him 10‚Äì9‚Äì9. He wins the competition which leaves Roland jealous but at the same time impressed. Wally takes Dorothy to her party when it is just about to be cancelled and the party begins.

Hawley studied extensively how human populations interacted with their changing environments along with the growth of populations. He focused his studies on the behavior of populations in terms of organization, development, and change over space and time. Career He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from the University of Cincinnati in 1936. At the University of Cincinnati Hawley took an Introduction to Sociology under professor James A. Quinn who had been a student at the Chicago School of Sociology taught by Robert E. Park. In his course of study, several books affected how Hawley conceived of human ecology. These works included An Introduction to the Science of Sociology by Robert E. Park and E.W. Burgess (1921), Social Organization by C.H. Cooley (1929), and Mind, Self, and Society by G.H. Mead (1934). Hawley pursued his Ph.D at the University of Michigan where he was mentored by Roderick D. McKenzie.Hawley, H. Amos. 1992. \\" The Logic of Macrosociology.\\" Annual Review of Sociology.

While teaching Hawley printed the 1950 book Human Ecology, which had an international effect on the field of sociology.Hollingshead, August B.

He was the 69th President of the American Sociological Association in 1978.John D. Kasarda, Amos Hawley: A Pioneer in Human Ecology, ASA Footnotes, May‚ÄìJune 2009 Issue ‚Ä¢ Volume 37 ‚Ä¢ Issue 5 Ideas and influences Amos Hawley was influenced by Roderick D. McKenzie, who was mentored by Robert E. Park and E.W. Burgess of the Chicago School of Sociology. Roderick McKenzie published several works on a number of topics ranging from immigration (Oriental Exclusion, 1927), economics ( L'evolution economique due monde, 1928), and to urbanism ( The Metropolitan Community, 1933). McKenzie influenced Hawley through his idea that it is necessary to understand change through space and time among populations or an aggregate.Hawley, H. Amos. 1968. Roderick D. McKenzie on Human Ecology.Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. Hawley learned from Mckenzie that humans are observable units within an ecosystem with a given technology they will interact with their environment and develop predictable patterns. Hawley expanded McKenzie's work on population studies and human interaction with the environment further. Hawley contended that \\"the environment, population, and the ecosystem tend to move toward equilibrium\\" (Human Ecology, p. 10). In his book, Human Ecology, Hawley wrote that humans will modify their behavior patterns to fit with changes in their biophysical environment. Through this adaption human groups can either evolve or expand into complex societies. For systemic change to occur, such as expansion of a population, disequilibrium is required along with multiple challenges to the environment. Hawley studied rigorously the nature of change and communities and their relation to time and space. Cumulative change is when a series of increments or a single increment within a social system forms a foundation for the next increment. In his study of change, Hawley strove to answer the question \\"Are there events or circumstances which lead inexorably toward cumulative change?\\"Hawley, H. Amos. Dec 1973. \\"The Presidential Address: Cumulative change in Theory and in History.\\" American Sociological Review. Vol. 43 No. 6 pp. 787‚Äì796. Found 7 Nov 2011. Hawley found that change is irreversible because a series of events within a state of time cannot go backward in time. Evolution, as viewed by those in the scientific community was an outcome of cumulative change along with expansion of population. To understand if a given population will expand or evolve, Hawley questioned whether \\"complexity and scale were concurrent.\\" He concluded that \\"when complexity and scale advance more or less together, the effect is growth or expansion rather than evolution\\". By understanding the concepts behind population expansion and evolution, Hawley explored how all organisms are connected to the environment and through behavior. Amos Hawley believed that organisms are connected in a web of relationships that interdependent and are enmeshed with the environment. In the web of relationships organisms can have relationships of symbiosis or commensalism. Symboisis is the close bond relationship between the two individuals of two different species. Commensalism is when organisms make similar demands on the environment often resulting in competition. Hawley believed humanity was dominant in the ecosystem due to advances in technology and humanity's control over the habitat. He contended that through culture humanity is able to modify its subsistence to match its needs and desires. Hawley writes \\"thus the development of human dominance through the agency of culture involves a reconstruction of the biotic community. Instead of accommodating his activities, as do primitive peoples, to the natural life association, civilized man regulates the biotic community in accordance with his needs\\".

After Schl√∂sser's death he became its commercial director. Scheibler married Anna n√©e Werner, a niece of Schl√∂sser, on 16 September 1854. In 1852, Scheibler and his partner Julius Schwartz bought a plot at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and started to build a machinery factory. In October 1854, Schwartz sold his share to Scheibler for 10,000 rubles, making him the sole owner of the factory. In 1855, Scheibler founded a spinning mill with 34 frames and a steam engine of 40 horsepower. In 1857, Scheibler employed 180 labourers and earned a turnover of 305,100 rubles in 1860.

Along with Majorca, Ibiza, and Formentera it is part of the Balearic Islands. It has a population of approximately 88,000. It is located 39¬∞47' to 40¬∞00'N, 3¬∞52' to 4¬∞24'E. It is a dry island without many wetlands or river systems; many of the wetlands in Menorca were drained to provide agricultural land. Despite this dragonflies are abundant on Menorca and in summer any pool of water will be alive with them. The best months to see dragonflies are May to September.

The A68 road generally follows the course of Dere Street, a Roman road, but has deviated at this point a little to the east, to facilitate a bridge crossing of the Swin Burn. History The reservoir was built at the end of the 19th century for the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company. The reservoir forms part of a series of reservoirs along the A68 which are connected by tunnels and aqueducts from Catcleugh Reservoir to Whittle Dene; from where drinking water is supplied to Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, and some surrounding areas. The reservoirs that form the chain are, from northwest to southeast: Catcleugh Reservoir ‚Üí Colt Crag Reservoir ‚Üí Little Swinburne Reservoir ‚Üí Hallington Reservoirs ‚Üí Whittle Dene. The first proposals for a reservoir on the Swin Burn were submitted to Parliament in 1854 by the Whittle Dean Water Company. They needed additional sources of pure water, highlighted by a disastrous outbreak of cholera in Newcastle and Gateshead in 1853, from which 1,527 people died. Their bill included provision for the building of an aqueduct which would gather water from a number of streams in the North Tyne catchment. This water would be stored in a reservoir to the north-east of Swinburne Castle, from where another aqueduct would carry the water to the River Pont near Matfen, passing through a tunnel at Ryal, where higher ground otherwise prevented the water flowing by gravity. A House of Commons Select Committee began considering the proposals in March 1854. The company's engineer was James Simpson, but it appears that Thomas Hawksley supported the bill on its passage through Parliament, an engineer who had a reputation for being particularly good at presenting complex information in a clear fashion. Both men had visited the sites of the proposed works in early March, to assess what could be done to placate Thomas Riddell, who owned some of the land on which the aqueduct would be built. The company made him an offer, which he refused, making a counter claim for ¬£7,600 in compensation, to which the company could not agree. Samuel Homersham, an engineer speaking against the bill, suggested that an additional reservoir at Whittle Dean could be built, and the opposition succeeded in having the clauses for the aqueduct to the west of Swinburne Castle and the reservoir removed from the bill. Some of Riddell's other proposals were rejected, including a clause to prevent the company from ever extracting water to the west of the Small Burn, and another to ensure that the company would ensure minimum flows in various streams, with financial penalties if they failed to do so. The bill became an Act of Parliament on 2 June 1854. The next proposal for the Swinburne area was made in 1873 by George Henry Hill, who was learning his trade by assisting the engineer John Frederick Bateman. Hill stated that measurements over ten years had shown that rainfall in the Swinburne area was per year, and that collecting water from some would yield an additional for the company. He further proposed a reservoir on the Swin Burn, a second reservoir to augment the storage capacity at Hallington, and an aqueduct or tunnel to convey water between the two. Following an unprecedented period of dry weather lasting for 560 days and ending in November 1874, a reservoir on the Swin Burn was again considered, and Hill again recommended proceeding. The directors agreed to proceed with plans for Swinburne reservoir, and a second reservoir, which became known as Little Swinburne, for which a bill was submitted to Parliament in February 1876. By the time the bill was submitted, it contained proposals for three reservoirs, of which Little Swinburne was the only one actually built. Lower Swinburne reservoir was immediately to the south west of Little Swinburne, while Upper Swinburne was to the north of it. The bill also included plans for West Hallington reservoir, to the south west of the first Hallington reservoir. There was opposition to the bill from Newcastle and Gateshead councils, from the Chamber of Commerce, and from John Gifford Riddell, the son of Thomas Riddell. The towns eventually withdrew there opposition, but Riddell's complaint was that the works would severely damage his estate, and that its engineering was unsound. He proposed three alternatives for reservoirs on the Warksburn, at the Northumberland Lakes, and on his own estate. Hill stated that the capacities of the three reservoirs would be for Upper Swinburne, for Little Swinburne, and for Lower Swinburne. Riddell's proposal was for a reservoir of , more than that of the upper and lower reservoirs combined. He was supported by Richard Cail, a local civil engineering contractor and builder, although the idea was actually that of a mining engineer called Thomas John Bewick. They argued that the lower reservoir was too low for all of its capacity to be useful, as it was below the elevation where gravity could be used to feed the water into the rest of the company's system. The Select Committee decided that plans for the lower reservoir should be removed from the bill, and it then became an Act of Parliament in July 1976. Work did not start immediately, but in October, Bateman was asked to proceed with the detailed design of the aqueduct between Swinburne and Hallington, and in December Little Swinburne reservoir was added to his remit. Exploratory borings were made in January 1877, but by then the directors had decided to abandon their plans for Upper Swinburne reservoir, and instead proceed with that proposed by Bewick and Riddell, for which they obtained an Act of Parliament on 12 July 1877. It became known as Colt Crag reservoir. The company offered Riddell ¬£8,000 for the land needed for the Little Swinburne reservoir and aqueduct, while Riddell argued it was worth ¬£22,600. The decision went to arbitration, and the court decided that the company's offer was reasonable. When work began, the company refused to employ two policemen, as requested by Riddell, but did agree to his request that ¬£50 per year should be paid to the Navvy Mission for scripture readers. The contract for construction was awarded to Rigby of Worksop, and the aqueduct between Swinburne and Hallington was commissioned in late 1879. By March 1880, the depth of water in the reservoir had reached . No major work was needed to the reservoir until 1946, when the tunnel between Little Swinburne and Hallington collapsed, while in 1948 the overflow was improved, following similar work at Hallington in the previous year. Responsibility for the reservoirs passed to the Northumbrian Water Authority in April 1974, as a result of the passing of the Water Act 1973. It then passed to Northumbrian Water when the water industry was privatised in 1989.

Originally chartered as the South Western Traction Company, the line was renamed the London and Lake Erie Railway in 1909. Throughout its short life, the line was always referred to locally as \\"The Traction Line\\". The South Western Traction Company In 1902, a group of London, Ontario residents led by Thomas Purdom and Alfred E. Welch chartered an electric railway based in London. Unlike the municipally-owned London and Port Stanley Railway, the South Western Traction Company was chartered primarily as a passenger hauling line. Lines were planned to several other municipalities in the area, but ultimately, the line was a 28-mile meandering route between London and Port Stanley. The line began construction in 1903 southward from London to Lambeth. Construction stopped in 1904 when the company ran out of funds but resumed after additional capital was secured from the Canadian Electric Traction Company, a joint venture between Canadian and British investors. The generating equipment and rolling stock were supplied by Bruce Peebles & Co. Ltd. of Edinburgh, Scotland. The equipment on the South Western Traction Company used a Three phase AC electric overhead traction system designed by Ganz of Budapest, Hungary. The new traction line and was the only railroad in North America to use this system. The powerhouse was built in Chelsea Green, a suburb of London, near its chief competitor the London & Port Stanley Railway (L&PS;).http://www.trainweb.org/swtractionco/gallery/swtpowerhouse.html The route of the line continued southward towards St. Thomas, passing through the villages of Scottsville, Tempo and Lynhurst. Tracks reached St. Thomas in July 1906. The Traction Line used the tracks of the St. Thomas Municipal Railway to navigate through the city streets. The line entered town on the west end and exited southward on the east end, crossing over the London and Port Stanley Railway via the street railway on Talbot Street in the process. Continuing southward, the line passed through the village of Union and entered Port Stanley via Colborne Street. The Traction Line station was on the east side of Port Stanley harbour, compared to the more extensive L&PS; yards on the west side. The station was located directly off Colborne Street and still exists today. There was a spur line that ran behind the station down to the dock for loading fish and passengers. The line entered London via Baseline Road, and curved north towards downtown. A long trestle carried the line over the Thames River valley before terminating at the company's station on Horton Street. There had been various issues with the Ganz A/C overhead system, and this prompted the line to switch to D/C operation in early 1907. The company ordered six D/C motor cars from the Ottawa Car Company in Ottawa, Ontario in March 1907. The line was dealt a major blow on August 10, 1907, when a fire caused by crossed wires destroyed the company's car barns in London. The company's six British built cars were in the barns at the time, and five were destroyed. Four of the new Ottawa cars were in St. Thomas, but hadn't had their motors or equipment installed. The losses for the railway were pegged at over $160,000. The following year, six additional cars were purchased from Preston Car and Coach in Preston, Ontario. The first train arrived in Port Stanley in October 1907. Plans for expansions to Delaware and Aylmer, Ontario were looked at in 1907 as well.,The London Advertiser, November 5, 1907 but for several reasons, these extensions were never built. The year 1908 brought about receivership and with it, a change in ownership. In 2012, the South Western Traction Line was inducted to the North America Railway Hall of Fame.North America Railway Hall of Fame: South Western Traction Line The South Western Traction Line was recognized for its contribution to railroading as the only three-phase AC electric railroad in North America, and one of only a few in the world. The line was inducted in the \\"Community, Business, Government or Organization\\" class in the \\"Local\\" category (pertaining specifically to the area in and around St. Thomas, Ontario.) The London and Lake Erie Railway and Transportation Company In 1908, the South Western Traction Company was in receivership and was purchased at auction by J. MacDougall of London. A consortium of businessmen led by G.B Woods of Toronto purchased the line from Mr. MacDougall and formed the London and Lake Erie Railway and Navigation Company. The first manager of the company was Mr. S.W. Mower. The company prospered, with both freight and passenger revenues up. In 1911, the company was dealt another blow when Sunday service was suspended by the Province under the Lord's Day Act. The London and Lake Erie, operating as a provincial charter, was not exempt from the act. Sunday cars were viewed as strictly recreational, and as the line did not provide an essential link, was forced to discontinue Sunday service. This was not reinstated until 1913. S.W. Mower resigned as manager in 1912, and was replaced by William Nelson Warburton. Warburton had worked with several other interurban railways in Ontario including the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway and the Chatham, Wallaceburg and Lake Erie Railway. Streamlining of the stops between London and Port Stanley was done shortly after Warburton assumed his position. Business was so good, the company also ordered two motor cars and two trailer cars from the Niles Car Company. The company also experimented with generating more freight service during this period. Fish from the dock in Port Stanley was the main commodity hauled, but never panned out into the big revenue generator the company hoped for. The tight curves and steep grades of the London and Lake Erie Railway, while satisfactory for interurban cars, was not conducive to effective freight operations. An interchange was established in St. Thomas around 1913 with the Michigan Central Railroad. In 1915, the Niles cars were sold to the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway. Talks were held in Aylmer in 1915 as well, the company seriously looking at extending the line. The plan was to extend to Port Burwell via Aylmer, but that never came to pass. The London and Lake Erie's lack of a rail connection in London was a major factor in this decision. In July, 1915, the London and Port Stanley Railway was electrified. That, combined with the ever-growing threat of the automobile, eventually spelled the end for the London and Lake Erie Railway. Decline and Sale Throughout the next few years, the London and Lake Erie struggled for survival. The outbreak of World War I did little to improve the line's fortunes. Traffic was up, but revenues were not. The beach area in Port Stanley was very developed as well, but the London and Lake Erie, being on the opposite side of the harbour, lost out on the majority of the tourist traffic. The London and Lake Erie retired its London generating station in 1915 in favour of purchasing power from Ontario Hydro. Management was increasingly cutting power to cut costs, often stranding cars out on the line, much to the chagrin of passengers. A record 726,799 passengers were carried in the 1916-1917 fiscal year, but it was too little, too late. The equipment was under increasing pressure, but revenue wasn't available to perform the necessary repairs. The winter of 1917 was exceptionally harsh. Wartime demands had reduced the amount of coal available, and service had to be drastically cut back due to no heat being available for the cars. Beginning in 1916, management began looking at options to sell the railway. Both London and St. Thomas expressed interest in purchasing portions of the line, but neither were willing to pay the full $600,000 asking price. Sir Adam Beck, Ontario Hydro visionary and former mayor of London, suggested that the City counter with just over $300,000, but this was declined by management. London was only interested in the portion southward to Talbotville and intended to operate it as commuter railway extension of the London Street Railway. The actual physical appraisal of the line in 1918 was $360,000. A buyer could not be found however, and the decision was made to scrap the line. On October 28, 1918, a statement was issued by manager Warburton that the London and Lake Erie Railway had ceased operations.The London Advertiser, October 28, 1918 Service was first cut back from Port Stanley to St. Thomas, with the remaining service discontinued shortly thereafter. Over the next few years, the assets of the company were liquidated. Most of the company's rolling stock went to the Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway, with four cars going to the Oshawa Railway. The right of way inside the London city limits was sold to the municipality. Belgrave Avenue south of Tecumseh Street follows the old traction line grade. The bridge over the Thames River remained until it was moved to the west to carry Richmond Street over the river. The London station building was sold to the Salvation Army and was demolished in the early 1950s when it was replaced. The remaining station buildings were dismantled over the years, save for Port Stanley. The grade can also be seen in various places, mainly south of St. Thomas.

The Treaty of Constantinople, also known as the Peace of Istanbul or the Treaty of Ferhad Pasha (), was a treaty between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid Empire ending the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578‚Äì1590. It was signed on 21 March 1590 in Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). The war started when the Ottomans, then ruled by Murad III, invaded the Safavid possessions in Georgia, during a period of Safavid weakness. With the empire beleaguered on numerous fronts and its domestic control plagued by civil wars and court intrigues, the new Safavid king Abbas I, who had been placed on the throne in 1588, opted for unconditional peace, which led to the treaty. The treaty put an end to 12 years of hostilities between the two arch rivals. While both the war and the treaty were a success for the Ottomans, and severely disadvantageous for the Safavids, the new status quo proved to be short lived, as in the next bout of hostilities, several years later, all Safavid losses were recovered.  War  At the time the war commenced, the Safavid Empire was in a chaotic state under its weak ruler, Mohammad Khodabanda. In the resulting fighting, the Ottomans had managed to take most of the Safavid provinces of Azerbaijan (including the former capital Tabriz), Georgia (Kartli, Kakheti, eastern Samtskhe-Meskheti), Karabagh, Erivan, Shirvan and Khuzestan, despite Mohammad Khodabanda's initially successful counterattack. When Abbas I succeeded to the throne in 1588, the Safavid realm was still plagued by domestic issues, and thus the Ottomans managed to push further, taking Baghdad during that year and Ganja shortly after. Confronted by even more problems (i.e. civil wars, uprisings,Such as in Shirvan, which was sparked due to heavy taxation (Matthee (1999), p. 21) and the war against the Uzbeks in the northeastern part of the realm), Abbas I agreed to sign a humiliating treaty with disadvantageous terms.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºcel-Prof. Ali Sevim:T√ºrkiye Tarihi III, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1991, pp. 21‚Äì23, 43‚Äì44  Treaty  According to the treaty, the Ottoman Empire kept most of its gains in the war. These included most of the southern Caucasus (which included the Safavid domains in Georgia, composed of the Kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti and the eastern part of the Samtskhe- Meskheti principality, as well as the Erivan Province, Karabakh, and Shirvan), the Azerbaijan Province (incl. Tabriz, but not Ardabil, which remained in Safavid hands), Luristan, Dagestan, most of the remaining parts of Kurdistan, Shahrizor, Khuzestan, Baghdad and Mesopotamia.Mikaberidze (2011), p. 698; Meri & Bacharach (2006), p. 581; Iorga (2009), p. 213; Floor & Herzig (2015), p. 474; Newman (2012), p. 52; Bengio & Litvak (2014), p. 61; Mitchell (2009), p. 178 A clause was included in the treaty that stipulated that the Safavids would have to stop cursing the first three caliphs, as was common ever since the first major Ottoman-Safavid treaty, namely the Peace of Amasya (1555). The Persians also agreed to pay obeisance to religious leaders of the Sunni faith.  Aftermath  This treaty was a success for the Ottoman Empire, as vast areas had been annexed. However, the new status quo did not last for long. Abbas I would use the time and resources which resulted from the peace on the main front with the Ottomans, to successfully deal with the other issues (including the Uzbeks and other revolts), while waiting for a suitable moment to regain his possessions. When the Ottoman Empire during the reign of young sultan Ahmet I was engaged with the Celali revolts, he was able to regain most of his losses, which the Ottoman Empire had to accept in the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha, 22 years after this treaty.

History The community's history dates back to the early 1900s. At that time, the Missouri Texas Land and Irrigation Company owned approximately of land, including the area that would later become Hargill. Two businessmen, William Apsey Harding and Samuel Lamar Gill, formed a partnership known as the Harding-Gill Company in 1916 for the purpose of developing the land. The name Hargill originated from the last names of the two men. In 1920, school was constructed in the community. A post office opened in 1924 and a railroad station was established in 1926. By 1930, Hargill had an estimated population of 400 with several stores and three churches. The number of residents grew to 450 by the late 1940s. Hargill's population declined to approximately 100 in the mid-1960s, but steadily grew during the remainder of the twentieth century.

NMR coupling refers to the effect of nuclei on each other in atoms within a couple of bonds distance of each other in molecules. This effect causes NMR signals in a spectrum to be split into multiple peaks. Decoupling fully or partially eliminates splitting of the signal between the nuclei irradiated and other nuclei such as the nuclei being analyzed in a certain spectrum. NMR spectroscopy and sometimes decoupling can help determine structures of chemical compounds. Explanation NMR spectroscopy of a sample produces an NMR spectrum, which is essentially a graph of signal intensity on the vertical axis vs. chemical shift for a certain isotope on the horizontal axis. The signal intensity is dependent on the number of exactly equivalent nuclei in the sample at that chemical shift. NMR spectra are taken to analyze one isotope of nuclei at a time. Only certain types of isotopes of certain elements show up in NMR spectra. Only these isotopes cause NMR coupling. Nuclei of atoms having the same equivalent positions within a molecule also do not couple with each other. 1H (proton) NMR spectroscopy and 13C NMR spectroscopy analyze 1H and 13C nuclei, respectively, and are the most common types (most common analyte isotopes which show signals) of NMR spectroscopy. Homonuclear decoupling is when the nuclei being radio frequency (rf) irradiated are the same isotope as the nuclei being observed (analyzed) in the spectrum. Heteronuclear decoupling is when the nuclei being rf irradiated are of a different isotope than the nuclei being observed in the spectrum. Supplemental NMR Topics For a given isotope, the entire range for all nuclei of that isotope can be irradiated in broad band decoupling, Carbon NMR spectra or only a select range for certain nuclei of that isotope can be irradiated. Practically all naturally occurring hydrogen (H) atoms have 1H nuclei, which show up in 1H NMR spectra. These 1H nuclei are often coupled with nearby non- equivalent 1H atomic nuclei within the same molecule. H atoms are most commonly bonded to carbon (C) atoms in organic compounds. About 99% of naturally occurring C atoms have 12C nuclei, which neither show up in NMR spectroscopy nor couple with other nuclei which do show signals. About 1% of naturally occurring C atoms have 13C nuclei, which do show signals in 13C NMR spectroscopy and do couple with other active nuclei such as 1H. Since the percentage of 13C is so low in natural isotopic abundance samples, the 13C coupling effects on other carbons and on 1H are usually negligible, and for all practical purposes splitting of 1H signals due to coupling with natural isotopic abundance carbon does not show up in 1H NMR spectra. In real life, however, the 13C coupling effect does show up on non-13C decoupled spectra of other magnetic nuclei, causing satellite signals. Similarly for all practical purposes, 13C signal splitting due to coupling with nearby natural isotopic abundance carbons is negligible in 13C NMR spectra. However, practically all hydrogen bonded to carbon atoms is 1H in natural isotopic abundance samples, including any 13C nuclei bonded to H atoms. In a 13C spectrum with no decoupling at all, each of the 13C signals is split according to how many H atoms that C atom is next to. In order to simplify the spectrum, 13C NMR spectroscopy is most often run fully proton decoupled, meaning 1H nuclei in the sample are broadly irradiated to fully decouple them from the 13C nuclei being analyzed. This full proton decoupling eliminates all coupling with H atoms and thus splitting due to H atoms in natural isotopic abundance compounds. Since coupling between other carbons in natural isotopic abundance samples is negligible, signals in fully proton decoupled 13C spectra in hydrocarbons and most signals from other organic compounds are single peaks. This way, the number of equivalent sets of carbon atoms in a chemical structure can be counted by counting singlet peaks, which in 13C spectra tend to be very narrow (thin). Other information about the carbon atoms can usually be determined from the chemical shift, such as whether the atom is part of a carbonyl group or an aromatic ring, etc. Such full proton decoupling can also help increase the intensity of 13C signals. There can also be off-resonance decoupling of 1H from 13C nuclei in 13C NMR spectroscopy, where weaker rf irradiation results in what can be thought of as partial decoupling. In such an off-resonance decoupled spectrum, only 1H atoms bonded to a carbon atom will split its 13C signal. The coupling constant, indicating a small frequency difference between split signal peaks, would be smaller than in an undecoupled spectrum. Looking at a compound's off-resonance proton-decoupled 13C spectrum can show how many hydrogens are bonded to the carbon atoms to further help elucidate the chemical structure. For most organic compounds, carbons bonded to 3 hydrogens (methyls) would appear as quartets (4-peak signals), carbons bonded to 2 equivalent hydrogens would appear as triplets (3-peak signals), carbons bonded to 1 hydrogen would be doublets (2-peak signals), and carbons not bonded directly to any hydrogens would be singlets (1-peak signals). Another decoupling method is specific proton decoupling (also called band- selective or narrowband). Here the selected \\"narrow\\" 1H frequency band of the (soft) decoupling RF pulse covers only a certain part of all 1H signals present in the spectrum. This can serve two purposes: (1) decreasing the deposited energy through additionally adjusting the RF pulse shapes/using composite pulses, (2) elucidating connectivities of NMR nuclei (applicable with both heteronuclear and homonuclear decoupling). Point 2 can be accomplished via decoupling e.g. of a single 1H signal which then leads to the collapse of the J coupling pattern of only those observed heteronuclear or non-decoupled 1H signals which are J coupled to the irradiated 1H signal. Other parts of the spectrum remain unaffected. In other words this specific decoupling method is useful for signal assignments which is a crucial step for further analyses e.g. with the aim of solving a molecular structure. Note that more complex phenomena might be observed when for example the decoupled 1H nuclei are exchanging with non-decoupled 1H nuclei in the sample with the exchange process taking place on the NMR time scale. This is exploited e.g. with chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) contrast agents in in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

The building contained the studio of artist Nicola Marschall when he taught at the school. He taught painting, music, French, and German while employed here. He is credited with designing the first Confederate flag. He also designed the gray Confederate military uniform, influenced by the mid-1800s uniforms of the Austrian and French Armies. Built to serve as a female seminary from the time of construction, it was subsequently owned by the city of Marion from 1918 to 1930, at which time it was transferred to state ownership for use as a Perry County public school. Originally a three-story building, it was remodeled in 1930 with the removal of the uppermost floor from the building.

It was located in West Chicago, Illinois, USA. (based partly on US EPA NPL narrative) Searchable by license number 12-04932-01 on https://nrctracking.ornl.gov/tlts/ 551 F.2d 790 History The site was opened in 1931 by the Lindsay Light and Chemical Company. It processed ores like monazite to produce elements, including thorium and uranium. It also made gaslight mantles, and during World War II, hydrofluoric acid. In 1958, it became owned by American Potash and Chemical Company (AMPOT), which at one point had a 'Lindsay Chemical Division.' In 1967, AMPOT, and thus the facility, were bought by Kerr-McGee. The Rare Earths Facility was closed by Kerr-McGee in 1973. In 2005, KMCC was spun off from Kerr-McGee as Tronox, shortly before Kerr-McGee was acquired by Anadarko Petroleum. Tronox inherited responsibility for the Rare Earths Facility and other sites. Tronox went bankrupt in 2009 and shareholders sued Anadarko Petroleum, partly for having misled investors in Tronox about its environmental debts. Pollution In the early years, people from the surrounding community used the mill tailings as fill dirt in various properties, such as their yards and gardens. A woman who played in such a yard as a child later sued Kerr-McGee over her Hodgkin's disease and settled out of court in 1988. Radioactive waste from the plant was put in a local landfill that later became a public park called Reed-Keppler Park. Kress Creek and West Branch Dupage River (including sediments, banks, and floodplains) were contaminated by years of rainwater runoff from REF going into a storm sewer and then into the creek. The floodplain includes people's yards. The West Chicago Sewage Treatment Plant was contaminated when mill tailings from REF were used as fill dirt there. This also resulted in pollution of the West Branch Dupage River from runoff and erosion. In 1991, the Illinois Department of Public Health found elevated cancer rates in the community.

The first states that Chuvanskoye is simply named after the Chuvans themselves, whereas the second theory suggests that the name is derived from an older tribe, the Cha'achen, who used to live in the area and were a Yukaghir tribe from which the Chukchi themselves eventually developed. Chuvanskoye was founded in 1930 as a collective farm, which was reorganised in the 1940s as the Chuvanskoye Kolkhoz \\"Znamya Sovetov\\" (although other sources suggest the village was not formally established until 1951Rural Village of Chuvanskoye at Anadyr Municipal District official website).

There were editions in many languages, translated for example as Glasskriget (\\"Ice Cream War\\") in Swedish. Synopsis The comic opens with a profile of the three main characters, two boys and a girl. In the English version, they are named Christine, Max, and Paul. The story begins with the three children meeting at a house, where they plan to depart for a walk in the woods. But instead, Christine gets interested in a website which needs a \\"special code\\" to access, and as they enter the website, their computer literally sucks them in through a spiraling tunnel and down into another world. The children find themselves in an open field, still equipped with their hiking gear. In front of them is a long road, and a barricade manned by a guard wielding a large gleaming axe. He will not allow the children to pass, and after he searches them for identifications which they do not have they are forced to give him a fountain pen as a bribe. They keep trekking along the road and soon meet another border guard who will not let them through until they give him their compass, which the guard believes is a wristwatch. As the children reach the edge of the nearest settlement, yet another guard stops them, this time demanding that they pay him money in order to be let in. The children rush the guard, whereupon a group of men armed with spears arrests them and forces them to walk into a castle. Only then do the children realise that they have traveled back in time. The king speaks to the children while an unseen light shines down on them from above. The king believes the children to be spies from a nearby kingdom, and accuses them of attempting to steal his recipe for raspberry ice cream so that the children and \\"their people\\" can enjoy eating it with their own \\"kingdom's\\" wafer biscuits. The king announces he is going to put the children into his dungeon until their own king arrives with a recipe for making wafers. Christine protests, and the king reveals that in the distant past, the two kingdoms used to share a dessert made of raspberry ice cream with wafer cookies; the kingdom the children are in now produced the ice cream and the neighbouring kingdom produced the biscuits. But a conflict, the Raspberry Ice Cream War, broke out, and since then the two kingdoms have carefully guarded these secrets and neither has been able to produce the recipe held by the other kingdom. The children suggest to the king that they could solve the problem by making peace with the rival kingdom, but the king and all his guards laugh at the suggestion and then explain that they speak different languages and that the other kingdom's roads are not navigable. The children become frustrated. Christine begins drawing the yellow stars of the flag of the European Union on the castle's marble floor, and explaining that in Europe, where the children originate from, they still have countries, but not borders. The king's guards continue laughing at the children, but this time the king tells them to be quiet so he can keep listening. He asks if they have war in Europe, and they reply that they have not fought a war for fifty years, and goes on to explain how the fifteen countries of the EU manage to resolve differences without violence. The king is interested in hearing about their plans, and organises a feast for them to continue talking. After the feast, everyone seems to be happier, but Paul and Christine want to return to their own time. They find a wizard who promises they can return home if they jump into a pool of water. They run back to get Max, who is flirting with the king's daughter Dolly in another room. Max wants to stay, but the other children convince him to come back once he realises he will miss all of his favourite foods if he stays in the Middle Ages. All together, the children jump into the pool of water, though only after giving the wizard a Game Boy as he warned them the spell wouldn't work otherwise. With a splash the children are dumped back down the computer screen through which they entered, and gather themselves up to go on their originally planned hike \\"right across Europe\\". After the end of the story are three pages drawn in the same cartoon style educating children about the European Union and the story's relevance to the present reality, followed by a map and a list of addresses and telephone numbers. Reception The idea of a government publication directly targeting European children with arguments in favour of strengthening the European Union proved quickly unpopular in some countries, most notably the U.K. The British European Commission representative Geoffrey Martin decided to \\"pulp\\" 75,000 copies of the comic because he felt that the political point of view espoused by the comic was inappropriate, and Employment minister Andrew Smith described the comic as factually inaccurate. According to a Parliament press release from 1998, no copies of the comic were ever distributed in Britain,https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmhansrd/vo991111/text/91111w46.htm though other sources claim that there were some.http://www.eurofaq.freeuk.com/schools/parents_main.html The comic appears in the archives of the Easy Reading Corner of the European Union, and it can be downloaded via the EU bookshop or from an archive of the University of Nebraska.http://contentdm.unl.edu/utils/getfile/collection/comics/id/116/filename/117.pdf Translations The comic was published under similar titles in the other official languages of the 1998 European Union: *La guerre de la glace √† la framboise (French) *Der Krieg ums Himbeereis (German) *Krigen om jordb√¶risen (Danish) *Glasskriget (Swedish) *Œü œÄœåŒªŒµŒºŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ œÄŒ±Œ≥œâœÑŒøœç Œ≤Œ±œÑœåŒºŒøœÖœÅŒø (Greek) *La guerra del gelato al lampone (Italian) *De frambozenijsoorlog (Dutch) *A guerra dos gelados de framboesa (Portuguese) *Sota vadelmaj√§√§tel√∂st√§ (Finnish) *La guerra del helado de frambuesa (Spanish)http://ec.europa.eu/publications/archives/young/01/index_es.htm (the navigation bar at the top allows the reader to select different languages) ReferencesExternal links * EU Bookshop link * UNL link Category:European Commission ","title":"The Raspberry Ice Cream War"},{"id":"24549119","text":"Bastilla dicoela is a moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Alfred Jefferis Turner in 1909.

Founded in 1991 it is the longest-running ensemble of its type in the university. History The Oxford University Jazz Orchestra was founded by students in the early 1990s, initially as a word-of-mouth, unauditioned group, later developing into a full-fledged, professional standard big band. Notable alumni from the band include Canadian jazz vocalist Diane Nalini, trumpeter and NYJO musical director Mark Armstrong, London-based trombonist Callum Au, saxophonists Carlos Lopez-Real and Idris Rahman, and ENO conductor Stephen Higgins. OUJO has been a multiple-time winner at the BBC Radio 2 National Big Band Competition, and has performed at the Oeuf de Jazz Festival in Le Mans, the OK! Celebrity Ball in London, and the Bull's Head jazz venue in Barnes, west London, as well as many venues in and around Oxford, including the Oxford Union, the Jacqueline du Pr√© music building, the Jericho Tavern, and Blenheim Palace. In 2002, OUJO recorded the live LP Know Where You Are. The album featured special guest saxophonist Peter King. The orchestra has since made several recordings, including its New York EP. In more recent years, OUJO has performed at the Glasgow International Jazz Festival and performed jazz legend Kenny Wheeler's Sweet Time Suite at St Barnabas Church, Oxford, earning the praise of the composer. The band has also run open jazz workshops for Oxford University students. In 2010, OUJO toured New York City, performing at multiple venues including a performance for the Hudson Union Society at the Russian Tea Room and as part of the \\"After Work\\" series in Bryant Park. In 2012, the band toured to Canada, performing at the Toronto Downtown Jazz Festival, supporting the Mingus Big Band on the main stage at the Ottawa International Jazz Festival, and playing at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. In 2013, OUJO became an official Oxford University Music Society affiliated ensemble. Associated ensembles The Oxford University Jazz Orchestra was linked with the Oxford University Big Band (OUBB), another jazz orchestra based in Oxford. The group was based on a band formed in 1961 by NYJO founder Bill Ashton and Peter Hartley, revived in 2005 and run separately alongside OUJO. The ensemble became the first ever big band to perform in Oxford's leading concert hall, the Sheldonian Theatre, and performed at many venues throughout Oxford and London, including the Jacqueline Du Pr√© Auditorium and at the Bulls Head in Barnes. The band also performed with several notable soloists, including Dave O'Higgins, Mark Nightingale, and Mark Armstrong, whose four-part \\"Solstice Suite\\" was premiered by the OUBB. The OUBB toured annually, with locations including Barcelona, Delhi and Mumbai, the Montreux Jazz Festival, North Sea Jazz Festival, the Vienne Jazz Festival, and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. The Oxford University Big Band has since merged with OUJO. Trumpet Section alt= The OUJO trumpet section is a renowned jazz trumpet foursome, known for their outstanding ability to \\"shift air\\" (Tom Walsh, 2019). On top of attending weekly band rehearsals, the section holds bi-termly trumpet sectionals to hone and fine tune their \\"mega\\" sound (Tom Walsh, 2019). Each sectional is followed by an obligatory meal at Pizza Express where the trumpeters order \\"wrong\\" Peronis, a sharing platter for four, an assortment of pizzas and a bottle of wine (a tradition forged by Timothy \\"Ma Dudes\\" Davies).

Present activity OUJO performs regularly on the Oxford ball circuit, including at the famous Commemoration balls, having appeared in line-ups with major recording artists such as The Streets, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Natty, and Athlete. The band represents Oxford annually in a Varsity 'jazzoff' match against the Cambridge University Jazz Orchestra, its Cambridge equivalent. The group plays a musically diverse repertoire ranging from big band swing classics to contemporary and original compositions, as well as new arrangements of popular songs. In 2014, members of OUJO performed in a quintet with Wynton Marsalis for an event at Ertegun House. In 2015, OUJO performed Duke Ellington's choral composition The Sacred Concerts, in collaboration with Schola Cantorum of Oxford, saxophonist Nigel Hitchcock, and vocalist Tina May, and tap dancer Annette Walker at the Sheldonian Theatre.

He moved to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1642, and M.A. in 1645. He was ejected from his fellowship by the parliamentary commissioners under the ordinance of 13 February 1646, in 1650. At the Restoration he became rector of St Mildred, Poultry in London, to which St Mary Colechurch was annexed in 1671. He proceeded D.D. at Cambridge on 2 July 1663; on 3 November 1664 he was installed prebendary of St. Peter's, Westminster, and on 2 August 1667 prebendary of London (Chiswick stall).

Background Born Helen Martyn, she was a member of one of The Tribes of Galway, the merchant families who ruled Galway from the late medieval to the early modern era. Her exact relationship to contemporary members of the Martyn family is uncertain; Richard √ìge Martyn - father of Oliver √ìge Martyn - was of her generation, as perhaps was Walter √ìge Martyn (see Dominick Kirwin). An older eccleastical relative was Father Peter Martyn, who was well known as a superb preacher and died in 1645. Poor Clare Helen was professed into the Poor Clares in 1632, the same year as the sisters Catherine and Mary Bonaventure Browne. The nuns had been banished from Dublin in November 1630 and resettled at Bethleham, parish of Kilkenny West, County Westmeath. Within a few years there were sixty members, several of whom bore tribal surnames such as Font and Skerrett. Following a request from some citizens of Galway, twelve sisters and two novices moved there during or immediately after January 1642. The convent was located in or near what is now St. Augustine Street. Maria Gabriel became the first abbess of the convent; in September, her relative Richard √ìge Martyn, became Mayor of Galway. Both he and his law partner, Patrick Darcy, were patrons of the order. By then, Galway was at war. Exile and return During the Cromwellian occupation of Galway after 1652, the nuns were expelled from Augustine Street, as were Dominicans such as Julia Nolan. While some made a new home across the Corrib on Oile√°n Altanach,\\"Oile√°n Altanach\\": Logainm.ie: https://www.logainm.ie/en/1403729?s=Oile%u00e1n+Altanach many were forcibly dispersed abroad, mainly to Spain. Maria Gabriel remained in Galway, hiding with friends and relatives, along with a small number of other sisters. Only in the mid-1660s, following The Restoration, were the sisters able to take in more members, including sisters who returned from Spain. The Galway convent continues to this day, and at least three other members of the Martyn family were sisters or abbess's.

After killing three of them, Police Captain John Kiley (Karl Malden) informs the mob's boss that an unknown boy has begun killing his mob partners. Kiley flies to Portugal and begins assembling the pieces of the puzzle. (Kiley and the mob boss had been partners in 1952, but turned to a vicious rivalry from opposing sides of the law.) With the help of a confidential informant, he finds out Raymond Castor (Christopher Mitchum) has kidnapped Alfredi's daughter, Tania (Olivia Hussey). He goes to Spain to find him and he discovers a garage where Raymond works. This sends Kiley to Torrej√≥n, to talk with Raymond's business partner, another mechanic. He finds Raymond's apartment, at the \\"Torres Blancas\\" in the Avenida Am√©rica de Madrid. Raymond's apartment is a treasure of information, but the only personal picture shows Raymond as a young boy on the beach with his parents. Meanwhile, he and Tania, after a rocky start (she attempts numerous escapes and tries to kill him with a sharpened closet pole), begin to fall in love.

Known for his work in the area of curriculum theory, Pinar is strongly associated with the reconceptualist movement in curriculum theory since the early 1970s. In the early 1970s, along with Madeleine Grumet, Pinar introduced the notion of currere, shifting in a radical manner the notion of curriculum as a noun to curriculum as a verb. Apart from his fundamental contributions to theory, Pinar is notable for establishing the Journal of Curriculum Theorizing, founding the Bergamo Conference on Curriculum Theory and Classroom Practice, and founding the International Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies. Although Pinar is known best for his publications concerning curriculum theory, he has also spoken about and written on many other topics, including education, cultural studies, international studies, and queer studies. Life and works Before taking up the post of Canada Research Chair at the University of British Columbia in 2005, Pinar taught at Louisiana State University where, in his capacity as St. Bernard Parish Alumni Endowed Professor, he taught curriculum theory. He has also served as the Frank Talbott Professor at the University of Virginia and the A. Lindsay O'Connor Professor of American Institutions at Colgate University. Additionally, he has held visiting appointments at Teachers College, Columbia University, Ohio State University, the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, the University of Alberta, among other institutions. He is presently at the University of British Columbia. In 1969, Pinar graduated from Ohio State University with a BS in Education and subsequently taught English at the Paul D. Schreiber High School in Port Washington, Long Island, New York, from 1969 to 1971.UBC.ca Pinar then returned to Ohio State University to obtain a MA (1970) and PhD (1972). Pinar is the Founding Editor of Journal of Curriculum Theorizing,JCT: Journal of Curriculum Theorizing is an interdisciplinary journal of curriculum studies. It offers an academic forum for scholarly discussions of curriculum. Historically aligned with the \\"reconceptualist\\" movement in curriculum theorizing, and oriented toward informing and affecting classroom practice, JCT presents compelling pieces within forms that challenge disciplinary, genre, and textual boundaries. See: JCTonline.org creating the first issue in 1979. He also founded, with Janet Miller, the Bergamo Conference on Curriculum Theory and Classroom Practice. Since then, he has established a number of associations, including the International Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies, of which he is the President, and the American Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies, for which he serves as Conference Committee chair. Long associated with the \\"reconceptualist movement\\" to describe the field as it appeared in the 1970s, Pinar's use of the term \\"reconceptualization,\\" as he notes in \\"A Farewell and a Celebration,\\" is \\"not dramatic enough\\" and more aptly described as an \\"intellectual breakthrough.\\"Pinar, W. (1999). Introduction: A Farewell and a Celebration. In William Pinar (Ed.), Contemporary Curriculum Discourses (pp. xi‚Äìxx), p. xi. This particular movement in the history of the field of curriculum theory is described in detail in Understanding Curriculum. Pinar notes, reflecting back upon the reconceptualist movement of the field and the comments of Bill Pilder at the first conference in Rochester, that The aim of the reconceptualist movement was to \\"understand, not just implement or evaluate, the curriculum\\".Pinar (1999). p. xiv As such, we see, as described in Understanding Curriculum, the movement open up to and embrace a variety of different forms of praxis like \\"history, politics, race, gender, phenomenology, postmodernism, autobiography, aesthetics, theology, the institution of schooling, the world\\".Pinar (1999). p. xiv Put differently, we see a significant shift from the usually taken-for-granted bureaucratization of schooling and the schooled experience to the intellectual exploration of a field by all. Unlike the early, influential days and subsequent preoccupation with the \\"Tyler Rationale\\", Pinar and his many colleagues aimed to move beyond the narrowly defined prescriptions and procedures often attributed to Ralph Tyler. Still, as Pinar writes in Contemporary Curriculum Discourses, this Kuhnian-like \\"shift\\" has been slow. Even to this day, the beginning of the 21st century, the reconceptualist movement is still to be felt: Major works A prolific scholar in his right, Pinar also has established a number of academic journals and scholarly organizations, founding and establishing Journal of Curriculum Theorizing, founding the Bergamo Conference on Curriculum Theory and Classroom Practice, as well as the founding and presiding over the International Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies.

He is faculty member of Monash University, In 1971, he participated in the Liberation War of Bangladesh. A career civil servant, he served as the Principal Secretary to the government of Bangladesh until 2006. He was nominated by Bangladesh for election to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and served from 2005‚Äì09. He was until 2006 Chief Editor of the Encyclopedia of Flora and Fauna of Bangladesh, the first volumes of which were published in 2008 by Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Participation in War of Liberation Bangladesh's war of liberation commenced on 25 March 1971. At that time, Siddiqui was serving as the Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) of Norail. He quit his job and walked to India to participate in the war against the Pakistani army. After the establishment of Bangladesh on 16 December 1971, he returned home and was appointed as the Deputy Commissioner (DC) and District Magistrate of the Khulna District. Research=Latest work While teaching at Monash University, Siddiqui co-authored a book on diplomacy which was published in 2009.Monash University description of Siddiqui book Cocktail ideology and poverty Recently he completed a project on \\"Deadly Sins of Cocktail Ideology and the Vicious Cycle of Poverty in Developing Countries\\". The objective of the research was to delineate the processes which cause, maintain, aggravate and reduce poverty in a typical village in Bangladesh, based on field work. The project evaluates the impact of economic and non-economic factors on poverty and establishes the role of ideology and beliefs in the whole process. Siddiqui coined the term \\"cocktail ideology\\" to characterise the cultural profile of the Bangladeshi people in the 21st century. A \\"cocktail ideology\\", combining the retrogressive interpretation of religion and tradition with vulgar elements of the so-called modernity, has emerged in many developing countries since the 1960s and the population of Bangladesh, among other developing courtiers, reflects uneasy and tense co-existence of these two components. Women and middle-aged men are, in general, the bearers of tradition and religious orthodoxy, while the younger generation tends to carry the flag for \\"decadent modernity\\". It has been found that the poor tend to be more affected by this \\"cocktail ideology\\" than any other class of society. MegaCity governance The term megalopolis was first used in 1940 by Lewis Mumford to refer to the great mega cities growing uncontrollably. Manuel Castells called the emergence of such mega cities of eight illion or more people a feature of 21st century urbanisation. Kamal Siddiqui, in association with Archana Ghosh, Sharit K. Bhowmik, Shahid A Siddiqi, Madhulika Mitra, Shchi Kapuria, Nilay Ranjan and Jamshed Ahmed researched the growth of mega cities in South Asia, namely Mumbai, Delhi, Dhaka, Kolkata and Karachi which will have in 2015 a population of 23 million, 21 million, 18 million, 17 million and 16 million respectively. Kamal Siddiqui and his team identified the characteristics of these mega cities, marked with corruption, poor accountability, lack of transparency and perverse prioritisation. Work for children's rights Siddiqui acted as Chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Standing Committee on Child Rights of the government of Bangladesh from January 2002. On 12 March 2003 he organised an International Workshop on Child Labour in Dhaka under the auspices of Asian Cooperation Dialogue (ACD). In September 2003 he led the Bangladesh delegation to the meeting of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva to review the second periodic report on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Bangladesh. Since March 2004, he acted as the Chairman of the National Committee to suggest the organizational set-up of the office of Independent Children Commissioner for Bangladesh. He led a Bangladesh Government delegation to France, Norway and Sweden in February 2004 to study the Children Ombudsman institution in these countries with a view to setting up such an institution in Bangladesh. Since February 2005 he has been serving as the Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child of United Nations High Commission for Human Rights. His achievements during the last three years include the release of a large number of children from jails, establishment of nurseries in prisons and safe homes, raising the age of criminal liability and converting correction centres for children into development centres. Recognized as a champion of children by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in its landmark judgement in a child rights case in 2003, owing to these activities.  Social formation in Dhaka City  This is a study which takes stock of the social formation of Dhaka city as it has evolved in the latter half of the 20th century. Kamal Siddiqui has carried out this research in association with Sayeda Rowshan Qadir, Sitara Alamgir and Sayeedul Huq.http://www.sai.uni- heidelberg.de/abt/intwep/zingel/Siddiqui1990.pdf While the book sets out with a focus on the historical background of Dhaka, its objective is to prepare an account of social structure of Dhaka, first as the provincial capital of the then East Pakistan and of Bangladesh since latter's emergence in 1971. As it has been observed, \\"the growth of Dhaka city has been predominantly the result of net migration, which accounted for 62.9 per cent of population growth between 1961 and 1974 and 70.5 percent between 1974 and 1981 ..., about 60 percent of Dhaka's population growth between 1981 and 2000 is anticipated to be the result of net migration ... The push factors in connection with migration include over-population, floods and natural disasters, erosion, growing landlessness and exploitation, by the rural elites and money lenders. The pull factors are employment opportunities in the informal sector, relief activities and the statutory ration system in Dhaka city under which, until recently, foodstuffs were sold at substantially subsidised prices.\\" (p. 16). As many as ten thousand households of the city have been investigated to deduce the true class of different classes of people. In addition, special account was taken of certain selected groups, namely, the residents of Dhaka government colonies, the \\"richest people\\" of Dhaka city, the beggars, prostitutes and criminals. Local government in Bangladesh The revised third edition of the book was published in 2005. The book covers urban and rural local government systems of Bangladesh.

Extensive trade networks existed at this time, particularly among the many local cultural expressions of the Hopewell communities. The Goodall pattern stretched from the southern tip of Lake Michigan, east across northern Indiana, to the Ohio border, then northward, covering central Michigan, almost reaching to Saginaw Bay on the east and Grand Traverse Bay to the north. The culture is named for the Goodall Site in northwest Indiana.Hopewell Archeology: The Newsletter of Hopewell Archeology in the Ohio River Valley; 4. Current Research on the Goodall Focus; Volume 2, Number 1, October 1996 Defining artifact Glacial Kame is a widespread of the northern late archaic cultural manifestations. Cemeteries were customarily made in sand and gravel ridges formed by glacial outwash called \\"kames\\". Not all human burials in a kame are necessarily from the same time period, those which reflect similar methods and are associated with similar materials are related to some degree. # Glacial Kame cemeteries contain from only a few to several dozen burials. The tightly flexed human remains, usually singly but sometimes paired, were placed in circular pits barely large enough to permit placement of the body. # If a stratum of hard silt overlay the more easily removed sands and gravels, only the narrowest possible disturbance was created through the former. # Males and females representing all age groups were placed in these cemeteries.Kellar, James H.; An Introduction to the Prehistory of Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana Historical Society; Indianapolis, Indiana; 1973 # Powdered ocher, contains iron oxides and ranges in color from bright yellow to a rich orange-red. # Large drilled sandal-sole-shaped and circular gorgets were cut from wall sections of marine molluscans. # A distinctive artifact is the so-called \\"birdstone.\\" Commonly carved from slate, it has a profile resembling the head, body, and tail of a stylized bird. # A symbolic spear-thrower weight comparable to that of the bannerstone. There is no clear associations to confirm this idea. # Other artifacts include copper and shell beads, some made from the columella of marine shells, long bone pins, and bone awls. Ceramics Ceramics tend to come from middens and contain expanding and contracting stemmed projectile points and obsidian flakes.

It marked the fifth wave of violence during the ongoing insurgency by the Houthis against the government. In November 2009, the conflict spread across the border into neighboring Saudi Arabia. This conflict led to the Saudi military's incursion into Yemen, marking the first military operation conducted by Saudi Arabia since 1991. Background Skirmishes and clashes between the two sides began in June 2009, when nine foreigners were abducted during a picnic in the Saada Governorate. Three bodies were found which belonged to a South Korean teacher and two German nurses. In addition, two German children were freed in May 2010 by Saudi and Yemeni forces. The remaining party members are still missing, and their current status is unknown. It remains unclear who was behind the abduction. Initial official statements suggested Houthi rebels had seized the group. However, according to Yemen's news agency, Houthi rebels accused drug cartels of the kidnapping and the three subsequent murders. A spokesman for the insurgents accused regional tribes of being responsible for the kidnappings and slayings. A government committee criticized the fighters for not abiding by an agreement to end hostilities announced by the Yemeni president in July 2008. In July and early August 2009, local officials said the fighters had taken control of parts of the Saada Governorate, including a vital army post near the province's capital. Operation= August‚ÄìSeptember, 2009  After the government promised to adopt an \\"iron fist\\" policy against the rebels, Yemeni troops backed by tanks and fighter aircraft launched a major offensive on rebel strongholds on the 11th of August 2009. Air, artillery, and missile attacks targeted the Malaheedh, Mahadher, Khafji, and Hasama districts, including the headquarters of the rebel leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi. After two days of bombardment, the Yemeni government offered ceasefire terms to the rebels, which included demands for information on the six hostages who disappeared back in June. The rebels rejected the terms, and the fighting continued. After three weeks, the provincial capital Sa'dah was further cut off. Mobile landlines were suspended after the Houthis shelled a communications tower in the neighboring Amran province. The rebels held out in Sa'dah neighborhoods and old mountain fortresses around the city. In September, the first of many ceasefires was agreed. The Yemeni army pushed to secure the road that links Sa'dah to Harf Sufyan, launching salvos of shells to \\"demine\\" and \\"remove bombs\\" for humanitarian convoys. On the 17th of September, an airstrike claimed the lives of more than 80 people in a camp for displaced people in the 'Amran Governorate'. On the same day, rebels and government forces also saw massive military action around Sa'dah. Yemeni press releases and military officials claimed that several Houthi leaders were among the dead. Eid attacks Another ceasefire was agreed on the 19th of September in commemoration of the Islamic holiday, Eid ul-fitr. The government announced on state television that the ceasefire would go into effect for three days, with the possibility of becoming a permanent ceasefire upon certain conditions being met. The Houthis responded by saying they would abide by the ceasefire in exchange for prisoners, some of which they claimed had been held for years. However, both sides claimed that the other had not laid down arms. The Houthis asserted that the government continued air and rocket attacks. In contrast, the government claimed the Houthis launched attacks in the Amran and Saada provinces. A Human Rights Watch report noted how the Houthis attacked the village of Mudaqqa on 16th of September, prompting a government response. The next day, the rebels attacked Sa'dah from three directions in a pre-dawn strike. Hundreds of fighters used at least 70 vehicles to assault checkpoints in the city while storming the Republican Palace. After four hours of combat, the attack was repelled by government air support. The Yemeni government claimed to have killed 153 rebels and captured 70, while only having suffered two deaths and 20 injuries. October, 2009 Fighting continued into October, with Houthi rebels claiming to have captured the town of Munabbih, one of the fifteen districts of the Sa'dah governorate. On the 2nd of October 2009, the Houthis announced that they had successfully shot down a Yemen Air Force MiG-21 fighter jet in the al-Sha'af district. A senior Yemeni military official denied the claim and said the plane ran into a mountain peak because of a technical fault. Contrary to state media, another Yemeni military commander told the AFP news agency that the aircraft had been \\"flying at low altitude\\" when it was hit. Three days later, a Yemeni Sukhoi jet crashed northeast of Sa'dah in the Alanad district; the rebels claimed to have shot it down while the government again attributed the crash to technical problems. Further reports by Yemeni sources also claim these planes were shot down, adding that agents of Hezbollah armed with shoulder-fired missiles were responsible. The Saudi Al-Arabiya and Kuwaiti Al-Seyassah news networks noted that a group of Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon was killed or captured by Yemeni forces. The official Yemen News Agency reported more heavy fighting in Sa'dah on the 9th of October, with Houthis launching suicide attacks and gaining some territory before government forces gained the upper hand, killing 100 and wounding more than 280 people. Dozens more casualties were reported in the following days. In the offensive's tenth week, the rebels captured a military base near the Saudi border in the Razeh district of Sa'dah governorate. The fighters also seized a military center, a government building, and even Razeh's airport. The month of October saw the involvement of Somali forces alongside the Houthis. Some 200 Somali recruits arrived on boats via the Red Sea and were mainly sent on suicide missions against government and military targets in Saada City. Yemen would later claim to have captured 28 Somali troops. Other sources indicated that Somali fighters were used to dig trenches to hide ammunition and launch ambushes from the mountains. By December, a Somali diplomat claimed that many Somali refugees faced abduction by the Houthis as they fled into Saudi Arabia. Those who refused faced execution. Saudi incursion By early November, the rebels stated that Saudi Arabia was permitting Yemeni army units to launch attacks across the border from a base in Jabal al-Dukhan, which the Yemeni government later denied. The conflict spilled into the neighboring Saudi Arabia on the 3rd of November 2009 when a Saudi border patrol was ambushed in a cross-border attack, killing one soldier and wounding eleven more. The Kingdom's news agency later added that a second soldier died from injuries suffered during the fight. Following the cross-border ambush on the 3rd of November, Saudi Arabia responded by moving troops to the border and striking Houthi positions on the 5th of November 2009, using F-15 and Tornado jets. Saudi Arabia denied hitting any targets inside Yemen, but it was reported that six Yemeni locations suffered rocket attacks, one of which received 100 rockets in one hour. Residents of the coastal city of Jizan reported hearing fighter jets and seeing armored convoys move towards the border. The city's King Fahd Hospital was also placed on alert for treating military casualties. A Saudi government adviser later said no decision had yet been taken to send troops across the border, but made clear Riyadh was no longer prepared to tolerate the Yemeni rebels. By the 8th of November 2009, Saudi Arabia confirmed that it had entered the fray, claiming to have \\"regained control\\" of the Jabal al-Dukhan mountain from the rebels. Around this time, Jordanian commandos, who had arrived in Saudi camps a few days prior, backed up Saudi forces in efforts to take Al-Dukhan mountain. The Jordanians reportedly sustained casualties in the attacks. As the war extended into December, reports indicated that Moroccan special forces had joined the 2,000 Jordanian commandos on the ground. Clashes continued throughout the month of December along the border. As the fighting extended into January, Samira al-Madani became the first female journalist in Saudi Arabian history to report from the battlefield near the border. She also interviewed several soldiers and Prince Gazan Mohamed bin Nasser bin Abdul Aziz, who briefed her on the situation. Truce Attempts The Yemeni government launched a direct attack into Saada on the 7th of December 2009. Forces attacked the barricaded strongholds of the city hoping to end the battle quickly and decisively. Fighting continued past the 11th of December 2009 with Houthi forces still holding out in barricaded houses of the Old City. The battle for the city appeared to have ended following the arrest of some 200 fighters after a week and a half of fighting. Abdul Malik al-Houthi reportedly suffered injuries during the fighting, but managed to escape to safety as Yemeni forces continued to engage rebels throughout the province. By the 1st of January 2010, Yemen's Higher Security Committee proposed a ceasefire, which was rejected. Houthi leader Abdul Malek al-Houthi said they would stop fighting to prevent further civilian casualties and suggested the withdrawal was a gesture for peace. Saudi General Said Al-Ghamdi confirmed that the Houthis had ceased fire as a result of the determined Saudi assault. Prince Khalid bin Sultan announced that the Houthis were defeated though did not declare an end to the Saudi bombing campaign, aimed at preventing any future incursions into the Kingdom. On the 30th of January 2010, Houthi rebels appeared to have accepted the Yemeni government truce offer. Clashes continue Following the truce, the Houthis claimed that Saudis continued with air and missile attacks.Press TV Saudis 'launch 17 air raids' on Houthis , 30January 2010 The situation deteriorated on the 31st of January 2010 after the Yemeni government turned down a truce offer by the Houthis. Made by Abdel- Malik al-Houthi, the offer was rejected because he demanded that the government end its military operations first. Yemen continued with the military offensive, killing 12 Houthis in the process. Early February saw a new round of attacks by Yemeni forces on Sa'ada. Saudi Arabia also rejoined the fight with air raids. On February 5th, 2010, the Yemeni court sentenced Yayha Al-Houthi, the brother of the Houthis' leader Abdul-Malek Al-Houthi, to 15 years imprisonment. The Yemeni MP was tried in absentia due to his involvement in the Shia insurgency. On the 6th of February 2010, the Houthis renewed their attacks against the Yemeni government, killing 15 Yemeni soldiers in an ambush in Wadi Al-Jabara district and killing 8 soldiers during street battles in Sa'dah city that day. The same day, Saudi air raids destroyed four civilian residences and injured two women. The Saudi military fired 174 rockets and mortars at the rebel controlled Al-Dhaher, Qamamat, Ghafereh, Al-Rammadiat and Shada districts. The last round of skirmishes occurred on the 11th of February 2010 with five soldiers and thirteen rebels dying in the Amran governorate. Fighting also continued in Sa'dah city and killed seven soldiers and eleven rebels. Houthis repulsed an attempted army infiltration in the Al-Aqab district killing an unspecified number of Yemeni soldiers. Meanwhile, Saudis carried out 13 air raids on the Harf Sufyan, Jouan and Jebel Talan districts Inside Saada City During the fighting, roughly 20,000 refugees fled to the provincial capital. The increase in population forced residents to share houses with refugees, along with food and water. Street fights and the continual breaking of ceasefires posed many problems for civilians, along with hot days and rainy nights. Mobile phone networks were cutoff during the beginning of war, making it nearly impossible to communicate with the outside world. United Nations aide workers were forced to pull out, but a few remained, often finding themselves pinned down in their homes. Government operations were concentrated primarily in the northern parts of the Old City, including the residential neighborhoods of Al-Rout, Al-Shaab, Al- Jarba, Al-Toot, and Bab Najran. The Bab Najran neighborhood in particular was cited as a main rebel stronghold and suffered frequent shelling from tanks and artillery. Houthi sources claimed that government forces used bulldozers to clear houses and other rebel positions during operations. A letter from a worker with the Islamic Relief organization provided a detailed account from the ground. Schools became refugee collection centers and prices were hiked due to the closures of shops and businesses. Mortars, gunmen, and a government-imposed curfew hindered the efforts of refugees and aid workers to travel freely. Since the only hospital was located in the bombarded Old City, aid groups within Saada became the only source of the population's limited food, water, and improvised shelter. Truce On the 12th of February 2010, the Houthis accepted the government's ceasefire proposal. A Yemeni General claimed the Houthis violated the ceasefire on the same day, claiming that four soldiers were killed in two districts while adding that an attempt was made to assassinate him. The Houthis denied responsibility for this attack.Press TV Houthis deny firing at govt. aircraft As the remainder of February progressed, it became clear that the fighting had ended. By the 25th, reports indicated that the Houthis, under the conditions that they would remain masked and would not be followed, had agreed to leave their final positions in northern Saada City. Yemeni engineers then cleared homes from mines and booby traps. A United Nations team, including a representative of the UNHCR, was finally allowed into Saada City and surrounding refugee camps in April 2010. Casualties=Death toll The exact breakdown of the casualties is unknown as neither side has released any casualty figures. However, official news reports on 6th of February 2010 claimed that the Yemeni government suffered at least 126 casualties, including 19 tribal fighters, two generals, Sa'dah's regional security chief and three security guards.Yemeni government casualties: , , , , , , , , , ,, , , , , , , , , , The Yemeni government claimed to have killed 600 Houthi fighters in the first two months of the offensive, although this cannot be verified. On the 23rd of January 2010, the Saudi government released new figures confirming 133 soldiers had been killed and six were still missing.Saudi: Bodies of 20 soldiers found on Yemen border , 23January 2010 Refugee crisis Upon the onset of the conflict, camps were set up along the border area between Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Other camps and settlements were dispersed throughout the Hajjah, Amran, and Al-Jawf provinces. Aid agencies tried organizing routes through Saudi Arabia, since domestic roads into the country were generally off limits. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Yemen Red Crescent Society sponsored four camps for internally displaced persons on the outskirts of and within the city, but one had to be dismantled and the refugees moved after being caught in crossfire. Prior to the war, an estimated 120,000 were already displaced as a result of the four previous wars. The northwestern village of Al-Mazrak became the main collection center for refugees with three camps set up for 23,000 displaced persons and 70,000 more outside the camp. UNICEF played a major role in creating educational environments for children and finding and hiring instructors. The village was home to the only camp that was open to United Nations workers during the war. International tensions The conflict took international dimension in late October 2009 with clashes between the Houthis and Saudi security forces near the border. Since the beginning of the operation, the Houthis accused Saudi Arabia of supporting the Yemeni government and conducting bombing raids into Yemen. Prior to this, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh held talks in the Moroccan city of Agadir with Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud and King Abdullah II of Jordan. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Morocco would later play roles in the fight against the Houthis. Morocco, which had severed ties with Iran in March of that year, noted that Tehran's alleged backing of the Houthis helped in the decision to later send troops. Around this period, Yemeni officials claimed to have captured a boat in the Red Sea that was transporting anti-tank shells. Five Iranian \\"instructors\\" were also captured. Various official Iranian sources responded, calling it a politically motivated fabrication and stating that the ship was traveling for business activities and was carrying no consignment. In Saana, the government shut down an Iranian sponsored hospital after suspicions that the staff, which included eight Iranians, were providing aid to the rebels. Government officials claimed that hospital services were closed down due to a delay in rent payments, but security surrounded and blocked off patients from receiving aid. As the Hajj approached during the month of November, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad noted that \\"appropriate measures\\" would be taken in case Iranian pilgrims faced restrictions. On the 13th of November 2009, the Iranian group Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom denounced the Yemeni and Saudi offensives against the Houthis. Two days later, Iranian Speaker of Parliament Ali Larijani accused the United States of cooperating with the Saudi campaign. A few days later, Iran announced plans to send warships to the Gulf of Aden as a means of protecting trade routes against Somali pirates. This move coincided with the Saudi naval blockade in the Red Sea to stop arms shipments allegedly from Tehran and Eritrea to the Houthis. Three Saudi warships with marine commandos from the Yanbu naval base patrolled the waters off the coast of northern Yemen.

It covers a period of about 65 years starting from 1626 and ending to 1689. While main objective of the Karina is to state how the family of Jedhes went on prospering day by day, it also throws light on the formative period of Maratha Empire. Background The Jedhes, the Khopades, the Bandals and the Naik-Nimbalkars were the prominent Deshmukhs of Maval. Out of these, Jedhes of Kaari, in present day Bhor, were the Deshmukhs of 'Rohid Khora',which includes the forts of Raireshwar and Rohideshwar in the Maval region of the modern Pune district, which is near Bhor about 48 km towards south of Pune. Being the leaders of their region, they were privileged persons and enjoyed a high status in political, social and economic life of the region. Kanhoji Jedhe is regarded as the real founder of the Jedhe family as he and his son Baji, popularly known as Sarjerao Jedhe, brought their family to prominence by rendering valuable services to Shivaji, the founder of Maratha Empire in the 17th century. Jedhe Shakawali (chronology) and Jedhe Karina (statement) are their family records which is now regarded as the genuine evidence for many historical events. Contents Jedhe Karina consists of an account the progress of Jedhe family starting from the death of Malik Ambar in 1626 and ending with Sambhaji‚Äôs capture in 1689. Wherever the year of an event is mentioned, it is given in terms ‚ÄòShaliwahan Shaka‚Äô era which is roughly 78 years behind of the Julian calendar year. Select Events *This Karina is of Jedhe Deshmukh, Taluka Bhor, Fort Rohida, to the following effect :- When the partition between our ancestors and the Khopade Deshmukhs was made by the judges and the family jurors, the Bhor region came to the share of the Jedhes and the Utroli region was assigned to the Khopades. *Thereupon the Jedhes managed the cultivation and revenue collection of the Bhor region and undertook great trouble for the sake of the forts, by the order of the Nizam Shah. They collected troops, conducted campaigns and fought battles at great risk. *They also managed the governmental work so well, that the Nizam Shah was highly pleased and gave village Kari as Inam to our ancestor Naikji Naik. *His son Kanhoji Naik Jedhe, by the strength of his sword and of his troops, bravely resisted Chandrarao More and Krishnaji Naik Bandal, who used to levy forced contributions upon the twelve Mavals. *By order of Malik Ambar, Kanhoji forcibly captured fort Kelanja (Mohangad) with the aid of rope ladders. *Malik Ambar died in the month of Vaishakh of Shaka 1578 (May 1626) Sometime thereafter this territory went to the share of Adil Shah. *In the month of Bhadrapada of Shaka 1554 (September 1632) Shahaji brought out a new Nizamshahi Prince and crowned him at Pemgiri near Ahmednagar. *Soon (in 1635) Shahaji carried the Prince to fort Mahuli which was besieged by Ranadullakhan and Kanhoji on behalf of Adil Shah. Ranadullakhan secretly carried out negotiations with Shahaji for surrender. Peace was made with the help of Kanhoji. *Kanhoji‚Äôs services were transferred from Ranadullakhan to Shahaji on his request to Adil Shah. *Shahaji sent Shivaji to Pune with Shamrajpant Peshwe, Mankoji Dahatonde, Balaji Hari Majalasi together with clerks and a body of cavalry. Houses were built for Shivaji and others and fort Kondana (Sinhagad) was captured. *Adil Shah heard of this and got very angry. He put Shahaji, Kanhoji and Dadaji Krishna in jail. *Kondana was given back to Adil Shah and peace was made. *Upon release, Shahaji sent Kanhoji to Shivaji saying ‚ÄòPeople of Maval respect you highly. I intend to send you to help Shivaji. Be loyal to him.‚Äô Thereupon Kanhoji took the oath.

Its only other habitat as of 2020 is on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. The species is especially vulnerable to fire, and much of its habitat was burnt during the 2019-2020 bushfire season in Australia. The bee gets its common name by its habit of burrowing into wood. It is not a social species and does not produce honey, but it is an important pollinator for several species of Australian native plants. Description  It was originally described by F. Smith in 1851 as Lestis aeratus.Smith, F. 1851. Notes on the habits of Australian Hymenoptera. Transactions of the Entomological Society of London ns 1: 179‚Äì181, pl. xvi figs 4, 5 [180]. Its specific epithet is the Latin adjective aerata, meaning \\"bronzed\\". As its name implies, the golden-green carpenter bee is a metallic green in colour, although it may appear purplish or bluish from some angles. A large stocky bee (at nearly , one of the largest native bees in southern Australia), it is often heard by its loud low-pitched buzzing while flying between flowers. The male has yellow face markings. The bee does have a sting which is potentially painful, although no stings have been recorded. Distribution and habitat  The natural distribution was southeastern New South Wales from Sydney southwards (where it overlaps with X. bombylans), and into Victoria and southeastern South Australia. However, the green carpenter bee went extinct on mainland South Australia in 1906 and in Victoria in 1938. Apart from conservation areas around Sydney, and in the Great Dividing Range, it exists only on the western half of Kangaroo Island in SA. They can be seen from spring to autumn, commonly feeding at pea flowers of the family Fabaceae, such as Gompholobium species, including Gompholobium latifolium in spring, and Pultenaea elliptica in autumn. Flowers of Leucopogon and Leptospermum are also visited.Species Xylocopa (Lestis) aeratus (Smith, 1851) Australian Biological Resources Study Australian Faunal Directory Behaviour  The golden-green carpenter bee nests by hollowing out stalks of grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea), or soft wood such as Banksia, Casuarina, Melaleuca and Leptospermum. The female excavates a tunnel with her jaws and picks up and dumps the wood shavings outside. The hollow can reach long by 1.1-1.4 cm diameter. Larger pieces of wood may allow for multiple tunnels. Several female bees may use a nest, one breeding and the others guarding. A bee defends the 0.7-1.0 cm wide entrance by blocking it with its abdomen (compare Allodapula). Both male and female bees may overwinter within the tunnels. The tunnels are partitioned into several cells, where the mother bee lays an egg in each accompanied by provisions of nectar and pollen. Conservation  Habitat clearing and large, intense bushfires led to extinction in some areas. The last green carpenter bee seen in Victoria was in December 1938 in the Grampians, not long before the Black Friday fires of January 1939. Fire destroys the dead wood the bee needs for nesting, and the flowers which it needs all the time. In 2007 a huge fire destroyed much of the vegetation in Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo Island, but left dry grass-tree stalks in the adjacent areas which were colonised by the bees. Conservationists also developed artificial nesting stalks to support the bee population until new banksia became available, which were placed in the fire- affected areas where the bee still occurred. Almost 300 female carpenter bees used the artificial stalks to raise their young, until disaster struck in the 2019-2020 bushfire season in Australia. Not only were the areas of the artificial stalks destroyed, but much of the old banksia habitat on Kangaroo Island, and the NSW fires destroyed large areas of habitat there too.

Schow and starring Sophie Monk, Tad Hilgenbrink and William Sadler. Plot Tyler is obsessed with the horror film The Hills Run Red, considered the scariest movie ever made, with the deranged serial killer Babyface in the lead role. However, the film's director, Wilson Wyler Concannon, disappeared years ago and there is no known copy of the film. Tyler's obsession with the film leads him to neglect his girlfriend Serena. When Tyler discovers that Concannon's daughter Alexa works in a night club as a stripper, he decides to meet her and ask about the lost film. He visits Alexa and asks her about the project. As she gives him a nude lap dance, the audience sees Serena cheating on Tyler with their best friend Lalo. Alexa informs Tyler that the movie might be in her father's home in the woods. Tyler drives out to Concannon's home, accompanied by Serena, Lalo, and Alexa. On the way, they are bound and attacked by rednecks, who threaten to rape Alexa and Serena. Babyface appears and kills the assaulters before chasing the teens into the woods, and then disappears. Tyler breaks into the house and finds a red room that contains many film reels hanging from the ceiling. When Tyler hears pain-filled screams, he finds Alexa tied to a bed and releases her. The two leave the house and find Serena, but Babyface breaks through the door, brutally throws Tyler into a wall and injures Serena. Alexa is slammed against the wall by Babyface and says \\"fetch,\\" telling him to run after Serena. Tyler drops unconscious as Alexa approaches him, smiling. Serena hides under the car parked in front of the house. Babyface enters a barn as Serena quietly moves to an adjacent building. Serena is shocked to find bloodied bodies in the room, which turns out to be a smoke house. When Babyface goes inside the smoke house, he doesn't find her and leaves. Serena emerges from a drum that was used to store blood and changes clothes. However, when she leaves the smoke house, Babyface jumps down at her from the roof. Tyler wakes and finds himself tied to a wheelchair. On the shelves behind him are many film reels, all titled The Hills Run Red. Tyler is shocked when Concannon, the missing director of the film, appears. Concannon tells him the secret behind the scares in his film, and plays a video of twenty years before, when the film was in shooting. Concannon is dissatisfied with the actor portraying Babyface, and angrily explains to him how to properly make a scene feel scary. He takes Babyface's costume and axe, and violently axes the actor to death. It is then that the reason why screenings were canceled and all actors vanished is revealed: the film was considered too violent, and all the death scenes in it were real. He also tells Tyler that Alexa was only thirteen years old when she \\"had him\\", indicating Babyface is a child born of incest between father and daughter. Babyface is called away by Wilson and returns to the barn, leaving Serena alone. She breaks free from her binds and successfully escapes the room. Alexa stabs Lalo in the chest, killing him. Concannon tells his daughter he's the only director of the family and shoots her. Babyface, angered by Alexa's apparent death, turns on Concannon and fights him. Concannon screams out that he is Babyface's father. Tyler takes a camera and encourages Babyface to kill Concannon ‚Äì which he does. Babyface then turns on Tyler but before he can kill him, Serena stabs Babyface through the back with a long iron staff, apparently killing him. However, Serena is hit by a shovel, and Alexa, still alive, hits Tyler as well, knocking him unconscious. Alexa then ties Tyler up and forces him to watch her cut of The Hills Run Red, driving him insane. In a post-credits scene, Serena, still Alexa's prisoner, is several months pregnant. Alexa sings a lullaby to Serena's unborn baby, and the end credits continue to roll as Serena screams. CastRelease The Hills Run Red was first screened at the Seattle International Film Festival on June 12, 2009. Home media The film was released on DVD on September 29, 2009 by Warner Home Video. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Hills Run Red received an approval rating of 57% based on 7 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10. J.R. McNamara from Digital Retribution.com praised the film calling it \\"the best 80s styled slasher [films]\\" \\"[With] perfect sized doses (all lethal) of beatings, brutalizations, babes and breasts all make for a great film\\". Daryl Loomis from DVD Verdict gave the film a positive review stating \\"The Hills Run Red is an above average little horror movie that is a love affair with horror for its director. He got to make his movie, but also got to travel back in time to make a film from what he feels is the golden age for the genre. It's a good idea that is pulled off reasonably well. For horror fans, this is definitely worth a rental\\". Gareth Jones from Dread Central awarded the film a score of 4/5 stating \\"If you‚Äôre a fan of slasher flicks, or even just truly inventive and twisted horror, you owe it to yourself to pick it up\\". Felix Vasquez from Cinema Crazedcalled it \\"[a] maniacal, gory, and smart slasher\\", commending the film's anarchic tone, quick pacing, themes, and villain. Tyler Foster from DVD Talk awarded the film 3/5 stars, stating that the film was above average in terms of the horror films released during that time, while also stating that the film was \\"not that great in the bigger picture\\". Will Brownridge from The Film Reel commended the film's villain as being \\"creepy\\", characters, and gore. However, Brownridge criticized the film's storyline, and plot twist, which he felt was \\"stupid\\". Ian Jane from Rock! Shock! Pop! stated that the film was \\"not particularly original, and at times, it‚Äôs border line dumb\\".

Its objective was to initiate the peace talk process as mediator between the central government and ULFA. The PCG was dissolved by ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa in February 2011. ULFA continued the peace talk process without the PCG on 10 February 2011 in New Delhi. Members The following is a list of PCG members released by ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa. Mamoni Raisom Goswami was appointed as the chief interlocutor between ULFA and the government. Some of its members are believed to be ULFA sympathizers or ex-ULFA cadres. #Mamoni Raisom Goswami (Jnanpith Awardee writer) #Reboti Phukan (Former footballer and childhood friend of Paresh Baruah) #Arup Borborah (Lawyer) #Lachit Bordoloi (MASS leader) #Mukul Mahanta (Engineer) #Ajit Bhuyan (Editor, Aji) #Haider Hussain (Editor, Asomiya Pratidin) #Brajen Gogoi (Doctor) #Dilip Patgiri (Adviser to the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad) #Diganta Konwar (Journalist) #Hiranya Saikia (Sports organiser) Reactions P. V. Sumant, the Director-General of Police in Assam, welcomed the move but made it clear that police operations would continue since no ceasefire agreement existed. Though he considered it a laudable step, he expressed concern that terror outfits are known to make similar overtures to buy time. The state government also agreed to facilitate the peace talk process but denied any unilateral ceasefire with the outfit. Activities On September 11, 2005, three days after its formation, the PCG launched a statewide opinion-sharing campaign through letters, SMS, fax and email. It adopted two further resolutions during its first sitting. It appealed to the Chief Minister, Tarun Gogoi to expedite the peace process. It also expressed concern over Director-General Sumant's remarks that police operations would continue with regard to ULFA. On November 5, 2005, at a rally in Nalbari, the group launched a campaign seeking an immediate end to army counter-insurgency operations. The talk process The future of the talk process became uncertain when state security forces killed 12 ULFA cadres on September 14 2005, in upper Assam, using mortars and other explosives. Paresh Baruah, the commander-in-chief of the armed wing of ULFA, reportedly said, ‚Äò‚ÄòWe will be compelled to call off the peace initiative because of the state‚Äôs attitude. While we took a major step by forming a PCG to work out the modalities of the talks with the government, what the state has done is nothing but sheer betrayal‚Äô‚Äô. The PCG held an emergency meeting in Guwahati taking note of the security force's operation and also threatened to call off the peace process if such operations were not stopped. Present status Declared unconstitutional by ULFA leadership, the PCG was dissolved in the first week of February 2011 by ULFA leaders, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa.

Saint Luke painting the Virgin, (Lukas-Madonna in German or Dutch), is a devotional subject in art showing Luke the Evangelist painting the Virgin Mary with the Child Jesus. Such paintings were often created during the Renaissance for chapels of Saint Luke in European churches, and frequently recall the composition of the Salus Populi Romani, an icon based on the legend of Luke's portrait of Mary. Versions of the subject were sometimes painted as the masterpiece that many guilds required an artist to submit before receiving the title of master. History 16th-century Russian version showing copy of the Theotokos of Vladimir. Though not included in the canonic pictorial of Mary's life, the scene became increasingly popular as Saint Luke gained his own devotional following as the patron saint of artists in general, and more specifically as patron saint of the Guild of Saint Luke, the most common name of local painters' guilds. The legend of Saint Luke as the author of the first Christian icons had been developed in Byzantium during the Iconoclastic Controversy, as attested by 8th century sources. By the 11th century, a number of images started being attributed to his authorship and venerated as authentic portraits of Christ and the Virgin Mary.See Michele Bacci, Il pennello dell'Evangelista. Storia delle immagini sacre attribuite a san Luca, Pisa: Gisem-Ets, 1998. In the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Luke's ascendancy paralleled a rise in status of painters themselves, whereas before the Renaissance, sculptors' guilds and their associated craftsmen ‚Äî which also included masons and architects, as all worked with stone ‚Äî tended to be regarded more highly than painters. Many Guilds of St. Luke were conglomerate associations of various professions, including painters, paint-mixers, book illuminators, and sellers of all of these things. Saddle-makers too were members of these guilds: like illuminators, who worked with vellum, they too painted on leather when creating the colorful military harness of the day. Early versions Frans Floris depicted his friend the painter Rijckaert Aertsz as Saint Luke. Floris himself models the pigment grinder, c. 1560 The earliest known version of this theme in Byzantine art is a 13th-century miniature in a Greek psalter preserved in the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. The theme appears in Western art in the second half of the 14th century (miniature in the Evangeliary of Johannes von Troppau, now in Vienna) and will be frequently represented in Italian and Early Netherlandish art of the 15th century. Rogier van der Weyden's version is the earliest known in Early Netherlandish painting. It is in Boston and copies of which are in Bruges, where it was originally painted, Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Hermitage.De heilige Lucas tekent en schildert de Madonna (Saint Luke painting the Virgin; Dutch); by Jan Piet Filedt Kok, 2006, Vossiuspers Amsterdam, File:The Lukasmadonna, by Derick Baegert.jpgDerick Baegert, circa 1470 File:Hugo van der Goes - S√£o Lucas retratando a Virgem.jpgHugo van der Goes, 1490s File:Master of the Holy Blood - Saint Luke painting the Virgin.jpgMaster of the Holy Blood, 1510s File:Niklaus Manuel Deutsch 008.jpgNiklaus Manuel, 1515 Self-portrait Giorgio Vasari paints himself and the Virgin, 1565. Traditionally, the donor of the painting to the chapel is the Guild of Saint Luke, which often appointed its best painter for the job. If the painting never found its way into a church, it was hung in the Guildhall.\\"Il Passignano\\", ca1560, painting now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. This painter then painted a self-portrait, although in some cases St. Luke is accompanied by a helper or admirer, and sometimes this is the self-portrait. Iconography Toledo. The attributes in such paintings tell a story about the art of painting through the centuries. In the Rogier van der Weyden and El Greco versions, the painter seems to be making a miniature on his own, while in other versions the painter is shown at his easel, using a maulstick, with the flesh tones present on a palette for the incarnation of the scene. Often a worker is seen mixing paint in the background. Though typically the subject of the painting is shown twice, once in the flesh and once on the easel, sometimes it seems as though Maria and Jesus are too holy to be shown incarnate, which is possibly the case with the painting by El Greco, since the painter's face seems paler than the subject.

She is best remembered for her association with the composer George Frideric Handel, in whose operas she sang.Note that Robinson is not to be confused with Ann Turner Robinson, another English soprano who was active during the same period, and who also sang for Handel. Though Turner Robinson was normally referred to as \\"Mrs Turner Robinson\\" in accounts of the time, it is not always easy to distinguish the two. Early life and initial career Robinson was the eldest daughter of Thomas Robinson, a portrait painter who worked for a time in Italy (where she is thought to have been born). Initially her musical talent was privately trained, and her first performances were at private society concerts at Golden Square, where her father owned a property. At these concerts she both sang and accompanied herself on the harpsichord. In the early 1710s her father's eyesight began to fail and Robinson, forced to earn a living for herself and her family, turned professional.Dean, Winton, \\"Robinson, Anastasia\\", Grove Music Online, ed L. Macy, accessed 2 October 2009 Professional career Her association with Handel can be dated to 1714, when he wrote the solo soprano role in the Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne for her. She joined his company early that year, making her debut in Creso, a pasticcio. As the year went on she sang in revivals of Arminio and Ernelinda (both pasticcios, possibly with music by Nicola Haym); on several occasions new music was written for her. London audiences clearly gave her a good reception, and her career continued to prosper; she played the role of Almirena in a 1715 revival of Rinaldo, and originated the role of Oriana in Handel's Amadigi. In a 1717 revival of this opera Handel created a new scene for her and Nicolini, the brilliant castrato who had earlier originated the title role in Rinaldo. Around 1719 it seems that an illness caused her voice to drop from that of a soprano to that of a contralto. Upon the formation of Handel's Royal Academy of Music in 1719, Robinson was engaged on a yearly salary of ¬£1000 and originated many new roles, most notably Zenobia (Radamisto), Irene (Muzio Scevola), Elmira (Floridante), Matilda (Ottone), Teodata (Flavio) and, most famously of all, the pathos-filled role of Cornelia in Giulio Cesare. She also sang in works by Bononcini and Ariosti, as well as a number of pasticcios. Soon after the premiere of Giulio Cesare in February 1724 she retired from the stage. In 1722 (or possibly 1723) she had secretly married Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough, although he did not acknowledge her status as his wife until 1735, just before his death; until then they lived separately, and society regarded her as his mistress. Retirement After Robinson's retirement she lived in Parsons Green, supported by Peterborough and her earnings from the opera. She did not detach herself from the musical world; she retained a close friendship with Bononcini, who had taught her in the past, and her house became a sort of academy-in-miniature at which Bononcini, Pier Francesco Tosi, and other musicians of the day frequently performed. For Bononcini she obtained a pension of ¬£500 per annum from the Duchess of Marlborough. A Roman Catholic, she was also a friend of the poet Alexander Pope. After Peterborough's death in 1735, she lived at his family residence near Southampton. Lady Peterborough died in Bath, and her remains were interred in Bath Abbey. Reputation As a singer Robinson was noted for sweetness of tone, expressiveness and charisma rather than any particular virtuosic gifts. Handel was careful to use the orchestra to support the music he wrote for her, but the dramatic demands of her roles in Giulio Cesare and Flavio suggest that she possessed a not inconsiderable talent as an actress. De Fabrice, a Hanoverian diplomat visiting London in the early 1720s, compared her favourably to the extraordinary Margherita Durastanti (Sesto to Robinson's Cornelia in Cesare). Part of her correspondence is preserved for posterity in the Campori collection at Modena, and these, in addition to her personal popularity in society, suggest an attractive character.

Retrieved 18 July 2014. and also as the ghost catfish or phantom catfish, is a small species of Asian glass catfish. It is commonly seen in the freshwater aquarium trade, but its taxonomy is confusing and was only fully resolved in 2013. It is endemic to Thailand, and found in rivers south of the Isthmus of Kra that drain into the Gulf of Thailand and river basins in the Cardamom Mountains. There are also unconfirmed reports from Penang in Malaysia. Until 1989, it was considered to be the same as the \\"glass catfish\\" Kryptopterus bicirrhis, a larger species infrequently seen in the aquarium trade. Subsequently, the ghost catfish commonly seen in the aquarium trade was believed to be the same as K. minor, but in 2013 it was established that the aquarium specimens actually represented another species, which was described as K. vitreolus. The true K. minor, which is restricted to Borneo, has rarely (if ever) entered the aquarium trade.\\"Kryptopterus minor\\". Cat-eLog Data Sheets. PlanetCatfish. 18 July 2014. Retrieved 29 July 2014. Description This is a transparent freshwater catfish with two long barbels. Standard lengths may range up to , but usually only reach around in total length. They are transparent because, like all catfish, they are scaleless, and catfish within the genus Kryptopterus lack body pigment. Most of their organs are located near the head; with a magnifying glass, their heart can be seen beating. When the light strikes the fish just right, it can create an iridescent rainbow color. During strong illness and after death, they turn milky white. The scientific species name vitreolus is derived from the Latin vitreus, which means glass. Among described species of Kryptopterus, only two other species, K. minor and K. piperatus, have clearly transparent bodies and both these are largely‚Äìif not entirely‚Äìabsent from the aquarium trade. The body of others, including K. bicirrhis, are only somewhat translucent or opaque. In the aquarium schooling Native to rivers in Thailand, glass catfish prefer tanks with open swimming areas with a moderate current and planted areas that provide shelter. Due to their timid and non-aggressive nature, they should always be kept in a group of at least five; they can be kept with other fish species of similar size and temperament. Glass catfish are highly sensitive to changes in water quality and pH. The pH should be slightly acidic (around 6.5), water hardness should be low (less than 20, ideally less than 10 ¬∞dGH) and the water temperature should be around . They have a reputation for being finicky eaters; they prefer live food such as mosquito (Culicidae) larvae, bloodworms (Chironomidae larvae) and brine shrimp (Artemia), but can be weaned to flake food with time. Kryptopterus species are different from most other catfish because they are free-swimming and live in the mid to upper region of the water. Glass catfish commonly favor dark places to being out in the open light. A small school of them may hide under elevated rocks, logs, or the shadow of plants. Sometimes, however, one or two may venture out into the open and swim in the upper level of the water. They can be enticed to do this more often if the flow of water in the tank is arranged so that their favorite hiding spots are sheltered, while a gentle current flows in the open areas. Thus, they will move in the open especially at feeding time, as they like to go after food drifting in the current. A generous growth of aquatic plants is necessary for their well-being, and floating plants can filter bright light, which they seem to find unpleasant. Breeding has reputedly been achieved in the aquarium, but is not documented. The aquarium trade in K. vitreolus generally relies on wild-caught specimens, and there are concerns that this may be unsustainable due to the volume and its limited range. Unlike many other aquarium fish, it is not known to be bred at commercial facilities.  Electromagnetic response  K. vitreolus reacts to electromagnetic fields owing to a protein encoded by Electromagnetic Perceptive Gene (EPG).

Located in the village of Thorp Arch, near the town of Wetherby, the site covers 12.1 hectares. The facility consists of three sections: The Barn, The Grange and the training pitches. Presently, none of the sections are owned by Leeds United, but the Barn and the training pitches are leased to the club. Leeds' under 18s and under 16s sides currently play their home games on the pitches at Thorp Arch. History Thorp Arch was the brainchild of Howard Wilkinson, who became manager of Leeds United in 1988 and realised that the club needed a modern, purpose-built training facility. At the time, the club trained on Fullerton Park, the area behind the West Stand at the club's stadium, Elland Road. In the early nineties, the club started searching nearby land where the new training ground could be built. The club settled on Thorp Arch and quickly built several pitches. A section called The Grange was also built, providing changing rooms, offices and accommodation for the academy players. In 2000, the club vacated The Grange in order to start work on a new ¬£5 million state- of-the-art youth academy and training facility. The move saw the academy players move in with local families. The new academy was opened in 2002 and was named The Barn. It featured a number of new facilities including an indoor pitch, a swimming pool, a gym and new changing rooms. However, the club soon encountered financial difficulties. In July 2004, The Grange was sold to Sterling Investment Properties Limited, a company owned by David Newett, a businessman from Wetherby. As part of the deal, the club were obliged to support any planning application made by Sterling for The Grange over a period of fifty years. Six months later, The Barn and the training pitches were sold to Barnaway Limited, a company owned by Manchester-based businessman, Jacob Adler for ¬£4.2 million, with the option of a re-purchase before 10 October 2009 for ¬£5,828,131. Barnaway leased the facility back to the club for twenty- five years, with the club due to pay annual rent of approximately ¬£430,000, rising 3% each year. In September 2009, club chairman Ken Bates announced that the club were in talks with Leeds City Council regarding the council re- purchasing the facility from Adler for and leasing it back to the club. The following month, it was announced that the club and the council had agreed terms regarding the lease with the option for the club to obtain the freehold of the facility after fourteen years when all council debt has been repaid or earlier by negotiation. The deal would also see the club make Thorp Arch available for training during the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, and the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In the summer of 2013 new Leeds United manager Brian McDermott made a series of changes to Thorp Arch including the main training field measured to the exact length and width of the pitch at Elland Road, an extension of the sprinkler system used at Thorp Arch and a ‚Äúbetter flow‚Äù to the grounds including mixing the first team and development squads. The physio room was also moved downstairs. Facilities The Grange, which was only operational by the club from its opening in the early nineties until the turn of the Millennium, accommodated the academy players, offices and changing rooms. The site has eight full-size grass pitches and two all-weather pitches. Several of the pitches are floodlit. The Barn, which replaced The Grange in 2002, contains a reception, a caf√©, offices and changing rooms. It also houses the following top-class facilities: *Indoor pitch: this is primarily used by the academy players. The pitch features artificial turf and is heated. *Physiotherapy rooms: there are two physio rooms, one for the first team and one for the academy. *Bio science room: this room is used for player medicals, science testing, preventative screens and academy muscular evaluations. *Rehabilitation room: in this room, assessment work and activities such as basketball take place to help players who are recovering from an injury. The room features a sprung floor for jumping work. *Gym: the gym is used for general player fitness as well as rehabilitation. *Wet area: the wet area features a massage jacuzzi, a hydrotherapy pool and swimming pool which is used for rehabilitation and recuperation.

It was directed by Natasa Urban and Lucian Muntean (aka Lunam Docs), a Serbian independent documentary production duo specializing in telling the stories of working children. Journey of a Red Fridge was produced in association with The Global Fund for Children. Synopsis Journey of a Red Fridge is a story of a 17-year-old boy named Hari Rai, who lives in a small village in the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal, and his extraordinary journey. Hari is a student. However, he also works as a porter so that he could pay for his tuition and cover his living expenses. Although very young, he already has three years of experience carrying loads up and down the mountain, mostly tourists' backpacks. This time, he gets a job to carry a huge red refrigerator from the top of the mountain, to the nearest town. We follow Hari Rai on his journey through the fascinating Himalayan landscapes, we discover Hari‚Äôs inner life, his thoughts, hopes and dreams and we also get to know the culture and the local people‚Äôs way of life in this region. We learn about their relation with the most important aspects of their lives: family, nature and religion. Out of 60,000 child porters in Nepal, Hari is one of the few lucky ones to have a chance of going to school. Journey of a Red Fridge shows us what it takes for him to get his education.

Aircraft fabric covering is a term used for both the material used and the process of covering aircraft open structures. It is also used for reinforcing closed plywood structures, the de Havilland Mosquito being an example of this technique, and on the pioneering all-wood monocoque fuselages of certain World War I German aircraft like the LFG Roland C.II, in its wrapped Wickelrumpf plywood strip and fabric covering. Early aircraft used organic materials such as cotton and cellulose nitrate dope, modern fabric- covered designs usually use synthetic materials such as Dacron and butyrate dope for adhesive, this method is often used in the restoration of older types that were originally covered using traditional methods. Purpose/requirements The purposes of the fabric covering of an aircraft are: * To provide a light airproof skin for lifting and control surfaces. * To provide structural strength to otherwise weak structures. * To cover other non-lifting parts of an aircraft to reduce drag, sometimes forming a fairing. * To protect the structure from the elements. Early use A Lillienthal flying machine replica Pioneering aviators such as George Cayley and Otto Lilienthal used cotton-covered flying surfaces for their manned glider designs. The Wright brothers also used cotton to cover their Wright Flyer. Other early aircraft used a variety of fabrics, silk and linen being commonly used. Some early aircraft, such as A.V. Roe's first machines, even used paper as a covering material. Until the development of cellulose based dope in 1911 a variety of methods of finishing the fabric were used. The most popular was the use of rubberised fabrics such as those manufactured by the \\"Continental\\" company. Other methods included the use of sago starch.Penrose, Harald British Aviation: The Pioneer Years London: Putnam, 1967 p.323 The advent of cellulose dopes such as \\"Emaillite\\" was a major step forward in the production of practical aircraft, producing a surface that remained taut (eliminating the need for frequent re-covering of the flying surfaces)Some Notes on Fabric VarnishFlight International12 August 1911 WWI/Post WWI The air battles of World War I were mainly fought with fabric-covered biplanes that were vulnerable to fire due to the flammable properties of the cloth covering and nitrocellulose dope.Goldenbaum, Jon: Aircraft Fabrics - Wrapping it up, AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, page 31-34. BAI Communications. National insignia painted on the fabric were often cut from downed aircraft and used as war trophies. The German aircraft designer Hugo Junkers is considered one of the pioneers of metal aircraft; his designs started the move away from fabric covering. The highly flammable mixture of fabric, dope and hydrogen gas was a factor in the demise of the Hindenburg airship. WWII Damaged Vickers Wellington showing burnt and missing fabric coveringBy the World War II era many aircraft designs were using metal monocoque structures due to their higher operating airspeeds, although fabric-covered control surfaces were still used on early mark Spitfires and other types. The Hawker Hurricane had a fabric covered fuselage, and they also had fabric covered wings until 1939. Many transports, bombers and trainers still used fabric, although the flammable nitrate dope was replaced with butyrate dope instead, which burns less readily. The Mosquito is an example of a fabric-covered (madapollam) plywood aircraft. The Vickers Wellington used fabric over a geodesic airframe which offered good combat damage resistance. An interesting case of ingenuity under wartime adversity was the Colditz Cock glider. This homebuilt aircraft, intended as a means of escape, employed prison bedding as its covering material; homemade glue and dope made from boiled millet were also used by the prisoners in its construction. Introduction of modern materials With the development of modern synthetic materials following World War II, cotton fabrics were replaced in civil aircraft applications by polyethylene terephthalate, known by the trade-name Dacron or Ceconite. This new fabric could be glued to the airframe instead of sewn and then heat-shrunk to fit. Grade A cotton would typically last six to seven years when the aircraft was stored outside, whereas Ceconite, which does not rot like cotton, can last over 20 years. An Ultraflight Lazair covered using Ceconite and the Hipec process. Early attempts to use these modern fabrics with butyrate dope proved that the dope did not adhere at all and peeled off in sheets. Nitrate dope was resurrected as the initial system of choice instead, although it was supplanted by new materials too. One fabric system, developed by Ray Stits in the USA and FAA-approved in 1965, is marketed under the brand name Poly-Fiber. This uses three weights of Dacron fabric sold as by the brand name Ceconite, plus fabric glue for attaching to the airframe (Poly-Tak), fabric preparation sealer resin (Poly-Brush) and paint (Poly-Tone). This system is not dope and instead uses vinyl-based chemicals. Ceconite 101 is a certified 3.5 oz/yd¬≤ (119 g/m¬≤) fabric while Ceconite 102 is a 3.16 oz/yd¬≤ (107 g/m¬≤) fabric. There is also an uncertified light Ceconite of 1.87 oz/yd¬≤ (63 g/m¬≤) intended for ultralight aircraft. This method requires physical attachment of the fabric to the airframe in the form of rib-stitching, rivets or capstrips, which are then usually covered with fabric tapes. In addition to Poly-Fiber, a number of other companies produce covering processes for certified and homebuilt aircraft. Randolph Products and Certified Coatings Products both make butyrate and nitrate-based dopes for use with Dacron fabric. Superflite and Air-Tech systems use a similar fabric, but the finishes are polyurethane-based products with flex agents added. These finishes produce very high gloss results. Falconar Avia of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada developed the Hipec system in 1964 for use with Dacron fabric. It uses a special Hipec Sun Barrier that adheres fabric directly to the aircraft structure in one step, eliminating the need for the riveting, rib-stitching and taping used in traditional fabric processes. The final paint is then applied over the sun barrier to complete the process.Hunt, Adam & Ruth Merkis-Hunt: Finishing With Hipec, Kitplanes June 2001 pages 70-74. Belvoir Publications. ISSN 0891-1851 Newer systems were developed and distributed by Stewart Systems of Cashmere, Washington and Blue River (Ceconite 7600). These two systems use the same certified dacron materials as other systems, but do not use high volatile organic compounds, using water as a carrier instead, making them safer to use and less environmentally damaging. Many ultralight aircraft are covered with pre-sewn envelopes of 3.9 oz Dacron that are simply screwed, bolted or laced into place. These are produced in a wide variety of colours and patterns and are commonly flown untreated or with an anti-ultraviolet radiation finish to resist sun damage. Lanitz Aviation introduced a new process in 2001 manufactured in Germany under the trade name Oratex6000. Oratex has received a European EASA Supplemental Type Certificate (STC),European Aviation Safety Agency Supplemental Type Certificate 10045970 Canadian STCs, and a US STC. Oratex differs from previous systems, which all require the application of many layers of special coatings (many of them toxic) along with the time, skill, equipment and safety precautions necessary to apply them. Oratex6000 is simply glued to the airframe and then shrunk tight and does not require any coatings. Covering processes=Traditional methods Laced panels and stitched undercambered airfoil of a Sopwith Pup Traditional covering methods use organic materials, such as cotton. Once the aircraft structure is prepared by sanding, the material is applied using dope as an adhesive. Rib-stitching is used on faster aircraft types and especially on undercambered airfoils to ensure that the fabric follows the aircraft structure. The distance between stitches is reduced in areas affected by the propeller wash. The covering would then be treated with tautening dope to remove wrinkles and increase structural strength, finish coats often containing aluminium powder would serve to protect the surface from ultra-violet light. Large fabric panels of the World War I era aircraft were often laced together through eyelets to ease access to the internal structure for maintenance. Some disadvantages compared to modern methods are the relatively short service life of the covering due to biological effects such as mildew and the labour required to achieve the end result.FAA AC.43.13, pp. 81-94. Modern methods Modern covering methods follow the traditional method with minor differences. Synthetic materials are used, covering is adhered to the structure using dedicated glues. The shrinking process is achieved by applying an electric iron or heat gun. Once the covering is tight, rib-stitching is again used for heavier or faster aircraft. Cosmetic finish coats are usually applied, except in the case of Oratex which normally receives no coatings. A side effect of using modern covering materials on wooden structured aircraft is that due to the much longer life the structure remains covered and un-inspected for much longer time periods, this has resulted in special periodic inspections being mandated by aviation regulatory bodies.FAA AC.43.13, p. 84. With both methods of covering it is normal for the aircraft to be re-weighed after renewal of the fabric to determine any change in mass and centre of gravity.FAA AC.43.13, p. 243.

Bred in Maryland by Robert E. Meyerhoff and raced under the Fitzhugh LLC banner as his owner, he had a record of 20: 10-1-4 with career earnings of $1,659,560. Include was best known for his wins in the grade one Pimlico Special and the grade two New Orleans Handicap and Massachusetts Handicap.Pedigree Online, Thoroughbred Database;.  Two-year-old season  Include was a slow-developing colt early in his career and raced only two times as a two-year-old, finishing out of the money once and finishing third in his second start for annual earnings of $4,280.  Three-year-old season  At age three, Include finished off the board in his first start and then reeled off four straight wins. In April 2000, he broke his maiden in his fourth attempt. He won that maiden special weight race at a distance of seven furlongs at Laurel Park Racecourse by 9¬Ω lengths. Then he scored wins in two straight allowance races in the summer in his home state of Maryland, both contested at Laurel Park. The first was a nine furlong dirt race that he won by three lengths, and the second was an eight and half furlong race that he won by 8¬º lengths over a field of multiple winners. Include also won the $100,000 Vincent A. Moscarelli Memorial Stakes at nine furlongs at Delaware Park by 9¬Ω lengths, defeating Judge's Case and Lightning Paces.

Thoroughbred Times Stallion Directory;  Four-year-old season  In 2001, Include had the best year of his career, which culminated in his being named Maryland's Champion Older Male and Horse Of The Year. As a four-year- old, he finished in the money in eight of nine races. During the first quarter of the year, Include won two stakes races at Fair Grounds Race Course. The first was a race was a prep for the next plateau in his career; he started with a win in the $125,000 Whirlaway Handicap at eight and a half furlongs. He followed that up with a win in the $500,000 grade two New Orleans Handicap at nine furlongs, beating well-regarded horses such as Nite Dreamer and Arkansas Derby winner Valhol. After his New Orleans success, he shipped north to Baltimore, Maryland and scored a 3¬º length win in the $100,000 Jennings Handicap, a nine-furlong route race on dirt at Pimlico Race Course. After his Jennings score, his connections decided to take a step up in class and compete in the $750,000 grade-one Pimlico Special Handicap. Include was bred and trained in Maryland, so many in the crowd threw their support behind him even though there had only been three Maryland winners of the \\"Special\\" before 2001. In that race, Include was the 5/2 second choice on the morning line in a field of seven graded stakes horses from around the country. He broke slowly but made up ground before the famous \\"Club house turn\\" at \\"Old Hilltop\\" and placed himself third rounding the track. He made a move at the top of the stretch and won the nine and a half furlong race in 1:55.3, defeating Albert the Great, Pleasant Breeze and Milwaukee Brew. Include followed up this win with a score in the $500,000 grade-two Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs just outside Boston, Massachusetts. In that race, he recorded a Rogozian figure of 1 in a time of 1:48.61 as he won by four lengths, defeating Sir Bear and Broken Vow at nine furlongs. In his next race, he placed third in the grade-two Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park to Albert the Great and Lido Palace of Chile. At the end of the summer, he placed third in the grade-two Meadowlands Cup, losing to Gander and Broken Vow by a neck. In the late autumn, Include finished the year with a runner-up performance in the $450,000 grade two Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs, losing by a neck to Ubiquity. During the last two years of his career, he earned 13 triple-digit Beyer speed figures in his final 15 starts, among which were back-to-back speed figures of 117. Include ended his four-year-old season with a record of (9): 5-1-2 and annual earnings of $1,435,400.  Five-year-old season  At age five, Include raced four times with a record of (4): 1-0-1 and annual earnings of $127,000. His lone win came when he repeated in the $100,000 Jennings Handicap at Pimlico Race Course, defeating Lightning Paces and First Amendment in 1:49 by 9 lengths. The only other race where he hit the board that year was a show finish in the grade two Massachusetts Handicap behind Macho Uno and Evening Attire.  Retirement  Include was retired to Airdrie Stud in 2001. He represents the last chance for his sire Broad Brush to continue the Domino line. This is incorrect.

After earning her J.D. degree from University of Washington School of Law in 1985, Durkan began practicing law as a prosecutor; she had many prominent cases both on behalf of the government and for private parties. During this time she also worked for many nonprofits and advocacy groups, and was briefly Governor Mike Lowry's chief lawyer. In October 2009, President Barack Obama appointed her United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington. She held that position until September 2014.Jerry Markon and Juliet Eilperin (September 25, 2014). \\"Attorney General Eric Holder to Step Down,\\" Washington Post Durkan was elected the 56th mayor of Seattle in 2017, becoming the city's first female mayor since the 1920s and its second openly LGBT elected mayor. She took first place in the nonpartisan August primary and defeated urban planner and political activist Cary Moon in the November general election, with over 60% of the vote. She and her partner, Dana Garvey, have two sons. Durkan's legal career and mayoralty have garnered controversy. She has received criticism for her decision not to prosecute Washington Mutual, her response to the George Floyd protests in Seattle, and her handling of law enforcement during the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. In July 2020 a King County Superior Court judge ruled that her use of tear gas during the protests was sufficient for a petition to recall her as mayor to move forward. Early life and education Jenny Durkan was born in Seattle on May 19, 1958. She was raised in a large Irish Catholic family of eight siblings. The family lived on Mercer Island in the mid-1950s and Bellevue in the early 1960s, before settling in rural Issaquah during a time \\"when there [wasn't] any development.\\" Her father, Martin Durkan, was a prominent Seattle-area lawyer, Democratic legislator, and lobbyist whose career included 16 years in the state Senate and two unsuccessful runs for governor. Her mother was primarily a homemaker who supported her husband‚Äôs career, though she eventually became an executive editor of the Ballard News-Tribune and wrote editorials. Durkan attended Forest Ridge School of the Sacred Heart, a private Catholic girls' school in Bellevue. She spent part of her junior year of high school as an exchange student in London and said that \\"the best part of the experience was traveling through England to Scotland, France, Austria, Switzerland and Germany.\\" A high-school classmate of Durkan's remembers her as ‚Äúsuper independent, and rough-and-tumble‚Ä¶strong-willed and adventurous.‚Äù Durkan earned her B.A. degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1980. At Notre Dame, she tried out for the basketball team before being cut and ending up as the team‚Äôs statistician. After graduating, Durkan spent two years in Alaska, teaching high-school English and coaching a girls' basketball team in the Yup‚Äôik Eskimo community through the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. After a summer working as a baggage handler for Wien Air Alaska in St. Mary‚Äôs, Alaska as a dues-paying Teamster, Durkan enrolled in the University of Washington School of Law, earning her J.D. degree in 1985.Callaghan, Peter. \\"Obama names Jenny Durkan U.S. Attorney for Western District\\", The News Tribune, May 15, 2009. \\"I wanted to be a lawyer since I was 5 years old,\\" she told the Seattle Post- Intelligencer in 1992. \\"When I graduated from law school, my mother said, 'Finally someone is going to pay you to argue.\\"' Career=Private practice While in law school, Durkan participated in a pilot criminal defense clinic, working with the public defender's office to represent individuals charged in Seattle municipal court. She continued the work on a pro bono basis, until she moved to Washington, D.C. to practice law with the firm of Williams & Connolly. There she did a range of civil and criminal cases, including representing reporters subpoenaed by the government. Durkan returned to Seattle in 1991, and established a successful practice focusing on criminal defense and work on behalf of plaintiffs, including the family of Lt. Walter Kilgore, who died in the Pang warehouse fire, the case of Stan Stevenson (a retired firefighter who was stabbed leaving a Mariners game) and the case of Kate Fleming, who died in a flash flood in her Madison Valley basement during the Hanukkah Eve windstorm of 2006. In 1994 Durkan became executive council and political director to Governor Mike Lowry, making her Lowry's chief lawyer. Lowry had been a campaign manager to and protege of her father in 1972, and Durkan worked for then congressman Lowry in the 1980s. After initially recommending that an independent investigator represent Lowry, Durkan resigned in February 1995 after deputy press secretary Susanne Albright accused him of sexual harassment. Among Durkan's most prominent cases in private practice was the 2005 recount lawsuit that attempted to undo Governor Chris Gregoire's election in 2004. The Democratic Party turned to Durkan with Gregoire's election \\"facing an unprecedented trial and Republicans trying to remove her from office.\\" Gregoire's victory was upheld. Durkan worked with families and other attorneys at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to prevent the return of people who had arrived lawfully at the airport the day President Donald Trump's first travel ban executive order went into effect. After serving as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, Durkan joined Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to head a new Seattle law office specializing in internet and online security issues. She also represented FIFA in a global corruption case against the U.S. Justice Department.  Civic leader  Durkan served on the Washington State Sentencing Guidelines Commission from 1993 to 1996. She served as the first Citizen Observer on the Seattle Police Firearms Review Board from 1997 to 2000 and two Seattle mayors asked her to serve on Citizen Review Committees for the Seattle Police Department. She also played an advisory role on the establishment of the King County Drug Court and the Mental Health Court. She later helped create a specialized drug program in the federal courts in Western Washington.\\"Seattle gets specialized federal drug court\\", Seattle Times, December 13, 2012. In September 1994, Durkan left the Schroeter law firm to join the staff of then- Washington Governor Mike Lowry as his lawyer and political adviser. In February 1995, she resigned from Lowry's office and returned to Schroeter. Durkan is a fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers and maintains an from Martindale-Hubbell. She served a three-year term on the Washington State Bar Association Board of Governors. She served on the Merit Selection Committee for the United States District Court, helping select the candidates for appointment to seven vacancies in the federal judiciary in the Western District of Washington. Durkan served on the nonprofit board of the Center for Women and Democracy from 2000 to 2009, as a founding Board Member for the Seattle Police Foundation from 2002 to 2004, and as the Chair of the Washington State Attorney General's Task Force on Consumer Privacy, which resulted in legislation that became a national model for identity theft protections. U.S. Attorney Durkan during her tenure as a U.S. Attorney In May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Durkan to be the U.S Attorney for the Western District of Washington, which covers 19 counties and is home to 4.6 million people (78% of the state's population).\\"Jenny Durkan confirmed as US attorney for W. Wash.\\", Seattle Times, September 29, 2009. She was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on September 29, 2009, and sworn in on October 1 by Chief U.S. District Judge Robert S. Lasnik.\\"Senate confirms Durkan as U.S. Attorney\\", Seattle Post Intelligencer, September 29, 2009. While U.S. Attorney, Durkan created a Civil Rights Department in the office. It coordinates a variety of civil rights cases and outreach, including a number of cases on behalf of returning veterans.[18] She also helped push police reform efforts in the Seattle Police Department after a Department of Justice investigation found a pattern and practice of excessive use of force. Upon taking office, Durkan was appointed to serve on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, which advises the U.S. Attorney General on policy, management, and operational issues at the Department of Justice. She was chair of the Attorney General's Subcommittee on Cybercrime and Intellectual Property Enforcement. Durkan played a leading role in prosecuting cybercrimes, including hacking, \\"Dutch Citizen Sentenced To 12 Years In Prison For Computer Hacking Scheme That Stole And Sold Credit Card Info\\", U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, February 1, 2013. skimming\\"Oh, the Irony: Identity Theft Prosecutor Is Hacked\\", Time (magazine), September 8, 2011. and identity theft.\\"Computer Crime & Internet Fraud Press Releases\\", U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, February 1, 2013. Durkan worked with the public schools to ensure internet safety tips for parents and kids were sent home with kids at the beginning of the school year. She also focused on terrorism and national security issues, including the prosecution of two men who plotted to blow up a military recruitment facility in Seattle.\\"Plea deal reached in plot to attack Seattle military station\\", Seattle Times, December 6, 2012.\\"2012 Report to the Community\\", U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, February 5, 2013 As U.S. Attorney, Durkan used the federal law against felons possessing firearms to crack down on career criminals in Western Washington. Cases referred for felons-with-guns charges increased 45% during her tenure. Durkan pushed \\"hot spot\\" initiatives in high- crime areas to address drug and gun sales. These investigations and law enforcement operations resulted in dozens of arrests and weapons confiscations. In September 2014, when U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, Durkan was widely discussed as a potential candidate to succeed him. The Obama administration nominated Loretta Lynch. Mayor of Seattle 2017 election = Fiestas Patrias Parade, Seattle, September 16, 2017 Durkan announced her candidacy for Seattle mayor on May 11, 2017, shortly after incumbent Mayor Ed Murray ended his reelection campaign and resigned as mayor due to allegations of repeated sexual offenses that were later settled by the city. Durkan was called the \\"establishment\\" candidate in the crowded primary field, and was endorsed by Murray and some members of the Seattle City Council, as well as The Seattle Times and Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce. Durkan placed first in the August primary election with 51,529 votes (28%), advancing to the general election against urban planner Cary Moon, who received 32,536 (18%), narrowly edging Nikkita Oliver, who received 31,366 (17%). Durkan's over $1 million fundraising haul broke the record for most donors and most money raised in the history of Seattle mayoral campaigns. She outraised Moon 5 to 1, with over $600,000 coming from a political organization sponsored by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, allowing large corporations such as Amazon, CenturyLink, Comcast, Vulcan, and Starbucks to quietly influence a major local campaign. Murray's political consultant Sandeep Kaushik joined Durkan's campaign and later became a senior adviser to her. Kaushik is also a lobbyist for Comcast and continues to advise Durkan on policy. The day after the November 7 general election, in which Durkan received over 60% of the preliminary votes, Moon conceded. In June 2019, to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, an event widely considered a watershed moment in the modern LGBTQ rights movement, Queerty named Durkan one of the Pride50 \\"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\\". Personal life Durkan identifies as a lesbian. She and her partner Dana Garvey have two sons. Durkan and Garvey are unmarried and are not registered as a domestic couple, which allowed Durkan to not disclose Garvey's financial records during her mayoral campaign. They own a 70-acre property on Whidbey Island and a 5,000-square-foot mansion in the Windermere neighborhood of Seattle. Garvey is the daughter of \\"a Louisiana telecom magnate who sold his wireless telecommunications firm for $400 million\\" and worked for AT&T; Wireless Services as a senior executive. Her company IconAlytics, Ltd. does art authentication research. Durkan is a Democrat. Controversies=Washington Mutual criminal investigation A Washington Mutual bank in 2007, a year before it went bankrupt during the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 In 2008, Washington Mutual (WaMu) was the biggest bank failure in US history. It was seized by federal regulators and sold to JP Morgan Chase. The U.S. Attorney's office for the Western District of Washington state announced an investigation in 2008, but in 2011 Durkan announced that no charges would be made against the defunct company, stating \\"Based upon its investigation, the Department of Justice has concluded that the evidence does not meet the exacting standards for criminal charges in connection with the bank‚Äôs failure.\\" Durkan received criticism for not prosecuting WaMu and during a Senate panel investigating banks Senator Carl Levin called WaMu \\"one of the worst\\" banks issuing subprime mortgages. 2011 raids on medical marijuana dispensaries In November 2011 (before recreational marijuana was legalized in Washington state) Durkan ordered a raid on 10 dispensaries in the state. The targeted dispensaries were accused of \\"flagrant violations\\" of laws because DEA officers believed that \\"the shops were fronts for illicit drug dealing and revealed that agents were looking for evidence of drug conspiracies, money laundering and guns.\\" Durkan stated her belief that many medical marijuana users were \\"fakers\\". Marijuana activists protested the raids. That same year Durkan urged Washington governor Christine Gregoire to veto a bill that would have legalized medical marijuana, writing that the bill would \\"authorize conduct contrary to federal law, and thus would undermine the federal government's efforts to regulate the possession, manufacturing, and trafficking of controlled substances.\\" 2012 May Day vandalism response During the 2012 May Day protests in Seattle, masked individuals identified as \\"black bloc\\" members vandalized a federal courthouse. In July FBI agents raided the house of several suspects in Portland, Oregon. These suspects were later found not to have been in Seattle during the May Day protest. The suspects were held at the SeaTac Federal Detention Center in solitary confinement. The Seattle Human Rights Commission condemned the solitary confinement: \\"There is simply no credible reason for their continued detention in solitary confinement...in an environment known to cause serious and lasting psychological harm.\\" The Department of Justice and Durkan's office brought the suspects before a federal grand jury, but were unable to obtain confessions from them. Durkan then pressured Judge Richard Jones \\"to imprison the activists, some for up to five months, in an effort to force them to testify against their peers in the Pacific Northwest‚Äôs radical left.\\" Emily Langlie, spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's office in Western Washington, said of the DoJ's actions: \\"It‚Äôs not punitive, it's coercive.\\"https://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/02/27/grand-jury- refusers-katherine-olejnik-and-matthew-duran-are- freehttps://www.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/04/11/maddie-pfeiffer-the- final-grand-jury-refuser-so-far-has-been-released 2013 police informant incident In 2013 Durkan prosecuted Walli Mujahidh and Abu Khalid Abdul- Latif for conspiring to kill US military personnel on July 4, 2011, in a terrorist plot. The FBI and SPD had used a convicted pedophile, Robert Childs, as a paid informant to infiltrate terrorist and other organizations. The use of Childs was criticized as an inappropriate and distasteful use of tax dollars (over $90,000), and Childs and Seattle Police detective Samuel DeJesus deleted over 400 messages from Childs's phone before handing the evidence over to Durkan's office, which presiding judge James Robart called \\"at-best sloppy\\". Durkan defended using Childs as an informant, saying, \\"It's not the saints who can bring us the sinners.\\" Childs later said, \\"After the arrests were made, I was expecting to receive my pardon...Instead, I was told that they couldn't do that for me. What they offered me was money.\\" Childs had also attempted to infiltrate several far-left organizations in Seattle as a paid informant and was arrested again in 2019 for second-degree rape of a child in 2006. Durkan was later criticized for initially supporting former Seattle mayor Ed Murray when he was accused of child molestation. Candidate forum incident Durkan and Cary Moon at a candidate forum on October 26, 2017 During a July 2017 mayoral candidate forum, Durkan tossed miniature tequila bottles into the all-ages crowd and during the \\"talent competition\\" imitated Melissa McCarthy‚Äôs parody of then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer from Saturday Night Live in costume, at one point using the term \\"colored person\\". The forum judge at the event told her that she should have said \\"person of color\\", and she apologized as soon as she took the stage again, saying she had tripped over her words. She later apologized for distributing the tequila, saying she had thought the event was for people 21 and over. Initiative 124 During the 2017 Seattle mayoral election, Durkan was the only candidate to not sign a letter requesting that Seattle hotel owners, represented by the Seattle Hospitality for Progress PAC and Washington Hospitality PAC, drop a lawsuit against Initiative 124. The initiative gave \\"hotel workers more protections against sexual harassment and assault\\" and was passed by Seattle voters in 2016. Durkan claimed that she was not given the opportunity to sign the letter, but Unite Here Local 8 (the union representing hotel workers) said that Durkan chose not to sign the letter after multiple requests. Durkan's campaign received $50,000 from the two PACs, including $20,000 from Seattle luxury hotel developer Richard Hedreen. In 2002 Durkan's sister Ryan and brother Jamie lobbied the Seattle City Council on Hedreen's behalf, asking it to exempt him from building $6 million of low-income housing in downtown Seattle. After pressure from council member Nick Licata, Mayor Greg Nickels vetoed the legislation. The Washington State Court of Appeals overturned Initiative 124 in 2018. Transportation issues During Durkan's term as mayor, the Seattle Department of Transportation canceled several bicycle lanes and greenway projects that had been planned in previous years under the city's comprehensive bicycle plan and funded in the 2015 Move Seattle levy. In response, several cycling advocacy groups and city council members protested Durkan's decision-making on bicycle issues. She has also been critical of scooter-sharing, with Seattle maintaining its ban on electric scooter-sharing apps, unlike other major U.S. cities. In March 2018, Durkan halted planning work on the Central City Connector streetcar project, which would link the South Lake Union and First Hill lines of the Seattle Streetcar system, due to cost overruns. Police chief selection Durkan's selection of a permanent chief of the Seattle Police Department in May 2018 ran into controversy after her list of finalists excluded interim chief Carmen Best, who had also served as deputy chief. After receiving criticism from community activists and the police officers' guild for choosing out-of-state finalists, Durkan defended her decision as the recommendation of a search committee. Durkan nominated Best as a finalist after another finalist withdrew to take a different position within the department, and the city council confirmed Best as police chief in August 2018. Workplace conduct In April 2019, two of Durkan's staffers accused her of mistreatment and called the working environment \\"toxic\\". One alleged that Durkan had \\"grabbed her face and forcibly turned her head\\" when the employee was making suggestions on how to handle the anniversary of the death of community leader Donnie Chin. The other described a hostile work environment where she was \\"set up to fail\\" despite having a good track record at previous jobs, and wanted $1.6 million in lost wages and emotional distress. Both employees were Asian women, a fact the second employee pointed out. Durkan's office denied both employees' allegations. Homeless sweeps during COVID-19 pandemic A homeless camp in Seattle, under the Alaskan Way Viaduct, 2019 During the COVID-19 pandemic, Durkan continued sweeping homeless encampments, forcing homeless people to leave their campsite and find a different place to live. Homeless shelters had gone on lock down in late March and had limited capabilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had stated that \\"Clearing encampments can cause people to disperse throughout the community and break connections with service providers. This increases the potential for infectious disease spread.\\" Durkan said that these encampments were cleared for the safety of both the people in the encampment and the community, but that the encampments had \\"shootings, human trafficking and other violent crimes.\\" Advocates argued that the homeless were more susceptible to COVID-19 and, given that the homeless in Seattle were also experiencing an outbreak of Hepatitis A, the ability to quarantine in a tent was their best option. On May 15 Seattle City Council members Tammy Morales, Teresa Mosqueda and Kshama Sawant introduced an ordinance to ban sweeps of encampments during the Coronavirus pandemic. Durkan objected to the bill and no agreement was reached by the council. The bill is not expected to receive enough votes to pass, and Deputy Mayor Mike Fong told the Council that the bill would be vetoed by the mayor because \\"Fundamentally we simply don‚Äôt believe that this particular issue with regard to encampment removals is something that should be legislated.\\" Handling of George Floyd protests CHOP calling on Durkan to resign On June 1, 2020, during the George Floyd protests in Seattle in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, police in full riot gear barricaded the SPD's East Precinct building from protesters, using blast balls, flash bang grenades, and pepper spray against the crowd \\"at times with little apparent provocation\\". On June 2, Durkan spoke to a group of protesters for the first time after five days of demonstrations. Addressing criticism about \\"mourning badges\\" for fallen officers being used to cover up police officer badge numbers, Durkan said that the policy would be reviewed and that badge numbers should always be visible. She also said that the SPD policy of body cams not recording \\"lawful protests\\" would be reviewed. When asked whether she would stop the use of tear gas, Durkan said she didn't want to make a promise that she couldn't keep. Police officers continued using tear gas to combat protesters, and on June 5 Durkan ordered a 30-day ban. Nevertheless on June 6 the police used pepper spray and blast balls to disperse protesters outside the East Precinct, and on June 7 \\"unleashed a barrage of tear gas and flash bangs\\" on a crowd outside the precinct. On June 8, Seattle City Council members Morales, Mosqueda and Sawant called on Durkan to resign or be impeached \\"for gassing her own people\\". On June 9, hundreds of protesters occupied City Hall to demand her resignation,. and on June 28 protesters marched to Durkan's home. A (non-legally binding) change.org petition to recall Durkan, started by residents effected by the use of tear gas, gathered over 43,000 signatures beginning in June. On July 2, King County Superior Court judge Mary Roberts heard arguments for two separate petitions to recall Durkan, and on July 10 she ruled that one of the seven allegations had sufficient evidence to move forward, allowing petitioners to gather signatures for a recall election. The allegation is that Durkan violated her oath of office: \\"To the extent the allegations pertain to failure to step in to stop the use of chemical crowd control agents after Mayor Durkan is alleged to have become aware of and opposed to their alleged use on peaceful protesters as a means of crowd control, such allegations are legally and factually sufficient to go forward.\\" Durkan's legal team asked Roberts to reconsider the ruling, arguing that the charge was the responsibility of Police Chief Carmen Best, but Roberts declined. On August 12 Durkan's legal team appealed the decision to the Washington State Supreme Court. The petitioners for the recall requested that the Supreme Court reconsider two of the charges that Roberts dismissed. 50,000 signatures of Seattle voters are needed for the recall to occur. Durkan has also been criticized by conservatives. Trump criticized the responses of Durkan and Governor Jay Inslee, claiming that they had not been effective in dealing with protesters, especially regarding the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone/Capitol Hill Occupied Protest and the Seattle police's abandonment of the East Precinct. He threatened to retake the city if local leaders did not reassert their authority. Durkan called the creation of the police-free autonomous zone an attempt to \\"de-escalate interactions between protesters and law enforcement\\". On June 12, she visited the police-free zone and told a New York Times reporter that she did not know of any serious crime reported in the area. On June 20, a shooting in the zone left one man dead and another in critical condition. Chilton Williamson, Jr., of the right-wing Catholic World Reporter said that Durkan's attitude towards CHOP indicated that she \\"could have felt comfortable and at home in the Weimar Republic during its final days.‚Äù See also * List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States * List of United States political families ReferencesExternal links * - Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:Lawyers from Seattle Category:Bisexual politicians Category:LGBT appointed officials in the United States Category:LGBT lawyers Category:LGBT mayors of places in the United States Category:LGBT people from Washington (state) Category:Mayors of Seattle Category:People from Island County, Washington Category:People from Issaquah, Washington Category:United States Attorneys for the Western District of Washington Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:University of Washington School of Law alumni Category:Washington (state) Democrats Category:Women mayors of places in Washington (state) Category:20th-century American women lawyers Category:21st-century American women lawyers ","title":"Jenny Durkan"},{"id":"24549767","text":"Lamkin circa 1917 Uel Walter Lamkin (January 18, 1877 ‚Äì September 16, 1956) was president of Northwest Missouri State University from 1921 to 1945.

Accomplished in a collaborative manner across the spectrum of operations in the maritime environment, MCAST Command executes civilian to military operations and military to military training, as directed, in support of security cooperation and security assistance requirements. The MCAST Command prepares regionally aligned planners, teams, specialists and trainers to be effective, flexible and responsive in support of the Navy Component and Joint Task Force Commanders‚Äô security cooperation plans. Enhancing partner-nation capability and capacity is accomplished by deploying fully qualified individuals and teams, trained to support civilian to military operations (MCA) and military to military training (SFA). To support the Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower and the Navy‚Äôs core competencies of Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief and Maritime Security, MCAST Command fosters and sustains cooperative relationships across the Joint, Coalition, and Multinational spectrum to provide regional stability, prevent conflict and protect U.S. interests.  History  MCAST Command combines the former Maritime Civil Affairs Group and the Expeditionary Training Command. The Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) officially established Maritime Civil Affairs Group (MCAG) during a ceremony at Naval Amphibious Base (NAB) Little Creek, March 30, 2007 under the leadership of Navy Capt. Kenneth Swingshakl. Captain Claudia Risner, U.S. Navy, assumed command of MCAG in September, 2008. In an effort to consolidate staffs and resources, MCAG and the Expeditionary Training Command were merged and designated as the Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Training (MCAST) Command in a ceremony October 1, 2009. Captain Risner continued as the Commanding Officer of the new organization until Captain Frank Hughlett, U.S. Navy, assumed command of MCAST Command in September 2010. Captain Marc Gordnier assumed command in August 2012. MCASTCOM was ordered to disestablish in spring 2014 due to Navy Budget decisions. MCASTCOM decommissioned in May 2014. Teams The command deploys two types of teams ‚Äì Maritime Civil Affairs and Security Force Assistance ‚Äì to support exercises and overseas contingency operations that enable partner nations to establish and exercise maritime security and sovereignty. Maritime Civil Affairs Teams MCA Teams (MCATs) specialize in the maritime environment ‚Äì from Economic Exclusion Zones, to fisheries, to port and harbor operations and harbor/channel maintenance and reconstruction. MCATs are generally five-person teams consisting of a commander (usually a junior officer), coxswain, corpsman, communicator, and a construction rating Sailor. MCAST also seeks Sailors with unique cultural expertise, such as native speakers, for missions where cultural exchange is necessary for success. MCATs liaison between an operational commander, U.S. country team, and host nation civil and military entities. They focus on benefitting the civilian populace, minimizing the military operations footprint and maximizing the humanitarian assistance impact. Security Force Assistance Teams Through Security Force Assistance Mobile Training Teams (SFA MTT), MCAST delivers maritime expeditionary core instruction in support of security cooperation and foreign internal defense missions. These efforts are directed at foreign country military, civil, and security personnel. SFA MTT experts from a variety of ratings perform as internally sourced team members. They provide critical training to partner nations that enhance security, partnership and stability. These teams deliver training in small boat operations and tactics, maritime combat operations, anti-terrorism/force protection, maintenance and construction, and military professional development and leadership. Lessons are taught in the host nation‚Äôs language and are tailored to the nation‚Äôs needs. SFA MTTs are also capable of providing non-standard training, such as running ranges, foreign weapons familiarization, and field training refreshers to support Navy Component Commanders. Teams deploy and train foreign militaries through a stand-alone event or in conjunction with planned fleet deployments, coordinated exercises, or regional engagement events.  Core Competencies =Maritime Civil Affairs Plans and Operations MCAST Command provides a plans and operations element capable of integrating with the operational (Navy Component or Joint Task Force) Commander. Provides command and control of the MCAST-assigned forces and integrates MCA subject matter expertise into campaign plans and mission analysis. Assists with the preparation of country-specific plans, enhances partner-nation relationships and oversees area assessment, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and civic action projects.

The play opened in Beverly Hills on February 2, 2008, and closed on March 8, 2008, in the Reuben Cordova Theatre. The production was directed by Warren Davis and starred Henry Hayashi, Mark Berry, and Sekai Murashige, alternating with Josh Ogner. Set Design by Jeff G. Rack; Lighting Design by Meghan Hong; Costume Design by Holly Victoria; Sound Design by Jonathan Snipes. Produced by Theatre Forty and Storey Productions. Plot summary Michael Dori, a Japanese American, teaches at Bienvenida Elementary School in Beverly Hills, priding himself on the fact that his students regularly score in the top five percent of state standardized tests. However, when he is confronted by a 10-year-old Japanese student with an apparent learning disability, Kai Goldman, the authoritarian teacher first tries to bond with the child through the commonality of their race, and then pushes the child too hard in class regarding multiplication tables, which seriously embarrasses the boy. The next day, the child brings a gun to school. The reason the child brought the weapon is the central conflict of the play. The teacher, Mr. Dori, accuses the boy of trying to get retribution for the embarrassment he felt over the incident with the multiplication tables. The child insists he was bringing the gun to impress his teacher. The weapon is an old Civil War relic and incapable of actually being fired, a fact Kai insists he was intimately aware. Left to sort out the issue is the school's African-American principal, Robert Rees, who has only held the position a few months, and Coral Bryson the specialist in charge of Kai's Individualized Education Program. Complicating the already tedious racial issue is Kai's adoptive parents, Aaron and Nancy Goldman, who are Jewish. The play, which is told from Coral's perspective, examines many school issues including race, parental involvement, and the differences in quality between public and private schools. Reaction and reviews Dany Margolies of Backstage West called the play \\"a worthy and interesting World Premiere\\" in which director Warren Davis delivered \\"a unified world for the actors and creative staging across the theatre's wide space that enables the many scenes to flow.\\" She goes on to laud the performances of Amy Tolsky, Mark Berry, and especially Addie Daddio. Amy Nicholoson of LA Weekly named The Monkey Jar a \\"GO\\" (Critic's Pick) and went on to say: \\"Playwright Richard Martin Hirsch has set up a credible and inextricable trap...\\" \\"Warren Davis' production is engrossing, with the parents' scenes appropriately screwball; Act 2 rehashes the problem in ever louder voices before homing in on what could feel to some like a slightly unsatisfying solution. But among the script's strong achievements is the tightly wound Mr. Dori, an undeniably good ‚Äî if authoritarian ‚Äî teacher who's proud that his kids score in the state's top 5 percent, and bristles at the insinuation that spurring them to achieve doesn't prove that he cares.\\" Cynthia Citron of Curtain Up said: \\"With just a minimal amount of furniture and Meghan Hong's effective lighting design, the production bounces along with a fast-paced contemporaneousness. Director Warren Davis leads these seasoned professionals through the ramifications of a felony committed by a child and to the consequences for all involved. It's a gripping story told by a superb cast, and well worth a visit.\\" Daryl Miller of the Los Angeles Times called the script, \\"Well-intended...\\", stating: \\"The story is complicated by layer upon layer of social, economic and ethnic detail.\\" \\"On Los Angeles' affluent Westside, frustration builds in an elementary school classroom when a 10-year- old with a mild learning disability is pushed hard by a teacher who, unaware of the boy's condition, wants every student to perform well. The youngster adopts sarcasm as psychological armor but, when pressured, becomes panicky and tearful -- qualities well conveyed at the reviewed performance by Sekai Murashige, who alternates with Josh Ogner. His teacher, as portrayed by Henry Hayashi, is energetic and inspiring, though he makes regrettable choices as he tries to break through to this student. In the tense situation that results, the school's new principal, played by Mark Berry, finds his ambitions -- as well as his compassionate best efforts for the kids -- in danger of being erased.\\" References Category:American plays Category:2008 plays Category:Plays about race and ethnicity Category:Plays set in Los Angeles Category:Jews and Judaism in fiction Category:Asian-American issues ","title":"The Monkey Jar"},{"id":"24549881","text":"Stephen M.

Biography Minnetti started her career as a singer in 1968 under the name Virginia and later began to sing with her then husband in a duet named Renzo & Virginia. Some time later Virginia was noticed by Giancarlo Lucariello, a producer of the Italian rock band Pooh. It was he who created an image of a sexy but delicate woman for her as well as her manner to sing with a subdued voice. In 1979, Virginia started singing under the name Viola Valentino. Her first song Comprami (\\"Buy Me\\") made her famous and was sold in a great number of copies in Italy and Spain. In 1980, Viola sang two other songs that also become hits, Sei una bomba (\\"You Are a Bomb\\") and Anche noi facciamo pace (\\"We Will Make Peace Too\\"). In the same year, her first album Cinema (\\"Cinema\\") came out. In 1982, Viola Valentino took part in Festival di Sanremo for the first time with the song Romantici (\\"Romantic\\") which also became a hit. In the same year, her second album In primo piano (\\"In the Foreground\\") and another hit Sola (\\"Alone\\") came out. At that time, Viola Valentino was in the zenith of her fame and was invited to act in the film Delitto sull‚Äôautostrada (\\"A Crime on a Highway\\"). In 1983, she took part in Festival di Sanremo again with the song Arriva arriva (\\"Come, Come\\"). Since then, the public interest in Viola Valentino began to fade. In the 1980s, Viola acted in the films Due strani pap√† (\\"Two Strange Daddies\\", 1983) and Le volpi della notte (\\"Night Foxes\\", 1986). In 1986, Viola sang Il posto della luna (\\"The Place of the Moon\\"), which had moderate success. In 1991, an album Un angelo dal cielo (\\"An Angel from Heaven\\") came out which included the best songs by Viola Valentino. In 2005 she went to the reality show Musicfarm. Interesting facts For some time, Viola Valentino was married to a well-known Italian singer Riccardo Fogli, which contributed to her popularity; later, however, they divorced. Two times Viola's photos were cover photos of Playboy.

Description The Hogganvik runestone is a stone slab of about , weighing approximately . It was lying face down and the runic inscription is therefore well preserved. The inscription, which is in Proto-Norse, can be approximately dated to between 350 and 500 CE and consists of 62 characters, one a bind- rune. This is an exceptionally long text for the early period, either the second longest after that of the Tune stone (known since 1627), or possibly the third; the inscription on the R√∂ stone has missing and illegible runes.

He is generally considered a modernist, influenced by the International style.

Jan 1964\\" p. 423 He graduated from MIT's Department of Architecture in 1907, with his thesis Design for a Synagogue. He then went studying to Europe for eight months. Before opening his own practice, he worked for Killham & Hopkins in Boston, and for Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge in Chicago. While he originally designed interior of hotels and department stores, Marx became a mostly residential architect, designing stripped-down buildings reminiscent of Mies van der Rohe's works, while he became respected for his aesthetic and functional integrated furnitures and decorative elements. Along with his third wife, Florene May (daughter of David May, the founder of The May Department Stores Company), he was an avid art collector. While many of his buildings were razed, his enormous collection was dispersed over the years. Posterity House Beautiful magazine (1948) said about his works ‚Äúit‚Äôs frequently hard to say where the architecture ends and the furniture begins.‚Äù Relatively overshadowed as an architect, Marx is, and has been a major influence in furniture design (notably industrial).

She fascinated the criticsLISTSERV 15.5 - OPERA-L Archives (see 'Critics' below) and audience not only with her voice but also with perfect acting and her beauty. She was particularly admired for her portrayal of the title heroine in Giacomo Puccini‚Äôs Manon Lescaut. Biography Born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia to Hungarian parents, H√°zy grew up in her parents' native country and was a Hungarian citizen. She studied singing at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music with G√©za L√°szl√≥. She began her career as a member of the Hungarian Radio Choir before making her professional opera debut in 1951 as Oscar in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera at the Hungarian State Opera House. She remained committed to that house for many years where she excelled in soubrette and coloratura soprano roles. She notably appeared in several world premieres at that house, including S√°ndor Szokolay's Hamlet (1968), Szokolay's Samson (1973), and Gy√∂rgy R√°nki's Az ember trag√©di√°ja (1970, \\"The Tragedy of Man\\").

She died from ovarian cancer in Budapest, Hungary at the age of 53. Critics \\"When she stepped on the podium, she enthused the atmosphere with her soul. She was the type of artist who carried a unique aura. This was the main secret of her success at home and abroad. She had that almost indefinable ability by which a great actress or a singer-personality does not live her part, rather she becomes the personification of it.\\" (Musicologist Peter Varnai) Recordings German CDs: *Der Zigeunerbaron, Label: RCA Red S.

Early and personal life Busfeild was born in Bingley in 1809 to Currer Fothergill Busfeild (1777‚Äì1832) and his wife, Sarah Ferrand. He attended Bingley Grammar School and briefly Giggleswick School. After Busfeild's mother inherited her brother's considerable property, in 1839 he took the additional surname of Ferrand by sign-manual in compliance with the requirements of his uncle's will. He dropped the name of Busfeild in 1854 after he succeeded to his mother's estate, which included Harden Grange and Bingley St Ives. He married Sarah Priestley (died 1832) in 1831. They had a son, William before Sarah died giving birth to their daughter, Sarah Harriette. He married Hon. Fanny Mary Stuart (1816‚Äì1896), sister of Lord Blantyre, in 1847, with whom he had a second son, Hugo. Political career Busfeild entered public life in 1833 and unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for Bradford in the 1837 general election. He remained active, opposing the Anti-Corn Law League, and was elected in 1841 to represent Knaresborough. He attacked the league and poor- law administration in parliament, and became associated with the Young England group. Lord Harewood withdrew his support for the 1847 election and he was unable to find another seat. His second marriage in 1847 lead to him resuming his political career in 1850, and he unsuccessfully contested the Aylesbury by-election in 1851. He then contested Devonport in the 1859 election and two further by-elections that year, before succeeding in the 1863 by-election. During his second period in parliament, he played a part in forcing the resignation of Lord Westbury, the Lord Chancellor. He was re-elected for Devonport in 1865, but the election was later declared void after he was found guilty of bribery. He unsuccessfully stood in by-elections for Coventry in 1867 and Devonport in 1868. Ferrand died in St. Ives in 1889.

John O'Donovan recorded a tradition that the √ì Fathaigh were the last of the Gaelic families of the area to submit to the Earls of Ulster, claiming their land was their own and refused him rent on that account. Confrontation continued with the Earl's successors, The Clanricarde. Tradition surviving into the 20th century stated that seven hundred of the clan were killed at the Second Battle of Athenry on 10 August 1316. An tSleibhe Tadhg was known by the nickname an tSleibhe (the mountain), although the reasons behind it are unknown. He is said to have lived in France for a time, and was living at home in Kilthomas when a confrontation with the Burkes occurred:https://www.duchas.ie/ga/cbes/4569056/4567511/4575154 > The O Fathaigh's had free land long after the other Clans had been subjued, > but the De Burgoes did not interfere until a famous dueller named Uilic de > Burgo (or Burke) vowed he would make them pay rents and rates like everyone > else.

Afr. 41, 51, 53, 56, 58, 59 and 67) in a narrative of Caesar's military campaigns (c. 47-46 BC) in the Tunisian Sahel region around Hadrumetum (now Sousse) and Thapsus.  Titular see  The diocese was nominally restored in 1929 as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric. It has had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank : * Candido Domenico Moro, Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (1931.07.14 ‚Äì 1952.10.01) * Othon Motta (1953.03.10 ‚Äì 1960.05.16) * Joseph Raymond Windle (1960.11.15 ‚Äì 1971.02.08) * R√≥mulo Garc√≠a (1975.08.09 ‚Äì 1976.01.19), served also as Auxiliary Bishop of Mar del Plata (Argentina) (1975.08.09 ‚Äì 1976.01.19), later succeeding as Bishop of Mar del Plata (1976.01.19 ‚Äì 1991.05.31), finally Metropolitan Archbishop of Bah√≠a Blanca (Argentina) (1991.05.31 ‚Äì 2002.06.15) * Maximilian Goffart (1977.12.02 ‚Äì 1980.07.17) * Wolfgang Weider (1982.02.10 ‚Äì ...), Auxiliary Bishop emeritus of Berlin archdiocese (Germany)  Archaeological research at Uzita  Although the site was recognized as ancient Roman by the end of the nineteenth century, it was not until the 1950s that it was investigated and excavated. At the time several mosaics were recovered.Salomonson 1964 Large-scale investigation took place in 1961 when an area of 120 x 50 meters was excavated by a Franco-Tunisian team of researchers. Archaeological investigations conducted by the University of Utrecht Van der Vin 1971 between 1970-72 were limited to the same area. They have shown that the visible remains are of Roman date, but that occupation of the site goes back to the earlier period of Phoenician expansion into the region. Two burial sites are located on the north and west slope of the plateau; these have been completely plundered through the years. The remaining features include paved streets, a private and public bathhouse, parts of a defensive wall, and three peristyle houses. Civic monumental architecture has not been found in Uzita. Further structural ruins were encountered in the surrounding landscape, such as the remains of kilns and irrigation structures.Van der Werff 1982 Existing literature deals primarily with the mosaic repertoire from Uzita, as well as the material assemblage excavated during the 1970-72 campaigns. Work on the architectural remains has been undertaken in the early 21st century by MataMata 2000 and 2009 but this remains unpublished.

The club was founded in 1896 when land was acquired near North Broad Street in Elizabeth for a nine-hole golf course and clubhouse. Among Elizabeth Town's charter members was US Senator John Kean (New Jersey) and George C. Thomas, founder of the Thomas & Betts company. The original clubhouse was built in the Shingle Style architecture popular in the late 19th century.https://www.amazon.com/dp/0738534641 p. 97 One of the club's first golf professionals was John Shippen, the African- American/Native American pioneer golfer.http://www.thejointlibrary.org/archives/TheTimes/1996/1996-05-23/pg_0014.pdf After a fire in 1925, the clubhouse was rebuilt in American Colonial style, the results of which earned favorable reviews in the March, 1926 issue of Golf Illustrated.http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/GolfIllustrated/1926/gi246z.pdf Shortly after though, the golf course was sold, and the main focus became tennis, squash and swimming. Elizabeth Town was the venue for such tournaments as the Eastern intercollegiate championships, the New Jersey State Open and the Eastern Father & Son Clay Court championships. Among the players who competed were Pancho Segura, Doris Hart and Peter Fleming, best known as John Mc Enroe‚Äôs doubles partner, but a top singles player in his own right, having reached a world ranking of No. 8. The Elizabeth Town Club was the scene of numerous receptions for local dignitaries such as US Labor Secretary James P. Mitchell and US Senator Harrison Williams as well as many private social affairs and weddings Among the members in the 1950s and 60s was New York Stock Exchange Chairman James C. Kellogg III and New York Knicks coach Eddie Donovan. In 1980 an outside banquet company began operating the clubhouse as ‚ÄúThe Old Mansion‚Äù while members continued to enjoy the red clay tennis courts, swimming pool and squash courts. A frequent tennis guest in the 1990s was ex- Governor Brendan Byrne who sat on the Board of the nearby Elizabethtown Water Co. (now part of New Jersey American Water Company). In 2004, the property was sold to the City of Elizabeth Board of Education for construction of a new school, and the Elizabeth Town & Country Club came to an end.Star Ledger, December 28, 2003 ‚ÄúThere go the brides, looking for a banquet hall; Elizabeth site to be razed to make way for school‚Äù The only trace of the club today is 'Country Club Lane', a small development of single family homes built adjacent to the club property on part of the original golf course.

It was one of several new colleges created in the nineteenth century to cater not just for non- graduates, but for graduates from the old universities who wished to receive specialist clerical training in preparation for ordination into the Church of England. It was founded by Bishop Law. In 1971 it merged with Salisbury Theological College, the students moved to Salisbury, and the new institution became known as the Salisbury & Wells Theological College, now Sarum College. Education The first principal of the college was John Hothersal Pinder who had held a similar position at Codrington College, Barbados. He remained at Wells until about 1865 when he resigned on account of infirmity. Under his leadership the college became known as a 'desirable place for training ordinands'. At the same time the college was criticised for its tractarian tendencies. In 1884 the tuition fees were ¬£30 per annum, or ¬£10 per term. There were lodgings for 30 students, and since its founding 898 students had been admitted. All except 30 had taken university degrees. At that time graduates studied for one year, non-graduates for two. Their studies included Holy Scriptures, Book of Common Prayer, the Articles, ecclesiastical history, Hebrew and pastoral theology. They attended many chapel services and had the opportunity of performing parochial work. Buildings The Cedars A guide book of 1862 notes that the students were using the Vicars' Hall as a library, but in 1896 they purchased a nearby building for this purpose on Cathedral Green. Rebuilt in the 15th century for Archdeacon Holes, it was still used as a house in 1555 when Bishop Polydore Vergil surrendered it to the Crown. In the late 18th century it became a brewery, but was extensively restored 1886. It is now a Grade II* Listed Building and is the Music School and Concert Hall of the Wells Cathedral School. The college acquired the lease of the chapel in Vicars' Close in 1875. The Cedars, a house built in 1758 for MP Charles Tudway, was leased by the Trustees of the Theological College in 1919 for use as a hostel for some of the students.
