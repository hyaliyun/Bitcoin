The game is released in January 2011, and is the first installment of an episodic series. Mark Leung was written, produced and directed by College Saga creator Mark Leung. As a spiritual successor to the film, cutscenes in the game are presented with live action video clips with actors cosplaying the characters. The game frequently makes references to the popular culture such as the Double Rainbow, flaming trolls and the Kanye West interruption at the VMAs. Many characters and monsters are bizarre hybrids of public figures and well-known characters, such as Jhompson, a summonable character inspired by Jack Thompson and Illidan Stormrage of World of Warcraft, and McFunny, a boss character inspired by Joker and Ronald McDonald. Recent events such as the subprime mortgage crisis also inspired a bank-themed dungeon and a cleric named Brother Lehman. Gameplay Navigation with a crocobo, a parody of Chocobo As with traditional plot-driven JRPGs, the player is guided by main objectives, but is free to explore Untitled (the game's world) to do side quests or fight special monsters, such as Giants, for additional rewards. Over the course of the game, players gain navigation aids such as the Return spell and Crocobo Riding. Monsters appearing in the field represent groups of monsters. If the player makes a preemptive attack against the monster, the player will be able to deal damage and enter a battle with turn priority. If the monster comes into contact with the player before an attack is made, the monsters will have turn priority in the battle. Battle encounters are made under a turn-based system, where turns are distributed to the player and enemies' parties. Emerging victorious from a battle yields experience points, skill points and money (the game uses 'dollar' as its currency). As different character setups vary in effectiveness in different battle encounters, players are encouraged to experiment with different character builds and setups. Aside from a general leveling system, a character may learn skills by accumulating skill points and further improve them by using them frequently. =Classes= A battle encounter Each character has a constant Main Class and a switchable Support Class, and has access to Action Abilities of both active Classes and Passive Abilities of all Classes at the same time. Fighting - A melee class covering basic combat skills that deal single-target damage and perform various crowd control abilities. Healing - Focuses on HP recovery, status recovery and damage prevention spells for single targets. Sorcery - Focuses on dealing elemental spell damage on single targets. Advanced spells may also trigger additional effects. Combat Skating - An Icelandic martial art that focuses on kicking techniques with ice skates. The nature of the weapon allows for physical damage on multiple, often random targets. Dreamcalling - A class available only to Ines, who is gifted with the ability to call forth Dreamolons from the Dreamscape to fight for her, dealing spell damage on multiple targets. Plot =Setting= The game world is set in a pseudo-Medieval fantasy world named Untitled. It is a retention of the real world map with country names and borders randomly rearranged. For example, the player starts off at the Kingdom of Hong Kong, which is where Australia is in the real world map, whereas Australia of Untitled is located mainly in the Middle East. Each country's climate and culture also bear no resemblance to their real life counterparts. Iceland, for example, is covered in snow. This arrangement is meant to be a mockery of general ignorance in geography. =Story= The population of Untitled has long been dominated by the Church of Noobism. Until recently, the world saw the rise of a rival religion, the Church of Vegetology, which gained much influence under an aggressive marketing campaign. Vegetology also used unethical measures to compel the population into joining their religion. Two commoners from the Kingdom of Hong Kong, Mark and Dick, unwittingly uncover their secret plot and trigger a preemptive invasion campaign against Canada, a country suspected to be the origin of Vegetology. Mark and Dick were sent on a mission to Ireland to retrieve Hong Kong's lost pirate navy. Upon arrival however, they are forced by Hong Kong's escaped princess to abort the mission and seek help from the United Nation in an effort to stop the impending war. Development Leung first approached Hong Kong Polytechnic University's School of Design seeking incubation services to form a game development team. As a result, the Uglysoft team was formed. Several months were spent on preproduction and experimenting with game engines before the team settled with Torque Game Engine Advanced. Mark Leung was originally planned as a full game, but a decision was made to split it into an episodic series, each carrying its own theme and sub-plot. Audio The in-game music of Mark Leung is scored by Leonard To and Matthew Myers. Background music for live action cut scenes mainly use stock music. Sound effects are arranged by various members of the staff. Mark Leung himself voiced many creatures that do not resemble common animals, such as the Bitchkraken and Goldman Sex. He also arranged the ambience and voiced some of the creatures where necessary. Reception Mark Leung received generally positive reviews.

The historic district contained 54 contributing buildings and 21 non-contributing ones, on the 900 to 1100 blocks of Pleasant and Palmer Avenues and on cross streets. With . Nine locations feature signs describing the property. Harmon House (1005 Palmer Street) The 1887 Harmon House E. H. Johnson, state legislator and Miles City's first mayor, built this impressive modified Queen Anne style home in 1887. Attributed to Miles City architect Byron Vreeland, the irregular plan originally featured an elaborate arched porch and an elliptical bay capped by a conical roof. Rancher William Harmon, the home's second owner, built the carriage house in 1891. Third owner Senator Kenneth McLean, following current architectural trends, added Neo-classical details and a wraparound veranda between 1903 and 1910. Ella M. and David G. Rivenes purchased the property in 1962. Alderson House (1019 Palmer Street) The Alderson House on Palmer Street Nannie Alderson came to Montana from Kansas with her husband Walt in 1883. They operated a cattle ranch for a decade but moved to Miles City in 1893 so their children could attend school. In 1895, Walt died from head injuries after he was kicked by a horse. Left with four children between the ages of two and eleven, Nannie built this home for her family. She scraped by, selling home-baked bread and milk from the family's cow and catering meals. She also took in boarders. Nannie moved the family to Birney in 1902. Later in her life, Nannie earned wide acclaim for her pioneer reminiscence, A Bride Goes West, published in 1942. Her quaint wood-frame home retains its Greek Revival style footprint, once common in Miles City, but rarely preserved. Changes, including alteration of the front porch and the addition of side entry canopies in the 1910s, add an interesting layer. These reflect changing tastes and the growing popularity of the bungalow style in the early twentieth century. Emmanuel Episcopal Church 1886 Emanuel Episcopal Church An eclectic blend of Romanesque, Gothic, and Queen Anne architectural styles, this 1886 church survives as designer Byron Vreeland's most significant building in Montana. Vreeland blended these styles as his architectural signature in many of his structures. The church features a barrel-vaulted wood ceiling trimmed with California redwood, a large Gothic style stained glass rose window in the entry gable above the canopy, and decorative brick work in a mouse-toothed pattern along the end elevations. The only alteration has been the removal of the bell tower. The interior features a walnut altar created from the salvaged hardwood finish of a steamboat that wrecked on the Buffalo Rapids below town about 1880. The altar is a rare survivor of steamboat architecture in Montana, the principal component of the ‚ÄúWooden City‚Äù phase of building between 1878 and the early 1880s in Miles City. As the only known church designed by Vreeland, the Episcopal Church has continuously served the city for over a century and remains a unique work. Farnum House Joseph E. Farnum arrived in Eastern Montana in 1883, settling in the Tongue River area. He married Minnie Parmenter in 1885 and relocated to a ranch on the Powder River. Typical of many ranchers at the time, Farnum maintained a residence in Miles City. He built a modest one-and-one-half-story Greek Revival style dwelling around 1883. In 1893, Farnum moved his family to town and shortly after completed a two-story addition in the Queen Anne style. He purchased C. A. Wiley's insurance and real estate business in 1901 and served as City Clerk in 1912. Farnum remained a prominent figure in Miles City until his death in 1924. Recognizing the importance of Miles City as a social, political, and economic center, Farnum built his home in the city's first affluent neighborhood and continued to alter the property to reflect the city's growth and prominence. Anna Weber purchased the property in 1928 and fortunately converted the residence into apartments. When she lost her savings in the Crash of 1929, the rental income assured her survival. The house was inherited by her niece after Weber's death and remains in the family to this day, having been converted back to a single family home. Furstnow House The Queen Anne style Furstnow House Born in Wisconsin, Al Furstnow settled permanently in Miles City in 1894 and became the major saddler in the northwest. In 1895, Furstnow commissioned Byron Vreeland to build this Queen Anne style home, unusual because the architect usually designed in brick. The previous year Furstnow opened Al Furstnow's Saddle Shop on Main Street in a Vreeland- designed building. Credited with making the first flower hand-stamped saddles in Miles City for Britain's Lord Sidney Paget, Furstnow outfitted Leigh Remington of Remington Arms and Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show for their Paris exhibition. The bay window heads are embellished with carved medallions in a motif that is continued throughout the interior. The residence retains the original tall ceilings and detailing, including a fan-trimmed arch and four brass and stained-glass chandeliers, one being in the form of a British Crown. Remodeling in 1910 modernized the house with Craftsman details to reflect Miles City's financial status during the homestead boom. The home remained in the Furstnow family until the late 1980s. Kennie-Howe House (114 N 11th St) The end of the 1880s witnessed development of Miles City's north side, with expensive homes being built on generous tracts of land. As land became scarce, parcels were carved from spacious lawns and working families became the neighbors of prominent residents. This charming Queen Anne style cottage, built on land once part of the property to the north, illustrates the trend. Constructed circa 1901, the home also foreshadows changing architectural tastes. Its symmetry reflects the newer Colonial Revival style while wide eaves suggest the Prairie style. Lovely stained glass transoms ‚Äî a classic Queen Anne element ‚Äî are, however, a dominant feature. The Craftsman style garage, constructed a little later to replace a barn, further chronicles neighborhood changes as transportation shifted from horse to automobile. Maud B. and Albert W. Kennie, later the longtime proprietors of the Olive Hotel, sold the home to rancher John S. Howe in 1904. The residence likely served as winter quarters so the Howe children could attend nearby Washington School. McAusland House (1013 Palmer St.) The McAusland House Nestled amidst grand Queen Anne style houses is this early folk residence. The wooden home, constructed for Scottish immigrant John McAusland, appears on an 1883 bird's-eye map of Miles City. A steeply pitched side-gable roof and a small dormer dominate the home's fa√ßade. Originally, the dormer likely framed a door that led to the roof of a full-length front porch. The main part of the house is one-and-one-half stories; the kitchen is under a separate, one-story roof. This plan was common in the 1800s. Placing the kitchen under separate roof minimized fire risk. Bucket brigades could more easily reach a one-story roof, perhaps saving the rest of the house in case of a kitchen fire. The design also provided good ventilation, a boon during hot summers. McAusland arrived in Miles City from Deadwood, Dakota Territory, in 1882. In 1886, he was named postmaster, an appointment that reflects political connections. The plum patronage position paid $1,800 annually (equivalent to approximately $37,000 today). In later years, he worked as a clerk. He still lived here with his daughter in 1914. Methodist Church The 1910 Methodist Church replaced an 1883 building In 1910, the Methodists hired a New York fundraising firm to raise funds for a new, larger church to replace the 1883 building. The growing congregation raised $14,000 and neighbor C. J. Wagenbreth donated the needed capital to complete the project, providing that no bell be hung in the belfry. Wagenbreth, not wanting to be awoken by bells, offered this deal, a steeple but no bells. Designed by the architectural firm of Woodruff & McGulpin in 1912, the Methodist Church stands as a visual reminder of the growth of Miles City and is an important neighborhood anchor. The building exhibits eclectic architectural influences, including Romanesque Revival windows, crenellated Gothic battlements, and early Christian or Tudor massing. Decorative round- arched Romanesque openings complement the bell tower and the design carries over to the main level windows. Each opening is highlighted with painted wood mullions and cusps that form a pair of arches with circular openings surrounded by brick. The only structure in Miles City designed by the firm, the design bears similarities to Brynjulf Rivenes‚Äô Presbyterian Church on Main Street. Ulmer House (1003 Pleasant) The Neoclassical Ulmer House The elegance of this magnificent Neoclassical style mansion belies the humble roots of its first owner, George H. Ulmer, the Pennsylvania-born son of a German immigrant. Ulmer came to Miles City in 1883, and by 1889 partners George Miles and Charles Strevell had added Ulmer's name to their pioneer hardware firm. It became the largest hardware company in southeastern Montana. Helena-based architect Charles S. Haire designed the home for Ulmer and his wife, Flora, in 1902. Haire, whose talents contributed much to the local streetscape, was at that time frequently in Miles City supervising the design and construction of the Carnegie Library and the Ursuline Convent. These and the Ulmer residence showcase the architect's fluency in the Neoclassical style. Haire's design of this residence helped inspire a new trend in Miles City's domestic architecture. A grand semicircular entry porch, Ionic columns, Palladian windows, and a central pediment with an inset lunette are elements characteristic of the style. Very fine detailing includes molded pilasters, a carved wreath above the main entry, paneled oak doors, and beveled glass.

If there exists an element x in R with , one says that a is a left divisor of b in R and that b is a right multiple of a.Bourbaki, p. 97 Similarly, if there exists an element y in R with , one says that a is a right divisor of b and that b is a left multiple of a. One says that a is a two-sided divisor of b if it is both a left divisor and a right divisor of b; in this case, it is not necessarily true that (using the previous notation) x=y, only that both some x and some y which each individually satisfy the previous equations in R exist in R. When R is commutative, a left divisor, a right divisor and a two-sided divisor coincide, so in this context one says that a is a divisor of b, or that b is a multiple of a, and one writes a \\\\mid b . Elements a and b of an integral domain are associates if both a \\\\mid b and b \\\\mid a . The associate relationship is an equivalence relation on R, and hence divides R into disjoint equivalence classes. Notes: These definitions make sense in any magma R, but they are used primarily when this magma is the multiplicative monoid of a ring.  Properties  Statements about divisibility in a commutative ring R can be translated into statements about principal ideals. For instance, * One has a \\\\mid b if and only if (b) \\\\subseteq (a) . * Elements a and b are associates if and only if (a) = (b) . * An element u is a unit if and only if u is a divisor of every element of R. * An element u is a unit if and only if (u) = R . * If a = b u for some unit u, then a and b are associates. If R is an integral domain, then the converse is true. * Let R be an integral domain. If the elements in R are totally ordered by divisibility, then R is called a valuation ring. In the above, (a) denotes the principal ideal of R generated by the element a.  Zero as a divisor, and zero divisors  * Some authors require a to be nonzero in the definition of divisor, but this causes some of the properties above to fail. * If one interprets the definition of divisor literally, every a is a divisor of 0, since one can take . Because of this, it is traditional to abuse terminology by making an exception for zero divisors: one calls an element a in a commutative ring a zero divisor if there exists a nonzero x such that .Bourbaki, p. 98  See also  * Divisor * Zero divisor * GCD domain  Notes   References  * Category:Ring theory ","title":"Divisibility (ring theory)"},{"id":"32981722","text":"Boka is a Chicago restaurant which has retained a one-star ranking from the Michelin Guide since 2010.

At all times the secret police was best known by its old acronym UDBA, which is derived from the initials of its original name in the Serbian variant of the Serbo-Croatian language: Uprava dr≈æavne bezbednosti (armije) (meaning \\"State Security Administration (of the Army)\\"). In its latter decades, it was composed of six semi-independent secret police organizations (of the same name) for each one of the six Yugoslav federal republics ‚Äì coordinated by the central federal office. Perkoviƒá belonged to the Croatian organization. convicted in 2016 in Germany to life in prison for his involvement in the 1983 assassination of Croat √©migr√© Stjepan ƒêurekoviƒá. Career Perkoviƒá was born in Liƒçko Novo Selo near Na≈°ice in eastern Croatia. After earning a university degree in economics, he started working for a local SDS office in Osijek in January 1970. In September 1979 he was transferred to Zagreb and put in charge of the department dealing with Croatian √©migr√©s abroad. Perkoviƒá continued to rise through the SDS ranks and was appointed the assistant to the interior minister of Socialist Republic of Croatia in 1986, becoming head of the entire Croatian branch of SDS. Following the 1990 multiparty election, Perkoviƒá continued working at the Croatian Interior Ministry and was named undersecretary for state security in April 1990. In 1991 he was transferred to the Defence Ministry, upon explicit request by Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, himself a former √©migr√© who had returned from Canada and who was at the time Minister of Emigration in the Cabinet of Franjo Greguriƒá. In 1992 Perkoviƒá was abruptly relieved of his duty after a film implicating him in the 1978 murder of Bruno Bu≈°iƒá in Paris was aired on national television. However, he was soon rehabilitated by ≈†u≈°ak (who in the meantime became Minister of Defence) who appointed him as his advisor at the defence ministry. In 1996 he was transferred to the newly formed Croatian Intelligence Agency (HIS), where he taught at the agency's internal training centre, before retiring in 1998. Extradition In 2005 the Federal Criminal Police of Germany issued a warrant for Perkoviƒá's arrest, over his alleged implication in the 1983 assassination of √©migr√© Stjepan ƒêurekoviƒá in Wolfratshausen, Bavaria. The allegations of Perkoviƒá's involvement were mentioned in the 2008 trial of Krunoslav Prates. Prates was charged with accessory to murder of ƒêurekoviƒá, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment by a Munich court in July 2008. As the Croatian Constitution prevents extradition of Croatian citizens to other countries, Perkoviƒá continued to live freely in Croatia even after the 2009 arrest warrant, as it had been issued by Germany. However, the warrant was to become legally binding for Croatian authorities in 2013, as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) issued by Germany for Perkoviƒá came into force with Croatia's accession to the European Union on 1 July 2013, allowing extradition of wanted individuals to fellow EU states. The Croatian Parliament passed an amendment to Croatia's extradition law just days before formal EU accession, including a provision which prevented extradition for crimes committed before 2002, when new EU extradition rules came into effect, thus omitting the 1983 murder of ƒêurekoviƒá in which Perkoviƒá was implicated. This amendment was highly controversial in Croatia; the government's critics dubbed the law Lex Perkoviƒá, asserting it was changed specifically to protect him. The abrupt passing of the amendment imposing time limit on European Arrest Warrants caused a diplomatic dispute with Germany, with the Croatian government saying at the time it wanted to protect war veterans of the 1991‚Äì95 Croatian War of Independence from facing potential arrests and prosecution elsewhere in the EU. The situation negatively impacted Croatian‚ÄìGerman relations temporarily. Chairman of the Committee for European Issues of the German Bundestag, Gunther Krichbaum, expressed discontent, stating this was a political move by the Croatian government with the intent of making an ad hoc law exclusively protecting Perkoviƒá from extradition. The government later lifted the time restriction in August 2014, only after the European Commission warned that the amended law was in violation of Croatia's EU accession treaty and that it could face legal action, including the loss of EU development funds. Perkoviƒá was arrested in Zagreb on 1 January 2014 and extradited to Germany on 24 January. Another former intelligence chief, Zdravko Mustaƒç, was also extradited to Germany over alleged involvement in the ƒêurekoviƒá murder, and the trial for both of them started at a Munich court on 17 October 2014. They both denied the charges. In August 2016, Perkoviƒá and Mustaƒç were both sentenced to life in prison for abetting the murder of Djurekoviƒá in a first-instance verdict.http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/yugoslav-spy-chiefs-murder- verdict-perkovic-mustac-08-03-2016 Footnotes References Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Na≈°ice Category:Croatian police officers ","title":"Josip Perkoviƒá"},{"id":"32981824","text":"The Carson Mansion is a large Victorian house located in Old Town, Eureka, California. Regarded as one of the highest executions of American Queen Anne style architecture, the house is \\"considered the most grand Victorian home in America.\\" It is one of the most written about and photographed Victorian houses in California and perhaps also in the United States. Originally the home of William Carson, one of Northern California's first major lumber barons, it has been a private club since 1950. The house and grounds are not open to the public.  William Carson  The Carson Mansion in 1902 William Carson (July 15, 1825 New Brunswick ‚Äì February 20, 1912 Eureka), for whom the house was built, arrived in San Francisco from New Brunswick, Canada, with a group of other woodsmen in 1849. After rolling out gold slugs in San Francisco, they joined in the northern gold rush, arriving in the Trinity Mountains via the Eel River and Humboldt Bay. They left the Trinity Mountains to overwinter at Humboldt Bay and contracted to provide logs for a small sawmill. In November 1850, Carson and Jerry Whitmore felled a tree, the first for commercial purposes on Humboldt Bay. All winter, Carson and his team hauled logs from the Freshwater slough to the Pioneer Mill on the shores of Humboldt Bay. In spring, the party went back to the mines where they had previously staked claim on Big Bar by the Trinity. They built a dam and continued mining until they heard that a large sawmill was being built at Humboldt Bay. They went south through the Sacramento Valley, bought oxen, and returned to Humboldt Bay by August 1852, where Carson, alone, went into the lumber business permanently. In 1854, he shipped the first loads of redwood timber to San Francisco. Previously, only fir and spruce had been logged. In 1863, Carson and John Dolbeer formed the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company. Eighteen years later, in 1881, as the company advanced into areas more difficult to log, Dolbeer invented the Steam Donkey Engine which revolutionized log removal, especially in hard-to-reach areas. At about the same time, Carson was involved in the founding of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad with John Vance. Before commencing the building of his mansion, Carson said, \\"If I build it poorly, they would say that I am a damned miser; if I build it expensively, they will say I'm a show off; guess I'll just build it to suit myself.\\" In 1884, on the eve of construction of the great home, the company was producing of lumber annually. The milling operations, combined with additional investments as far away as Southern California and at least partial ownerships in schooners used to move the lumber to booming markets on the west coast and all over the globe, set the stage for the unlimited budget and access to resources the builders would have. Pacific Lumber Company purchased the company in 1950 and maintained milling operations at the original Humboldt Bay site, located bay-side below the house, well into the 1970s. Following the Carson family divestiture of remaining family holdings (including the home) in 1950, the family left the area. The building was purchased for $35,000 in 1950 by local community business leaders, and currently houses the Ingomar Club, a private club, which was named after Carson's Ingomar Theater, itself named for Carson's favorite play, Ingomar the Barbarian.  Architectural style  The house is a mix of every major style of Victorian architecture, including but not limited to: Eastlake, Italianate, Queen Anne (primary), and Stick. One nationally known architectural historian described the house as \\"a baronial castle in Redwood...\\" and stated further that \\"The illusion of grandeur in the house is heightened by the play on scale, the use of fanciful detail and the handling of mass as separate volumes, topped by a lively roofscape.\\" The style of the house has been described as \\"eclectic\\" and \\"peculiarly American.\\" Unlike most other houses dating from the period, this property always has been maintained, and is in nearly the same condition as when it was built. In May 1964, the house was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) as catalog number CA-1911. This is the only official historical building listing of the house. Although the historic house does merit National Register of Historic Places status, the private club has chosen not to apply for it.  Architects  Samuel and Joseph Cather Newsom of San Francisco (and later Los Angeles) were nineteenth century builder-architects contracted by Carson to create the house by 1883. The Newsoms produced many styles and types of buildings, from homes to churches to public buildings, including the Oakland City Hall, the Alameda County Courthouse, and the Napa County Courthouse. Of their many commissions in California, a few original buildings remain in addition to the Carson house, including the Napa Valley Opera House and the San Dimas Hotel. One house they designed was \\"The Pink Lady,\\" which William Carson gave to his son Milton as a wedding present in 1889. After being sold in 1920, it went through several owners before being inherited by sisters in Germany. It operated as a rooming house until it was seized as Nazi property in 1942. In 1964, it became the first historic building in Eureka to be restored. Another of their designs was built in Eureka in 1982 by the Carter House Inn. It is a replica of the 1885 Murphy House in San Francisco, designed by Newsom and Newsom, which was lost in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Their works also include the Bradbury Mansion, which was built in 1887 at the cost of $80,000 for Lewis L. Bradbury. The house, a 35-room structure with five chimneys and five turrets, stood at 147 North Hill Street in Los Angeles' Bunker Hill, at the corner of Hill and Court streets, until being demolished in 1929, and was the inspiration behind the exterior of Hong Kong Disneyland's Mystic Manor attraction.  Popular culture  Images of the house are prevalent in website designs and video animations as well as on posters, paintings, and book covers. This popularity also has led to replicas being created in amusement parks, including the clock tower on the train station at Disneyland. The home also serves as a model for haunted house artwork and design.

Hugh Oswald Blaker was born on 13 December 1873 at 31 Marine Parade, Worthing, Sussex. Both his parents were originally from Worthing ‚Äì master builder Robert Charles Blaker (born May 1836) and Jane Rosalie Redstone (n√©e Sanders, born April 1845). Following Robert's death, Jane married John Richard Eyre in the Church of the Sacred Heart, Teddington on 27 August 1898. Blaker's collection of essays on social problems of the day, Points for Posterity (1910), paints a detailed portrait of its author: a free thinker, open minded, opinionated, cynical, reactionary, critical, and a socialist. The book ‚Äì which in its manuscript form is titled Hints for Historians ‚Äì opens: \\"There is no greater proof of stupidity than to be in love with your generation. Strong men are in love with the future and its manifold possibilities.\\" Blaker was curator of the Holburne Museum in Bath from 1905 ‚Äì 1913 http://www.holburne.org/events/i-am-art-in-bath/ and is best known nowadays as adviser to the Davies sisters Gwendoline and Margaret Davies of Llandinam (Wales, UK) in the formation of their internationally renowned collection of French nineteenth-century painting and sculpture, which they bequeathed to the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. As well as his activities as dealer and advisor to the Davies sisters, Hugh Blaker assembled an important collection of art that he kept in his home at 53, 55 & 57 Church Street, Old Isleworth. After his death in 1936, Blaker's executors ‚Äì his sister Jane (Jenny Louisa Roberta Blaker, 1869‚Äì1947) and the artist Murray Urquhart ‚Äì sold over 600 artworks at auction and through two exhibitions at the Leicester Galleries, London (1937 & 1948). From 1895, Jane was governess to the young Gwendoline and Margaret Davies. She remained with them as companion throughout her life, firstly at Plas Dinam and from the early 1920s at Gregynog Hall, near Newtown, Montgomeryshire. When Hugh Blaker died in 1936, Jane presented from his art collection Amedeo Modigliani's Le Petit Paysan (1919) to the Tate Gallery and Quentin Massys' The Ugly Duchess (c.1513) to the National Gallery in London in his memory. From 1924, Blaker became guardian to the 16-year-old William Hartnell. Blaker had found Hartnell flyweight boxing near King's Cross, London. Hartnell was an illegitimate child from the London slums. Blaker gave him a home and sent him to the Italia Conti Academy of the Theatre Arts. While Hartnell made numerous stage and television appearances and acted in over 75 British films, he is best remembered today as BBC Television's first Doctor Who (1963‚Äì1966). When Hartnell married, he and his wife continued to live in one of Blaker's adjacent properties at Isleworth; their first child, Heather, was born there in 1929. In his later years, Blaker regretted that he had not been blessed with a single-mindedness of vision that could have enabled him to succeed in his calling as artist. On 25 February 1932, he recorded in his journal:Quoted directly from Blaker's original handwritten \\"Journals\\" 1931‚Äì1936 (Private Collection, Wales, UK) > \\"The cause of my failure to \\"make good\\" in any single branch of knowledge is > that I have too many interests.

This discovery led to the conjecture that Leonardo painted two portraits of Lisa del Giocondo: the famous one in The Louvre, and the one discovered by Blaker, who bought the painting and took it to his studio in Isleworth, London, from which it takes its name. According to Encyclopedia Americana and The New York Times, The Isleworth Mona Lisa has been attributed to Leonardo, and is thought to be the unfinished portrait from which Raphael made his famous sketch (which is in the Louvre museum); art historian Paul George Konody wrote of the painting that it \\"in no sense of the word a 'copy,' but varies in some very important points from the Paris 'Mona Lisa'\\".Paul George Konody, \\"Another 'Mona Lisa' Found in London?\\", The New York Times (15 February 1914), p. 25.

Plot As described in a film magazine, Leon Kantor, born in the ‚ÄúGhetto‚Äù of New York City, exhibits an exquisite, inherent musical ability that culminates in him becoming a famous violinist. He is born into a Jewish family with many siblings, a loving mother (Sarah Kantor), and a stingy father (Abrahm Kantor). Early scenes in the film depict their family‚Äôs poor living conditions as well as Leon‚Äôs childhood in the squalor of New York, including interactions with grimy playmates and his female friend, Gina Ginsberg, who later becomes his romantic interest. On his ninth birthday, Leon accompanies his father to a store, where he notices a four-dollar violin that sparks his interest. When Abrahm sees Leon interested in the violin, he tries to direct Leon to a more inexpensive music box and reprimands him when he keeps reaching for the violin. After they return home, Leon‚Äôs interest in the violin is brought to his mother‚Äôs attention. Sarah Kantor excitedly claims that her prayers for a musical prodigy have finally been answered and proceeds to give Leon his sibling Isadore‚Äôs old violin. When Leon picks up the violin and plays, Sarah Kantor‚Äôs belief in her son‚Äôs musical genius is confirmed. Throughout the film, the love of Leon‚Äôs mother is a significant presence in his musical journey. In a brief cross dissolve, child Leon playing the violin is transformed into young adult Leon playing in front of the Italian royal family. In subsequent scenes, the Kantors‚Äô lifestyle of new money from Leon‚Äôs success can be seen. The Kantors have moved from the Ghetto into a stylish Fifth-Avenue home equipped with servants. Leon and Gina, now both well-off, express their romantic interests in each other. Leon and his family seem to live a comfortable life, but Leon feels unrest with the rumblings of World War I and the call for soldiers. He commits to serve in the war without his mother‚Äôs knowledge and plays the song ‚ÄúHumoresque ‚Äî that laugh on life with a tear behind it‚Äù at his last concert for his own childhood community before leaving. After the concert, Leon must turn down a lucrative playing contract and later tells his mother about his commitment to serve. Leon plays the violin for his family to bid them goodbye as he leaves home for the war and commits to pursue a relationship with Gina after he returns. After months at war and suffering an arm injury, Leon returns back to his home in New York. The doctors pronounce that normal use of his arm would be very unlikely, which breaks Leon‚Äôs spirit. In one of the last scenes, Leon is sitting in an armchair, obviously distressed about his crippled arm. Gina enters the room and comes to his side, reminding him about their commitment to each other. Leon responds coldly and asks Gina to leave if she loves him, telling her not to give herself to a useless cripple without a career. Gina, heartbroken, leaves the room and collapses outside the translucent door. Leon sees her collapse and goes over to pick her up in his arms. After handing Gina over to a house servant to be placed on the sofa, he realizes that he can use his injured arm normally. He immediately begins to play the violin, whose music reaches the ears of Gina and Leon‚Äôs parents. They rush over to Leon and end the film with their embraces.

Producer William Randolph Hearst had screenwriter Marion change the ending from Hurst's story to have a surprise happy ending, which helped make it Cosmopolitan's first successful film. Reception Humoresque was very popular with the film going public and was praised by critics for the realism in its portrayal of New York City ghetto family life. Its success led to the release of several ghetto life films from other studios, often with a \\"long suffering mother\\" character, which included Cheated Love (1921), The Barricade (1921), The Good Provider (1922), Hungry Hearts (1922), Little Miss Smiles (1922), Solomon in Society (1922), Salome of the Tenements (1925), Souls in Exile (1926), Jake the Plumber (1927), and East Side Sadie (1929). Humoresque was the first film to receive the Photoplay Medal of Honor, the first motion picture award, preceding the Academy Awards by nine years. Recipients of the award were selected by the two million readers of Photoplay magazine.

The battle resulted in the end of the Mandinka hegemony began by the Mali Empire on Africa‚Äôs Atlantic coast. Background The Kaabu Empire, which began as an outpost of the Mali Empire in what is now Guinea-Bissau, had imposed Mandinka rule through military and economic dominance over much of Upper Guinea. In 1537, Kaabu broke completely away from the Mali Empire under its own line of rulers called the mansaba (great king). They expanded aggressively into neighboring Wolof, Serer and Fula territories. By 1705, Kaabu was the uncontested power in the region. It had made use of the slave-hungry Portuguese traders along Kaabu‚Äôs coast, as well as the adventurous and warlike spirit of its own Nyancho aristocracy, to feed that hunger. As time passed, Kaabu grew more and more decadent in their treatment of non-Mandinka subjects, especially the Fula. Tired of their oppression by pagan overlords, the Muslim Fula rallied under the banner of the Imamate of Futa Jallon to end Kaabu‚Äôs dominance. Fula attacks based out of Futa Jallon became routine after 1790. One such assault resulted in the death of Mansaba Yangi Sayon in 1849. Around this time, the Fula inside Kaabu rose up against the Mandinka along with a hosts of Mandinka Mori (Muslim Mandinka) and marched on Kansala, with a general from Futa Jallon, Alfa Molo Balde at their head. =Kaabu forces= The army of Kaabu was usually more than a match for any of its neighbors. It had a strong cavalry culture inherited from the Mali Empire. It also utilized guns bought from coastal traders in return for slaves, of which Kaabu never had a short supply. The spear, sword, shield, bow and arrows were never fully replaced, however. Kaabu‚Äôs greatest disadvantage was a lack of reliable manpower due to a recent civil war between three contenders for the throne. Mansaba Janke Waali of the Sanneh won this contest with no small amount of bloodshed. There was still dissension within Kaabu, and those warriors who had not perished against Mansaba Janke Waali sanneh were loath to heed his call now that the Fula were marching on Kansala. According to legend, Janke Waali made three predictions: (1)a war would break out between Kaabu and the Fula, (2) the fortress at Kansala would be renamed Turban Hecatombe (End of Life) and (3) he would be the last King of Kaabu. When Alfa Molo arrived at the wooden city walls, Janke Waali could only muster some two to five thousand defenders. He would not have been able to bring his cavalry to bear in a siege situation, and the muskets in his possession were inaccurate at all but close range. Mansaba Janke Waali knew the attack was coming and gathered a defense force from his remaining loyal provinces of Pacana, Jimara, Tumana, Kantora and Sankolla. He had an immense amount of gunpowder in Kansala and plethora of warriors raised in the Nyancho ethos that dying in battle was the only acceptable death. As characterized in the Mandinka epic of Kelefa Sanneh, a legendary nyancho warrior‚Ä¶ > ‚ÄúThe nyancho hold three things in horror: wealth, feebleness, and to die > old.Iliffe, page 52\\" =Futa Jallon forces= The Imamate of Futa Jallon was a Muslim theocratic Fula-dominated state similar to the Imamate of Futa Toro in what is today Senegal. In September 1865, the Turban Kelo or Kansala War broke out. Futa Jallon found common cause with its brethren in Kaabu against both the enslavement of Fula and their abuse by traditionalist Mandinka rulers. The Kingdom of Futa Jallon contributed around twenty-five thousand soldiers. This was augmented by warriors from Bundu and some of the Muslim Mandinka states on Kaabu‚Äôs periphery. After two years of campaigning, Alfa Molo arrived at the gates of Kansala with approximately 12,000 troops. The siege Alfa Molo‚Äôs forces surrounded Kansala‚Äôs fortress for a monthForrest, page 69 or three months,Sonko-Godwin, page14 depending on the source. Neither side would fire a shot (both sides were armed with muskets at this point). According to legend, Abdu Khudus, a prominent marabout from Timbo, told Alfa Yaya that whichever side fired first would lose the battle. Within the Mandinka ranks, a resident marabout named Foday Barika Drammeh told Mansaba Waali the same.Bowman, page 59 The nyancho were infuriated by the mere presence of the Fula and believed to not attack was cowardice. On May 13, someone (reportedly on the Mandinka side) fired the fateful shot that started the battled. The story is likely apocryphal and meant to highlight the hubris and arrogance associated with Nyancho aristocrats. The battle For eleven days,Sonko-Godwin, page14 the Fula, who could not bring their cavalry to bear against the fortress walls, were kept at bay. In fact, the only cavalry casualty of the battle may have been a Mandinka named Faramba (General) Tamba of Kapentu whom marched out of Kansala with only his walking stick to drive the ‚Äúhaughty‚Äù Fula away. He was trampled to death by a Fula horseman. The Mandinka accounts are of the opinion that Fula took many casualties with hundreds of their infantry being decapitated as they tried to scale the wall with ladders.Sonko-Godwin, page14 They didn‚Äôt succeed at entering the city until Mansaba Waali, convinced that the sheer number of enemies was insurmountable, ordered the gates open. At this point, Mandinka women began committing suicide by jumping down wells to avoid slavery. Mansaba Waali ordered his sons to set fire to Kansala‚Äôs seven gunpowder stores once the city was full of the enemy. Six were successfully ignited, killing all the Mandinka defenders and around 8,000 of the Alfa Yaya‚Äôs army. Aftermath The fall of Kansala marked the end of the Kaabu Empire. The Fula army had surrounded Kansala so thoroughly that the neighboring towns could not be warned of the invasion. They were only made aware by the sound of Kansala‚Äôs gunpowder stores exploding. Kaabu‚Äôs territory was divided up into two tributaries owing allegiance to Futa Jallon. Alfa Molo‚Äôs victory is considered pyrrhic in that most of his army died on the walls of Kansala or in its explosion. All in all, only 4,000 troops returned from Kaabu. Alfa Molo went on to govern the region he had conquered and made his capital at Lab√©. It became more or less autonomous of Futa Jallon while maintaining close ties to Timbo. Both his realm and a severely weakened Futa Jallon would fall to French rule after the Battle of Pore-Daka in 1896.

The episode originally aired on September 21, 2011 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and ran back-to-back with \\"Dude Ranch\\" in a one-hour timeslot. The episode was written by Jeffrey Richman and directed by Michael Spiller. \\"When Good Kids Go Bad\\" was viewed by 14.53 million viewers and received positive reviews from critics with particular praise for the collage of moments between Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) and Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) from Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly and Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club. Despite of the positive commentaries, the storyline for Claire (Julie Bowen) was criticized by Alan Sepinwall of HitFix. Plot Claire (Julie Bowen) and her husband Phil (Ty Burrell) go to the grocery store. The latter flirts with an attractive woman and accidentally pushes Claire into a pile of peach cans, but thinks he never did it. Luke (Nolan Gould), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) take Phil's side on the dispute. To prove that she is right, Claire manages to take the security tape from the grocery store and when she describes how she did it, Phil and the kids assert that she has an illness of proving others wrong. Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) gets a call from principal of Manny's school that Manny (Rico Rodriguez) allegedly stole a girl's locket. Gloria is in disbelief about this, but Jay (Ed O'Neill) confronts him in the garage and Manny confesses to have stolen the locket. Manny tells his mother about the situation and Gloria yells at him. However, when they enter the school, Gloria notices how sad Manny is, and breaks into the girl's locker and slips the locket inside. Haley and Alex trick Luke into moving into the attic so they can each have their own room. Luke figures out what they are doing but decides to move anyway because of a line of ants that is in his closet. Claire disagrees with the idea, and she tells Luke that the attic is cold and that he will also be scared. Luke moves in anyway but at the end he is really scared and cold and agrees to move back to his room. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) are planning to have the family over to announce their plan to adopt a new baby but are concerned about Lily's (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) reaction, as she is overprotective of Cameron, who Mitchell suggests this is because Cam is too possessive of her and coddles her too much. Cameron denies that he spoils her, but evidences suggest otherwise. Lily's preschool teacher later tells Mitchell that Lily has a problem with sharing, and suggests that she may get it from a parent, causing Mitchell to realize that he too has a problem with sharing.

Maris Kreizman of Vulture called the episode \\"not all that surprising and a little sentimental, but charming nonetheless.\\" She also complimented the performance of Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) calling her a \\"pleasant surprise\\" and that \\"she‚Äôs at her best when she‚Äôs surly, particularly when she deadpans about her future little brother: 'No, I hate the baby.' 'I wanna make the baby dead.'\\" Alan Sepinwall from HitFix regarded the episode as the strongest part of the one hour timeslot, but was still underwhelming for Sepinwall, as he criticized the storyline for Claire (Julie Bowen) and described the character as \\"unpleaseant to watch\\".

The church and its associated buildings were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. It was also listed on the former Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/79 History The foundation stone for St John's Church was laid in December 1856, and the church opened in 1858. The initial building (stage 1), consisting of the nave, aisles and north porch, was designed by architectural firm Goold and Hilling. Allowances were made to add the chancel, tower and transepts at a later date. In 1871, a church benefactor described this initial building, while fine from the inside, \\"unsightly from the road and a discredit to the parish\\".Notes from the work of the historian Paul Egan - taken from \\"A Stroll around St John's\\" 24/1/1993 In 1871, Edmund Blacket commenced work on the ornate tower and spire, which is the major feature of the building. The transepts, tower and spire were added by 1875, and the chancel by 1875. Because Blacket's additions are so prominent, St John's \\"now owes precious little of its outward appearance to Goold and Hilling\\" (Herman), though Blacket's design work is seen only in the large windows at the end of each transept, the tower and spire, the floor tiling and the reredos. Description St John's is a large sandstone structure designed in the Gothic Revival style and built in the 19th century. It features a square tower, pinnacled spire, slate roof and dressed stonework. The walls of the tower are of dressed ashalr in 12\\" courses, sparrow picked generally with tooled margins. The spire is of stone and has an early stone fleur-de-lis on top. A lightning conductor is mounted on top and runs down the east face of the spire. The tower is independent of the original 1858 church on a separate 1872 foundation and consists of four storeys. The ground floor of the tower serves as a porch to the west entrance, the first floor is used for the bellringers, the second floor to keep noise of bells from the church and the ringers and for an inoperative clock, while the third floor is open to the air by four large windows. The former rectory, located next to the church, is a two-storey building in the Italianate style. It was built . As was common practice in the Victorian period, the building is composed predominantly of rendered brick. The rectory is state heritage-listed along with the church. It is now leased as an office.

It operated consistently until 1994, when it had to close because St Peter's Church was closed down. The clergy from St John's searched for a place that was suitable for a new drop-in centre and decided to utilise the basement of the parish hall in Victoria Street. A new centre called Rough Edges was opened in 1996, fronting directly onto Victoria Street. It operated under full-time managers, supplemented by volunteers, until 2010; since then it has been staffed entirely by volunteers. It opens four nights of the week (Wednesday to Friday from 7:30 to 10:30 pm and Sunday from 7:30 to 9:30 pm) depending on the availability of volunteers. Drinks are sold and food is given away for free after having been donated by Oz Harvest and Govinda's Restaurant in Victoria Street.

The story, set in the present day, centers on the plight of a hostage and the ensuing efforts of family and new acquaintances, many of them associated with a fictional MMORPG, to rescue her as her various captors drag her about the globe. Topics covered range from online activities including gold farming and social networking to the criminal methods of the Russian mafia and Islamic terrorists. Plot summary Zula Forthrast, an adopted Eritrean, is given a job by her billionaire uncle, Richard \\"Dodge\\" Forthrast, at his company which runs an MMORPG called \\"T'Rain\\", which has made Richard rich and famous. Zula and her boyfriend, Peter, visit Richard's cat-skiing resort. Desperate for money, Peter sells a database of stolen credit card numbers to a shady contact, who is in fact working for the Russian mob. The transaction inadvertently results in a T'Rain-based ransomware virus infecting the contact's laptop and rendering the only copy of the database useless. Ivanov, a senior gangster behind the deal, tracks Peter down and coerces him and Zula to help him find the virus creators in Xiamen, China. Upon arriving in China, Peter, Zula, and Sokolov (a former Spetsnaz security consultant hired by Ivanov), locate the virus creators‚Äô apartment. The Russian team prepares to raid the apartment, only to be misdirected by Zula into a random apartment, which coincidentally happens to house Islamic terrorists preparing to bomb an international conference soon to take place in the city. In the subsequent gun battle, Ivanov kills Peter, and Abdallah Jones, the head of the Islamist cell, murders Ivanov. The hackers flee the building as a fire sets off the stored explosives and causes it to collapse. Jones flees with Zula as his hostage. Jones and Zula covertly fly from China into the Canadian wilderness and move south toward the US border. Jones plans to use Zula to force Richard to help him cross the border using a secret smuggling route. Meanwhile, Sokolov narrowly escapes from Xiamen by sea and begins to hunt down Jones in order to save Zula, eventually entering the US. An MI6 agent posted to Xiamen to manage surveillance on Jones is reassigned to locate Jones in cooperation with the CIA but suspects that both agencies' traditional approaches are misguided, eventually uniting with Sokolov to travel to the US-Canada border directly based on intuition. Eventually, all of the main characters converge on Richard's ski resort and its US-side counterpart, where Richard's brothers live with a community of Christian isolationists and heavily armed Second Amendment fanatics. The terrorists camp in a location near the resort and inform Richard of their hostage, forcing him to lead them into the US while a small team detonates a suicide bomb near a border crossing as a distraction. After being used as bait, Zula manages to escape and heads out to rescue her uncle. Meanwhile, US-based terrorist cells converge on the community from the south, and protagonists and terrorists end up battling in a massive gunfight. In the end, the terrorists are stopped and Richard kills Jones.

Though an abductor of Zula, he is reasonably kind to her. Vaporized when a dying member of Richard‚Äôs crew voluntarily became a suicide bomber himself. Reception Writing in the Irish Examiner, Val Nolan called Reamde \\"one of the smartest, fastest-moving, and most consistently enjoyable novels of the year\\". It is, Nolan went on, a \\"painstakingly-researched, deftly-plotted roller-coaster of gigabytes and gunplay, a pitch-perfect pastiche of Robert Ludlum or Tom Clancy-style techno-thrillers and a comment on contemporary digitality and the ubiquity of online interconnectivity.\\" Rowan Kaiser for The A.V. Club gives Reamde an A‚àí rating saying: \\"The marriage of the thrilling and the nerdy is what makes Reamde work, and it offers a glimpse at a fascinating writer making a welcome transition back into a more accessible style.\\" Kirkus Reviews sums up Reamde as: \\"An intriguing yarn‚Äîmost geeky, and full of satisfying mayhem.\\" Cory Doctorow writes in his Boing Boing review: \\"Stephenson's several exquisitely choreographed shoot-outs (including an epic, 100+ page climactic mini-war) are filled with technical gubbins about guns that convey the real and genuine enthusiasm of a hardcore gun-nut, with so much verve, so much moment, that I found myself itching to find a firing range and try some of this stuff out for myself.\\" Michelle West, reviewing the novel for The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, did not consider the book to be science fiction and called it \\"a geek thriller.\\" She wrote, \\"Even if I don't like characters Stephenson's created, I nonetheless find them engaging, and I read him in large part for his characters and the particular ways in which they process information and interact with the world. Of his novels, this has easily the most structurally solid ending. In feel, it's closest to Cryptonomicon, although all of the action takes place in the present, where information travels quickly, and cellphones and wifi are ubiquitous. I enjoyed it greatly, and I frequently laughed out loud at his descriptions or his dialogue; it read like a much shorter book.\\" In an interview, Paul Di Filippo called Reamde \\"the most gripping and funny and wise thriller I've ever read.\\" Entertainment Weekly called it \\"an ingenious epic\\" in their \\"Must List\\" column.

Kennedy, in whom Kennedy confided most closely during the Chappaquiddick incident. Markham, along with Kennedy's cousin Joseph Gargan, participated in a futile attempt to rescue Mary Jo Kopechne from Kennedy's submerged car, and also wrote down Kennedy's dictated statement to the police about the accident. Markham was an American attorney who served as the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts from 1966 to 1969. Early life and education  Markham was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on May 22, 1930.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/paul-f-markham-dead.html He attended Georgetown Preparatory School and then Villanova University. He dropped out to serve in the Coast Guard before returning to earn a Bachelor of Arts in economics. He would then attend the Boston University School of Law. He was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1958. He worked at the personal injury firm of Badger, Parrish before joining the Small Business Administration. United States Attorney's office In 1963, Markham was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to serve as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. When Wendell Arthur Garrity Jr. accepted a judgeship on the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Markham to succeed Garrity as the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. He remained a U.S. Attorney until 1969 when he resigned to work in private practice, with the Boston firm of Moulton, Looney, Mazzone, Falk, & Markham. Chappaquiddick incident Markham was present on Chappaquiddick Island, Massachusetts, on the night leading up to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne. According to the testimony of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, after the accident, he, Markham, and Joseph Gargan returned to the waterway to try to rescue Kopechne. Markham testified that Kennedy was sobbing and on the verge of becoming crazed. The next day Gargan and Markham joined Kennedy at his hotel where they had a \\"heated conversation\\" over the fact that Kennedy had not reported the accident. In an October 15, 1994 interview for Ronald Kessler‚Äôs book The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded, Gargan said that when he and Markham returned to the scene of the accident with Kennedy, they both urged Kennedy to report the accident to the police. Gargan told Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter. \\"The conversation was brief about having to report,\\" Gargan told Kessler for the book. \\"I was insistent on it. Paul Markham was backing me up on it. Ted said, \`Okay, okay, Joey, okay. I've got the point, I've got the point.' Then he took a few steps and dove into the water, leaving Markham and I expecting that he would carry out the conversation.\\" But Kennedy did not report the matter to the police until later in the morning, Kessler‚Äôs book notes.Kessler, Ronald, The Sins of the Father: Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded, Warner Books, 1996, page 419. After Kopechne's body was discovered, Kennedy dictated a statement to Markham which was then given to the police. He was portrayed by Jim Gaffigan in the 2017 film of the same name. Later life and death Markham died on July 13, 2019, aged 89. He was buried at Wyoming Cemetery in Melrose, Massachusetts.

Initially they produced radios but eventually expanded into defense electronics during World War II. After the war ended, they began manufacturing other consumer electronics, including television sets. In 1957, the company became involved in the manufacture of scientific and military computers. American industrial conglomerate Teledyne Technologies acquired the business in 1968. In 1986, Israeli investors bought the name for a newly formed personal computer manufacturer, Packard Bell.  History  Herb Bell had been in radio electronics since 1926, when he had formed a partnership with an engineer named Neff. Bell wanted to expand from manufacturing in a one-car garage to a larger facility to increase production, but Neff disagreed and the partnership ended. In 1928, Bell formed a new venture with Edward Jackson called Jackson Bell Radio Company. Jackson left when Bell suggested producing higher priced radios that came with greater financial risk. Jackson Bell experienced financial problems during the Great Depression, but the business encountered greater difficulty in 1931 when RCA released the superheterodyne radio. Jackson Bell was licensed by RCA but struggled due to a large inventory of obsolete radios, and was liquidated. Bell then formed Packard Bell with Leon Packard, whose uncle provided the capital. Packard Bell Model 46H AM/SW Radio (1938) In 1934, Packard Bell marketed their first radio, the Model 35A, originally developed by Jackson Bell. Herb Bell managed to obtain the RCA license for manufacturing superheterodyne radios. Based in Los Angeles, Packard Bell, along with Hoffman Radio, became well-known regional makers of consumer electronics. Leon Packard was unhappy with the direction Packard Bell Company was going and asked Herb Bell to buy his share out in 1935. Packard Bell was a family business. Bell and his four brothers Arthur, Albert, Elmer, and Willard participated in design, manufacturing and marketing. The company incorporated as Packard Bell Corporation in 1946. Packard Bell was a very profitable company during World War II, producing defense electronics, and this continued into the 1960s. One of Packard Bell's products during the Second World War was an identification, friend or foe transponder unit (designated AN/APX-92) used for aircraft. In 1955, the company went public. Packard-Bell Electronics Corp. was adopted in 1956 as the new name for the public company. The company formed a subsidiary to produce computers in 1957, which was later acquired by Raytheon in 1964. In 1968, Packard Bell was sold to Teledyne. Teledyne was interested in expanding into consumer electronics. Teledyne converted Packard Bell common stock into Teledyne common stock at a ratio of one share of Teledyne common stock for each seven and one-half shares of Packard Bell common stock. The Packard Bell name remained but with Teledyne as a prefix (as with other Teledyne operating divisions), and was renamed \\"Teledyne Packard Bell\\". Packard Bell ceased marketing television sets in 1974, joining a number of old-line manufacturers who were exiting the business, merging with stronger competitors or outsourcing manufacturing to foreign entities. Founder Herb Bell There is very little information on Leon S. Packard. The growth of Packard Bell was mainly from Herb and his brothers. Born Herbert Anthony Zwiebel in 1890, his parents were Anthony (Anton) Zwiebel Jr and Anna Mary Brehm. Like many descendants of immigrants, there was the desire to acquire 'American-sounding' names, so Herb changed his last name to Bell. In his leisure time, Herb Bell was an avid boater and owned several pleasure crafts and yachts. He had a 98-foot yacht that he later donated to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He had them docked at Newport Harbor (Newport Beach, California) and often sailed from Newport Harbor to Catalina Island. He named his boats the Five Bells referring to him and his brothers.  Radios  Packard Bell Co Trade Mark-Stationized Dials of US and Canadian stations west of the Rocky Mountains. Packard Bell radios had a unique styling that makes them easy to identify. Being a US West Coast radio maker, they maintained that image by \\"stationizing\\" their radio dials. Major US West Coast and Canadian (west of the Rocky Mountain range) radio station call letters were printed on the tuning dial. From 1926 through 1950, the marketing area for Packard Bell radios consisted of Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Many Packard Bell models made during this period have stationized dials with the call letters of the major stations from these states marked on the dial. These \\"stationized\\" dials also include KSL 1160 in Salt Lake City and KOA 850 in Denver. This was an idea inspired by Herb's mother who had trouble reading the tuning dial. After 1950, Packard Bell discontinued its \\"stationized\\" dials when it began selling radios and televisions throughout North America. A Packard Bell radio was used as a prop in the 1960s American television series Gilligan's Island. The Japanese made, eight-transistor AR-851 was an important plot device over the course of the three-year run of the show.  Other business  In 1957, Packard Bell Electronics formed a unit called Packard Bell Computer Corporation which was led by Max Palevsky. This subsidiary developed and produced computers for specialized uses, such as industrial process control, military, and scientific applications. An example of a niche application was a truck-mounted digital computer that analyzed seismic data for the oil industry. Starting in the late 1950s, Packard Bell was involved in the defense electronics business. They produced the PB 250, released in 1960, which was one of the last users of magnetostrictive delay lines for its main memory. It was also the last machine to be partially based on the original designs of Alan Turing‚Äôs NPL ACE computer. The company also produced a digital differential analyzer (DDA) called Transistorized Realtime Incremental Computer Expandable (TRICE) which could optionally be combined with the PB 250. Together the two machines formed a hybrid general purpose/DDA computing system. The Hycomp 250 was a hybrid computer that combined the PB 250 with a small analog computer such as the EAI TR10 or TR48. Packard Bell's computer operations were acquired by Raytheon in 1964.

Background  Little is known about Zhao Huang's background, as there was no biography of his in either of the official histories of Tang, the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang.Table of Contents for the Old Book of Tang .Table of Contents for the New Book of Tang . What was known that he, at an early age, formed a friendship with Zhu Wen ‚Äî who would later be a major warlord.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. As of 887, Zhao was the prefect of Chi Prefecture (Ê±†Â∑û, in modern Chizhou, Anhui),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. which belonged to Xuanshe Circuit,Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 63, appendix [part 2 of table of Tang Dynasty circuits]. when the much larger Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), ruled by the military governor (Jiedushi) Gao Pian, fell into internecine warfare between Gao's favorite sorcerer L√º Yongzhi and Gao's officer Bi Shiduo. Bi, who put Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (ÊèöÂ∑û) under siege but was unable to capture it quickly, decided to seek aid from Qin Yan the governor of Xuanshe, offering the Huainan military governorship to Qin if they could jointly prevail. Before Qin's forces arrived, however, Yang Prefecture fell to Bi. Bi nevertheless still offered the military governorship to Qin, who went to Yang Prefecture to assume the post. Qin made Zhao the acting governor of Xuanshe to replace him.  Rule of Xuanshe Circuit  Qin Yan and Bi Shiduo, however, were then defeated by the joint forces of Yang Xingmi the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui) and L√º Yongzhi. They fled Yang Prefecture and joined forces with Sun Ru, but Sun subsequently executed them, leaving Zhao Huang without an ally to the north. In 888, Sun defeated Yang Xingmi, causing Yang to flee back to Lu Prefecture. Yang was fearful that Sun would attack him there, too, and pondered an attack against Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit (ÈéÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi) to try to take over Zhennan. Yang's strategist Yuan Xi (Ë¢ÅË•≤), however, convinced him that Zhao was an easier target ‚Äî as, according to Yuan, Zhao had not ruled the circuit for long and had governed it violently and arbitrarily, causing his soldiers to be alienated. Yuan further suggested that Yang persuade Sun Duan (Â≠´Á´Ø) the prefect of He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui) and Zhang Xiong, who ruled Shangyuan (‰∏äÂÖÉ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), to attack Zhao first, and then attack Zhao when Zhao was concentrating on repelling Zhao and Zhang. Yang agreed. Yang was able to persuade Sun and Zhang to attack Zhao, and Zhao initially was able to repel their attacks. Yang took this opportunity to attack Zhao's officers Sun Tang (Â≠´Â°ò) and Qi Lang (ÊºÜÊúó) at Mount He (Êõ∑Â±±, in modern Xuancheng); after he defeated them, he put Xuanshe's capital Xuan Prefecture under siege. Zhao Huang's older brother Zhao Qianzhi (Ë∂ô‰πæ‰πã) was then the prefect of Chi Prefecture, and he tried to come to Zhao Huang's aid, but Yang's officer Tao Ya (Èô∂ÈõÖ) defeated Zhao Qianzhi, forcing Zhao Qianzhi to flee to Zhennan, leaving Zhao Huang without aid. By summer 889, Xuan Prefecture was so desperate for food under Yang's siege that people had resorted to cannibalism. Zhao's officer Zhou Jinsi (Âë®ÈÄ≤ÊÄù) then expelled Zhao. Zhao tried to flee to Yang Prefecture to join Sun Ru, but was captured in flight by Yang Xingmi's officer Tian Jun. Subsequently, Zhou himself was arrested by other officers, who surrendered Xuan Prefecture to Yang. After Yang took Zhao captive, Zhu Wen, who by that point was the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and one of the most powerful warlords of the Tang realm, sent an emissary to Yang, asking for Yang to deliver Zhao to him. Yang consulted Yuan, who instead advocating executing Zhao and then delivering his head to Zhu. Yang did so.  Notes and references  * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 257, 258.

It premiered on 3 October 2011 and ended on 28 March 2013. The show was loosely based on the Pakistani television drama Dhoop Kinare.  Plot  Kuch Toh Log Kahenge is a love story revolving around a team of doctors working at Dr. Kotnis General Hospital in Lucknow. Former college friends Dr. Ashutosh Mathur (Mohnish Behl) and Dr. Malika Trehan (Rukhsar Rehman) work at the same hospital. Dr. Ashutosh was a workaholic and hard hearted man then due to some sad past events of his life and he had kept himself engrossed in his work. He didn't prefer any kind of nonsense, enjoyment or fun at hospital or his life. However Dr. Malika loved Dr. Ashutosh secretly and expressed this indirectly by stating that she is waiting for him since 12 years, but Ashutosh does not express any kind of willingness to marry her. Life starts changing for Ashutosh when a young female intern, Dr. Nidhi Verma (Kritika Kamra), joins the hospital. She was a fun loving and jovial person and at times irritated Ashutosh with her childish way of handling Children Ward. Ashutosh warned Nidhi few times to behave herself but she did not improve. Ashutosh and Nidhi slowly start having a good time with each other and Ashutosh internally loved Nidhi even though he was 18 years older than her. He never expressed his feelings since he knew he was loving a very young girl. Malika realises that Ashutosh is getting closer to Nidhi and decides to make Nidhi's life hard by giving her extra work and assigning Night duties. Her sister-in-law Suhasini kept provoking Malika to make Ashutosh realise that loving a girl who is almost half his age is wrong and this wont work at any cost. Malika somehow convinces Ashutosh to eliminate Nidhi from the hospital and that they cannot have any future. Ashutosh terminates Nidhi's internship stating her mistakes and behaviour in the hospital is no more tolerable. Nidhi was hurt and felt angry on Ashutosh for behaving this way with her. Dadi Bua (Kavita Vaid) could not see Nidhi upset and thus decided to call Rohan (Karan Wahi) to their home. Initially Nidhi found Rohan very irritating and did not talk with him. However, they both loved to eat noodles in the midnight and often Rohan would understand Nidhi's mind, which developed trust for Rohan in Nidhi's mind. They both became good friends and started sharing things. Ashutosh's childhood friend, Armaan (Nitesh Pandey) also arrived at Lucknow and started living with Ashutosh. Slowly and gradually Armaan and Rohan came to know about Ashutosh & Nidhi's love for each other. Ashutosh felt bad for terminating Nidhi, and thus recommended her to City Centre General Hospital. Both of them again meet at Mumbai in a medical conference, where Malika tells Nidhi that she got a new job due to Ashutosh's recommendation. Nidhi felt even more hurted and resigned from that job. Later she comes to know about a house which was named on her by an unknown man, who in fact was Ashutosh's father's home Dr. Ashish Mathur (Alok Nath). Ashutosh wanted that house at any cost but was completely unaware that Nidhi was the owner of the house. He was behind his lawyer Sanjeevani to get his house back, but Sanjeevani could not help him. Nidhi's father Colonel Yograj Verma (Vijay Kashyap) had married Dr. Mathur's daughter during his army days. However Dr. Mathur rejected their marriage and abandoned his daughter for choosing marriage over career and going against his will. After the birth of Nidhi, her mother passed away. Since then Col. Verma had a serious grudge against Dr. Mathur and held him responsible for the situation. In the interim, Kotnis General Hospital's Admin Dr. Rangnath (Vishal Malhotra) and Nidhi's childhood friend Anjilika Solanki (Anji) (Ishita Sharma) had started working with each other for designing uniforms. Dr. Rangnath had a huge crush on Anji, but she did not pay attention to him because of his extra flirty nature. Dr. Rangnath used to flirt a lot with every girl around him and Anji disliked this. However, even she started secretly feeling for him after sometime, but did not disclose. Once Rohan & Armaan meet each other at Kotnis hospital, and after knowing the history, shake hands and decide to make Ashutosh & Nidhi realise about each other's love. Both now try to persuade Nidhi and Ashutosh to express their love, but both of them deny that it was already over. When they both plan to patch up Ashutosh & Nidhi at Lucknow Darbar, they enter a mosque to listen to Qawali, where Nidhi & Ashutosh again meet other. Taking advantage of the situation, Rohan and Armaan face both of them and confirm that Ashutosh & Nidhi loves each other. Ashutosh & Nidhi also confess their love and they now start spending quality time with each other. Anji's mom, Shyama Solanki (Nandita Puri) observes this closely and once advises Nidhi to disclose about this relationship to Col. Verma & Dadi Bua as early as possible. Nidhi kept asking for sometime but did not have courage to disclose it with a fear that her family will never accept Ashutosh. Later Malika comes to know about this relationship and everytime, with the constant provoking of Suhasini, she tries to force Ashutosh to do those things which makes him feel uncomfortable but makes Nidhi's happy. However Malika's plans fail everytime as Ashutosh & Nidhi try to adjust things to save their relationship despite facing embarrassment. Meanwhile, Col. Verma received a huge export order, and to complete this, he took a loan from a bank, whose manager turned out to be Malika's brother, Aditya Trehan (Puneet Tejwani). Malika came to know about the loan when she came to meet Aditya the same day when Col. Verma came there to take the loan with his partner Mr. Mansukhani. Ashutosh was constantly forcing his lawyer, Sanjeevani, to get him his house, and Sanjeevani was in touch with Mr. Mansukhani, to get the house sold. Mansukhani knew that the house belonged to Nidhi. Mansukhani was a very greedy man, so inorder to earn huge commission from the house, he decided to target rejection of Col. Verma's order so that to repay the loan, they will have no option but to sell the house. Col. Verma asked Anji to check the samples since she was a fashion designer. Mansukhani and his assistant, Chandak, tricked Anji & Col. Verma by showing them good quality samples, but later blackmailed the supplier to use inferior material with a promise to give him some commission. The Quality Officer told Col. Verma that he will come soon to check the samples. Col. Verma again asks Anji to check the samples, and she was shocked to realise that the samples were not those shown to her. She informs Col. Verma, who gets tensed. Col. Verma fails to replace the samples due to lack of time, and thus the Quality Officer rejects the full order. Col. Verma decides not to share this with anyone and asks Anji to stay quiet about this. Now, Col. Verma's relative Mandira comes to Lucknow. She had married a man who was double her age and due to this, Dadi Bua & Col. Verma had broken their relation with her. However, Col. Verma felt sorry for her and asked her to come home. But Dadi Bua insulted her and asked her to leave. Ashutosh was present during this drama and he realised that it wont be easy to convince Nidhi's family for their marriage. Col. Verma once in a conversation strictly told Nidhi that he was also against a person who is double the age of her daughter and will never accept such relationship, which broke Nidhi. However she still kept hopes when Ashutosh assured her that he will speak to her family soon. Malika kept feeling jealous due to growing love between Ashutosh and Nidhi, and keeps blackmailing Aditya Trehan to force Col. Verma to repay his loan without any delay. Aditya, unwillingly, warns Col. Verma that if he fails to repay the loan, bank will take steps to recover it by attaching his property and dismissing his family from their home. Col. Verma gets into hypertension due to rejected order & loan pressure, but decides to stay quiet. Meanwhile, Ashutosh once disclosed about his house to Nidhi, and takes her to see it. Nidhi was shocked to see that it was the same house which she owned. She plans to gift Ashutosh his house back on New Year eve and plans a programme at that house. But before reaching there, she gets a call that Col. Verma suffered a heart attack due to bank's increasing pressure of repaying loan. This spoils the plan and makes Ashutosh very angry. He felt that Nidhi played a prank with him. Armaan tries to convince Ashutosh alto but he denies to believe anything. Due to Malika's contant blackmailing, Aditya Trehan now kept forcing Nidhi to repay the loan in 3‚Äì4 days else he will have to take extreme steps to recover the loan. Nidhi asked Mansukhani and he suggested Nidhi to sell her house, as the only solution to repay the loan. Nidhi received a call from a man called Sandeep Bagchi (Vinay Jain) and he bought the house from her. This helped Nidhi to repay the loan and Col. Verma also recovered from his illness. Later, Dadi Bua started believing than Rohan & Nidhi like each other due to their good friendship and secretly planned their engagement with Col. Verma without informing them. She called Rohan's parents to Lucknow to see Nidhi. Rohan's father was stubborn and did not allow Rohan to speak anything against him. On the day of engagement, Shyama informed Nidhi about this and she was heartbroken. Rohan was also shocked & objected but his father did not listen to him. Ashutosh was in Delhi due to an emergency & when Nidhi informed him about the engagement, he assured that on returning, he will come and convince her family. However, Ashutosh missed his return flight and decided to come by road. But he met with a serious accident and went missing. Nidhi told Col. Verma that she loves someone else and cannot accept this engagement, as a result Col. Verma cancelled the engagement. On asking frequently, Nidhi revealed that she loves Ashutosh and this makes her family furious. Rohan, Nidhi & Anji start searching for Ashutosh but they could not find him anywhere. The police informed that Ashutosh is dead since they found his broken phone and suitcase but his body was found nowhere at the accident spot. Nidhi denies to believe this & starts searching for him again. Ashutosh (Sharad Kelkar) was found unconscious in a lake and villagers manage to bring him in a village hospital. Nidhi manages to find him there & brings him to Kotnis Hospital. Dadi Bua & Col. Verma strictly refuses Nidhi to meet Ashutosh, which disheartens her. Things get more worst as Dadi Bua & Col. Verma take Nidhi to Kerala to forget Ashutosh, but Ashutosh manages to reach there too with Armaan's and Anji's help. Ashutosh confronts Dadi Bua & Col. Verma but they again refuse to accept him. Nidhi decides to break her relation with Ashutosh & asks him to forget her and move on for their betterment. Meanwhile, Sandeep Bagchi had actually bought the house for Malika. Malika decides to gift the house to Ashutosh and gets a promise from him to fulfill whatever she demands. Later their college colleague Jagan Mehta (Sachin Parikh) enters the hospital and expresses his love for Malika. Ashutosh had huge grudges against Jagan & knew he was not a trustworthy person. Jagan invites Ashutosh & Malika to his home for dinner, but instead humiliates Ashutosh a lot. When Jagan expressed his wish to marry Malika again, she refuses and tells him that she loves Ashutosh. Malika again asks Ashutosh about marriage, but when he refuses, she decides to marry Jagan. Now Nidhi starts working in an NGO where she meets an old man who was suffering from Alzheimers. The man turns out to be Dr. Ashutosh's father Dr. Mathur. Nidhi treats Dr. Mathur and helps him regain his memory about the house & Ashutosh. Nidhi helps Ashutosh meet his father and take him home. Dr. Mathur learns about Ashutosh & Nidhi's broken relationship and decides to solve this. He persuades Nidhi's family to agree to the marriage, but Col. Verma strictly denies. To turn things worst for Nidhi, Rohan started falling in love with her and expressed his wish to marry her. Shyama informed Nidhi about this and she was astonished. She told Rohan that she cannot think about anyone replacing Dr. Ashutosh and thus declined marriage. Rohan was heartbroken. Nidhi was fed up of the situation and decided to go out of India for a long time. Despite stopping, Nidhi does not listen and leaves. But Ashutosh reaches airport and requests Nidhi to stop. She ignores him as well. Col. Verma stops Nidhi & finally accepts their relationship. Dadi Bua objected this initially, but hesitantly accepted them for Nidhi's happiness. Both finally marry each other. Rohan could not see this and secretly left the house, leaving a goodbye letter for Nidhi. Fate again decides to trouble Nidhi & Ashutosh's married life when Ashutosh finds Malika in deteriorated condition. But when he follows Malika to stop her, he meets with a minor accident and injures his leg. He asks Nidhi to find Malika, who initially lies him that she could not find her, but to see his husband happy, finally succeeds and brings her to hospital. Anji was very furious on Nidhi for doing this, but they patched up on Nidhi's request to support her instead of blaming her. Malika was still hopeful for Ashutosh but was in trauma due to severe physical abuse by Jagan. When Ashutosh got discharged from hospital, Malika could not bare this and decides to commit suicide. Ashutosh decides to take Malika home till she recovers. Nidhi did not like this but remained silent. However, Malika started filming illness to get closer to Ashutosh & eliminate Nidhi out from his life. Malika succeeded in creating regular arguments between Ashutosh & Nidhi, but they both patched up everytime, which disappoints Malika. Nidhi realises about Malika's illness drama when she saw her throwing her tablets out of the window and decides to expose her. Malika decides to kill Nidhi as the only way to get close to Ashutosh. She orders sleeping pills from Purohit Chemist and mixes it in her food. However, Dr. Rangnath is informed by medical store that Malika had ordered sleeping pills without prescription and he informs Anji. Anji informed Nidhi, who suspects that Malika has poisoned her food, and blames her for this. When Ashutosh gets angry on Nidhi & attempts to eat the same food, Malika stops him and confesses her ill acts. Ashutosh eliminates her from his house. Dr. Rangnath calls his parents to Lucknow to see Anji after her parents force him. Rangnath's parents were traditional in nature and thus first disapproves Anji without seeing her since she was a modern girl and they wanted Rangnath to marry a village based girl. They had selected a girl named Susila and called her to live with them. Rangnath did not like her at all. Nidhi & Anji plan to put city life craze into Susila's mind and they succeeded. Susila told Rangnath's parents that she wants to be like a modern girl, but this develops a negative image in Rangnath's parents mind and they eliminate her. They finally agreed to meet Anji. To impress Rangnath's parents, Anji started behaving like a typical cultured and spiritual village girl and she succeeded. both families finally approve their marriage, however Anji's father Kapil Solanki and Rangnath father had few heated arguments before the marriage. Meanwhile, Dadi Bua now had a wish to see Nidhi & Ashutosh's child and keeps on reminding them about it. Ashutosh also wanted a child (inorder to again bring back his lost childhood days), but Nidhi strictly refused saying her career was more important than motherhood at that time. She demanded 2 years from Ashutosh to develop her career, which Ashutosh hesitantly agreed. Nidhi rejoined Kotnis Hospital but is assigned Admin work. Jagan suddenly enters Ashutosh's cabin and blackmails him that Malika & he will not be spared. Jagan accused Ashutosh that he had hidden Malika and saved her from him. But Ashutosh denies Jagan that he does not have any relation with Malika since she tried killing Nidhi. However, Jagan follows him to find Malika's home. When Jagan visited her home and started blackmailing her, Ashutosh arrived with police arrested Jagan. Since Malika was pregnant, Ashutosh decides to help her and frequently visits her, but Nidhi did not like this. She requested Ashutosh to stop meeting her as he had already done huge favours by shifting her to new home and getting Jagan arrested. Ashutosh explains that he is helping Malika just because she is pregnant and she might need help anytime, however Nidhi disapproves this. Suddenly Malika develops immense pain and Ashutosh brought her to Kotnis Hospital. Nidhi was deeply hurt to see this and this created a huge argument between her & Ashutosh. Mallika realises that Ashutosh & Nidhi are not talking with each other due to her. She apologizes to Nidhi and says that she is going to Australia to live with her brother and will never bother both of them now. Later, a patient, Amar Tiwari (Dheeraj Dhoopar) was injured in a shootout and is brought to the hospital by Nidhi. He gradually falls in love with Nidhi, but Nidhi does not pay much attention. In order to make Ashutosh feel jealous, she tries to be friendly with Amar, but Ashutosh understood Nidhi's plan. Ashutosh warned Nidhi that Amar seems to be from a criminal background and so he changed Nidhi's duty. Finally, Ashutosh tells Aman that Nidhi is his wife and he should not try to come close to her. Amar's brother, Bajrang Tiwari was in fact a criminal, and he could not see Amar's broken. He kidnapped Ashutosh and decided to kill him to allow Amar to come closer to Nidhi. When Aman realised this, he informed Nidhi and both reach the spot where threy found Ashutosh fighting with Bajrang. Ashutosh was rescued but his left hand got injured when one of the gang member shot him. Later, Nidhi and Ashutosh solve the differences she returns. Nidhi discovers that Dr. Mathur was in love with his college friend Dr. Aradhana (Anju Mahendru), but did not marry her. She goes to Allahabad to Dr. Aradhana's clinic, tells her about Dr. Mathur, and asks her to come to Lucknow. Dr. Mathur tells Aradhana he had wanted to marry her but had to marry his principal's daughter to save him from humiliation. Aradhana feels sorry for misunderstanding Mathur for so many years.

Life 45 York Place, Edinburgh Duncan was the son of Elizabeth Knox and Andrew Duncan, the elder, born at Adam Square in Edinburgh on 10 August 1773. His early education was at the High School in Edinburgh. He was then apprenticed (1787‚Äì92) to Alexander and George Wood, surgeons of Edinburgh. He graduated with an MA in 1793, and MD in 1794. Duncan studied in London in 1794‚Äì5 at the Windmill Street School, under Matthew Baillie, William Cumberland Cruikshank, and James Wilson. He then made two long visits to the continent, studying medical practice in G√∂ttingen,Johanna Oehler: ¬ªAbroad at G√∂ttingen¬´ Britische Studenten als Akteure des Kultur- Wissenstransfers 1735‚Äì1806, Wallstein, G√∂ttingen 2016, pp. 289‚Äì326 (German) Vienna, Pisa, and Naples, and meeting Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, Johann Peter Frank, Antonio Scarpa, and Lazzaro Spallanzani. Returning to Edinburgh, he became a fellow of the College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and physician to the Royal Public Dispensary, assisting his father also in editing the Annals of Medicine. He later became physician to the Fever Hospital at Queensberry House. In 1807, a professorship of medical jurisprudence and medical police was created at Edinburgh, with Duncan as first professor, with an endowment of ¬£100 per annum; but attendance at lectures in this subject was not made compulsory. From 1809 to 1822, he acted as secretary of the university's academic senate and librarian; while from 1816 until his death he was an active member of the college commission for rebuilding the university, including the Adam-Playfair buildings. In 1819 he resigned his professorship of medical jurisprudence on being appointed joint professor with his father of the institutes of medicine. In 1821 he was elected without opposition professor of materia medica. In 1827, Duncan had a severe attack of fever, and his strength afterwards gradually declined. He lectured until nearly the end of the session 1831‚Äì2, and died at his home at 45 York PlaceEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1829-30 on 13 May 1832, aged 58. He is buried in St Johns Churchyard on Princes Street. Works Duncan in 1803 published the Edinburgh New Dispensatory, an improved version of William Lewis's work. This became very popular, a 10th edition appearing in 1822. It was translated into German and French, and was several times republished in the United States. He published a supplement to it in 1829. From 1805, he was for many years chief editor of the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, which gained a leading position in the field. In 1809, he contributed to the Transactions of the Highland Society a \\"Treatise on the Diseases which are incident to Sheep in Scotland\\". He also published in 1818 Reports of the Practice in the Clinical Wards of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Perhaps his most distinctive discovery was the isolation of the principle cinchonin from cinchona, as related in Nicholson's Journal, 2nd ser. volume vi. December 1803. Besides writing copiously in his own Journal, he also wrote occasionally for the Edinburgh Review. *The Edinburgh new Dispensatory : containing 1. The Elements of pharmaceutical Chemistry ; 2.

He was a member of the Royal Society of Watercolours and received Royal patronage from Queen Victoria. Biography Edward Duncan was the son of Thomas Duncan (c. 1781 - 1841) and Peggy n√©e Watson. He was born on 21 October 1803 at St Pancras in London.Chatterton 1967, p. 101 He was apprenticed to Robert Havell, the principal aquatint engraver of Audubon's Birds of America. Duncan was thus afforded frequent opportunities of studying the works of Havell's brother, the watercolorist, William Havell. These developed his taste for drawing and the use of colour. After tutelage under the Havell Brothers in London, Duncan started his own engraving studio, and primarily created print works for Fores of Piccadilly. In 1826, a project to engrave maritime scenes, after paintings by William John Huggins (the official artist to the royal court of King William IV, and King George IV) are said to have sparked Duncan's interest in marine subjects. In about 1835 Duncan married Huggins' daughter Berthia (1811-1884). The couple had six sons and one daughter, Berth(e)a. One of the sons was Walter Duncan, also a painter. The influences of both Havell and Huggins undoubtedly led to Duncan's long and successful career as one of Britain's foremost marine watercolorists. Edward Duncan was a painstaking artist with his preferred media. In addition to his early training as an engraver, he was skilled in oils, lithography and etching. Duncan's drawings comprise a wide range of subjects but his best known works depict coastal scenes with shipping and other marine craft. Duncan also specialised in landscapes of the southern counties, often populated with animals and farms. In the face of the vogue for painting with body-colours, Duncan relied almost entirely on transparent colours. His watercolours are amongst the most technically defined and detailed paintings of the period and are considered to have a breadth and fluidity that bespeak the earlier traditions of British watercolour. Duncan was a prolific exhibitor of his works, showing more than 40 at the Royal Academy and the Society of British Artists, and including more than 500 watercolors and drawings within the shows of the Old and New Watercolor Societies during his career. His works include; ‚Ä¢ The Shipwreck. 1859. ‚Ä¢ The Life-Boat. 1860. ‚Ä¢ Blue Lights. ‚Ä¢ Oyster Dredgers ‚Äî Swansea Bay. 1874. ‚Ä¢ Landing Fish on the Sands at Whitby. ‚Ä¢ Fishing Boats making for the Harbour of Boulogne ‚Äî early morning. * Spithead from the Isle of Wight. 1857. In 1833 he was elected a member of the New Society of Painters in Water- Colours, but he resigned in 1847 and, in 1849 was elected an Associate of the Royal Watercolour Society (then, the Society of Painters in Water-Colours), and a full member in the following year. Between 1865 and his death in 1882 he spent almost every summer painting in the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea, painting the coastal scenes for which he became known. He died in Hampstead, London, on 11 April 1882. A sale of his works at Christie's in 1885 took three days; and a sale of 1887 lists nearly 2,000 of his sketches and paintings.

Early life Duncan was born at Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, on 19 December 1794. His mother, Ann Caird, was not married to his father, John Duncan, a weaver of Drumlithie, eight miles from Stonehaven, and she supported herself and the boy by harvesting and by weaving stockings. He never went to school, but very early gathered rushes in the valleys, from which he made pith wicks for sale. During his boyhood he acquired a strong love for wild plants. From the age of fifteen he went as herd-boy to various farms, receiving cruel treatment. In 1809, Duncan was apprenticed for five years to a weaver in Drumlithie, a village of country linen-weavers. His master, Charles Pirie, an ill-tempered man who had almost conquered the celebrated Captain Robert Barclay Allardice, carried on an illicit still and smuggled gin. He was cruel to his apprentice; but his wife helped him with reading. He did not learn to write till after he was thirty years of age. He obtained the loan of Nicholas Culpeper's British Herbal, then reputed among village herbalists. In 1814, however, when his apprenticeship had still some months to run, Duncan ran away and returned to Stonehaven, where he lived with his mother for two years. He managed to buy a copy of Culpeper, and he practised herbalism all his life. From Culpeper, too, and the astrology it contained, he gained an introduction to astronomy. Move to Aberdeen In 1816, Duncan and his mother moved to Aberdeen, where he learnt woollen-weaving. He married in 1818, but his wife proved unfaithful, and, after deserting him, demanded money. In 1824, Duncan became a travelling or household weaver, varying his work with harvesting, and taking a half-yearly spell of training as a militiaman at Aberdeen for nearly twenty years. He became a skilled weaver, studying the mechanics of the loom, and purchasing Essays on the Art of Weaving (Glasgow, 1808), by a namesake, the inventor of the patent tambouring machinery, Alexander Peddie's Weaver's Assistant, 1817, and Murphy on Weaving, 1831. He also devoted himself to advancing his general education by the aid of dictionaries and grammars, proceeding also to acquire some Latin and Greek. He gradually purchased Sir John Hill's edition of the Herbal, Joseph Pitton de Tournefort's Herbal, James Rennie's Medical Botany, and works on astrology and astronomy. Duncan never possessed a watch after he left Aberdeen, but became an expert dialler, and made himself a pocket sun-dial on James Ferguson's model. From his outdoor habits of astronomical observation he was nicknamed Johnnie Meen, or Moon, and also 'the Nogman', from his queer pronunciation of the word gnomon, which he often used. For many years he lived in the Vale of Alford, under Benachie, and devoted himself chiefly to astronomy and botany. He was abstemious, his bed, board, washing, and dress not costing him more than four shillings a week. Botanist In 1836, Duncan made the acquaintance of Charles Black, gardener at Whitehouse, near Netherton. They became friends, and helped each other in the study of botany; they formed large collections of every attainable plant for many miles round, preserving and naming them. Sir W. J. Hooker's British Flora they only managed to see at a local inn until 1852, when Duncan bought it. Duncan lived in poverty and obscurity, only emerging once as far as Edinburgh, where Black was working at the botanical gardens. His herbarium succumbed largely to dampness and insects, but in 1880, when he presented it to Aberdeen University, it still contained 75% of the British species of flowering plants, and nearly every species mentioned in George Dickie's Flora of Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine. Later life After 1852 Duncan lived in the village of Droughsburn, performing every office for himself except the preparation of his meals. He was a regular church-goer, being a Free church man, but always took some wild flowers to church. He acquired considerable knowledge of animals, purchasing Charles Knight's Natural History, and in later years he studied phrenology. He was a liberal in politics. In 1874, from failing health, Duncan was obliged to seek parish help. In 1878, Mr. W. Jolly of Inverness, who had visited him the preceding year, gave an account of Duncan in Good Words, which brought him some assistance; in 1880 a public appeal was made on his behalf. He died on 9 August 1881 in his eighty-seventh year, having left the balance of the fund raised for him to furnish prizes for the encouragement of natural science, especially botany, among the school children of the Vale of Alford.

Al-Nuaimi, who spent more than thirty years in self-imposed exile from Bahrain, founded some of the country's most important political opposition groups. He was born in 1944 on Muharraq island to the Sunni Al Nuaim family that has close ties to the traditional ruling circles. In the 1960s, he became increasingly politically active and joined the Arab Nationalist Movement. In 1966, he graduated from the American University of Beirut with a degree in mechanical engineering. He founded the Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain (PFLB), a resistance group, during the 1970s. The groups was inspired by the Arab Nationalist Movement which was sweeping though the Arab World at the time. After a crackdown on the workers' movements at the power station where he was working in 1968, he left Bahrain to live in exile, spending 33 years in Damascus. In 2001, al-Nuaimi returned to Bahrain from abroad and re-entered politics. He founded the National Democratic Action Society (NDA), Bahrain's largest leftist political party, with members of the former PFLB. The NDA is also known as the Wa'ad party. Al- Nuaimi ran for a seat in the Council of Representatives of Bahrain during the 2006 parliamentary election, but lost to a pro-candidate candidate by a small margin.

On Dartbrook Station, in the Upper Hunter Valley, Hall selectively crossed the offspring of Northumberland Drover's Dogs (Border Collie lineage) that he had imported, with the progeny of dingoes that he had tamed. By 1840 he had bred the type of dog that he needed to control cattle on the massive runs that his family owned, and until he died in 1870 few of these dogs were owned and used by anyone outside the Hall family and their workers. However the death of Thomas Hall and the break-up of the Hall estate coincided with the development of the dog show, and an interest in breeding dogs to specific criteria or standards. The Halls Heeler was further developed into two contemporary dog breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog.The name is spelled both with the possessive apostrophe, as Hall's Heeler, and without.  History  Halls Heeler, early 1900s George Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, George's son Thomas Simpson Hall and some of his older brothers had established two cattle stations in the Hunter Region, Gundebri near the present day Merriwa, and Dartbrook near Aberdeen. In the 1828 census Thomas Hall is described as 20 years old, and the manager of Dartbrook. Using this property as a home base, Hall began a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland, setting up properties for the family and eventually controlling over 1 million acres of good grazing land. On Dartbrook Thomas Hall set about breeding the cattle needed to stock these extensive holdings, and developed a herd of polled shorthorn cattle from stock imported from Durham in 1830. Getting the cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub. A droving dog was desperately needed but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of Old English Sheepdog type (commonly referred to as Smithfields; descendants of these dogs still exist) useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents‚Äô home county. At this time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a ‚Äòbreed‚Äô as it is currently understood, and in the manner of the time these blue mottled dogs were known as the Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog. Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes that he had tamed and then continued to selectively crossbreed until 1840, when he was satisfied with his resultant breed. This working cattle dog was so suited to the Hall's needs that no breed changes were considered necessary by Thomas for the rest of his life. During the next 30 years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls and those who worked for them. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Halls' properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them that Halls Heelers became freely available. Jack Timmins was a contract drover working in the Upper Hunter Valley and was employed by the Hall family to take cattle to the Sydney markets. In the late 1840s he obtained a pair of Halls Heelers, from which he bred a line of dogs that he described as \\"great biters\\", a characteristic which led to the dogs being called Timmins Biters. Robert Kaleski referred to them as \\"wonderful workers\\" in an article titled The Working Dogs of Australia in 1911. Other Hall associates, particularly those on properties distant from Dartbrook near the Queensland border, were also breeding their own dogs from Halls Heeler stock. In 1976 a monument to Thomas Hall's achievement was erected on Dartbrook Road at the Blue Heeler Bridge in Dartbrook, New South Wales. The plaque inscription says: \\"This plaque presented by The Australian Cattle Society of NSW commemorates Thomas S. Hall of Dartbrook who in 1840 in this area carried out his breeding experiments with the native dog the dingo and a pair of smooth coated blue merle collies. These dogs known as Halls Heelers became the foundation of today's breed the Australian Cattle Dog.\\"  Appearance and temperament  While dogs were not routinely bred for consistent appearance before the end of the 19th century, the Halls Heeler was described as a thick-set dingo, usually speckled blue or red in appearance.  Descendants  By the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. They reportedly adopted the term Australian Cattle Dog to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \\"heelers\\", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, at the time a young associate of Harry Bagust, noted that in 1893 cattle dog breeders had begun to \\"fix the type\\" so he drew up a standard for them on those lines. Selective breeding of those dogs that were born bob-tailed or without tails from some point in the late 19th century led to the development of the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is recognised by the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog Club of New South Wales and by the Australian National Kennel Council in the Working Dogs Group, and it was provisionally accepted by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 2005, in Group 1, Section 2 : Cattle Dogs (except Swiss Cattle Dogs) as breed number 351.

The North-west Tasmanian Coast Important Bird Area comprises a 2438 km2 stretch of coastal and subcoastal land covering the northern section of the coast of western Tasmania, south-eastern Australia. Description The Important Bird Area (IBA) is defined as the 10 km-wide coastal fringe extending along the western coast of Tasmania from Low Rocky Point in the south to Rocky Cape in the north, constituting the mainland Tasmanian section of migratory habitat used by orange-bellied parrots. In the south it adjoins the complementary Melaleuca to Birchs Inlet IBA which covers the south-west Tasmanian coast, with the two IBAs meeting at Macquarie Harbour. In the north it abuts the Robbins Passage and Boullanger Bay IBA.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: North-west Tasmanian Coast. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-09-05. The coast is characterised by rocky headlands, sandy beaches and sand dunes, and is backed by a coastal plain containing lagoons, swamps, heathland, eucalypt forests and woodlands, and areas of buttongrass. The climate is wet temperate maritime with an average annual rainfall of about 1000 mm on the coast, increasing with altitude to about 2000 mm in the highlands. Birds The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an IBA because it regularly supports critically endangered orange-bellied parrots on their annual migration between the breeding ground in South West Tasmania and the wintering sites in coastal mainland south-eastern Australia. It also provides non-breeding habitat for swift parrots and supports populations of fairy terns, hooded plovers, Cape Barren geese and pied oystercatchers, as well as most of Tasmania's endemic bird species. Other birds recorded from the site include sooty oystercatchers, eastern ground parrots, flame and pink robins, tawny-crowned honeyeaters and southern emu- wrens.

Tree- lined residential neighborhoods fringe the property to the south, while Leighton Avenue, a busy transportation corridor, defines its northern boundary. The Holy Rosary Church underwent an extensive restoration and has been converted to low income housing.

It has a hipped roof with wide eaves supported by decoratively-carved rafter tails. Green asphalt shingles cover the roof, and large metal ventilators pierce the ridgeline. The north slope has a chimney made from Hebron brick (the Hebron Bick Company was founded in 1904 in Hebron, North Dakota by European settlers) at the corners and a corbelled top. Darker, red, polychromatic brick adorns the chimney's raised side panels. Two chimneys, similar to the chimney at the north slope, pierce the east slope of the 1910 building's roof. A Mission-style curvilinear parapet rises across the entry bay at attic level on the west (front) elevation, a hipped-roof dormer protrudes from the center of the north slope, and another hipped roof covers the central, protruding bay of the east elevation. The south elevation of the original building was modified when the 1922 annex was constructed. 1922 annex The 1922 annex is three full stories, plus a full daylight basement, and features a flat roof with a banded, straight parapet wall across its west, north, and south elevations. Throughout the exterior, the daylight basement level is finished with smooth concrete, the first story is Hebron brick, and the upper stories are concrete and brick.

It was released in 2001 by Three Rivers Press. The story begins around 1971 with an exploration of the impact that the UK glam rock scene was having on American rock at the time, specifically through the efforts of promoter Rodney Bingenheimer to help sell David Bowie to the American public. There is then an examination of the impact of various bands that were contemporaneous at the time, including The Stooges and The New York Dolls before looking at the roles of bands and key figures that followed including The Screamers, Devo, X, Black Randy, Kim Fowley, Darby Crash, The Go-Go's, The Cramps, Black Flag, Los Lobos, Agent Orange and Social Distortion. The book finishes around 1981 with the perceived 'selling out' of the LA punk scene, including The Go-Go's having their mainstream breakthrough on MTV, Penelope Spheeris' documentary The Decline of Western Civilization and the death of Darby Crash, foreshadowing in Greg Hetson's words \\"the dark years of punk\\" from 1984-1990.

In 2011, The Waitresses were featured in an exhibition about the Woman's Building, \\"Doin' It In Public\\", at Otis College of Art and Design. Performance and vision The Waitresses revolved around the exploration of the unity seen within the work waitresses around the world perform. The group focused on four themes: work, money, sexual harassment, and stereotypes of women. They also explored the sexualization of waitresses, as \\"sex objects, slaves, whores, and women who perform a service.\\" Allyn used her own experience as a waitress to channel the idea of the waitress as a prostitute; making more money in tips from male customers by dressing sexier, and how that experience was universal in waitressing and sexist by concept.Montano, 154. The group would also interview waitresses to pull inspiration from their experiences.Montano, 155. Ready to Order?, the group's first performance, involved a sexually provocative waitress earning a big tip. The piece was a part of a 7-day, site specific conceptual work conceived by Jerri Allyn, and was performed during business hours at a local Los Angeles restaurant. For their guerilla performances, the artists created playful and provocative characters such as Wonder Waitress, \\"who helps the harried and hassled waitresses of the world,\\" and the many- breasted Great Goddess Diana, a critique of the nurturing role expected of waitresses. Beyond addressing sexism, the Waitresses delved into global issues around food production and waste in pieces such as One Plate, One Planet (1981), while Wonder Waitress Takes a Look at the Union (1979) focused on organized labor in the restaurant industry. In 1979 The Waitresses, consisting of 35 participants, marched in the Pasadena Doo Dah Parade as the \\"All City Waitress Marching Band.\\" The group marched wearing waitressing uniforms, led by a bandleader, the band members performed an original piece based on the song \\"McNamara's Band\\", playing pots, pans and cooking tools instead of traditional instruments. In 2007 Allyn, Gauldin, Anne Mavor, Denise Yarfitz Pierre and 37 women, men, and children marched in the Doo Dah Parade again, as the All City Waitress Marching Band, marching in support of pay equity. =Notable performances= *The All American Waitress Radio Show; Pacifica Radio *The All City Waitress Marching Band; Doo Dah Parade References Bibliography *Montano, Linda M.

Life He was born in 1805, was the son of a small farmer of Culdoch, near Kirkcudbright. He had a strong frame and little education. When seventeen years old he enlisted in the 1st Regiment of Life Guards. He taught himself drawing during his service, and in 1839 left the army with a high character. He next obtained an appointment as master-at-arms in Albert, which with Wilberforce and Soudan sailed on the Niger expedition of 1841. On the voyage out he was wounded by a poisoned arrow in a conflict with the natives at the Cape de Verde Isles. Duncan held a conspicuous position in all the treaties made with the native chiefs. He was selected to march at the head of his party, in the cumbrous uniform of a Lifeguard, when the heat was fearful even to the natives themselves. When at Egga, the highest point reached by the Albert on the Niger, he ventured upon an exploration further up, taking a few natives only, but sickness compelled the abandonment of the project. On reaching Fernando Po, Duncan was attacked by fever, the effects of which were aggravated by his previous wound; he reached England in an emaciated condition. As soon as his health improved Duncan proposed to penetrate the unknown land from the western coast to the Kong mountains, and between the Lagos and Niger rivers. His plans were approved by the Royal Geographical Society, and the lords of the admiralty granted him a free passage in , which left England on 17 June 1844, and reached Cape Castle on 22 July following. After an attack of fever he commenced his journey from the coast to Whydah, and afterwards made the unexampled feat of a passage through the Dahomey country to Adofidiah, of which he sent particulars to the Royal Geographical Society, dated 19 April and 4 October 1845. He was refused a passage through the Ashantee country, but was favourably received by the king of Dahomey. Another attack of fever was followed by a breaking out of the old wound, and Duncan made preparations to amputate his own leg. He succeeded, however, in returning to Cape Coast. There, early in 1846, he planned a journey to Timbuktu. Funds to assist him were being forwarded by his friends in England, when his health compelled him to return, and he sailed for home in February 1846. In 1849, Duncan proposed to continue his explorations, and the government appointed him vice-consul at Whydah. He arrived in the Bight of Benin, but died on board the ship Kingfisher on 3 November 1849. Works In 1847, he published Travels in Western Africa in 1845 and 1846, comprising a Journey from Whydah through the Kingdom of Dahomey to Adofidiah in the Interior, 2 volumes, London, duodecimo. The preface is dated \\"Feltham Hill, August 1847\\". The work has a steel portrait of the author by Durham, and a map of the route. The same year he contributed to Bentley's Miscellany a paper in two parts, entitled Some Account of the late Expedition to the Niger. Duncan's sense and powers of observation make up for deficient education, and his book contains many interesting notices of African superstitions. Family He was married, and his wife survived him.

Life Duncan was the son of Thomas Duncan of Maxpoffle, Roxburghshire, by Janet, daughter of Patrick Oliphant of Sowdoun in the same county, is supposed to have been born about 1570, and to have been educated partly in Scotland and partly on the continent. He certainly took the degree of M.D., but at what university is not known. From Duplessis-Mornay, he was appointed governor of Saumur by Henry IV in 1589; he received the post of professor of philosophy in the University of Saumur, of which he subsequently became regent. Duncan is said to have been versed in mathematics and theology, as well as in philosophy, and to have acquired such a reputation for medical skill that James I offered him the post of physician in ordinary at the English court, and even forwarded to him the necessary patent; but to have declined the royal invitation out of regard to his wife (a French lady), who was reluctant to leave her native land. Duncan lived at Saumur until his death, which took place in 1640, to the regret, it is said, of Protestants and Catholics alike. Works Duncan published in 1612 Institutiones Logic√¶, to which Burgersdijck, in the preface to his own Institutiones Logic√¶ (second edition 1634), acknowledged himself much indebted, and which indeed seems to have served as a model to the latter work; also (anon.) in 1634, Discours de la Possession des Religieuses Ursulines de Loudun, an investigation of the supposed cases of demoniacal possession among the Ursuline nuns of Loudun. The phenomena had been attributed to the sorcery of Urbain Grandier, cur√© and canon of Loudun, who had been burned at the stake in consequence. Duncan explained them, at much risk to himself, as the result of melancholy. He is said to have been shielded from the vengeance of the clergy only by the influence of the wife of the Mar√©chal Urbain de Maill√©-Br√©z√©, then governor of Saumur. This work elicited an answer in the shape of a Trait√© de la M√©lancholie by the Sieur de la Menardi√®re, and that in its turn an Apologie pour Mr. Duncan, Docteur en M√©decine, dans laquelle les plus rares effects de la M√©lancholie et de l'imagination sont expliquez contre les reflexions du Sieur de la Mre par le Sieur de la F. M.. La Fl√®che (no date). Duncan also wrote a treatise entitled Aglossostomographie on a boy who continued to speak after he had lost his tongue, pronouncing only the letter \\"r\\" with difficulty. The faulty Greek of the title, which should have been Aglossostomatographie, was very severely criticised in prose and verse by a rival physician of Saumur, named Benoit. Family Mark Duncan married Suzanne Gorin or Gorrin at the Protestant temple in Saumur on 7 January 1611. They had three sons and three daughters who survived childhood. The three sons were Mark Duncan de C√©risantis; Fran√ßois Duncan, Sieur de Saint Hel√®ne, b.1617 in Saumur, d.1697 in London; and Jean or John Duncan, Sieur de Montfort, b.1624 in Samur, entered the service of Queen Christina of Sweden, d.1646 in Stockholm. The three daughters were Guillonne (1612-1670), Rachel (b.1613) and Claude (1619-c.1684). After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, Mark and Suzanne's granddaughter Suzanne Martin, daughter of their daughter Rachel, differed in opinion so strongly from her husband Mo√Øse Poitevin, of another large Saumur Protestant family, that they separated: he abjured and stayed in France, but she left c. mid-1688, first to England, where she did her \\"reconnaissance\\" at Leicester Fields Huguenot Church, then to Rotterdam where she bore her last-born, Paul Poitevin, in December 1688, whose godfather was Pierre de Monnery, father-in-law of minister and pastor Daniel de Superville.

Life He was born in 1772 at South Warnborough, Hampshire, where his father was rector. He was educated at Winchester College (where he afterwards founded the Duncan Prizes), and at New College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow in 1792. He graduated B.A. 1794, M.A. 1798. Among the school and college friends with whom he continued intimate were Archbishop William Howley, Bishop Richard Mant, and Sydney Smith. He was called to the bar in 1796, and for a few years attended the home and the western circuits. From 1801 until his death, he lived much at Bath, and promoted many local scientific and philanthropic schemes. He was elected president of the Bath United Hospital in 1841. In 1826, he was made keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, in succession to his elder brother, John Shute Duncan, author of Hints to the Bearers of Walking Sticks and Umbrella, anonymous, 3rd edition 1809; Botano Theology, 1825; and Analogies of Organised Beings, 1831. Philip Duncan increased the Ashmolean zoological collections, and himself gave many donations. He also presented to the university with casts of antique statues and various models. Duncan advocated the claims of physical science and mathematics to a prominent place in Oxford studies. He was instrumental in establishing at Oxford, as also at Bath, a savings bank and a society for the suppression of mendacity. He resigned his keepership in 1855, and was then given the honorary degree of D.C.L. Duncan died on 12 November 1863, at Westfield Lodge, his home, near Bath, aged 91. He was unmarried. Character assessment He was a man of simple habits and refined tastes. Archbishop Howley said of him and his brother: Works He had published in 1836 A Catalogue of the Ashmolean Museum, octavo, and in 1845 had printed at considerable cost a Catalogue of the manuscripts bequeathed by Ashmole to the University of Oxford (edited by W.

Although it was discovered in 1923, Acallosuchus was not described until 1995, when the type species A. rectori was named. The taxonomy classification of Acallosuchus is uncertain. Although it is known to be a neodiapsid reptile, it has not been assigned with confidence to any particular group of neodiapsids. History In 1923, paleontologist Charles Lewis Camp discovered a bone in the Chinle Formation in what is now Petrified Forest National Park. It was found on top of a Placerias jaw in an area called Crocodile Hill, part of the late Carnian-age Blue Mesa Member of the formation. The bone included the skull and lower jaws of a reptile, but when Camp removed it from the surrounding rock, then it broke apart. Camp described the skull as being long, with a broken rostrum, and thought it belonged to a pterosaur or small dinosaur. Camp's description of this specimen was confined to his field notes and was not published. In 1983, sixty years after it was first found, the specimen was rediscovered in a cigar box in a storage room of the University of California Museum of Paleontology. Bone fragments were crushed and did not resemble the sketches Camp made in his notes. The specimen was cataloged as UCMP 7038/27095 and formally described in 1995 as a new genus and species, Acallosuchus rectori. The term \\"Acallosuchus\\" means \\"ugly crocodile\\" from the Greek \\"akalles\\" (\\"ugly\\") and \\"suchus\\" (\\"crocodile\\"). The species was named after Roger Rector, a former superintendent of Petrified Forest National Park, and his wife. A postcranial skeleton was also referred to Acallosuchus in 1989, although it was not found with the skull material. This skeleton was found in 1962 in an area very close to where Camp found UCMP 7038/27095. It was referred to Acallosuchus because it belonged to an animal of similar size to UCMP 7038/27095. The two specimens also had bony armor. In 1995, both specimens were redescribed. Because the postcranial skeleton was not associated with the original Acallosuchus material, it was placed in its own genus called Vancleavea. Description Although it is poorly preserved, the skull of Acallosuchus has several features that distinguish it from other reptiles. The overall shape of the skull is long and narrow with large projections along its upper surface. These projections were first interpreted as osteoderms that fused to the cranial bones of the skull, but were later proposed to be knobs originating from the cranial bones themselves. Identifiable skull bones include a postorbito-jugal bar (a strut behind the eye socket) and a frontal with a small piece of the postorbital attached. The mandible or lower jaw is even thinner than the skull and is lined by small, closely spaced alveoli or tooth sockets. Based on the shape and number of these sockets, Acallosuchus had at least 23 teeth in its lower jaw with the forward-most being the largest. The lower jaw is also covered in two rows of bony knobs that are similar to those on the skull. Classification When it was first named in 1989, Acallosuchus was classified as a proterochampsid archosauriform. This was mainly based on the postcranial skeleton that is now assigned to Vancleavea, a definite archosauriform. When Vancleavea and Acallosuchus were distinguished from each other in 1995, both were redescribed as indeterminate diapsid reptiles. The presence of a postorbito-jugal bar indicates that Acallosuchus is a diapsid with the characteristic presence of two large holes in the back of the skull (the bar would have formed the anterior margins of these holes). In 1995, similarities were noted between the bony ridges of Acallosuchus and the skulls of the archosauriforms Proterochampsa and Doswellia. A 2005 study also pointed out similarities with the archosaur Revueltosaurus. However, there are no features that definitively link Acallosuchus with any specific group of diapsids.

Life He was a native of Aberdeenshire, was born on 12 March 1811 at Bluefield, Towie, and educated for the Scottish national church. He subsequently embraced Catholicism, was accepted as a student at the Scots Benedictine College, Ratisbon, and afterwards at the new college at Blairs, Kincardineshire, but having offended the authorities there by too outspoken criticism on a sermon, he gave up all thoughts of entering the priesthood. He started publishing and bookselling business in Aberdeen, after five years he was poorer than when he began. He then resorted to teaching and to writing for the press, and was an earnest advocate of the Reform Bill of 1832 and of Lord Stanley's Irish education scheme. In July 1838, Duncan went out to New South Wales, becoming a publisher in Sydney. The following year, he was appointed editor of a newly established Roman Catholic journal, the Australasian Chronicle and used the journal to comment on many matters of controversy.J.M. O'Brien, W. A. Duncan, the Irish question, and the NSW elections of 1843, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, 4 (1) (1972), 40-57; B.J.

Fowler, Anti- Catholic polemic at the origins of Australia's first Catholic newspaper, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 37 (2) (2016), 147-160. On relinquishing this post in 1843, he issued a paper of his own, Duncan's Weekly Register of Politics, Facts, and General Literature. In 1846, he was appointed by Sir George Gipps sub-collector of customs at Moreton Bay, and soon after settling at Brisbane he was placed on the commission of the peace, made water police magistrate, guardian of minors, and local immigration commissioner. In January 1859, he succeeded Colonel Gibbes as collector of customs for New South Wales, which appointment he held until 1881. On his return to Sydney, after thirteen years' absence, he declined the chairmanship of the National Board of Education; but afterwards accepted an ordinary seat at the board, of which he remained a prominent member until its dissolution. Duncan was afterwards on the council of education, and was also chairman of the free public library. For his services to the colony he was awarded the distinction of C.M.G. in the 1881 Birthday Honours, together with a pension from the colonial government. He died in 1885. Works Duncan, whose acquaintance with modern languages was unusually extensive, translated from the Spanish of Pedro Fernandes de Queiros an Account of a Memorial presented to his Majesty Philip III., king of Spain, concerning the Population and Discovery of the Fourth Part of the World, Australia the unknown, its great Riches and Fertility, printed anno 1610, Spanish and English, octavo, Sydney, 1874, to which he appended an introductory notice.

Following the failure of the 1685 Rising, he escaped to the Dutch Republic, and returned after the 1688 Glorious Revolution in Scotland. During the Jacobite rising of 1689, he commanded the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, the primary unit involved in the Massacre, after which he was posted to Flanders for the Nine Years' War, where he remained until the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick. When the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701, he served in Flanders until 1704, when he was posted to Spain and Portugal; in May 1705, he died of wounds sustained leading an assault on the Spanish border town of Valencia de Alcantara. Biography Robert Duncanson was one of four children born to John Duncanson (c.1630‚Äì1687), and his first wife, Beatrix Campbell; his date of birth is unknown, but is estimated as being around 1658 to 1660. Originally from Stirlingshire, John was appointed minister at Kilmartin in 1655, a Church of Scotland parish controlled by Earls of Argyll. He was one of the dissidents removed by the Rescissory Act 1661; although appointed to Kilbrandon and Kilchattan, he was removed again in 1684. Career Carnasserie Castle, seat of Sir Duncan Campell of Auchinbreck; destroyed after the 1685 Rising Little is known of Duncanson's early years, and there is no record of any marriage; the first time he makes an appearance was during Argyll's Rising in 1685, launched in response to the succession of the Catholic James II. The local laird at Kilmartin was Campbell of Auchinbreck, hereditary Lieutenant-Colonel to the Earls of Argyll and one of the few to actively support the revolt. Both Duncanson and his father helped recruit clan levies for the Rising; after it failed, the two went into exile in the Dutch Republic along with Auchinbreck. English and Scottish volunteers had served in the Dutch military since the 1570s, grouped in what became known as the Scots Brigade. By the 1680s, it contained three Scottish and three English regiments, many officers being religious or political exiles. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, these exiles were used to replace those loyal to James II or appointed to new regiments raised by the Scottish and English Parliaments. One of these was William Beveridge; on 28 February 1689, Duncanson was commissioned as an Ensign in the newly formed Beveridge's Regiment, later 14th Foot and promoted Captain-Lieutenant on 24 September. With the commencement of the 1689 Jacobite Rising in March, the Parliament of Scotland authorised Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll to raise a unit of 800 men, known as the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot. Duncanson joined as Major in July 1690 and remained with it until disbanded in February 1697; it seems he was in effective operational control for most of that period. A copy of Duncanson's written orders to Glenlyon The Argylls became operational shortly after the Jacobite victory at Killiecrankie in July 1689 and were based at Perth to counter an advance towards Edinburgh. This threat never arose and in July 1690 they moved to Fort William as part of the force commanded by Colonel John Hill, the military governor tasked with pacifying the Highlands. This included Colonel Hill's own regiment which was commanded by Lt-Colonel James Hamilton and is often confused with the Argylls. The next 18 months were spent retaking or destroying strongpoints captured by anti- government forces after Killiecrankie, including Castle Stalker, Duart Castle and Cairnburgh Castle. At the end of January 1692, two companies of the Argylls under Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon were sent to Glencoe where they were billeted on the local MacDonalds. Officially this was to collect property tax; payment in kind or 'free quarter' was a common means of paying tax in a largely non-cash society. As instructed by Lord Stair, Secretary of State for Scotland, on 12 February Colonel Hill issued orders to Lt-Colonel Hamilton and Duncanson. Hamilton was to block the northern exits of Glencoe at Kinlochleven while Duncanson would join Glenlyon at the southern end, then sweep north. Glenlyon began the operation as ordered at 4:00 am on 13 February; in all, 38 people were killed and another 40 died of exposure. Casualties might have been considerably higher but both Duncanson and Hamilton were delayed by severe weather and not in position until 11:00. The Scottish Parliamentary Commission set up to investigate the Massacre in 1695 focused on whether orders had been exceeded, not their legality. They were unable to reach a conclusion on Duncanson and left the decision to William III who took no further action. Shortly after Glencoe, a threatened Jacobite invasion meant the Argylls moved to Brentford in England. When this failed to occur, they transferred to Flanders in early 1693 and suffered heavy casualties attacking tFrench fortifications at Dottignies on 9 July. The unit became 'Lord Lorne's Regiment' in April 1694, when Argyll's eldest son became Colonel. Operational command was exercised by Lt-Colonel Hume, who was severely wounded at Namur in 1695, leaving Duncanson as senior officer. {sfnChilds1991p=285}} Valencia de Alcantara; bridge leading to town gate, Duncanson was wounded nearby This meant he was in command when the regiment was part of the garrison at Diksmuide, a strategic point for the Siege of Namur. Besieged by the French on 25 July, the garrison commander Ellenberg capitulated two days later; Duncanson protested and refused to sign the terms of surrender. He was later promoted Lt-Colonel as a reward, but Ellenberg was executed in November, and the other signatories dismissed. After the prisoners were exchanged in September, Lorne's was based in Damme; by 1696, the war was winding down and it was recorded as being disbanded or 'broke' in February 1697. Duncanson went onto half-pay and spent several years in Debtor's prison, for ¬£1,200 owed to a Joseph Ashley for clothing supplied to the regiment in 1696; this was eventually settled by the Treasury. When the War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701, the army expanded once again, and he was appointed Lt-Colonel of Huntingdon's Regiment. After serving in Flanders, this was transferred to Portugal in 1704 as part of the expeditionary force which supported the claim of Archduke Charles to the Spanish throne. Promoted Colonel in February 1705, Duncanson died of wounds sustained leading an assault on the Spanish border town of Valencia de Alcantara on 8 May.

Life In 1640, he was \\"strayed three times\\" for refusing to pay ship-money. He was ordered to march with the king's forces against the Scots; but he was allowed, after some troublesome negotiations, to hire a substitute. Processes were also begun against him in the commissaries' court and the court of arches. This caused him to repair several times to London, and led finally to his being \\"damnified about ¬£300\\". Duncon complained to the parliament, but without result. When the English Civil War broke out, he as well as his father and father-in-law, aided the parliament with many contributions, by raising troops (which brought him into direct communication with Cromwell), and by acting as high collector of assessments until 1651. Duncon seems finally to have settled in London, and to have died about the time of the Restoration.

These peacemakers were to be the \\"most understanding plain honest-harted men\\" that the people of the district could find. Their function was to be to settle all sorts of disputes, and thus avoid as far as possible the necessity for law courts.

He is best known as the author of an unfinished county history of Herefordshire (published 1804‚Äì12). Life Duncumb was the second son of Thomas Duncumb, rector of Shere, Surrey. He was educated at a school in Guildford, under a clergyman named Cole; and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1787, and proceeded M.A. in 1796. In 1788 he settled in Hereford, acting as both editor and printer of Charles Pugh's Hereford Journal. Duncumb's journalistic career ended in 1791, when he was ordained. He was instituted to the rectory of Talachddu, near Brecon, in 1793; and to Frilsham, Berkshire, in the same year. In 1809 he became vicar of Tortington, Sussex, but resigned the living soon afterwards on his institution as rector of Abbey Dore, Herefordshire (the Duke of Norfolk being patron of both benefices). In 1815 he obtained the vicarage of Mansel Lacy, Herefordshire, from Uvedale Price, and he continued to hold both livings ‚Äì Abbey Dore and Mansel Lacy ‚Äì until his death. Duncumb was secretary to the Herefordshire Agricultural Society from its formation in 1797, and in 1801 he published an Essay on the Best Means of Applying Pasture Lands, etc., to the Production to Grain, and of reconverting them to Grass. Another treatise was a General View of the Agriculture of the County of Hereford (1805), written for the consideration of the Board of Agriculture and Internal Improvement. He also published two sermons, one preached on 9 March 1796 (the day appointed for a general fast); the other preached in Hereford Cathedral on 3 August 1796, at the annual meeting of the subscribers to the Hereford General Infirmary (printed in 1797 for the benefit of the charity).; cites By 1809 he had been elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He also served as a magistrate for Herefordshire. Duncumb was never resident in any of his various parishes, but lived from 1788 until his death in Hereford. Death Duncumb died in Hereford on 19 September 1839, aged 74. He was buried in Dore Abbey church, where a monument still exists. His manuscript collections were sold by his widow to a local bookseller. Herefordshire county history =Duncumb's project= In 1790, Duncumb accepted an invitation from Charles, Duke of Norfolk, owner (through his wife) of extensive estates in the county, to compile and edit a county history of Herefordshire. The terms were ¬£2 2s. per week for collecting materials, with extra payment for journeys out of the county, the work to become the property of the Duke. The Duke had bought several collections of antiquarian material relating to the history of the county, and Duncumb drew on these, and on his own researches in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Tower of London and elsewhere. He also distributed questionnaires, but received few returns. The first volume of the Collections towards the History and Antiquities of the County of Hereford, containing a general history of the county and an account of the city, was published as a quarto in Hereford in 1804; and the first part of a second volume, containing the hundreds of Broxash and Ewyas Lacy, with a few pages of Greytree hundred, appeared in 1812. However, the Duke died in December 1815, the payments to Duncumb ended, and he then abandoned work on the project. =Later developments= Following the Duke of Norfolk's death, the unsold portions of the Collections, along with the pages for Greytree hundred (pp. 319‚Äì58), which had been printed but not yet published, were regarded as part of the Duke's personal estate. They were taken from Hereford to a warehouse in London, where the parcels lay undisturbed and forgotten until 1837, when the whole stock was acquired by a bookseller, Thomas Thorpe. Thorpe put the two volumes and the pages of Greytree on sale, adding an index. Volume 2 from p. 358 onwards was completed, with an index, in 1866 by Judge William Henry Cooke. Cooke issued a third volume containing the remainder of Greytree in 1882; and another volume, covering parishes in the hundred of Grimsworth, in two parts in 1886 and 1892.; cites Duncumb, preface to vol. 1; Cooke, postscript to vol. 2, p. 401; preface to vol. 3.After volume 3, volumes of the Collections were not formally numbered. Cooke's Grimsworth volume has sometimes been retrospectively numbered either 4 or 7. George Strong's Heraldry of Herefordshire (London, 1848), arranged by families, with brief accounts of their seats, claims on its title page to be \\"Adapted to form a Supplement to 'Duncumb's County History'\\". In about 1896, a committee was formed to continue the history, and under its auspices two more volumes, edited by Rev. Morgan G. Watkins and covering Huntington and Radlow hundreds, appeared in 1897 and 1902 respectively. Another volume, edited by John H. Matthews and covering Wormelow hundred, was published in two parts in 1912 and 1913. The project proved impossible to continue, and the residual funds were passed to the Woolhope Club (Herefordshire's natural historical, archaeological and historical society), which established the Duncumb Fund to assist the publication of research. A facsimile reprint of Duncumb's first two volumes was published by the Merton Priory Press in 1996. The completed volumes ‚Äì those published by Duncumb, and those edited from his materials by Cooke and Watkins ‚Äì contain much useful material, but have also been criticised for many inaccuracies on points of detail. Janet Cooper describes them as \\"collections of material rather than finished histories\\". Matthews' work is considered more conscientious, but remains \\"patchy\\". Personal life In 1792 Duncumb married Mary (c.1773‚Äì1841), daughter of William Webb of Holmer, near Hereford, by whom he had three children: Thomas Edward (c.1799‚Äì1823), William George (c.1807‚Äì1836), and a daughter.

He served as a shire commissioner to the Scottish Parliament. Life He was son of Sir James Dundas of Arniston, Midlothian, governor of Berwick under James I, and Marie, daughter of George Home of Wedderburn. He was educated at the University of St Andrews. In 1639, he signed the national covenant; in 1640 he was appointed an elder of the church, and on 16 November 1641, he was knighted by Charles I. He represented Edinburgh in parliament in 1648, and was commissioner for war within the sheriffdom of that city between 1643 and 1648, sat on a commission composed partly of lawyers and partly of laymen, to which the liquidation of the insolvent estates of the Earl of Stirling and Lord Alexander was referred in 1644; on a parliamentary committee of 18 appointed to consider of dangers threatening religion, the covenant, and the monarchy, and how to meet them; on another \\"close and secret\\" committee of six empowered to take steps rendered necessary by the presence of garrisons of \\"malignants and sectaries\\" in Berwick and Carlisle in March 1648; and on 11 May was appointed one of the \\"committee of estates\\" in which supreme power was vested during the adjournment of parliament. The same year he was also a member of a committee for considering of ecclesiastical matters in conference with the commissioners of the kirk, and was added to the \\"commission for the plantation of the kirks\\". He signed the solemn league and covenant, apparently with some reluctance, in 1650. From that date his history is a blank until we find him again a member of the commission for the plantation of kirks in 1661, and also one of the commissioners for raising the sum of ¬£40,000 granted to the king in that year. Though not a trained lawyer, he was nominated an ordinary Lord of session, and assumed the title of Lord Arniston, on 16 May 1662; and having satisfied the court of his knowledge of law was admitted to the College of Justice on 4 June. His tenure of office, however, was brief. In 1663 a statute was passed requiring all public officials to subscribe a declaration, affirming the duty of passive obedience, and renouncing the solemn league and covenant. Being unable conscientiously to sign the declaration, Dundas sent in his resignation. It was signed by ten of the Judges on 10 November 1663, Dundas being absent. Though the time for signature was extended in his case until 8 January 1664, and then for a further period of 18 months, and though he was frequently pressed to reconsider the matter, Dundas steadily refused to sign unless he were permitted to qualify the clause in the declaration abjuring the covenant by the words, \\"in so far as it led to deeds of actual rebellion\\". The compromise was not accepted, but it was notified to him that if he would sign the declaration as it stood the king would permit him to make reservation in private audience. To this Dundas replied: \\"If my subscription is to be public, I cannot be satisfied that the salvo should be latent\\". On 28 August 1665, Sir John Lockhart of Castlehill was appointed to succeed him. Dundas died at Arniston in October 1679. Family He married, first, in 1641, Marion, daughter of Robert Boyd, 8th Lord Boyd, together they had three daughters and a son, Robert Dundas, also a Lord of Session.

Located in the Waldorf Astoria Chicago, it originally opened in 2009, serving upscale French cuisine. RIA was popular with critics, earning many awards, including two Michelin stars. After losing executive chef Jason McLeod in 2011, RIA closed on July 27, 2012 after replacement Danny Grant also left his position at the restaurant.  History  RIA was located in the Elysian Hotel, now called the Waldorf Astoria Chicago. RIA was a part of the Elysian Hotel (now the Waldorf Astoria Chicago). The Elysian, developed by David Pisor, was originally conceptualized as a condo hotel before being run as a traditional hotel. RIA was one of two restaurants operated by the Elysian, with the other being European bistro Balsan. RIA and Balsan were both launched in April 2009, with Jason McLeod being the first executive chef for both restaurants. McLeod, originally from Vancouver, had previously worked at the Four Seasons in Whistler and Toronto. While working in San Diego, he was persuaded to come work for the Elysian after initially declining the invitation. Stephanie Prida joined the Elysian in June 2010 as the executive pastry chef for the two restaurants. After closing temporarily from January 1 to 25, 2011 so that the staff could do research in New York, RIA reopened with a new menu. However, on February 11, 2011, it was announced that McLeod would be leaving the restaurant, with chef de cuisine Danny Grant taking his place. McLeod later stated that the parting of ways was amicable. He explained that his decision to leave was fueled by his desire to open his own restaurant, and that he gave notice of his departure during RIA's closure in January. In July of that year, Prida also left for an open position at the restaurant L20. She was replaced by pastry chef Aya Fukai. On July 6, 2012, Grant confirmed that he would be leaving RIA on July 27, with management deciding to close RIA on Grant's last day to perform \\"a repositioning of its food and beverage options.\\"  Description  RIA was described by press release as a \\"globally influenced upscale restaurant\\". Listed by The Chicago Tribune Guide to Chicago as featuring \\"seasonally driven French fare\\", the restaurant was located on the third floor of the Elysian Hotel. Initially, McLeod kept the menu small, stating that the restaurant's \\"goal was to build as we go and add some more dishes\\". As noted by reviewers, the menu simply listed each dish with few other details other than nouns. After reopening in late January 2011, RIA unveiled a retooling of their menu, with about half of the items being new additions. McLeod's seasonal tasting menu included rabbit with foie gras, common sole with leeks, pain de mie, and Peking duck breast with blood orange, fennel and cumin. At the same time, they also introduced a limited-time table d'h√¥te menu called the \\"Ria Lucky Seven\\", where one of seven parties got to experience a three-course meal with champagne for $75. After McLeod's departure, RIA introduced items like a pop-up seven-course lamb dinner. They also created a new spring dinner menu.  Reception  RIA was well-received by food critics. Jeff Ruby of Chicago described the place as a \\"polished new spot\\", as it felt \\"less like a restaurant visit and more like a banquet on a private island with your own staff.\\" Modern Luxury's Michael Nagrant enjoyed his experience, stating that it was \\"an oasis‚Äîof unpretentious fine dining\\" and that the establishment was \\"a five-star restaurant waiting to happen, derailed only by minor details\\". Martha Bayne of the Chicago Reader praised RIA's grilled sturgeon, as well as the \\"pink knuckles of lobster and pale scallop dumplings trickled with impeccably clear pale-gold consomme\\". She described each dish as \\"an expertly composed work of art\\". After McLeod's departure as executive chef, the Chicago Tribune's Phil Vettel gave the restaurant a four-star review, stating that \\"Danny Grant is a taste master.\\" The restaurant also earned many accolades before its closure. In their April 2010 issue, Chicago named it as their Best New Restaurant of 2010. It also earned two Michelin stars in the Michelin Guide. The Chicago edition of Time Out named RIA's seafood dishes as one of the \\"100 Best Things We Ate\\", and the Chicago Reader stated that RIA was one of the best restaurants of 2010. Under Danny Grant, the restaurant maintained its two Michelin stars in 2011. Grant was also nominated for Food & Wine's People's Best New Chef of 2012, which he later won.

Early life John Meirs Horner was born on June 15, 1821 in Monmouth, New Jersey to Stacy and Sarah Horner (n√©e Johnson). He was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, having been baptized Aug 2, 1840 by Erastus Snow.From a letter by Horner reproduced in \\"'Heaven Forgave Me': The Fortunes of John M. Horner\\" by Ardis E. Parshall on Keepapitchinin, December 7, 2015. Accessed April 16, 2017. He was serving in New Jersey on Joseph Smith's presidential campaign when he learned Smith had been killed. He first arrived in California on the ship Brooklyn in 1846 with a group of Mormons led by Sam Brannan. Career He had been a teacher and farmer in New Jersey and quickly took up farming in California quickly became one of California's premier agriculturists, despite being swindled into buying the same land four times and then losing much of it to squatters (according to his own account). In 1847, he began farming in the vicinity of Mission San Jose. Although he briefly tried mining in 1848, he realized that there was more potential in farming. By 1849, he was making a profit at selling his produce. He was also connected with early agricultural fairs in California designed to encourage others to be involved in growing produce. He built a building to be used as a school and meetinghouse. Although he allowed Methodists and Presbyterians to hold meetings there, the main meetings conducted there at which he presided were of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This building has been called the first LDS meetinghouse in California.Cowan and Homer. California Saints. p. 146 = San Francisco = In 1854, Horner purchased a portion of the Rancho San Miguel from Jos√© de Jes√∫s No√©, in what is called the western Mission District of San Francisco and parts of Noe Valley. By the 1860s Homestead associations were popular in San Francisco as a way for persons of modest means to pool their money and purchase large tracts of land to be subdivided, and for early speculators to acquire groups of lots and even entire blocks for later development. Horner platted his lands (in what is now the Mission District) as blocks and lots, named his new streets based on personal and religious influences, and advertised residential property for sale in Horner's Addition. However very few of his lots sold, due to the hilly terrain, poor access, and economic downturns. Horner lost his entire fortune in the panic of 1857 and was forced to liquidate his land holdings. In 1895, descendants of Jos√© de Jes√∫s No√© filed a San Francisco lawsuit involving $24,000,000.00 against Horner, stating a percentage of the land in Horner's Addition was legally theirs. Death and legacy He died on May 14, 1907 at age 91 in Kukaiau, Hamakua, Hawaii where he had managed the Kukaiau Plantation Company starting in 1884. John M. Horner Junior High School in Fremont, California is his namesake.

He became an Austrian citizen in 1976. Wysocki's works have been performed widely in Europa by the Ensemble Wiener Collage and its artistic director Ren√© Staar: at the Salzburg Festival in 2003, the K√∂lner Philharmonie in 2000, the Stars of the White Nights Festival in 2007, at the Wiener Konzerthaus in 1996, and at numerous other occasions. His work \\"Double Concerto\\" has been premiered by Kent Nagano in San Francisco in 2002, his three orchestra Etudes (Nr. 99-101) were premiered in February 2014 by the McGill Symphony Orchestra, Montreal, under the baton of Alexis Hauser. He has written numerous commissions for the Ensemble Wiener Collage. His work melds elements of the 2nd Vienna School and the Polish Avantgarde, namely Witold Lutos≈Çawski, into a characteristic musical language, in which segments of rhythmical impact and freedom of expression create new forms of interaction. While his work seems to be intellectually conceived, it surprises public and reviewers with its great spectrum of different ideas and instrumental colors, which he permanently develops further especially in his Etudes. This big collection of differentiated pieces has become a centerpiece of Wysocki's output over the years, and is an example of the development of Wysocki's style. Once apostrophed as Miniature Dramolets, the Etudes present an ideal counterpart to Wysocki's bigger pieces, such as his Double Concerto or the recently written Cello Concerto.

AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2005), was a case decided by the Federal Circuit that clarified the hierarchy of evidentiary sources usable for claim construction in patent law.Adelman, M.J., Rader, R.R., and Klancnik, G.P. Patent Law In A Nutshell. Thomson West, St. Paul, MN. 2008, p. 301 Factual background The patents at issue were for modular steel shell panels that could be arranged into vandalism resistant walls. The panels interlocked by means of steel baffles - internal barriers meant to create fillable compartments or to deflect projectiles that penetrate the outer wall. Defendant AWH Corporation distributed similar modular panels, and Plaintiff, Phillips, sued AWH for patent infringement. AWH asserted that its panels did not meet all of the limitations of Phillips' patent claims. The District Court granted AWH's summary judgment motion for noninfringement because it read the term \\"baffles\\" in the claims to mean internal barriers angled at angles other than 90 degrees. AWH's panels had baffles angled at 90 degrees.Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1309-11. Phillips appealed to the Federal Circuit. The panel affirmed the judgment of noninfringement, but on different grounds from the District Court. The Federal Circuit then agreed to rehear the case en banc.Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1310. Decision =Majority opinion= The majority opinion, written by Judge Bryson, began by clarifying the hierarchy of evidentiary source usable for claim construction. Most importantly, the words of the claims should be given their ordinary meaning in the context of the patent documents, as interpreted by a person of ordinary skill in the art to which the patent pertains. The court recognized that the patentee can act as his own lexicographer, and that the other claims and the specification can provide important clues to the intended meaning of the claim language. Also of importance in interpreting claim language is the prosecution history and other documents in the file wrapper. The prosecution history, however, should be viewed with more skepticism than the plain language of the claims themselves, because the prosecution represents a back and forth between the Patent Office and the inventor and lacks the clarity of the final claim language. Other than the above cited intrinsic sources of evidence courts may also look to extrinsic evidence, though it is of secondary importance. Extrinsic evidence includes scholarly journal articles and expert testimony. Dictionaries may also be used, but the Federal Circuit repudiated the holding of an earlier case, Texas Digital, that suggested dictionaries could be accorded weight tantamount to the claim language itself. Turning to the facts of the case at hand, the court held that the claim limitations did not indicate that the baffles could not be situated at 90 degree angles. The case was remanded to the District Court.Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1312-1328 =Lourie's concurrence in part and dissent in part= Judge Lourie praised the majority's analysis of the evidentiary hierarchy for claim construction. Lourie, however, thought that the District Court applied these principles correctly and that its claim construction should be affirmed.Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1329-30 (Lourie, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) =Mayer's dissent= Judge Mayer, joined by Judge Newman, dissented asserting that the majority endorsed the problematic idea that claim construction is a matter of law reviewed de novo on appeal. Mayer argued that claim construction is similar to an obviousness determination, which is considered a factual finding (and thus subject to a \\"clear error\\" standard for appellate review).Phillips, 415 F.3d at 1333-34 (Mayer, J., dissenting) On 20 January 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 7-2 decision in an unrelated case, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., et al. v. Sandoz, Inc., et al., 574 U.S. ___ (2015). The opinion held that the Federal Circuit court must apply a \\"clear error\\" standard to review questions of fact. In accordance with Mayer's dissent in Phillips, this opinion ended de novo review by the Federal Circuit when reviewing the meaning of claim terms.

Life Fitzgerald was the son of Edmund Fitzmaurice Riskard, seneschal of Imokilly, and Shylie, daughter of Sir Maolrony McShane O'Carroll,Sir Maolrony O'Carroll1 A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the royal families of Europe Person Page - 15492 lord of Ely. He was a prominent actor in the two great conflicts between the invading English and the Irish and Old English that convulsed Munster from 1563 to 1583. In 1569, being \\"a principal communicator with James FitzMaurice FitzGerald, arch traitor\\", he was besieged in his castle at Ballymartyr by Sir Henry Sidney; but after a stout defence, in which several of the besiegers were wounded, finding the place untenable, he \\"and his company in the dead of night fled out of the house by a bog, which joins hard to the wall where no watch could have prevented their escape\\". He continued to hold out with Fitzmaurice in the woods of the Glen of Aherlow till February 1573, when he submitted himself before Sir John Perrot in the church of Kilmallock, and was pardoned. In 1575, he accompanied Fitzmaurice to France, but returned to Ireland a few weeks afterwards. From that time till the date of Fitzmaurice's landing we hear nothing of him, with the exception that on 16 November 1576, he complained to the president of Munster, Sir William Drury, that the Earl of Desmond was coshering 60 horses and a hundred horse-boys on Imokilly, an incident quite sufficient to show how the wind was blowing meanwhile. On the arrival of Fitzmaurice in July 1579, he went into rebellion. An adept in all the stratagems of Irish warfare, and personally brave in carrying his schemes into execution, he became, after the death of the \\"arch traitor\\", the unquestionable, though not nominal, head of the rebellion. It was against him, and not the Earl of Desmond, that Ormonde mainly directed his efforts. More than once during that terrible struggle, he was reported to have been slain. He was, indeed, once severely wounded and his brother killed, but he manifested no intention of submitting. In February 1581, he narrowly missed capturing Sir Walter Raleigh. Philip O'Sullivan Beare in his 1621 history of the Elizabethan wars reported that in 1581 \\"a company of English soldiers, distinguished by their dress and arms, who were called \\"red coats\\" [], being sent to war [in Ireland] by the Queen were overwhelmed near Lismore by John Fitzgerald, the seneschal\\".Historiae Catholicae Iberniae Compendium by Philip O'Sullivan Beare (1621), Tome II, Bk IV, Chap XV, translated as Ireland Under Elizabeth by Matthew J. Byrne (1903). See p. 27 of Byrne's translation In May 1583, 'Black Tom', Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, captured James's aged mother, Shylie O'Carroll and 'executed' her, hanging the old lady in Cork. But it was not till 14 June, when he was reported to have not more than 24 swords and four horse, that he consented to recognise the hopelessness of his cause. His submission was accepted conditionally; but Ormonde, who greatly respected him for his bravery, pleaded earnestly with Elizabeth I's spymaster Burghley for his pardon. He was, he declared, a man \\"valiant, wise, and true of his word, and ever since his submission \\"he and his people had been employed in order and husbandry\\". Ormonde's intervention was successful so far as Fitzgerald's life was concerned. As for his lands, that was to be left an open question ‚Äì 36,000 acres of good land, which English plantation-farmers known as \\"undertakers\\" had come to regard as their property, would not be surrendered by them without a struggle. He was represented as the most dangerous man in the province, as \\"having more intelligence from Spain than anyone else\\". The undertakers' representations were not without their calculated effect on Queen Elizabeth I, who had at first been inclined to treat him leniently. Not suspecting any attack, he was in March 1587, arrested by Sir Thomas Norris and confined to Dublin Castle, where he died in February 1589, cites Ham. Cal. iv. 126, but cf. page 253. a few days after it had been finally decided that he should enjoy the profit of his lands. His cousin Sir John Fitzedmund Fitzgerald of Cloyne and Ballymaloe House became the next Seneschal of Imokilly.Sir John FitzEdmund FitzGerald from A Compendium of Irish Biography, 1878 Family He married Honora, daughter of James FitzMaurice FitzGerald, by whom he had two sons, Edmund and Richard, seven weeks old in 1589, and two daughters, Catherine and Eleanor. His son and heir, Edmund, at the time of his father's death being a year and a half old, was found by inquisition to be heir to Ballymartyr and other lands in County Cork, and was granted in wardship to Captain Moyle. He obtained livery of his lands on coming of age, and in 1647 defended Ballymartyr against his nephew, Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, when the castle was burnt and himself outlawed.

Search for his remains  Wayne Wetherall, a PNG campaign historian and the founder of the Kokoda Spirit trekking company, travelled to Japan in 2009 to meet Kokichi Nishimura, one of the last survivors of the Japanese 144th Regiment to ask him about Templeton. Templeton's son Reg wanted to know what had happened to his father, as there had been various conflicting stories, none of which were confirmed. Nishimura believed that he had buried Templeton, and said that he had not been present at Templeton's death, but that he had been captured and, when interrogated before Lieutenant Colonel Hatsuo Tsukamoto, commander of the 144th regiment, lied and said, \\"There are 80,000 Australian soldiers waiting for you in Moresby,\\" and laughed at Tsukamoto, who became enraged and killed him with his sword. Nishimura said that he later found the body with a sword or bayonet blade protruding from its side, and buried it because of the smell.

The JCCV‚Äôs mission is to represent the Victorian Jewish community, the largest Jewish community in Australia, on all matters that affect its status, welfare and interests. The JCCV was established in 1938 as the Victorian Jewish Advisory Board. It has been known as the Jewish Community Council of Victoria since 1989 and became an incorporated entity in 2000. Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews has said of the organisation: :The Council's promotion of religious tolerance, and its supervision of community security, has made Victoria a safer and friendlier place.The Jewish Community Council of Victoria Annual Report 2014, p. 7.  The Australian Context  Jews have lived in what was to become Australia from the beginning of European settlement (1788)For a history of the Jews in Australia, see History of the Jews in Australia but the Jewish population only grew significantly after World War II, largely due to migration from Europe. The 2006 Australian Census put the Jewish population of Melbourne (Victoria‚Äôs capital) at 40,547 of a national Jewish population of 88,834.‚ÄòThe Jewish Population of Victoria: key findings from the 2006 census‚Äô (Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation, Monash University, 2009) Andrew Markus and Tanya Aronov. It is estimated, however, that there may well be under-counting of up to 30% for a range of reasons. One reputable analysis of the Census figures estimates that 60,080 Jews live in Victoria, constituting 1.2% of the total Victorian population.‚ÄòGen08: Jewish Population Survey (Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation, Monash University, 2009) Andrew Markus et al. Other estimates, based on the numbers of the various Jewish funeral houses, put the number possibly as high as 100,000 in the early 2000s. These community has a high concentration around the South Eastern Melbourne suburbs of Caulfield, East St Kilda and Elsternwick, and there are a large number of communal organisations situated in those suburbs, including schools, synagogues and cultural centres. There are also significant pockets of Jews in other areas of Melbourne, including Malvern and Hawthorn East, Bentleigh, Brunswick and Docaster, although those locations do not have the same communal structure and are not served well by communal organisations.. The Victorian Jewish community comprises a range of sub-groups including strong Progressive, Yiddishist, Modern Orthodox, secular, Conservative, and ultra-Orthodox communities. It is a commonly held belief that most of the community can be described as strongly Zionist. Victoria‚Äôs Jewish population has continued to grow due to immigration from the former Soviet Union, South Africa, Israel and New Zealand.  History  The Jewish Community Council of Victoria was established 10 October 1989. It was the successor of a series of communal peak bodies that claimed to be the official voice of Victorian Jewry. The previous versions were the Melbourne Jewish Advisory Board (est. 1921), the Victorian Jewish Advisory Board (est. 1938) and the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies (est. 1948). There was a desire for a unified representative voice for the community since the 1880s, but it was a visit from Chief Rabbi Hertz in 1921 that was the trigger for the formation of the organization, where he convinced a number of prominent Melbourne Jews of its need. The membership of the resulting Melbourne Jewish Advisory Board (MJAB), was drawn from the three major synagogue congregations. In 1936, the secular Judean League, the Yiddishist Kadimah and the Victorian Zionist Organisation pushed MJAB to form a new constitution which would allow input from the non-Orthodox communities. The MJAB renamed itself the Victorian Jewish Advisory Board (VJAB). During World War II the representational base of the VJAB was further expanded to include 18 constituents by 1947. At a meeting on May 7, 1948, delegates to the VJAB agreed formally to rename and reconstitute themselves as the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies (VJBD). In 1988 delegates approved a name change and the VJBD became the Jewish Community Council of Victoria on 10 October 1989. The new name was promoted as having greater meaning for a cosmopolitan Jewry entering the 1990s. The JCCV became an incorporated entity in 2000. The new organization continued to grow, and today the JCCV has over 50 affiliates.  Affiliation  The JCCV‚Äôs affiliation is drawn from various organisations that constitute the Victorian Jewish community. Their affiliates represent a range of religious, political, cultural, welfare, educational and social associations. Affiliates are able to share views through the JCCV‚Äôs Plenum, which meets seven times per calendar year. = Affiliates as of December 2017 = * Access Inc * ARK Centre * Australasian Union of Jewish Students (Victoria) * Australian Jewish Democratic Society Inc * Australian Jewish Historical Society of Victoria Inc * Australian Jewish Psychologists Inc * Australian Society of Polish Jews & Their Descendants * Ballarat Hebrew Congregation * Bialik College * Blake St Hebrew Congregation * B'nai B'rith Victoria Inc * Brighton Hebrew Congregation * Caulfield Hebrew Congregation Inc * Council of Orthodox Synagogues of Victoria Ltd * East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation * Elwood Talmud Torah Congregation * Emmy Monash Aged Care Inc * Forum of Russian Speaking Jewry * J-Air * Jewish Care (Vic) Inc * Jewish Cultural Centre and National Library (Kadimah) * Jewish Holocaust Museum & Research Centre * Jewish Labor Bund Inc * Jewish Museum of Australia * Kehilat Nitzan Conservative (Masorti) Community Inc * Kew Hebrew Congregation Inc * King David School (The) * Keshet Australia * Kosher Meals on Wheels Association of Victoria Inc * Leibler-Yavneh College * Maccabi Victoria * Magen David Adom Victoria Inc * March of the Living Australia * Melbourne Hebrew Congregation Inc * Mizrachi Organisation * Mount Scopus Memorial College * National Council of Jewish Women of Australia (Vic) * North Eastern Jewish War Memorial Centre Inc (Yeshurun Synagogue) * Oz Shalom TV Inc * Progressive Judaism Victoria * Shalom Association Inc * Sholem Aleichem College * South Caulfield Hebrew Congregation * Stand Up * St Kilda Hebrew Congregation * Theodor Herzl Social Club Inc * United Jewish Education Board Inc * Victorian Association of Jewish Ex & Servicemen & Women Australia Inc * Wings of Care (Kanfei Chessed) Inc * Zionism Victoria * Zionist Youth Council  Activities  = Advocacy = The JCCV devotes much of its resources to advocating for the Jewish community with government and the media. The JCCV regularly provides submissions to government on a wide range of issues on behalf of Victorian Jewry. In the past these have included reforms into the Sentencing Act, Racial Vilification legislation, Child Protection and Equal Opportunity legislation. The JCCV also coordinates with local governments where there is a significant Jewish population. One such issue is setting traffic lights in the city of Glen Eira to automatic during Shabbat. They are involved in interfaith and multicultural activities and dialogue. This includes establishing bilateral ties and hosting functions with other faiths and communities, and by participating in various multicultural and multifaith organisations, both government and non-government organisations. The JCCV has engaged in overt advocacy of Israeli policies in partnership with Zionism Victoria. This is despite having affiliates such as the Australian Jewish Democratic Society who are not supportive of Israel's policies. The JCCV has, however, come in for considerable criticism for a number of public relations failures. Arguably the greatest of these was the JCCV's inability to accommodate the community's LGBTQI community until 2015,http://galusaustralis.com/2013/11/7978/7978/http://sensiblejew.com/2009/09/coming- next-in-the-ajn-bumper-edition-pontificators-congratulations-and-our-glbt- community/ although they did apologise for the exclusion in 2019. The JCCV has also been heavily criticised for its failure to tackle key communal issues, such as drug and alcohol abuse,http://sensiblejew.com/2009/08/coming-next- young-jews-drugs-and-alcohol/ the rise of the far right, soaring costs of Jewish living, and the refusal to engage in meaningful public advocacy to extradite accused paedophile, former [Addas] Principal, Malka Leifer.https://www.facebook.com/groups/710902039012070/permalink/1048854735216797/http://www.jwire.com.au/new- south-wales-v-victoria-a-tale-of-two-systems/ = Public ceremonies and events = The JCCV also organises a number of communal events, and is the host of a communal event for Yom HaShoah and Yom HaAtzma'ut, the later being co-hosted with Zionism Victoria. Some events in the past have caused problems for them. The JCCV did significantly strain their relations with the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) due to its invitation of anti-Islam academic Daniel Pipes to address the community. Pipes is noted by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an \\"anti-Muslim extremist\\" and his presence caused the ICV to cancel their official partnership in the annual Jewish Muslim Comedy Debate, and they temporarily broke off all contact with the JCCV. = General activities = The JCCV have other functions within the community such as: * Social justice and community welfare projects such as the Youth Alcohol Project, Child Protection Working Group, Pastoral Care Project and the GLBTI (Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex) Reference Group * Various guest speakers and forums on a range of topics *Acting as an umbrella organisation to pool resources and lessen the duplication of activities *Acting as a central node for promotion of communal events and news *Liaising with police on incidents of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, and assisting with community security, and emergency crisis management  See also  *Jewish Community Council  References   External links  * Jewish Community Council of Victoria * Executive Council of Australian Jewry * Jewish Victoria Category:Jewish organisations based in Australia Category:Jews and Judaism in Victoria (Australia) Category:Organisations based in Victoria (Australia) Category:Organizations established in 1938 ","title":"Jewish Community Council of Victoria"},{"id":"32983921","text":"Kaleb is a given name, a variant spelling of Caleb, as well as a surname.

The Sloss Mines are a group of mines in southwestern Jefferson County, Alabama. They were established by the Sloss Iron and Steel Company and its successor, the Sloss-Sheffield Iron and Steel Company, on the southern end of Red Mountain. The Sloss Iron and Steel Company itself was founded by James Sloss in 1881 as the Sloss Furnace Company. The Sloss Mines produced iron ore from 1882 until the 1960s. The ore that these mines produced were essential to the production of iron at the Sloss Furnaces, making them an important element in the formation of adjacent Birmingham and Bessemer as cities. Red Mountain Park is an urban park that runs from east to west along the mountain. Park officials plan to open a portion, but not all, of the area that the mines operated on to the public. Although the entrances have for the most part been sealed, mines 10, 11, and 14 are planned for development into interactive visitor sites. In addition, walking trails on the former mining sites have been developed, as well as the preservation of a mine worker's cemetery and many historic mining structures.

It is in use by several military forces and law enforcement agencies around the world. History Since 1981 the Massachusetts-based Lenco Industries, known as Lenco Armored Vehicles, has designed and manufactured armored vehicles for law enforcement, military, government and private security forces. Lenco has produced more than 5,000 armored vehicles for use in more than 40 countries worldwide. The BearCat is one type of vehicle produced by the company that is in use by numerous U.S. military and law enforcement agencies and it also used by all state and territory Police Tactical Groups in Australia purchased by the Australian Government. The name BearCat stands for Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Truck as it is the smaller cousin to the Lenco B.E.A.R. The Bearcat is based on a Ford F-550 Super Duty commercial truck chassis with two available engines (the V10 Triton Gasoline and the 6.7L Turbo Diesel), and a six-speed automatic transmission. The .5-1.5 inch thick mil spec steel armored bodywork is completed with .50 BMG rated ballistic glass capable of multi- hits, blast-resistant floors, gunports, roof hatches/turret and agency specific equipment and/or modifications such as lights/sirens/battering ram/winches/thermal cameras and spot lights. The first BearCat was designed and completed in August 2001 as a spin-off product of the larger Lenco B.E.A.R., with input from Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) as an updated and improved version of their military surplus Cadillac Gage Ranger \\"PeaceKeeper\\" armored vehicles. Usage BearCats are typically referred to by law enforcement agencies as being \\"armored rescue vehicles\\" with their primary use being to transport tactical (SWAT/Special Reaction Teams) officers to and from hostile situations and to assist with the recovery and protection of civilians in harm's way during terrorist threats, hostage incidents, or encounters with large gatherings of aggressors. The BearCat is designed to provide protection from a variety of small arms, explosives and IED threats. Like its larger cousin, the B.E.A.R, the BearCat is able to be fitted with the \\"MARS\\" Mobile Adjustable Ramp System which allows tactical officers to gain entry to elevated platforms such as second story windows or aircraft. Lenco BearCats have been credited with saving the lives of officers in armed confrontations on numerous occasions. In 2010 in Athens, Texas, an armed offender fired more than 35 rounds from a semi-automatic AK-74 rifle at tactical police. Not one round penetrated the BearCat. In June 2012 a BearCat, belonging to the Central Bucks Emergency Response Team, took 28 rounds from a \\"high-powered rifle\\" during a siege with no rounds penetrating the vehicle. In November 2015, a BearCat was used by police to rescue civilians during the Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting. The Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office BearCat was shot between four and seven times with a rifle during an incident on December 29, 2015. Sheriff Whetsel was quoted as saying the BearCat saved the Deputies' lives. On June 12, 2016, a BearCat was used to breach Pulse nightclub after a gunman shot and killed 49 clubgoers and injured 53 others.

Features The BearCat series is customizable with a variety of non-standard features depending on the customers' requirements. BearCats are able to be fitted with moveable elevated platform systems called the Liberator and ARC by Patriot3, Inc., to enable tactical units to access a variety of elevated structures such as multi-story buildings, ships at docks, or aircraft during high-risk hostage or terrorist situations.

By 1773 he earned promotion to general officer. From 1783 he held important posts on the Military Frontier and led an independent corps in Croatia during the Austro-Turkish War. In the French Revolutionary Wars he commanded the joint forces of Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont from 1792 until 1795. Though the French were held at bay during his tenure, his slowness and poor health prevented Piedmont's lost territories from being recovered. Throughout the period much tension existed between the two allies. Ironically, the day after De Vins resigned, the French attacked and badly defeated his replacement. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment from 1784 until his death. Early career Born at Mantua in Italy in 1732, De Vins was the son of Hektor Franz de Vins, an Austrian general killed in the Battle of Piacenza in 1746. He went into the army of the Habsburg Monarchy and fought in the Seven Years' War.Boycott- Brown, 76 Wartime promotion was rapid. On 8 September 1757 De Vins became Major, on 16 July 1760 he was named Oberstleutnant, and on 13 October 1761 he was elevated to Oberst (colonel). He won the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 4 December 1758. His promotion to General-major came through on 1 May 1773. Another elevation in rank to Feldmarschall-Leutnant occurred on 3 April 1783. In that month he was appointed to command the Banal- Warasdin Military Frontier. He became Proprietor of the De Vins Infantry Regiment Nr. 37 on 7 February 1784 and held the office during his lifetime.Smith & Kudrna, De Vins De Vins commanded the Banal-Warasdin- Karlstadt Military Frontier beginning in August 1786. On 10 November 1788 he received promotion to Feldzeugmeister. He led the Autonomous Corps in Croatia during the Austro-Turkish War (1787-1791). His tenure in corps command lasted from October 1787 to October 1790, though it was not continuous. He briefly led the Karlstadt-Warasdin Military Frontier from May 1790 to December 1791. De Vins received the Grand Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 19 December 1790. After the war he served as Inspector General of the Military Frontier from 1791 until his death. French Revolution King Victor Amadeus asked for the Austrians to provide him with a general In the spring of 1792, the First French Republic declared war on the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. In the fall, the French invaded the County of Nice on the Mediterranean coast and Duchy of Savoy in the northwest. The French seized Chamb√©ry in Savoy on 24 September and Nice on 29 September. In the south, the Piedmontese army withdrew to a powerful defensive position at Saorge (Saorgio), blocking access to the strategically important Col de Tende (Tenda Pass). The onset of winter weather spared Piedmont the loss of more territories.Boycott-Brown, 75-76 Shocked at the incompetence of his high-ranking officers, King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia begged the Austrians to send a general to supervise the combined Austrian and Piedmontese armies. Accordingly, De Vins was appointed to fill the position on 21 December 1792. The French attacked Saorgio in June 1793 and were defeated. The Allies tried to mount a counteroffensive, but this effort was crippled by the new commander's slowness. De Vins planned to recapture both Savoy and Nice. Because he suffered badly from gout, De Vins intended to supervise both operations from the capital of Turin. Prince Maurizio, Duke of Montferrat, named to lead the invasion of Savoy, was directed to follow strict daily instructions from De Vins. Since Turin was away, the arrangement was impractical.Boycott-Brown, 77-78 In any case, the Savoy column was turned back with heavy losses at the Battle of Epierre on 15 September 1793.Smith, 56 This map shows the Battle of Saorgio campaign in April 1794. The progress of the French offensive is displayed with flags and dates where known. The locations of the events of 1792 and 1793 are also shown. Charles-Fran√ßois Thaon, Count of Saint-Andr√© was directed to advance on Nice from Saorgio. This effort was complicated by the dislike that Saint-Andr√© and his Austrian subordinate Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi had for one another. Furthermore, the Piedmontese officer corps hated De Vins' chief of staff, Eug√®ne-Guillaume Argenteau. At this time, areas of southern France rebelled against the revolutionary government. Large forces were diverted to contain the revolt at the Siege of Toulon, giving the allies a chance to recover territory. De Vins and King Victor Amadeus left in August for the southern front, where operations were supposed to start on 7 September 1793.Boycott-Brown, 78 On 18 October, six Piedmontese battalions defeated the French at Gilette. Three days later, there was an inconclusive skirmish at Utelle.Smith, 59-60 In the end, the offensive petered out when snow began to fall in the mountains, prompting the disappointed king to return to his capital in mid-November.Boycott-Brown, 80 The following year, Sardinian General Dellera wanted to occupy Briga Alta northeast of Saorgio, but De Vins overruled him. However, Dellera convinced the army commander to position an Austrian force at Dego to the east.Boycott-Brown, 88-89 On 6 April 1794, French General Pierre Jadart Dumerbion launched an offensive which seized the port of Oneglia on the 9th. Argenteau attempted to organize a defense at Ormea but the French captured that town on 18 April and Garessio the next day. With Saorgio outflanked on the east, De Vins advised Colli to hold the position but to send back other forces not needed for immediate defense. Meanwhile, the Austrian force at Dego failed to send any help. Relations between the Allies were so poor at this time that some Piedmontese officers believed that De Vins had betrayed their nation.Boycott-Brown, 90-91 The Battle of Saorgio took place on 24 April and also included clashes at the Col Ardente on the 24th and Briga on the 27th.Smith, 74-75 The French seized Saorgio on 28 April after Colli withdrew. By early May he abandoned the Col de Tende and fell back nearly to the fortress of Cuneo.Boycott-Brown, 91 On the coast, the French advanced to seize Albenga and Loano.Chandler, 31 From August 1794 until March 1795, De Vins went on leave from the army. In his absence, Olivier, Count of Wallis suffered a defeat at the First Battle of Dego on 21 September 1794.Smith, 92 The French failed to exploit the success and instead withdrew to Vado Ligure.Chandler, 35 After De Vins returned, he launched an attack along the Italian Riviera on 29 June 1795.Chandler, 36 French general Fran√ßois Christophe de Kellermann was defeated and driven back west, losing Vado.Boycott-Brown, 102-103 Kellermann was replaced by Barth√©lemy Louis Joseph Sch√©rer and the new general counterattacked in the fall, recapturing some lost territory. However, a winter gale struck on 18 November, apparently halting operations. De Vins, suffering from scurvy according to Colli's chief of staff, named Wallis as his replacement and left the army on 22 November 1795.Boycott-Brown, 110 Sch√©rer mounted a major assault the next day in the Battle of Loano. For casualties of 3,000, the French inflicted 2,500 killed and wounded on the Allies, while capturing 4,000 soldiers, 48 guns, and five colors.Smith, 108 Fortunately for the allies, Sch√©rer declined to follow up his victory.Chandler, 38 De Vins died on 26 September 1798 at Vienna.

It is a right tributary of the Yug. It is long, and the area of its drainage basin is . Its main tributaries are the Lopyu, the Porub, the Lekhta, and the Lala (all from the right). The town of Luza and the urban-type settlement of Lalsk are located on the banks of the Luza, as well as the selo of Obyachevo, the administrative center of Priluzsky District. The basin of the Luza comprises vast areas in the north of Kirov Oblast, southeast of the Komi Republic, north-east of Vologda Oblast, and minor areas in the southwest of Arkhangelsk Oblast. Having the source in the east of Oparinsky District of Kirov Oblast, the Luza initially flows east, enters the Komi Republic, makes a bow and returns in the western direction, crossing Kirov Oblast again and emptying to the Yug River in Vologda Oblast. Most of the course of the Luza runs through the Northern Ridge. The Luza is navigable for more than downstream of the selo of Noshul in the Komi Republic; however, there is no passenger navigation. Until the 1990s, it was used for timber rafting. The Luza had a historical significance in the past as one of the waterways of the Russian North. Whereas it is not listed among the most important waterways, there were at least two portages from the Luza to the basin of the Vyatka, one to the Kobra, another one to the Moloma. These portages were local and presumably were used by local hunters and traders. Lalsk was founded by the Novgorodians looking for a remote location.

History People born in Cambodia as a percentage of the population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area. Prior to 1975, most of the few Cambodians in Australia were children of upper income families or having government funded scholarships sent abroad to attend school. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975, a few Cambodians managed to escape, but not until the Khmer Rouge was overthrown in 1979 did large waves of Cambodians began immigrating to Australia as refugees. In order to encourage rapid assimilation into Australian culture and to spread the economic impact, Australian government settled the 10,000 refugees in various towns and cities throughout the country. However, once established enough to be able to communicate and travel, many Cambodians began migrating within Australia to certain localities where the climate was more like home, where they knew friends and relatives had been sent, or where there were rumored to be familiar jobs or higher government benefits. Consequently, large communities of Cambodians took root in major cities such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide.

Francis was born at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England. He joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1847 over his family's objections. In 1850 he took charge of missionary labor in Sherborne, Dorset and was ordained an Elder, then spent a few years as a missionary in England. In 1854 he was appointed to serve in the Swiss Mission, which soon put him in charge of all Latter-day Saint operations in Italy. There he met and baptized Esther Charlotte Emily Weissbrodt, a school teacher. In February 1856 he was reassigned to Geneva, Switzerland to oversee the emigration of Latter-day Saints from Switzerland to the United States. He and Esther married in Geneva in 1857 and had 10 children, all of whom lived to adulthood. In 1858 he returned to England to work directly under William Budge. Francis was honorably released from his missionary labors in 1861. He and his family emigrated to the United States, arriving in Salt Lake City in the Utah Territory that fall. In 1863 they moved to Morgan County, where he worked mainly as a farmer and rancher. When the Morgan Stake was organized in 1877, Francis became a counselor to the president of the stake, retaining the position until he was honorably released in 1900 and ordained a Patriarch. Francis served at various times as county clerk, county recorder, county attorney, justice of the peace, and probate judge. In 1886, he was elected to the Territorial Council (the legislature of the Utah Territory). For a single two-year term, he represented a northeastern district covering Morgan, Summit, Wasatch and Uintah Counties. He was then admitted to the bar in 1888 and practiced law for the rest of his life. He was a member of the State Constitutional Convention when Utah became a state.

Life John Watson was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 25 February 1847. He attended the Free Church School in Kilmarnock, then enrolled at the University of Edinburgh. Within a month, however, he was drawn to the University of Glasgow by the reputations of the brothers John Caird, professor of divinity, and Edward Caird, professor of moral philosophy. On completion of his studies in 1872, he was appointed on the basis of the recommendation of his mentor Edward Caird to the Chair of Logic, Metaphysics, and Ethics at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Caird had written that \\"Watson is perhaps a man of the 'driest light' that I know. I do not know anyone who sees his way more clearly through any philosophical entanglements.\\"Wallace, Robert C., ed.: Some Great Men of Queens. Toronto: Ryerson Press, 1941, p. 24. He spent the remainder of his career at Queen's and died in Kingston on 27 January 1939. Among his works are Kant and His English Critics, Christianity and Idealism, and The State in Peace and War.http://www.jrank.org/literature/pages/8872/John-Watson.html He was the Gifford Lecturer for 1910‚Äì1912 at the University of Glasgow after which his lectures were published as The Interpretation of Religious Experience. He was a charter member of the Royal Society of Canada. Watson Hall at Queen's University is named after him.http://www.queensu.ca/campusmap/?mapquery=watsonhttp://qnc.queensu.ca/Encyclopedia/w.html#Watsonhttp://qnc.queensu.ca/Encyclopedia/j.html#JohnWatson Philosophy Watson's philosophy, which he called speculative or constructive idealism, continued the Hegelian critique of Immanuel Kant as pursued by Thomas Hill Green, Francis Herbert Bradley, and especially by his teacher at the University of Glasgow, Edward Caird. The main distinction between his position and that of Kant's critical idealism is that while both maintain that the universe is rational and that reason is self-harmonious, critical idealism denies that either of these propositions can be established on the basis of knowledge, while speculative idealism contends that the opposition of the theoretical and practical reason is fatal to both positions. While critical idealism falls back upon certain \\"postulates\\" of the moral consciousness in support of \\"faith\\", speculative idealism refuses to accept the antithesis of faith and knowledge, theoretical and practical reason, maintaining that a faith which is not identical with reason, a theoretical reason which is not in harmony with practical reason, is beset by an inherent weakness, which is sure to betray itself under the most searching of all tests, the test of self-criticism.Watson, J.: Philosophical Basis of Religion. Glasgow: Maclehose, 1907, p. 100. All that exists is rational and in principle knowable. The degree to which it is known reflects both evolution and history. The human being possesses ‚Äì as a result of evolution ‚Äì a principle of rationality that makes it possible to comprehend the rationality of the world and to master it. Watson argued that this capacity could not, however, have resulted from natural selection.Watson, J.: Outline of Philosophy. Glasgow: Maclehose, 1908, pp. 143-144. By contrast, human evolution, especially as continued in history, represents a transcendence of nature, \\"the gradual realisation of reason in the individual and in society, and the gradual comprehension of the meaning of both when viewed in their relation to the world and God\\".Watson, J.: Christianity and Idealism(New Edition). Glasgow: Maclehose, 1897, p. 240. Religion and moral philosophy God is the absolute. The absolute is inadequately conceptualized as substance, power, person ‚Äì although Watson found \\"personality\\" more fitting, though still inadequate ‚Äì or super rational.Christianity and Idealism, pp. 256-292. The. absolute is the identity of subject and object, the repository of universal reason itself, the very rationality that is manifest in the world and increasingly revealed to conscious, reflective human beings. Morality is acting rationally; and as reason ultimately governs both, there is no real conflict between individual and societal interests. Evil, or immorality, is the failure to act rationally owing to ignorance or confusion.Outline of Philosophy, p. 229. Watson's liberal theology had a significant influence on the Social Gospel movement and the formation of the United Church of Canada in 1925.Walsh, H. H.: The Christian Church in Canada. Toronto: Ryerson Press, 1956. Political theory Watson's social thought is pervaded with a communitarianism deriving from his doctrine of the in-principle identity in reason of individual and common goods. Thus he summarizes his position on the State as existing \\"for the purpose of providing the external conditions under which all the citizens may have an opportunity of developing the best that is in them, and the success with which this aim is achieved is a test of the perfection of a community.\\"Watson, J.: The State in Peace and War.

After many years of commercial distribution, a Consortium (the TELEMAC-MASCARET Consortium) was officially created in January 2010 to organize the open source distribution of the open TELEMAC-MASCARET system now available under GPLv3. Available modules =TELEMAC-2D= It 2D hydrodynamics module, TELEMAC-2D, solves the so-called shallow water equations, also known as the Saint Venant equations. TELEMAC-2D solves the Saint-Venant equations using the finite-element or finite-volume method and a computation mesh of triangular elements. It can perform simulations in transient and permanent conditions. TELEMAC-2D can take into account the following phenomena: * Propagation of long waves, taking into account non- linear effects * Bed friction * Influence of Coriolis force * Influence of meteorological factors: atmospheric pressure and wind * Turbulence * Torrent and river flows * Influence of horizontal temperature or salinity gradients on density * Cartesian or spherical coordinates for large domains * Dry areas in the computational domain: intertidal flats and flood plains * Current entrainment and diffusion of a tracer, with source and sink terms * Monitoring of floats and Lagrangian drifts * Treatment of singular points: sills, dikes, pipes. TELEMAC-2D is used in many fields of application. In the maritime field, particular mention may be made of harbour structure design, studies of the effect of building submersible breakwaters or dredging works, the impact of discharges from a sea outfall, study of thermal plumes; and, with regard to rivers, the impact of various types of construction (bridges, sills, groynes), dam breaks, flood studies, transport of dissipating or non-dissipating tracers. TELEMAC-2D can also be used for a number of special applications, such as industrial reservoir failures, avalanches falling into reservoirs, etc. =TELEMAC-3D= It 3D hydrodynamics module, TELEMAC-3D, uses the same horizontally unstructured mesh as TELEMAC-2D but solves the Navier-Stokes equations, whether in hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic mode so allowing shorter waves than those in a shallow water context (where wavelengths are required to be at least twenty times the water depth). The wave formulation for the updating of the free surface is used for efficiency. The 3D mesh is developed as a series of meshed surfaces between the bed and the free surface. Flexibility in the placement of these planes permits the use of a sigma grid (each plane at a given proportion of the spacing between bed and surface) or a number of other strategies for intermediate surface location. One useful example is to include some planes which are at a fixed distance below the water surface, or above the bed. In the presence of a near-surface thermocline or halocline this is advantageous in so far as mixing water between the near- surface planes, where the greatest density gradients are located, can be avoided. When drying occurs the water depth falls to zero exactly and the planes collapse to a zero inter-layer spacing. =MASCARET\\"A Finite Volume Solver for 1D Shallow-Water Equations Applied to an Actual River\\", N.

Lacombe, F. Zaoui and K. El-Kadi-Abderrezzak, River Flow 2012 ‚Äì Murillo (Ed.), pp. 1169-1174= MASCARET includes 1-Dimensional free surface flow modelling engines. Based on the Saint-Venant equations, different modules can model various phenomenon over large areas and for varied geometries: meshed or branched network, subcritical or supercritical flows, steady or unsteady flows. MASCARET can represent: * Flood propagation and modelling of floodplains * Submersion wave resulting from dam break * Regulation of managed rivers * Flow in torrents, * Canals wetting * Sediment Transport * Water quality (temperature, passive tracers ...) =ARTEMIS= ARTEMIS is a scientific software dedicated to the simulation of wave propagation towards the coast or into harbours, over a geographical domain of about few square km. The domain may be larger for simulation of long waves or resonance. The frequency dependence and directional spreading of the wave energy is taken into account by ARTEMIS. The computation retrieves the main wave characteristics over the computational domain: significant wave height, wave incidence, orbital velocities, breaking rate, ... ARTEMIS solves the Berkhoff's equation or Mild Slope Equation through finite element formulation. The Mild Slope Equation has been extended to integrate dissipation processes. With a consistent set of boundary conditions, ARTEMIS is able to model the following processes: * Bottom refraction * Diffraction by obstacles * Depth induced wave breaking * Bottom friction * Full or partial reflections against walls, breakwaters, dikes, ... * Radiation or free outflow conditions ARTEMIS has been validated on a set of reference tests and has been successfully used for numerous studies. The software has shown its ability to provide reliable wave agitation results in coastal areas, in the vicinity of maritime works and structures, or in the surf zone. ARTEMIS is an operational tool to determine project conditions: * structure design, * coastal management, * wave conditions for wave driven currents and associated * sand transport, ... * breaking rate in the surroundings of a harbour for two different wave directions ... * easily carrying into effect with the help of adapted pre and post-processors for mesh generation and results visualization. =TOMAWAC= TOMAWAC is used to model wave propagation in coastal areas. By means of a finite-element type method, it solves a simplified equation for the spectro-angular density of wave action. This is done for steady-state conditions (i.e. with a fixed depth of water throughout the simulation). TOMAWAC is particularly simple to use. It can take into account any of the following physical phenomena: * Wind-generated waves * Refraction on the bottom * Refraction by currents * Dissipation through bathymetric wave breaking * Dissipation through counter-current wave breaking At each point of the computational mesh, TOMAWAC calculates the following information: * Significant wave height * Mean wave frequency * Mean wave direction * Peak wave frequency * Wave-induced currents * Radiation stresses Validated with a variety of test cases and already used in numerous studies, TOMAWACis ideal for engineering projects: design of maritime structures, sediment transport by waves, current studies, etc. Like all the other modules of the open TELEMAC- MASCARET system, TOMAWAC has the benefit of the system's powerful mesh generation and results display functions. It is also easy to link TOMAWAC and the hydrodynamic or solid transport modules, and to use the same computation grid for various modules (TELEMAC-2D, SISYPHE, TELEMAC-3D, etc.). Like all the modules of the open TELEMAC-MASCARET system, TOMAWAC was developed in accordance with the quality assurance procedures followed in Electricit√© de France's Studies and Research Division. The software is supplied with a complete set of documents: theoretical description, user's manual and first steps, validation file, etc. =SISYPHE= SISYPHE is the state of the art sediment transport and bed evolution module of the TELEMAC-MASCARET modelling system. SISYPHE can be used to model complex morphodynamics processes in diverse environments, such as coastal, rivers, lakes and estuaries, for different flow rates, sediment size classes and sediment transport modes. In SISYPHE, sediment transport processes are grouped as bed-load, suspended-load or total-load, with an extensive library of bed-load transport relations. SISYPHE is applicable to non-cohesive sediments that can be uniform (single- sized) or non-uniform (multiple-sized), cohesive sediments (multi-layer consolidation models), as well as sand-mud mixtures. A number of physically- based processes are incorporated into SISYPHE, such as the influence of secondary currents to precisely capture the complex flow field induced by channel curvature, the effect of bed slope associated with the influence of gravity, bed roughness predictors, and areas of unerodable bed, among others. For currents only, SISYPHE can be tightly coupled to the depth-averaged shallow water module TELEMAC-2D or to the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes module TELEMAC-3D. In order to account for the effect of waves or combined waves and currents, SISYPHE can be internally coupled to the waves module TOMAWAC. SISYPHE can be easily expanded and customized to particular requirements by modifying friendly, easy to read Fortran files. To help the community of users and developers, SISYPHE includes a large number of examples, verification and validation tests for a range of applications. =Common techniques= Common to all its modules, finite volume style numerical techniques are used to ensure that both water and tracer can be well conserved in the presence of drying and subsequent wetting.

Some sources give his birth date as March 5, 1799 He was the son of William Walker, Sr., a white man who was captured by Delaware Indians in 1777 in Russell County, Virginia. Walker, Sr. was later sold to the Wyandot and grew up among them. William, Sr. married Catherine Rankin, one- fourth Wyandot Indian.\\"Descendants of James Rankin; http://www.kckps.org/disthistory/pdf%20files/wy_walker_garrett.pdf , accessed 30 Aug2011. The couple had ten children.

W. Norton & Company, 2020, p. 24 and read Latin and Greek. He was described as an eloquent speaker and forceful writer on political and literary subjects. He married Hannah Barrett (d. Dec 7, 1863) on April 8, 1824. She was a student in a Christian mission school at Upper Sandusky, Ohio and probably part Indian. and served as Private Secretary to Lewis Cass the Governor of Michigan Territory. He became chief of the Wyandot in 1835., Connelley, William E. The Provisional Government of Nebraska and the Journals of William Walker. Lincoln: Nebraska State Historical Society, 1899, pp. 11‚Äì13 After the death of his first wife, Walker married Evelina J. Barrett, a widowed sister-in-law of his first wife, in 1865. She died on August 28, 1868. The move to Kansas Despite their adaption to American mores, political pressure increased on the Wyandot in the 1830s to exchange their lands in Ohio for land in what would become the state of Kansas. In 1832, Walker headed a delegation of five Wyandot to explore their proposed new lands. The report of the Wyandot, written by Walker, was highly unfavorable toward the land they saw and the white people they encountered on the frontier, an \\"abandoned, dissolute, and wicked class of people,\\" many of whom were \\"fugitives from justice.\\"Oliphant, J. Orin, ed. \\"The Report of the Wyandot Exploring Delegation.' Kansas Historical Quarterly, Aug 1947, Vol. 14, No. 3, pp. 248‚Äì262 The murder of a Wyandot chief and his family finally persuaded the Wyandot that the American government would not protect them in Ohio and, in 1843, 664 Wyandot left Ohio by steamboat for their new home in Kansas. Their new lands, purchased from the Delaware people, another Indian tribe in Kansas, encompassed the present Kansas City, Kansas.\\"Huron History.\\" http://www.tolatsga.org/hur.html , accessed 30 Aug 2011 Kansas historian William E. Connelley described the Wyandot. \\"When the Wyandots came to Kansas no member of the tribe was more than one-fourth Indian. The tribe was Indian; the people three-fourths white. They brought with them their church, their schools, their Masonic lodge, a code of laws for their government. They set up their institutions here. They enforced the law.\\"\\"Kansas City, Kansas: Its Place in the History of the State.\\" Collections of Kansas State Historical Society, Vol. XV (1919‚Äì1922, p. 185 Provisional governor of Nebraska Territory On July 26, 1853, Walker was elected provisional governor of the territory of Nebraska at a meeting at the Wyandot Council house. The group that elected him consisted of Wyandot, white traders, and others with outside interests who wished to preempt the federal government's organization of the territory and benefit from the settlement of Kansas by white settlers. Walker and the others were also promoting Kansas as the route for the proposed transcontinental railroad.Bowes, John P. Exiles and Pioneers: Eastern Indians in the Trans-Continental West. New York: Cambridge U Press, 2007, p. 183 Walker's election as provisional governor was not accepted by the federal government, but it prompted Congress to hasten the official organization of the future states of Kansas and Nebraska by bypassing the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act 1854. This opened the territory to white settlement and allowed settlers to determine if slavery would be allowed in their territories. The Wyandot people were divided on the issue of slavery, although some, Walker included, owned slaves.Bowes, p.182 Walker, however, opposed secession. A few Wyandot benefited in the 1850s and 1860s by selling their lands to white settlers, but for most the influx of Whites proved disastrous and they soon moved to Oklahoma and new lands there. Walker, however, remained in Kansas where he died on February 13, 1874.NEGenWeb project, \\"The Walker Family, http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/Walker/wlkr011.html , accessed, 30 Aug 2011. Walker's legacy Walker's political efforts had the objective of preventing the Wyandot from being dispossessed of their lands in Kansas as they had been in Ohio. As a member of the Wyandot elite, he believed that the Wyandot could survive and prosper alongside white settlers. He was wrong, although some of the Wyandot, including himself, continued to be respected and to be known as important citizens of the territory and state of Kansas.

It is present in transcription regulators of the LuxR/FixJ family of response regulators. The domain is named after Vibrio fischeri luxR, a transcriptional activator for quorum-sensing control of luminescence. LuxR-type HTH domain proteins occur in a variety of organisms. The DNA-binding HTH domain is usually located in the C-terminal region of the protein; the N-terminal region often containing an autoinducer-binding domain or a response regulatory domain. Most luxR-type regulators act as transcription activators, but some can be repressors or have a dual role for different sites. LuxR-type HTH regulators control a wide variety of activities in various biological processes. The luxR-type, DNA- binding HTH domain forms a four-helical bundle structure. The HTH motif comprises the second and third helices, known as the scaffold and recognition helix, respectively. The HTH binds DNA in the major groove, where the N-terminal part of the recognition helix makes most of the DNA contacts. The fourth helix is involved in dimerisation of gerE and traR. Signalling events by one of the four activation mechanisms described below lead to multimerisation of the regulator. The regulators bind DNA as multimers. LuxR- type HTH proteins can be activated by one of four different mechanisms: 1\\\\. Regulators which belong to a two-component sensory transduction system where the protein is activated by its phosphorylation, generally on an aspartate residue, by a transmembrane kinase. Some proteins that belong to this category are: * Rhizobiaceae fixJ (global regulator inducing expression of nitrogen- fixation genes in microaerobiosis) * Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium uhpA (activates hexose phosphate transport gene uhpT) *E. coli narL and narP (activate nitrate reductase operon) *Enterobacteria rcsB (regulation of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in enteric and plant pathogenesis) * Bordetella pertussis bvgA (virulence factor) * Bacillus subtilis comA (involved in expression of late-expressing competence genes) 2\\\\. Regulators which are activated, or in very rare cases repressed, when bound to N-acyl homoserine lactones, which are used as quorum sensing molecules in a variety of Gram-negative bacteria: *Vibrio fischeri luxR (activates bioluminescence operon) * Agrobacterium tumefaciens traR (regulation of Ti plasmid transfer) * Erwinia carotovora carR (control of carbapenem antibiotics biosynthesis) *E. carotovora expR (virulence factor for soft rot disease; activates plant tissue macerating enzyme genes) * Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasR (activates elastase gene lasB) * Erwinia chrysanthemi echR and Erwinia stewartii esaR * Pseudomonas chlororaphis phzR (positive regulator of phenazine antibiotic production) * Pseudomonas aeruginosa rhlR (activates rhlAB operon and lasB gene) * Acinetobacter baumannii abaR (activates operon for production of surfactant-like lipopeptide acinetin-505)Niu C, Clemmer KM, Bonomo RA, Rather PN.

According to legend, Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja was suffering from skin disease following the curse from Ranakadevi, the queen whom he captured from Junagadh. He was cured after bathing in this tank so he refurbished the tank. The water of the tank is still considered miraculous. It is mentioned in Prabandha-Chintamani written by Merutunga. The tank kept finding its reference and mentions citing Siddharaja since 12th century. It is also mentioned in Ain-e-Akbari. Poet Nanalal Dalpatram Kavi expresses and explains in his Hari Samhita that Krishna had visited the place. Architecture Brahma Kund, built in the style of medieval architecture, has a design of steps, small temples, metaphors, motifs and beliefs, idols of Hindu deities, stone work, some scientific entities, everything carved within and across the complex.

It was founded in 2009 by former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and current Chairman of AEA Investors Admiral Bill Owens and Vice Minister Liu He of the Chinese Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. The forum extends for two days. Participants spend the first day in private discussions and then convene a half-day public session to summarize their observations, analyses, and conclusions with the press and a broader audience. The Summer Palace Dialogue is scheduled annually in mid-September in Beijing, right before the Summer World Economic Forum in Dalian. The third annual Summer Palace Dialogue was held on September 12‚Äì13, 2011. Other than the forum, SPD sends a delegation of Chinese economists who participated in the forum to major cities in both the east and west coasts of the United States in order to conduct first hand research on political, social and economic conditions in the U.S. Topics of discussion =2011= The 2011 Summer Palace Dialogue focused on rebalancing the global economy in light of a stubbornly persistent economic downturn. Participants stressed that the United States is going through a painful but necessary process of decreasing household debt. This restructuring is severely undermining demand in the U.S. economy, thus harming economic output and employment. Part of global rebalancing, participants said, was pushing the United States to greater export dependence, in line with President Obama's 2010 initiative to double U.S. net exports in five years. SPD economists and policymakers also assessed China's current economic challenges: inflation, local debt, and the possibility of a housing crisis. Beijing's primary rebalancing task remains to increase Chinese domestic consumption. Such a shift will provide a new boom in Chinese economic growth while also decreasing China's trade surplus. Increasing Chinese outward foreign direct investment to the United States and small business purchases of U.S. goods were also solutions to help resolve the U.S.-China trade imbalance. =2010= In 2010 Lou Jiwei, the chairman of the China Investment Corporation and an economist at the Summer Palace Dialogue, said that China should sell its U.S. dollars and diversify its foreign currency holdings if the United States continues its loose monetary policy. Lou Jiwei also had some advice for the United States, in which he said that the US Federal Reserve should tighten monetary policy and the United States Congress should continue with raising stimulus spending.

The car was based on mechanical components from the Renault 4CV. Origins The car was inspired by the ‚ÄúMarquis‚Äù a Renault 4CV based coup√©, a design acquired for production under licence in the United States but which had never entered production. More direct inspiration came from the ‚ÄúAllemano‚Äù, another Renault 4CV based coup√© prototype, and modified by Chappe et Gessalin, the firm that would assemble the early ‚Äúglass fibre‚ÄùAt the time, the body shell material was described variously as ‚Äúresin and fibre-glass sheets‚Äù or, frequently, as ‚Äúplastic‚Äù. bodied A106s for Alpine. Under the skin, the A106 closely resembled the 4CV. The more sporting ‚ÄúA106 Mille Miles‚Äù would derive from a competition version of the 4CV model developed by Renault. The name The number ‚Äú106‚Äù also came from Renault. 1060, 1062 and 1063 were the reference numbers under which the 4CV had been registered with the French homologation authorities.1061 was the number of an automatic transmission version of the Renault 4CV intended for drivers whose war injuries left them unable to use a manual transmission: this project never progressed beyond the prototype stage, however. The Alpine 107 was a steel-bodied prototype, which never entered production. The launch The emphasis at this stage was not on selling cars to the public but on chalking up successes in competition, indicating financial support from Renault for Alpine. Following on from the one-off ‚ÄúMarquis‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlemano‚Äù prototypes, in the summer of 1955 the first three Alpine A106s, painted respectively red, white and blue, were presented to Renault CEO Pierre Dreyfus in the yard at Renault's large (though by now rather cramped) Billaincourt plant. The cars had been assembled by Chappe et Gessalin, in order to meet a special order received from Charles Escoffier, the owner of a large Paris based Renault dealership who also happened to be the father in law of Jean R√©d√©l√©. Rear view of coach Mille Miles version From 1955 the little A106 started to accumulate a succession of victories, and various performance enhancing options were offered such as ‚ÄúMille Miles (Mille Miglia) suspension‚Äù following A106 participation in the eponymous race. The Mille Miles specifications involve using four shock absorbers at the back, and was the suspension system later used for the Renault 8 Gordini. Also offered was a five speed manual gear box manufactured under license: a five speed gear box in a road car of this class was almost unheard of, and since the gearbox option alone came with a price tag sufficient to purchase 35% of a Renault 4CV, Alpine A106s incorporating the five speed gear box option remained rare. In 1956 Jean Claude Galtier and Maurice Michy achieved a podium place and class victory for the A106 in the Mille Miglia race. Commercialisation Although the initial emphasis was on sporting success, in October 1957 the A106 made its first appearance at the Paris Motor Show. In 1957 Chappe et Gessalin relocated production facilities for the fibre-glass bodied cars from Saint-Maur to a new more spacious site (which a few years later became their headquarters) at Brie-Comte-Robert. This prepared the way for increasing production levels. The A106 still came with the same little 747 cc Renault engine, but now three different power output versions were offered, providing respectively at 4,100 rpm, at 4,800 rpm or, on the ‚ÄúA106 Mille Miles‚Äù, at 6,300 rpm. Performance differences correlated with different carburettors and higher compression ratios and, in the case of the fastest car, of weight reduction. The October 1957 Paris Motor Show also marked the first appearance of the Michelotti styled Alpine cabriolet. Subsequently, a closed coup√© version of this car would also be produced (\\"coach\\" in French), and it would eventually become the Alpine A108. At this stage, however, the A106 continued to be the manufacturer's principal model, and by the time production ended around 650 had been produced. A larger engined version of the car later appeared offering a maximum of power from a 904 cc version of the Dauphine engine. In 1959 a tubular-framed backbone chassis version was introduced. In 1960 emphasis switched from the A106 to the A108, and at some point during the next couple of years the last A106 was produced. The A106 had established Alpine's credentials as an auto-brand, but it successor would be produced in significantly greater numbers and would become much better known than the A106 had managed.

Gaddafi regime =Apartheid regime= From the time Muammar Gaddafi assumed power in Libya in 1969 until the end of apartheid in South Africa and the country's first democratic elections in 1994 the Gaddafi regime was hostile to the government in Pretoria. Libya provided funding and support to South African anti-apartheid movements. as well as military training to ANC combatants. After the legalisation of the ANC, then ANC leader Nelson Mandela visited Gaddafi in Libya in May 1990 to thank him for Libya's assistance. =ANC government= After South Africa's first democratic elections in April 1994 and the arrival of the new African National Congress (ANC) government South African - Libyan relations were transformed overnight from one of hostility to one of friendship and cooperation. This saw bilateral trade and investments increase greatly and South Africa making significant contributions to further negotiations for the release of the two Libyan suspects involved in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. This relationship was highlighted by official visits to Libya by former President Mandela and former President Thabo Mbeki. Mandela made two official visits to the country as president of South Africa. Once in 1994 shortly after being elected president and again in October 1997. In June 2002 then President Mbeki led a South African delegation to Libya to discuss issues ranging from closer economic integration and bilateral trade to the launch of the African Union in Durban later that year. In 1994 Gaddafi, then still a world pariah, was invited to attend then President Nelson Mandela's swearing in ceremony. Responding to Western criticism of the new ANC government's close relationship with the Gaddafi regime Mandela stated that: It is alleged that the Gaddafi government gave the ANC money for its election campaigns from 1994 until its fall in 2011. South Africa bestowed the Order of Good Hope, one of its highest honours, on Gaddafi in 1997. Libyan civil war Despite backing U.N. Security Council resolution 1973 the official position of the South African government has been against the NATO bombing of Gaddafi forces and in support of the African Union's \\"road map to peace\\" which called for an immediate ceasefire, opening channels for humanitarian aid and talks between the rebels and government. South Africa's Deputy Minister for Foreign affairs Ebrahim Ebrahim has stated that the way in which Resolution 1973 was implemented and the regime change policy of NATO has left the South African government feeling betrayed by the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Ebrahim also stated that in the future this sense of betrayal might prevent South Africa from supporting other UN resolutions proposed by these countries. The ANC lead South African government has been seen to be sympathetic to the Gaddafi government. One South African based analyst has identified six reasons for this: rejection of external involvement in African affairs especially by Western powers; regaining its 'radical credentials' that were lost for South Africa's support of resolution 1973; South African policy on the Israel- Palestine issue; a perceived shift of global power by the South African government that emerging powers will \\"cover South Africa's political back\\"; South Africa's policy of applying equal regional and international pressure to solve regional problems; and the ANC's reliance on Gaddafi money and investments in South Africa. Post-Gaddafi Libya In the early days of the National Transitional Council (NTC) rule, South Africa, closely flowing movements by the African Union, was slow to recognise it as the legitimate government of Libya, only recognising the NTC in late September 2011, almost a month after most Western nations (as well as Nigeria) and around two weeks after countries like China and Russia. South Africa has been highly reluctant to unfreeze $1.5-billion in Libyan assets in South Africa. The South African government has also urged the NTC to protect African migrants in Libya following reports of abuse by anti-Gaddafi militia units.

He was Rector of St Alban, Wood Street, London, served as chaplain to Prince Rupert of the Rhine, and published a translation of Augustine's Confessions in 1631, which serves as the principal text of the Loeb Classical Library two volume edition of the work.Confessions, St. Augustine. Trans. Watts. Harvard University Press. London. 1912. Life The son of William Watts of Tibbenham, Norfolk, he was born there about 1590. He was at school at Moulton St Mary, and in 1606 at age 16 was admitted sizar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. in 1611, M.A. in 1614, and was college chaplain from 1616 to 1626. He was incorporated at Oxford on 14 July 1618, and in 1639 was created D.D. Watts travelled on the continent of Europe after leaving college, and became linguist. In December 1620 he accompanied Sir Albertus Morton as chaplain on his mission to the German Protestant princes. In 1624, Watts was apparently appointed vicar of Barwick, Norfolk, and the next year rector of St. Alban, Wood Street, London. The former living he seemingly held until 1648: on 24 April of that year he was included in a list of sequestrated delinquents (Royalists whose estates were confiscated by Parliament). From the London rectory he was driven in 1642, and his wife and children were homeless for a time. He was serving in 1639 as army chaplain to Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, the general of the English forces in the Bishops' War, with supervision of the other chaplains. He was appointed a prebendary of Wells Cathedral on 19 March 1633, and in 1645 was nominated Archdeacon of Wells, but never took up the post. On Prince Rupert's return to England in 1642, Watts, who had previously held the post of chaplain to Charles I, was attached to him. He accompanied the prince on campaign, and was present throughout many actions. He also attended him at sea, and during the blockade of the royalist ships under the prince in Kinsale Harbour, Watts fell sick. He died there about December 1649, and was buried in Ireland. Works Watts was a scholar whom Gerard Vossius praised for his major work, the edition of the Historia Major of Matthew Paris.London, 1640, fol.; Paris, 1644; London, 1684 He assisted Sir Henry Spelman with his glossary, and his translation of the Confessions of St. Augustine (London, 1631) was edited by Edward Pusey in 1838 for his Library of the Fathers. He also issued a series of newsletters under the title of The Swedish Intelligencer. Of other works mentioned by Anthony Wood, the Bodleian Library hold a manuscript treatise on the surplice entitled The Church's Linen Garment, dated 1646, among its Tanner manuscripts (No. 262). Eliot Warburton conjectured that Watts was author of two manuscripts describing portions of Prince Rupert's maritime exploits during the Commonwealth period; he found those among the Rupert manuscripts and printed them in the third volume of his Life of the prince. Family Watts was married and had a son. His wife, a daughter of Vaughan, minister of Ashtead, Surrey, the brother of Richard Vaughan, bishop of London, and his wife Judith, survived him.

The play takes place from 1938-1940, when Stalin was implementing the Great Purge in which several million people were exiled, imprisoned, or executed. The play is Hodge's first, although he has had a long career as a screenwriter. The play received its premi√®re at the Royal National Theatre, London, on 25 October 2011; Nicholas Hytner directed, with Alex Jennings as Bulgakov and Simon Russell Beale as Stalin. The production subsequently won the 2012 Laurence Olivier Award for the best new play produced in Britain. The play has been published in the United Kingdom and in the U.S. Plot summary The story takes place in Moscow in the years 1938 to 1940 and the drama centers around the apartment of Mikhail Bulgakov and his wife Yelena. Bulgakov has just finished his play The Life of Monsieur de Moli√®re which his friends acclaim a masterpiece. The night after the premiere, he is visited by two secret policemen from the NKVD. They tell him the play is banned and will never be shown again unless he cooperates with them in writing a \\"hack\\" play on the life of the young Joseph Stalin. At first Bulgakov resists their bullying and refuses to cooperate even though this could endanger his life. Their terrorizing of Bulgakov intensifies until he pretends to start work, but sits at the typewriter unable to put words to paper. Then one night he receives a phone call and a mystery voice offers him help if he goes to a certain metro station and enters a door hidden in the tunnel. Bulgakov follows the instructions and finds himself alone in a room beneath the Kremlin with Joseph Stalin himself. Stalin says he has always admired Bulgakov's work and offers his assistance in the play. Stalin sits at the typewriter and produces scenes which delight the NKVD with their depiction of Stalin as an heroic and glorious leader fighting Czarist oppression. While Stalin types Bulgakov relieves Stalin of the burden of some of his state papers. Inadvertently Bulgakov becomes involved in issuing the orders which bring about the Great Purge of Stalinist Russia. The play is finished but the monster of the purges consumes his friends' lives one by one. The strain on Bulgakov leads to an intensification of his inherited disease, nephrosclerosis, and his eventual death.National Theatre London, performance programme. John Hodge's notes, May 2012 Historical context The play is a fictional device to examine the conflict experienced by a writer who is trying to portray a recognizable depiction of the human condition in a tyrannical world which systematically represses such expression. Bulgakov did receive a phone call from Stalin out of the blue at an earlier stage in his career in 1930 in which he was favoured with a new post. He knew that the dictator admired his work and followed his output. No formal collaboration between Stalin and Bulgakov existed but the figure of Stalin as a monster inside Bulgakov's mind existed, and this was reinforced physically through the NKVD. Bulgakov did indeed write a play to order on the life of the young Stalin around the time depicted, entitled Batum, which is regarded by modern critics as stilted and shallow. The terror of the tyrant led him to produce a play on demand which might have been written by the dictator himself. Bulgakov's play Moli√®re: The Cabal of Hypocrites (1936), of which there are brief extracts within this play, examines the life of another author, Moli√®re, at the court of a tyrant, Louis XIV of France. Critical reception The original production received somewhat mixed reviews. Charles Spencer wrote for The Daily Telegraph, \\"This is a truly tremendous double act which thrills chills and makes you laugh out loud - even though you know you shouldn‚Äôt.\\" Michael Billington wrote for The Guardian, \\"the purpose of Hodge's satirical fantasia is clearly to suggest Bulgakov's obsession with Stalin is proof of the latter's ultimate triumph. ... While I may question Hodge's arguments, his play has a nightmarish vivacity well captured in Nicholas Hytner's freewheeling production on Bob Crowley's zig-zagging traverse stage.\\" Live broadcast and US productions On 1 December 2011, the original production was broadcast to cinemas around the world as a part of the National Theatre Live programme. In 2016, the play received new productions in New York City and in Washington, D.C. References Further reading * Unsigned commentary about the play from the Russian Embassy in London.

It has been recognized as the closest young star to the Earth. Discovery AP Columbae was identified as a flare star in 1995; it was discovered as a bright X-ray source in 1999 during a study of bright infra-red point sources from the 2MASS catalogue which did not have an optical counterpart‚Äîone of the reasons for an absence of a counterpart would be a large proper motion, which tends to correlate with proximity. Photometry and spectra taken during that work gave an estimate for the intrinsic brightness of the star, which let to a distance estimate of about 6.1 pc. A later work confirmed that the star was nearby, and determined that it was very young. It is at a distance of 27 light years (8.4 pc), a figure calculated by accurate observations of the star's relative movement with respect to the background stars during the course of an Earth year. For many years, scientists were of the opinion that such young stars were present only in very distant star-forming regions like the Orion nebula, but with the advent of new all-sky survey techniques this has proved to be incorrect. Features AP Columbae is about 40 million years old, which is very young compared to the age of the Earth; it formed after the dinosaurs became extinct and during a period when mammals were beginning to dominate the Earth. The age of the star was estimated by calculating the amount of lithium present in the star, which is rapidly burned up once nuclear fusion ignites. AP Columbae is classified as a red dwarf of the spectral class M4.5 with an estimated surface temperature of 3250 K. It has not evolved into a main sequence star yet and is still in the pre-main-sequence stage. The star is almost surely single‚Äîdirect imaging indicated that any stellar companion would be less than 50 milliarcseconds distant, and the radial velocity variations induced by so close a companion would be much larger than the observed ones. It is about 2500 times less luminous than the Sun in the visible light and may be part of a newly formed group of stars called Argus/IC 2391. AP Columbae belongs to the class of stars known as UV Ceti flare stars. These are young low mass stars, which are strong sources of X-ray radiation and experience frequent flares. The latter are much like Solar flares but are much brighter as compared to the star's quiescent luminosity‚Äîthe brightness of AP Columbae can increase as much as 10 times during the largest flares. Since AP Columbae is so close to the Earth, it will be possible to search for any large gas giant planets it possesses using high-resolution images of its immediate neighborhood. Such an approach would not be practical for other, more distant, young stars. Scientists hope to find newly formed planets orbiting the star from observations with the telescopes in Chile.

The other stations in the city that are served by regular passenger services are Unna-K√∂nigsborn, Unna West, Massen, L√ºnern and Hemmerde. Reconstruction in 2007 History  The station was opened in 1855 as part of the Dortmund‚ÄìSoest railway built by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company (BME) and equipped with an impressive station building, which was sold for non-rail purposes in 2005. In 1866, the BME opened the line from Unna to Hamm to connect with the Cologne-Minden trunk line. Later the line was extended from Unna to Hagen, making Unna station into a railway junction of regional importance. Between 1899 and 1901 the Prussian state railways opened the Fr√∂ndenberg‚ÄìKamen railway to connect the three east- west lines in the area. The southern part connected with the line to Menden, which was opened in 1872; this line was extended in 1912 to Neuenrade as the H√∂nne Valley Railway.

He is remembered as a national hero in Iran who organized popular resistance against the British troops which had invaded Iran in 1915. Rais Ali, son of Rais Mohammad, was born in 1882 in the suburb of Bushehr. In the age of constitutionalism he was 24, chivalrous, brave, unparallel in sincerity and famous for patriotism and reliance upon God. Subsequent to British occupation of Bushehr, Rais Ali courageously resisted the aggressors and imposed heavy defeats on them. After occupation of Bushehr, British forces decided to take over Delvar, a place they had earlier experienced heavy defeats. Rais Ali and his companions fought the occupiers and routed them who were nearly 5000 people. The uprising of people of Tangestan prolonged nearly for 7 years in which Daliran Tangestan (the brave of Tangestan) pursued two goals: guarding Bushehr, Dashtestan and Tangestan as their habitat and preventing the foreign forces from infiltrating the country and securing the independence of the country. The noble Rais Ali Delvari eventually was attacked from behind by a traitor and martyred on September 2, 1915, when he was 33 His house, located in Delvar, near Bushehr, has been transformed into ethnological museum. Some of Rais Ali Delvari's personal items, as well as historic documents of his time, various types of guns and horse caparisoning are exhibited in this museum.Delvar Ethnological Museum Background =Iranian background= In World War I, Iran was neutral . In reality, Persian forces were affected by the rivalry between the Allied Powers and the Central Powers and took sides based on the conditions. Western interest in Persia was based on its significant oil reserve and its strategic situation between Afghanistan and the warring Ottoman, Russian, and British Empires. Persia was divided into northern and southern spheres of influence under the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907. The treaty defined their respective spheres of influence in Iran and Afghanistan and provided a counterweight to German influence. This treaty was widely viewed by Iranians as having made the nation into nothing more than a British and Russian protectorate, so during the World War I, many local rebellions occurred in Iran against the British and Russian forces participating in war against Central powers of World War I. In Northern Iran, Jangal movement of Gilan, was the main operating local force against the British and Russians forces, and in Southern Iran, Lurs (BoyerAhmadi) , Tangistani and Laristani tribes were the main resisting power against the British empire. In both Southern and Northern movements, Persian Central Government Gendarmerie supported the rebels (See Persian Campaign ). =German rule= Germany established their Intelligence Bureau for the East on the eve of World War I, dedicated to promoting and sustaining subversive and nationalist agitations in British India and the Persian and Egyptian satellite states. The bureau was involved in intelligence and subversive missions to Persia and Afghanistan to dismantle the Anglo-Russian Entente. The bureau's operations in Persia were led by Wilhelm Wassmuss. The Germans hoped to free Persia from British and Russian influence and to further create a wedge between Russia and the British, eventually leading to an invasion of British India by locally organized armies. Uprising During first years of World War I, Rais Ali and Wassmuss were busy formulating a general Anti-British uprising in Persia.Conrad Cato,\\"The navy everywhere\\",Constable and company, 1919 , pp.178 On 12 July 1915, Rais Ali and Tangestani's attacked the British residency in BushehrJefferson Adams,Historical dictionary of German intelligence,Scarecrow Press, First Edition, September 1, 2009,, pp 482 but they were relapsed . On 8 August 1915 the British forces occupied Bushehr with five hundred more Anglo-Indian cavalrymenDonald M. McKale ,War by Revolution: Germany and Great Britain in the Middle East in the Era of World War I,Kent State University Press (October 28, 1998),, pp.139 and on 14 September removed Mokhber-al-Saltana from Shiraz and installed Habib-Allah QawƒÅm-al-Molk as acting governor of Fars Province. Between August and October 1915, QawƒÅm-al- Molk received financial support from the British . But in late December the British prot√©g√© was expelled from Shiraz by pro-German officers of gendarmerie and the radical Democrat Party members who occupied the city and confiscated the British assets. Five days later British ships bombarded the headquarters of the Tangestanis tribal at Dilbar ; and on 3 and 9 September the Anglo- Indians repulsed during bloody clashes several Tangistani raids, in this clashes, Rais Ali was killed .Then the Britishs used pro-British tribes to scatter the enemy into the hinterland.At the end, local tribal leaders murdered the British vice consul (a Persian) in Shiraz. Aftermath On 26 June 1916 an anti-British uprising broke out in Shiraz, but was put down the next day. The fragile British control over FƒÅrs was disrupted in May 1918 when ·π¢awlat-al-Dawla, leading the Qashqais and other pro-German tribal forces from Kazerun, Dashti, Dashtestan and Tangestan, embarked upon a war against the British. Eventually, ·π¢awlat-al-Dawla‚Äôs uprising subsided due to the spread of influenza and British pressure. In late 1920 Mohammad Mossadegh, the new governor-general of FƒÅrs, reinstated ·π¢awlat-al-Dawla to the office of ƒ´l·∏µƒÅnƒ´. The South Persia Rifles ended its activities following the British supported coup d‚Äô√©tat of 1921, which was followed by the formation of a modern army in Persia and the eventual suppression of tribal rebels. Legacy According to Iranian Minister of Islamic Culture and Guidance, the Islamic Republic of Iran has designated September 3 as day of combat against British colonialism in Iran. The day is devoted to sacrifices of Rais Ali Delvari, and will be registered in official calendars.Persia Herald tribune The Rais Ali Dilavari Dam, is named after this person.

Limestone of Khattak Formation is another dominant lithology which is crushed by crushing plants for obtaining cheap, easily accessible and durable construction aggregates. Slates are broken down naturally into pencil structures to form another type of construction aggregate \\"locally known as Shengal\\" which is mostly used for filling purposes and is being fluently transported to nearby cities. Recently the PMDC \\" Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation\\" has made a commercial discovery of graphite, sulphur and red oxide in the Manki Slates at Western border of the village's territory.

Linderman is a non- citizen of Latvia. Biography In 1991 Linderman worked in the Russian editorial office of the Atmoda newspaper. In 1998 he was the leader of the Latvian branch of the National Bolshevik Party (NBP). From 2002, Linderman was a member of the Central Committee of the NBP. On November 2002, he went to Saratov to take part in the trial of the NBP founder Eduard Limonov as a defence witness. On September 24, 2003, Linderman was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSS) in Moscow and spent 19 days in Lefortovo Prison. Latvia requested Russia to extradite him, but Russia refused, citing fears of political persecution. On June 21, 2006, Linderman was arrested again, but during his convoying to Latvia he escaped and remained in hiding for two more years. In 2008 Linderman was finally found and on March 20 extradited to Latvia, where he was accused of storing explosives, calling to overthrow the political system and planning to assassinate the President of Latvia Vaira Vƒ´ƒ∑e-Freiberga. On October 6, 2008, Linderman was given a one-year prison sentence suspended for twelve months for the possession of a TNT block with a detonator, but was cleared on the charges of inciting to overthrow the government due to lack of evidence. On October 26, 2008, he attempted to enter Estonia from Finland, but was detained at the Tallinn Port, where Linderman was informed that he is banned from entering the country and sent back to Finland. In 2009 Linderman became the establisher and leader of the Latvian political party The 13 January Movement.–ó–∞—Ä–µ–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ø–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è –õ–∏–Ω–¥–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∞ ¬´–î–≤–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ 13 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è¬ª In 2011, he was the co-founder of an NGO called \\"Mother Tongue\\" that initiated the unsuccessful constitutional referendum for making Russian a second state language in Latvia. On July 16, 2012, Linderman renamed The 13 January Movement to For the Native Language! and registered it as a political party. Soon after he called his supporters to boycott SEB banka for refusing to open a bank account for the party. In 2013 Linderman became the unofficial leader of a newly founded organization ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Protect Our Children‚Äù that along with another organization called \\"Kin\\" began collecting signatures to initiate a referendum against \\"gay propaganda\\". In 2014 he and few other pro-Russian activists appeared in the Victory Day celebration at the Victory Memorial to Soviet Army in Victory Park, Riga, Latvia with flags of Donetsk People's Republic and expressed their support for the pro-Russian separatists. On May 8, 2018, Linderman was arrested by the Security Police for a suspected incitement of national, ethnic and racial hatred, performing activities aimed against Latvia‚Äôs independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, state power and government structure, as well as organizing mass riots in a March 31 speech he gave at the \\"All-Latvian Parents Gathering\\" organized by the Latvian Russian Union. On May 10 Linderman was kept in custody, but finally was released on May 22.

It is the oldest house in the city, and now houses public offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1983. History thumb thumb William Upton was born in 1835 in Leicestershire, England, and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1841. The Uptons first settled in Detroit, then moved to Sterling Township in 1845. In 1861, William Upton married Sarah Jeanette Aldrich, and in 1866-67 he built this house on his farm. Upton was a successful and prosperous farmer, and also sold fish caught in the Clinton River, and by 1891 the farm spread out over 138 acres. William and Sarah Upton lived in this house until 1891, when they moved to Utica and purchased a three-story commercial building. William Upton ran a successful mercantile and real estate business in the Utica building until 1897, when he sold the business (but not the building). In 1897, Upton became general manager of the local Salvation Army. Upton's building was destroyed by fire in 1904, and he was seriously injured trying to protect it. Soon afterward, the Uptons moved to Rochester, where William Upton died in 1923 and Sarah Upton died in 1925. In 1891, the Uptons sold the house to Frederick Ahrens, who lived there until 1913. In 1913, the farm was purchased by Fred and Augusta Heldt, who lived there from 1913 to 1927. In 1922, Heldt conveyed part of the farm to the state of Michigan to create Dodge Park. Stella Boylan purchased the house in 1927, and afterward a number of owners and renters lived there. Although the exterior of the house was originally natural brick, at some point in the 1940s or 50s it was painted. In 1964, the house was purchased by the Macomb Child Guidance Center, and later the city of Sterling Heights bought the building for use by the Parks and Recreation Department. The Upton House was restored in 1981-82, at which time the interior was converted to house public offices. Description The Upton House is a two-story Italianate-style house constructed of brick with a hipped roof and tall cupola. The brick construction indicates the relative affluence of the builder. The exterior is painted and heavy brackets support the eaves. Windows are tall, double-hung, four-over-four lights; the ones on the front facade feature ornate stone hoods while windows on the other sides have brick hoods.

He also drew Bananaman in the BEEB comic.Alan Clark, Dictionary of British Comic Artists, Writers and Editors, The British Library, 1998, p. 4 In 1999, he took over Bananaman in the Dandy from John Geering. He returned for a short time to do Bananaman in 2008. In 2003, he took over Roger the Dodger after the death of Robert Nixon. Appleby's Roger strips were similar in style to Nixon's, although his own style was always evident. However, following the Dandy's revamp in October 2004, he relinquished Cuddle Dimples to Nigel Parkinson. A couple of years later, he drew two new strips for the Beano, with Pirates of the Caribeano beginning in September 2006 and London B412 following in October 2007, both were short-lived. He also provided the cover illustrations for the 2008 and 2009 editions of the Beano Annual. In February 2011, Appleby became the full- time Dennis the Menace artist, and he stopped drawing Roger shortly afterwards. Barrie Appleby returned to draw new Roger the Dodger episodes in August 2012 after Nigel Parkinson took over as Dennis artist. He supposedly left in The Beano in July 2013 along with Barry Glennard and Dave Eastbury when Roger was taken over by Jamie Smart.

Other scenes in the lost reels of the film were believed to have included gold seekers leaving London; the issuing of licences; the rush at Canadian gully; the arrival of the first women at the goldfields; licence hunting; diggers chained to logs and rescued by mates; the murder of Scottish gold digger James Scobie; diggers burning Bentley's Hotel; the Rebellion; Peter Lalor addressing the miners; burning the licenses; building the stockade; troops storming the stockade; the stockade in ruins; and a look at Ballarat 55 years later Release The film was first screened in the Athenaeum Hall, Melbourne on 19 October 1907. It impressed critics of the time and was found to be a stirring portrayal of the events surrounding the Eureka Stockade, but failed to connect with audiences during the two weeks it was screened.

Dissius (1653 - 1695) was a Dutch typographer and printer. He is most notable as an art collector and for his links to Johannes Vermeer - his collection included 21 Vermeer works (including The Milkmaid, Portrait of a Young Woman, A Girl Asleep, Woman Holding a Balance and The Music Lesson) and in 1680 he married Madgdalene, daughter and sole heir of Vermeer's main patron Pieter van Ruijven. Dissius died in 1695 and his collection was auctioned off in Amsterdam the following year. Biography Jacob Dissius was baptised on 23 November 1653 in Delft as the son of Maria Cloeting and the printer Abraham Dissius. He married Magdalena Pieters van Ruijven, daughter of Pieter van Ruijven, born in 1655. Dissius' father-in-law was one of the wealthier citizens of Delft, and became a patron of Vermeer. She inherited her parent's money and art collection after the death of her mother in 1681. When she died childless in 1682, he inherited her collection of Vermeer paintings and other works of art. He was the owner of the \\"Golden ABC\\" (\\"Het Gulden ABC\\"), a print shop on the Market Square of Delft.

Salerno worked as the right field umpire in the 1964 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In his career, he umpired 1,110 Major League games.Retrosheet Early career Before his umpiring career, Salerno was a pitcher in the Boston Red Sox organization. He was drafted out of high school, being able to throw a 95 mph fastball. He only had one loss in his high school career, which resulted when he threw a no-hitter. He played for the Marion Red Sox of the Ohio‚ÄìIndiana League in . He was drafted into the army and Boston a couple of days apart. Unfortunately, he broke both his arms after falling out of a jeep during service and was unable to pitch again. After his relatively short-lived playing career, Salerno became a New York state police officer, and spent time as both a trooper and a motor vehicle licensing examiner. He also umpired local baseball and softball games, and eventually enrolled in the Al Somers Umpire School in Daytona Beach, Florida. Major league career After spending time in various levels of the minor leagues, Salerno joined the American League staff in September 1961 at the age of 30. Salerno was the third base umpire when Roger Maris hit his record-breaking 61st home run in Yankee Stadium. On September 16, 1968, Salerno received a call from American League president Joe Cronin, informing Salerno that he and crewmate Bill Valentine were being fired, effective immediately. Cronin told Salerno and the press that he was fired for being a poor umpire. However, Salerno and Valentine had in fact been working to form a union of American League umpires, with the hopes that they could join their National League counterparts to form one union of Major League umpires. Bill Kunkel, a former Major League pitcher, and Jake O'Donnell, who was already a referee in the NBA, were called up to replace Salerno and Valentine. After the 1968 season, Salerno and Valentine filed a $4 million lawsuit against the American League and Major League Baseball, alleging defamation of character and federal antitrust violations. In 1970, as a settlement, the American League offered the umpires full reinstatement, back pay, and $20,000 in salary, but Salerno refused the deal because of a provision that stated that the umpires would have to spend time in the minor leagues to improve their skills. Salerno and Valentine lost both cases, and Salerno returned to Utica. Later life Although disappointed that he would never umpire again, Salerno was also bitter, stating, \\"If every baseball stadium in the country blew up tomorrow, I‚Äôd be happy.\\" Salerno continued to fight the case for the rest of his life, writing letters to lawyers the commissioner's office, and even Chief Justice John Roberts. Due to health problems, he never held a steady job after his firing. He died in Utica on August 5, 2007.

MicroRNAs are typically transcribed as ~70 nucleotide precursors and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22 nucleotide product. The excised region or, mature product, of the miR-138 precursor is the microRNA mir-138. miR-138 has been used as an example of the post- transcriptional regulation of miRNA, due to the finding that while the precursor is expressed ubiquitously, the mature product is found only in specific cell types.  Species distribution  The presence of miR-138 has been detected experimentally in humans (Homo sapiens) and in different animals including house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), Carolina anole(Anolis carolinensis), cattle (Bos taurus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), dog (Canis familiaris), Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), Oryzias latipes, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). It is also predicted computationally that the miR-138 gene exists in the genome of other animals including horse (Equus caballus), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), takifugu rubripes (Fugu rubripes), Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), Tetraodon nigroviridis and western clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis).  Genomic location  In human genome, there are two miR-138 associated genes and they are not located in any cluster. More precisely, the miR-138-1 gene is in region 5 at 3p21.3 and miR-138-2 is located on chromosome 16 (16q13).  Pattern of expression  In adult mice, miR-138 is only expressed in brain tissue. Its expression is not uniform throughout the brain but restricted to distinct neuronal populations. On the contrary, its precursor, pre-miR-138-2, is ubiquitously expressed throughout all tissues, which suggests that the expression of miRNAs can be regulated at the post-transcription level. In the zebrafish, miR-138 is expressed in specific domains in the heart and is required to establish appropriate chamber-specific gene expression patterns. Targets and function Since the identification of miR-138, a number of targets have been found and some of them have been verified experimentally. It has been proven that miR-138 is involved in different pathways. Furthermore, it is in relation with various types of cancer. ;HIF-1a: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1a), one of the key regulators in cancer cells, has been shown to be one target of miR-138. ;VIM, ZEB2, EZH2 and head and neck cancers: Downregulation of miR-138 has been reported in several types of cancers, including HNSCC(head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). It is suggested that miR-138 is a multi-functional molecular regulator and plays major roles in EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and in HNSCC progression. A number of miR-138 target genes have been identified to be associated with EMT, including VIM (vimentin), ZEB2 (zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2) and EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2). ;CCND1 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma:miR-138 is commonly underexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens and NPC cell lines. Cyclin D1 (CCND1), which is widely upregulated in NPC tumors, is found as a direct target of miR-138. Therefore, miR-138 might be a tumor suppressor in NPC, which is exerted partially by inhibiting CCND1 expression. ;BCR-ABL and CCND3: BCR (breakpoint cluster region)-ABL (c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase)/GATA1/miR-138 mini circuitry contributes to the leukemogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). ABL and BCR-ABL are the target genes of miR-138, which binds to the coding region instead of three prime untranslated region (3'UTR). miR-138 can negatively regulate another gene CCND3 via binding to its 3'-UTR. The expression of miR-138 is activated by GATA1, which in turn is repressed by BCR-ABL. Therefore, miR-138, by virtue of a BCR-ABL/GATA1/miR-138 circuitry, is a tumor suppressor miRNA implicated in the pathogenesis of CML and its clinical response to imatinib. ;H2AX and DNA damage repair: mir-138 is linked with DNA damage repair. It can directly target the histone H2AX 3'UTR, reduce histone H2AX expression and induce chromosomal instability after DNA damage. ;ALDH1A2 and CSPG2: In zebrafish, the mature form of miR-138 regulates gene expression influencing cardiac development. miR-138 helps establish discrete domains of gene expression during cardiac morphogenesis by targeting multiple members of a common pathway. It has been experimentally verified that miR-138 can negatively regulate aldh1a2, encoding retinoic acid (RA) dehydrogenase (Raldh2), by targeting the binding site in the 3'UTR of its mRNA. Another putative target of miR-138 is cspg2. ;Regulation of sleep: In rats, miR-138, let-7b, and miR-125a are expressed at different times and in different structures in the brain and likely play a role in the regulation of sleep. ;Brain cancer: miR-138 has been found to be significantly linked with the formation and growth of Gliomas, from Cancerous Stem Cells (CSC). In vitro inhibition of miR-138 prevents tumour sphere formation. Furthermore, its high expression in Glioma makes it a potential biomarker for CSC. ;Rhoc, ROCK2 and Tongue cancer: Tumour metastasis concerning the Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TSCC) can be regulated via the expression of 2 key genes in Rho GTPase signaling pathway : RhoC and ROCK2 (Rho-associated protein kinase 2). Thus, by targeting the 3' untranslated region of those genes, mir-138 is able to reduce their expression and by this mean, to destroy TSCC ability migrate and invade.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. History The Wolcott Mill was constructed in 1847 by a miller named Freeman, and was operated as a grist mill and feed mill. The mill passed through multiple owners, including John Smith, Norman Crawford, and Frank Ritter, before being purchased by Fred B. Wolcott in 1878. Fred Wolcott was born in Bradford County, Pennsylvania in 1845, the son of J.P. and Rebecca Rogers Wolcott. He worked in a sawmill in Pennsylvania, then moved west to Wisconsin in 1865. He moved from there to Nebraska, then Wyoming, Utah, and California in succession, before returning to Nebraska where his father had subsequently settled, in 1869. There he homesteaded a tract of land, and in 1870 married Miss Anna C. Callahan. The couple had twelve children: A. E., John P., Fred H., William H., Frank O., Lewis J., Rebecca, Ida May, Anna, Rosa M., Mary, and Lillie. Wolcott improved his homestead property for nine years until 1878, when he traded the Nebraska tract for the mill located in Ray, Michigan. Wolcott rebuilt part of the mill, adding new machinery and another barn to the property. The Wolcott Mill was known for its high-quality flour, and a number of large Detroit bakeries, including Acme Pie and Oven King Cookies, used Wolcott Mill flour for their pastries and desserts. Fred Wolcott operated the mill until at least 1905. The mill closed in 1967. In 1989, the mill opened as part of the Wolcott Mill Metropark. Description thumb The Wolcott Mill complex includes the mill itself, the millpond, a barn, and a truck garage. A 1950s corncob building is also on the property, and a modern gazebo, restrooms, and toll road building were added by the park system. The large barn was first used as a stable, and was later converted to storage for certified seed. The Metropark uses the barn as a historical museum. The truck garage once housed delivery trucks, and is now used for special events. The original milling machinery is still in place in the mill. The machinery includes two midget marvel roller mills, used to grind grains, and other machinery used for milling.

She was the wife of Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy. Together with her husband, she is known for her excavations at Susa. Career Jane Dieulafoy was born Jeanne Henriette Magre to a wealthy family in Toulouse, France. She studied at the Couvent de l‚ÄôAssomption d‚ÄôAuteuil in a suburb of Paris from 1862 to 1870. She married Marcel Dieulafoy in May 1870, at the age of 19. That same year, the Franco-Prussian War began. Marcel volunteered, and was sent to the front. Jane accompanied him, wearing a soldier's uniform and fighting by his side. With the end of the war, Marcel was employed by the Midi railways, but during the next ten years the Dieulafoys would travel in Egypt and Morocco for archaeological and exploration work. Jane did not keep a record of these journeys. Marcel became increasingly interested in the relationship between Oriental and Western architecture, and in 1879 decided to devote himself to archaeology. Citadel of Varamin by Jane Dieulafoy Vakil Bazaar of Shiraz, as seen by Jane Dieulafoy in 1881. The Dieulafoys first visited Persia in 1881, and would return twice after that. The first journey to Persia was by freighter from Marseilles to Constantinople, by a Russian boat to Poti on the east coast of the Black Sea, and then across the Caucasus and via Azerbaijan to Tabriz. From there they travelled widely through Persia, to Tehran, Esfahan and Shiraz. Jane Dieulafoy documented the pair's explorations in photographs, illustrations, and writing. She took daily notes during her travels, which were later published in two volumes. At Susa, the couple found numerous artifacts and friezes, several of which were shipped back to France. One such find is the famous Lion Frieze on display at the Louvre. Two rooms in the museum contain artefacts brought back by the Dieulafoy missions. For her contributions, the French government conferred upon her the title of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1886. The transfer of the found objects to France caused considerable damage to the findings of Iranian archaeological excavations. Jane Dieulafoy says in her memoir about the Apadana Palace in Susa: Yesterday I watched the large stone bull found in recent days with great regret , weighing about twelve thousand pounds! It is impossible to shake such a huge mass. Eventually I could not overcome my anger, grab a sledgehammer and fall into the rock. I hit it with a savage blow. The head of the column is broken as a result of a sledgehammer struck like a ripe fruit ... After their journeys in Persia, Dieulafoy and her husband spent time traveling in Spain and Morocco between 1888 and 1914. She also wrote two novels: Her first was Parysatis, in 1890, set in ancient Susa. It was later adapted into an opera by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. Her second, D√©ch√©ance, was published in 1897. Marcel volunteered to go to Rabat, Morocco during the First World War, and Jane accompanied him. While in Morocco, her health began to decline. She contracted amoebic dysentery and was forced to return to France where she died in Pompertuzat in 1916. The childless couple left their home at 12, rue Chardin in Paris to the French Red Cross who continue to operate an office from the building to this day. Cross- dressing Jane (left, in men's clothing) with her husband. During her travels abroad, Jane Dieulafoy preferred to dress in men's clothing and wear her hair short, because it was otherwise difficult for a woman to travel freely in a Muslim country. She had also dressed as a man when she fought alongside Marcel Dieulafoy during the Franco-Prussian war and she kept dressing in men's clothing when she came back in France. This was against the law in France at the time, but when she returned from the Middle East she received special \\"permission de travestissement\\" from the prefect of police. It is difficult to determine Dieulafoy's motives for choosing to wear men's clothing. She wrote, \\"I only do this to save time. I buy ready-made suits and I can use the time saved this way to do more work\\" but, given that she includes many characters who cross-dress in her fiction (see her novels Volontaire and Fr√®re P√©lage, for example) she was clearly fascinated with the subject of cross-dressing and her motives appear to be more complex than mere convenience. Dieulafoy considered herself an equal to her husband, but was also fiercely loyal to him. She was opposed to the idea of divorce, believing it degraded women. During the First World War, she petitioned for allowing women a greater role in the military. She was a member of the jury of the prix Femina literary prize from its creation in 1904 until her death.

Her father, Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, was Directorate General of Public Relations Punjab until 2003. In her childhood she accompanied her mother in women's protests. Before entering teaching and journalism careers she was a sciences student. She was a pre-med student and obtained her masters degree in science and education from the University of Punjab and taught at secondary schools in Lahore.  Career  Sirmed is a social democrat, advocating for secular polity and minority rights in Pakistan. She has advocated for improved domestic violence legislation and governmental secularism. In 1990s, Sirmed started getting involved in NGO activities along with her journalistic activities. In 2001‚Äì2002 she joined the Aurat Foundation's Legislative Watch Programme. In 2004, she worked for The United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan, and simultaneously with the National Commission on the Status of Women, Federal Ministry of Women‚Äôs Development, and the Parliament of Pakistan. Marvi Sirmed received the National Human Rights Award of the government of Pakistan in 2010 and Friend of the Parliament Award in 2012. Sirmed was a member of the executive council of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and serves as board chair of Bytes for All. She is fellow at National Endowment for Democracy. She has been a freelance journalist since 2016.  Advocacy and controversies  As an outspoken advocate for human rights and secular democracy, Sirmed has attracted controversy among conservatives. In November 2007 she was arrested when she protested the 2007 emergency declared in Pakistan by then military dictator Pervez Musharraf. When the United States Embassy in Pakistan invited LGBT people to an event, Sirmed's defense of their decision was met with attacks on YouTube. In another televised debate broadcast on YouTube, Sirmed again spoke in defense of LGBT rights, leading her to be threatened with both death and sexual violence. The Coalition for Women in Journalism (CFWIJ) condemned an online harassment and misinformation campaign targeting Sirmed. CFWIJ Founding Director Kiran Nazish complained that the amount of propaganda and harassment of women journalists in Pakistan was unprecedented, with many inciting violence against women journalists in general and Sirmed in particular. Senior journalist member of CFWIJ, Beena Sarwar, said that while social media can be put to good use, it is being misused for negative purposes that violate fundamental rights and human dignity. In 2016, Sirmed appeared on a live television debate with conservative Islamic scholar and parliamentarian Hafiz Hamdullah. Their argument escalated, leading Hamdullah to threaten her. Later when Hamdullah's citizenship was challenged, she publicly supported him on the issue to criticize officials who saw a problem only with his citizenship and not with his other behavior. On 3 March 2020, during live TV debates on Neo News, Sirmed interrupted Khalil-ur-Rehman Qamar with the chant \\"Mera Jism Meri Marzi\\" (\\"My Body My Choice\\"). Qamar called the slogan shameful and made derogatory misogynist remarks about her and shamed her body which led to criticism and boycott of him by media fraternity. Sirmed explained her position in interviews given to Daud Khattak and DW.com. When asked whether \\"my body my choice\\" was priority for women of non-elite social classes, and whether \\"my life\\" might be better wording than \\"my body,\\" Sirmed retorted that \\"my body, my choice\\" is an issue relevant to Pakistani women across all classes, and that '‚ÄúMy body, my choice‚Äù means that no society can wage their wars at the expense of a woman's body. We ask the men not to use our bodies for their ghairat or honor. We ask them to stop killing us in the name of honor and give us the right to say no because we have the right to say no to anything that we don't feel comfortable with. We must have the right to say that we can't tolerate sexual harassment and to say no to decisions regarding our marriages by other [family members]. Our religion gives us the right to choose our life partner, so why not society?\\"  Attacks  In 2012 and again in 2018, she was shot at by unidentified gunmen and escaped unhurt.

His jewels were crafted through the lost wax technique. After centrifugal casting in 750/1000 alloy, the mould was broken and destroyed meaning only one original existed.

It is situated at the foot of Burner Mountain, at a bend in the East Fork Greenbrier River, where U.S. Route 28 intersects U.S. Route 250. It was entered onto the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. The District The District encompasses ten contributing buildings and nine contributing sites. The house known as \\"Traveller's Repose\\" was built in 1869, and is a two-story, side gabled residence. It was expanded in 1912, and in 1928. The property also includes a simple two-story, side gabled residence built in 1898, with a rear 1 1/2 story addition. Contributing outbuildings associated with the Repose include a barn (1925), well house (c. 1930), woodshed (c. 1930), cellar house (c. 1870 / 1912), corn crib (c. 1940), and storage building (c. 1920). Located nearby and also contributing are an unpainted barn (c. 1910) and garage (c. 1940). The property also includes the Yeager Cemetery. \\"Traveller's Repose\\" circa 2009 Sites associated with the American Civil War battle of October 3, 1861, known as the Battle of Greenbrier River, include four major fortifications, consisting of a series of trenches surrounding artillery emplacements. There are two additional artillery emplacements, camp / tent sites associated with Camp Bartow, and an unmarked Confederate Army cemetery containing 82 graves. Also included in the district is a section of the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike, constructed between 1838 and 1846. Traveller‚Äôs Repose =History= The historic inn known as \\"Traveller‚Äôs Repose\\" ‚Äî or \\"Travelers‚Äô Repose\\" ‚Äî for many decades served patrons transiting the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike. It was once well known as the first stagecoach stop west of Allegheny Mountain. It was owned and managed from 1845 by Andrew Yeager (1800-1861), son of area pioneer John P. Yeager, Sr (1762-1833), an immigrant from near Lancaster City, Pennsylvania who had arrived in the area around 1795. The Repose served as Pocahontas county's first post office (1847-1906). The present two-story, wood-frame farmhouse dates to 1869. The Repose owes its existence to construction of the historic turnpike, which began in 1838. By 1845, the turnpike having extended from Staunton to Weston, a traveler's inn had become an attractive proposition. The mail route through here was established in 1847, and when it did, Travelers‚Äô Repose became the post office as well. In September, 1861, a Confederate detachment encamped on the crest of Allegheny Mountain, just ten miles to the southeast. On October 3, the inn suffered crossfire during the Battle of Greenbrier River. Named Camp Bartow after the late Col. Francis S. Bartow (a Confederate commander who had died about 2 months before), the fortifications are still relatively intact. (The surrounding community would consequently be known as Bartow as well.) Later that winter, bushwhackers burned the Repose, thereby depriving both sides of its use. The Rebels, uncertain as to whether they could hold Camp Bartow in the event of another Union challenge, moved about 5 miles to the east to establish Camp Allegheny in an effort to retain control of the turnpike. On December 13, the Rebels repulsed a Union advance at this new position, thus ensuring that control of the turnpike would not be lost. But that advantage was secured at a significant cost: An unmarked grave on the property is said to contain the remains of more than 80 Confederate soldiers who died of their wounds, disease and exposure that winter. In 1869, Peter Dilly Yeager (1829-1906), Andrew's son, who had spent a portion of the war in a Union prison, rebuilt Travelers‚Äô Repose on the foundations of the earlier establishment. The refurbished lodge had 22 rooms, plus space for 28 horses in the barn. It was then variously known as the ‚ÄúYeager Hotel‚Äù and the ‚ÄúGreenbrier Hotel‚Äù. The Repose was purchased by Brown Buren Beard (1883-1969) in 1912. (He was Peter's first cousin once removed.) His daughter, Jessie Beard Powell (1915-2013), a great-great-grand daughter of John Yeager, Sr, resided at the Repose for all of her 97 years and long kept alive stories of the old days. (One of them: that the 1,200 Rebel soldiers who invaded her family's farm exacted a cost of 500 of their sugar maples which were cut down for military purposes.) Longstanding local lore asserts that Abraham Lincoln stayed here during his early journeys between Illinois and Washington, DC.Johnston, Ross B. (July 1926), ‚ÄúWest Virginia: The Switzerland of America‚Äù, Bulletin of the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, No. 66, pg 16. Among the other notables who are said (mostly without documentation) to have lodged at the Repose are Stonewall Jackson. The Repose was still supplying \\"lodging and meals\\" to travelers around 1940 when writers for the WPA visited the area.; Sponsored by the Conservation Commission of West Virginia. In 2014, after Jessie Beard Powell had died, the property was auctioned and finally passed out of the family's hands.Hamill, Geoff (2014), ‚ÄùTravelers‚Äô Repose to be sold at auction‚Äù; The Pocahontas Times (13 Aug issue). =In popular culture= *Celebrated writer Ambrose Bierce described the Repose in an autobiographical essay (‚ÄúA Bivouac to the Dead‚Äù) in 1903.Joshi, S.T. and David E.

He produced films under the name Spencer's Pictures and was an early backer of the films of Raymond Longford. He was also instrumental in the creation of \\"The Combine\\". Biography Spencer was born in Hunston, Sussex, the third son of Cornelius Cosens, farmer, and his wife Ellen. In 1892 he emigrated to British Columbia, Canada, with his brother Arthur in order to look for gold. He did a variety of jobs then in 1894 formed a company of providers with his prother Sidney at Fairview and Camp McKinney. In 1898 he was a clerk at Vernon. He began screening motions pictures and met and married Mart Stuart Huntly who became his chief projectionist and business partner. =Australia= Spencer first arrived in Australia in 1905. He opened the Great American Theatrescope at the Lyceum Theatre in Sydney and eventually turned the Lyceum as a permanent picture theatre from June 1908. He made a fortune exhibiting The Great Train Robbery in Australia and soon became the leading exhibitor in the country. He moved into production, establishing a permanent production unit under Ernest Higgins in 1908. Initially focused on documentary shorts and newsreels, he moved into funding dramatic feature films, starting with The Life and Adventures of John Vane, the Notorious Australian Bushranger (1910).Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years, Currency Press, 1989, p28. He was an early supporter of director Raymond Longford who directed The Fatal Wedding (1911) for Spencer. The success of this film enabled him to set up a ¬£10,000 studio complex in Rushcutter's Bay, Sydney, where Longford made his next couple of features. By 1912 he was the largest importer of films in Australia and helped popularise the medium in that country. In 1911, Spencer had established a company, Spencer's Pictures Ltd with a nominal capital of ¬£150,000. He went overseas for 12 months; while overseas, the board of Spencers voted to merge with Wests Ltd and Amalgamated Pictures resulting in the \\"combine\\" of Australasian Films and Union Theatres. After the box office failure of The Shepherd of the Southern Cross (1914) Spencer was unable to persuade the combine to invest in drama production, and stepped back his involvement in the local industry. Several of his films were released in the US by Sawyers Pictures; they were given new titles such as The Convict Hero, The Bushranger's Bride, Nell Gwynne, The Bandit Terrors of Australia and The Queen of the Smugglers.http://lantern.mediahist.org/catalog/motionp09moti_0377 In 1918 the Spencers were sued by the Combine for an alleged breach of contract. They settled out of court and left Australia. Death Spencer returned to Canada with his wife, where he bought several ranches in British Columbia in Chilcotin County. In September 1930, he was unpacking a truck full of groceries at one of his ranches along with his foreman, Walter Stoddart, and a grocer, Edward Smith. Spencer grabbed a gun and shot Smith in the back and then Stoddart, before fleeing. Smith died of his wounds; Stoddart managed to drive away and was rescued. Spencer went missing in the aftermath of the shooting; eventually his body was found in a lake, where he had drowned himself. He left behind an estate worth $346,059.

It opened in 1870 as an institution for the care and education of children with learning problems. By 1909 there were 662 children in residence. Following new legislation in 1913, adults were also admitted. By the time of the introduction of the National Health Service in 1948 the hospital had 886 patients, and by the 1960s there were over 1,000 patients. Following legislation in the 1980s, the patients were relocated in the community, and the hospital closed in 1996. The building was acquired by Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College to provide Islamic education for girls. The main part of the hospital is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and its west lodge is listed at Grade II. History The hospital was built between 1868 and 1873, and designed by the local architect E. G. Paley. Its original name was \\"Royal Albert Asylum for idiots and imbeciles of the seven northern counties\\". An additional building, the Winmarleigh Recreation Hall was built at the rear of the hospital and designed by Paley, Austin and Paley (E. G. Paley in partnership with his son, Henry, and with Hubert Austin). In 1898‚Äì1901, following the death of E. G. Paley, the practice (now Austin and Paley) designed a new south wing, named the Ashton wing. The hospital was established under the Lunacy Act 1845, at a time when there was little understanding of the difference between learning disability and mental illness, to provide care and education for children with learning disabilities. It took patients from the seven northern counties of England between the ages of 6 and 15. It was a voluntary hospital, whose financial provision came entirely from public subscription. The foundation stone was laid in 1868. The first patients entered the hospital in December 1870, and in August 1871 the first girls were admitted. By 1874 it had 196 patients. In 1884 the hospital was renamed as the \\"Royal Albert Asylum for the Care, Education and Training of Idiots, Imbeciles and Weak-Minded children and Young Persons of the Northern Counties\\". By 1909 there were 662 patients in residence, 85 per cent of whom were aged under 15. During the following year the hospital was renamed again, this time to \\"The Royal Albert Institution, Lancaster\\". Following the Mental Deficiency Act 1913, the nature of the hospital changed, as it was determined that no more than 10 per cent of its patients should be under the age of 16. In 1948 the hospital became part of the National Health Service, and its name was changed to \\"Royal Albert Hospital\\". By this time it had 886 patients, of whom 45 per cent were aged over 35, and only 12 per cent were under 15. In 1958 two new blocks were built, each containing 54 beds, to accommodate the increasing number of patients. By the middle of the 1960s the hospital contained over 1,000 patients. From the 1980s, Care in the Community legislation led to the relocation of patients into the community, so that by 1990 only about 500 patients were still resident. Further relocation of patients led to the closure of the hospital in 1996. The building was acquired by Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College for use as an educational establishment for Muslim girls. Architecture =Exterior= The main building is constructed in sandstone with ashlar dressings and bands of red sandstone from St Bees. The roofs are in green slate from Coniston. Its architectural style is Gothic Revival. Hartwell and Pevsner in the Buildings of England series describe its appearance as that of a h√¥tel de ville (French town hall). The main front of the building is symmetrical, in two storeys with attics and a basement. The roofs are hipped, and incorporate dormer windows. The front consists of a central block of six bays, with eleven-bay wings on each side. In the centre of each wing is a three-bay canted projection, and at both ends is a wider three-bay pavilion under a separate roof. In the wings, most of the windows in the ground floor are pairs of lancets under an arched hoodmould, and most of the windows in the upper storey have two lights under a flat lintel. The windows in the projections and pavilions are more ornate, most of them consisting of a triple lancet under an oculus. The dormers contain cross casement windows, and on the summits of the dormers are finials. In the ground floor of the central block is a porch with three arches carried on red sandstone columns. Above the porch in the first floor is a canted oriel window. Behind the porch and rising above it is a three-stage tower. In the middle stage is a clock face flanked by statues in Longridge stone of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, carved by Bridgeman of Lichfield. The statues stand in an arcade of trefoiled arches. At the four corners of the tower are turrets, and the roof of the tower is steeply pitched, containing three tiers of gabled dormers. To the rear of the building are two further wings, each comprising eight bays with three-bay pavilions at their ends. =Interior= Inside the central block is a triple arch behind which is an imperial staircase with an ornate wrought iron balustrade. The roof timbers are exposed, and the hall is lit from above. Beyond this is a five-bay hall with two-light transomed windows. The windows contain small pieces of stained glass depicting badges of the benefactors of the hospital. Also in this hall are galleries. =West lodge= West lodge On Ashton Road at the entrance to the drive to the former hospital is a lodge, built in about 1873. It is also constructed in sandstone with ashlar dressings, red sandstone bands, and green slate steeply pitched roofs, and is in Gothic Revival style. The main part of the lodge is in two storeys, and contains a wide arch for the carriageway, and a smaller narrower arch for pedestrians. In the upper storey are three trefoiled single-light windows. The roof is hipped and carries lead finials. To the right of this is a chimney with bands of red sandstone. On the right of the building is a short lower wing with a coped gable. On the gable side is a two-light stair window above a quatrefoil, and another two-light window. Facing the road is a canted bay containing mullioned windows. The lodge is entered from the pedestrian walkway. Present day The main part of the hospital was designed as a Grade II* listed building on 30 November 1970, the same date the west lodge was listed at Grade II. Since 1996 the building has been used as the Jamea Al Kauthar Islamic College, an academic establishment aiming to educate girls over the age of eleven in a safe, secure, happy and Islamic environment\\". Originating with 60 girls, as of 2011 it has about 400 residential students on its roll. The students attend Islamic theology courses in the morning in the college, and in the afternoons travel to Preston Sixth Form College to study other subjects.

It declared the Union of South Africa to be a \\"sovereign independent state\\" and explicitly adopted the Statute of Westminster into South African law. It also removed any remaining power of the Imperial Parliament to legislate for South Africa, and ended the King's direct involvement in the granting of Royal Assent. The Statute of Westminster applied to South Africa without needing ratification from its Parliament (unlike the case in Australia and New Zealand), so the Status Act was not legally necessary to establish South Africa's sovereign independence. It was, however, seen as a symbolic action by the Pact government of Prime Minister JBM Hertzog, coming as it did shortly before the merger of his National Party with Jan Smuts's South African Party to form the United Party. The Status of the Union Act was repealed by the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, 1961, which ended South Africa's membership of the Commonwealth of Nations and transformed it into a republic. Provisions The Status Act incorporated the Statute of Westminster into South African law as if it were an act of the South African Parliament. Sections 7 to 10 of the Statute were omitted because they dealt with matters specific to other Dominions of the British Commonwealth. The act further declared that \\"the Parliament of the Union shall be the sovereign legislative power in and over the Union,\\" and that no act of the British Parliament would extend to South Africa unless extended by an act of the South African Parliament. This went further than the Statute of Westminster, which allowed the British Parliament to legislate for the Dominions at their request and with their consent. With respect to the executive, the Status Act prescribed that the King, when exercising his executive powers in regard to South Africa, was required to act on the advice of the South African Prime Minister and Cabinet only. This made explicit what had previously been a constitutional convention. The Status Act also altered the law governing the granting of the Royal Assent. Originally, the Governor- General had three options when a bill was sent to him by Parliament: to assent to it, to withhold his assent (i.e. veto it), or to reserve it for the signification of the King's pleasure. Reservation meant sending it to the King for a decision, which might be taken on the advice of the British cabinet. The Status Act removed this power of reservation, requiring the Governor-General to either sign or veto each bill. It also removed the King's power to disallow (i.e. veto) an act within a year after the Governor-General had assented to it. While it made the executive and legislative branches of the South African government completely independent of Britain, the Status Act did not affect the judicial branch. Appeals to the Privy Council from the Appellate Division remained possible until 1950.

Context Politically, the English county of Shropshire was predominantly Royalist at the start of the civil war. Of the county's twelve Members at the Long Parliament called in 1640, eight would fight on the Royalist side and four for Parliament. Control of the area was important to the King as Shropshire was a gateway to predominantly Royalist Wales as well as to keep in contact with the north-western counties and the western port links with Ireland. Parliamentary control of Shropshire was achieved after the capture of its last Royalist garrison by Parliament in 1646. First English Civil War =1642= The week after raising his standard at Nottingham, Charles I proceeded into Shropshire, arriving in Wellington on 19 September. On 20 September he issued the Wellington Declaration promising to preserve the Protestant religion, laws, and liberties of his subjects, and the privileges of Parliament, and inspected his troops below the Wrekin. From Wellington he marched to Shrewsbury, where he was joined by his two sons, the Prince of Wales and James, Prince Rupert, and great numbers of noblemen and gentlemen, and established a mint in the town. He remained there until 12 October, when he marched to Bridgnorth, and from there advanced to Edge Hill, in Warwickshire, where the first pitched battle of the First Civil War was fought. =1643= In January the king formally appointed Sir Francis Ottley as governor of Shrewsbury. In counteraction to the king, the Parliamentarians, including some Shropshire gentry, formed their Committee of Association for Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire in April 1643. In August Parliament garrisoned Wem. It was threatened by Royalist forces under Lord Capel, who were forced to retreat by a Parliamentary army arriving from Chester. On 28 December 1643 Tong Castle was captured by Parliamentarian troops from Eccleshall, Staffordshire. =1644= On 13 March 1644 Hopton Castle was captured by the Royalists. The Parliamentary commander, Colonel More, did not surrender until after the final assault. The Royalist commander Sir Michael Woodhouse, at his digression (his prerogative under the laws of war as they were practised at that time), decided not to grant the majority of his prisoners quarter and they were killed by their captors. However the Parliamentary side believed for some months that prior to the surrender terms had been agreed which included the sparing of the lives of the garrison and so the killings were a breach of the law of war. It was not until October that year the Colonel More's account was published, setting the record straight, but not in time to prevent Parliamentary propaganda vilifying the Royalists for their alleged Perfidy. On 3 April Longford Hall was captured by the Royalists. On 6 April Tong Castle was captured by the Royalists under the command of Prince Rupert. In June the king was in Shrewsbury during the campaign that led to the Battle of Cropredy Bridge. The same month Oswestry was taken from the Royalists by the Earl of Denbigh. The inhabitants gave ¬£500 to prevent the Parliamentary soldiers from plundering. In July Oswestry was besieged by the Royalists under Colonel Marrowe, but it was relieved by Sir Thomas Middleton, who took Lord Newport's eldest son, Francis, and 200 men prisoners. By August, Prince Rupert had Sir Francis Ottley replaced as royal governor of Shrewsbury by Sir Fulke Hunckes,Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.245. who, becoming locally unpopular, was later that year replaced by Sir Michael Earnley. In early October, Sir William Vaughan, the Royalist governor of Shrawardine Castle, was captured by Major-General Thomas Mytton while receiving the sacrament in Shrawardine church. He was allowed back into the castle on pretext of negotiating the garrison's surrender, but tricked Mytton by raising the drawbridge and broke his parole.Thomas, W. L. \\"Vaughan, Sir William\\", ODNB, 1899 By the winter Vaughan was appointed general of Shropshire, and quartered his regiment around the county, leaving his parson brother James in charge of Shrawardine. =1645= In February Apley House was taken by the Parliamentarians under Sir John Price, when Sir William and Sir Thomas Whitmore, Sir Francis Ottley, and about 60 men, were made prisoners. On 9 February the Royalist garrison in Shrewsbury Castle was surprised. The town's governor, Sir Michael Earnley, was slain, 15 pieces of ordnance, about 60 gentlemen, and 200 soldiers, were taken by Mytton, the Parliamentarian Governor of Wem. On 23 February Parliament captured Shrewsbury, and in the same month they also captured Benthall Hall from the Royalists. On 10 June there was a battle at Stokesay, near Ludlow. The Royalists were defeated, and Sir William Croft was slain by the Parliamentarians. Stokesay Castle was captured, and Caus Castle and Shrawardine also fell to Parliament the same month. On 4 and 5 July, Sir William Vaughan won two significant victories, resulting in the relief of the besieged garrison of High Ercall. =1646= After a one-month siege the Royalist garrison of Bridgnorth Castle surrendered to the Parliamentarians. On 28 March the Royalist garrison of High Ercall, under Sir Vincent Corbet, capitulated. The articles of surrender allowed the garrison to depart for Worcester, albeit without their weapons. On 9 July the Royalist garrison of Ludlow surrendered to Sir William Brereton. =1647= Fear of Royalist uprisings lead to Parliament ordering Shrewsbury re- garrisoned. Third English Civil War =1651= At 3 o'clock in the morning of 4 September Charles II and the Earl of Derby arrived at White Ladies Priory, fleeing from the fatal battle of Worcester. Charles had his hair cut off, and was disguised in the clothes of the resident Pendrills. Hence he was conducted to Boscobel House, where he was concealed during the night, and in the day time he hid himself with Colonel Careless in the Royal Oak. From Boscobel he was conducted by the five faithful brothers, the Pendrills, to Mr. Whitgrave's house, at Moseley, in Staffordshire. Interregnum =1651= On 15 October 1651 Captain John Benbow, uncle to the renowned admiral, was shot on the Shrewsbury Castle's green. =1654= Sir Thomas Harries, in an abortive royalist uprising, fails to capture Shrewsbury Castle in a surprise attack.

Life He was second son of Robert Beatson, Esq., of Kilrie, Fife County, Scotland, and a nephew or cousin of Robert Beatson. He obtained a cadetship in 1775, and was appointed to an ensigncy in the Madras infantry, 21 Nov. 1776. He served as an engineer officer in the war with Hyder Ali, although he appears never to have belonged to the engineers. As lieutenant, he served with the Guides in Lord Cornwallis's campaigns against Tippu Sultan; and eight years after, as a field officer, was surveyor-general with the army under Lieutenant-general Harris, which captured Seringapatam in 1799. He attained the rank of colonel 1 Jan. 1801. After leaving India, Beatson was governor of St. Helena from 1808 to 1813. The island, which then belonged to the East India Company, was in a very unsatisfactory condition. The scanty population had been nearly swept off by a measles epidemic a short time previously, and, although recruited by emigrants from England and by Chinese coolies, was in a wretched state. The acts of the home authorities in suppressing the spirit traffic and other matters gave rise to great discontent, resulting in a mutiny in 1811, which was put down by the firmness of Beatson, who also introduced a better system of cultivation and many other beneficial measures. After his return to England, he devoted much attention to experiments in agriculture at Knole farm and Henley in Frant, Sussex, near Tunbridge Wells. He became major-general July 1810, lieutenant-general June 1814, and died 15 October 1830. Family On 28 December 1805 he was married to Davidson Reid (sic) (1787-1865) who was 18 at the time of marriage. She returned to family members in Edinburgh after his death and is buried in the churchyard of St John's on Princes Street.Grave of Davidson Reid, St Johns, Edinburgh She was born in Kinghorn in Fife the daughter of David Reid and Jean Renny. They had 13 children. Works Beatson was the author of the following works: *An Account of the Isles of France and Bourbon, 1794, which was never printed, and remains in manuscript at the British Museum (Add. MS. 13868). *A View of the Origin and Conduct of the War against Tippoo Sultaun (London, 1800, 4to). *Tracts relative to the Island of St. Helena, with views (London, 1816, 4to) **other smaller works on the island besides contributions to the St. Helena Monthly Register *A New System of Cultivation without Lime or Dung, or Summer Fallowing, as practised at Knole Farm, Sussex (London, 1820, 8vo); **various papers on improvements in agriculture.

Synopsis The plot concerns the rivalry between two neighboring sheep stations, Enderby and Waratah. This version includes the subplot about the bushranger Ben Hall which was not used when the play was adapted again in 1933. Cast *Olive Wilton as Violet Enderby *Bert Bailey as Archie McPherson *Edmund Duggan as Ben Hall *J.H. Nunn as James Harrington *Rutland Beckett as Dudley Harrington *George Cross as Tom Bathurst *George Mackenzie as Nick Harvey *Temple Harrison as Nulla Nulla *Edwin Campbell as Billy *Eugenie Duggan Production Filming took place in June 1910 with cast from the acting company of theatre producer William Anderson at the Kings Theatre Melbourne, many of whom had just appeared in The Man from Outback, also by Bailey and Duggan.\\"ANDERSON'S DRAMATIC COMPANY.\\" Barrier Miner (Broken Hill) 12 Jan 1910: 3 Theatre star Olive Wilton played the lead role, with Bailey and Duggan in support. One of her leading men, George Cross, later became a casting director for Cinesound Productions. Shooting took place in Ivanhoe and other surrounding districts of Melbourne entirely outdoors, even interior scenes. \\"Under these circumstances brilliant sunshine was the main factor to be wooed\\", recalled Olive Wilton. \\"It seemed impossible to acquire sufficient light without a constant battle against high wind, which made these interior scenes a nightmare, with hair and clothes blowing in all directions.\\" However the fact it was a movie allowed the demonstration of scenes only discussed in the play, such as Nulla escaping the bushranger's cave. Other sequences praised by reviewers included the abduction of the squatter's daughter, the pursuit by Ben Hall and his gang, Ben Hall's last stand, the dash through the cataract, the farm house rope bridge, the waterfall, the shearing match, and a champion stock whip artist. It was advertised as being the most expensive movie ever made in Australia to that date, but this is unlikely. Reception Screenings were often accompanied by a lecture. The movie was a popular success at the box office, breaking records in Sydney and Melbourne, and enjoying long runs throughout the country. It achieved a cinema release in England, one of the first Australian films to do so. Bert Bailey and Ken G. Hall tried to track down a copy of the movie when Hall directed a version in 1933 but was unsuccessful. No known copies of it exist today, and it is considered a lost film.
