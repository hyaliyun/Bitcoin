The toponym, first recorded in 1540, is of Old Norse origin, from skírr \\"bright\\" and holmr \\"water-meadow\\", and so means \\"bright water-meadow\\". Skyreholme was historically in the township of Appletreewick in the large ancient parish of Burnsall in the West Riding of Yorkshire. In the early 19th century the hamlet had a substantial population (234 in the 1841 census). The main industry was a cotton and calico mill. To serve this population a chapel of ease was built in 1837. The chapel closed in 1897, but from 1867 the building was also used as a school, which continued until 1967.

Both schools currently compete in the NCAA Division II level, and are members of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). Emporia State currently leads the series a 56–52–2. The Turnpike Tussle is the second-oldest active NCAA Division II rivalry. Prior to joining the MIAA (Washburn in 1989, Emporia State 1991), both schools have competed in the same conferences with the exception of 1935 to 1940 when Washburn was a member of the Missouri Valley Conference.  History  Emporia State University opened its doors in 1863 as the Kansas State Normal School, with Washburn University opening its doors two years later in 1865 as the Lincoln College. Washburn's football program began in 1891 and Emporia State began two years later, with the first football game between the two schools taking place on November 4, 1899 in Topeka where Emporia State won 11–0. After a one-year hiatus, the rivalry began again playing annually until 1942 when World War II took place. During those 42 seasons, Washburn started out with a strong lead in the series winning eight of the next nine games before Emporia State took the majority of the wins those years. The teams tied six times prior to WWII. Ten years after World War II finished, the Kansas Turnpike was completed, forming a 58 mile distance between the two schools and led the two schools to name their rivalry series the \\"Turnpike Tussle\\" in 1956. The series winning streaks began alternating around every five years or so after the War until 1991 when Emporia State began the longest winning streak in the series – 11 games from 1991 to 2001. The turn of the century brought new leadership for both teams. In 2001, Emporia State promoted offensive coordinator Dave Wiemers as their head coach, who later resigned in December 2006. On December 28, 2001, Washburn hired Craig Schurig as the next head coach, who remains the current head coach as of 2018.

It was in use from 1846 to 1934. The property is owned by Maitland City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 7 March 2014.  History  As the colony of New South Wales expanded into the Hunter Valley in the early 19th century, with Maitland was strategically positioned on the Hunter River, it soon became a booming new township for commerce and trade between the region and Sydney. Known then as Wallis Plains, the establishment and success of the shipping trade along the river resulted in the expansion of the district as land grants were allocated amongst the settlers, many of whom were Jewish entrepreneurs. Bringing their business skills from Sydney, and often from their native England, the Jewish colonists soon became prosperous leaders of the burgeoning community and formed a strong core for the small Jewish community of the region. Adherence to tradition was often used by colonists to establish a community and connect people to a new place. As followers of the Orthodox faith, the Jewish community soon established a dedicated burial ground on which to observe the burial rites and customs of the religion. In keeping with Jewish tradition, a parcel of land was acquired in 1846 beyond the outskirts of the township and in an area isolated from neighbouring residences. Attained \\"upon trust for a Burial Place for the internment (sic) of deceased members of the Jewish Religion\\"Wilton, 2010 the first burial for the cemetery took place in 1849 for young Jane Cohen, an 11-year old girl who had succumbed to the scarlet fever disease epidemic of the time. As the strength of the Jewish community grew in the region, so too did the number of burials at the cemetery. A cottage structure was established on the site to receive the dead and where rites and prayer rituals could take place prior to interment. The rarity of a dedicated Jewish cemetery north of Sydney also bought Jewish people from afar for interment. The strength of the Jewish community in the mid-to-late 19th century is also reflected in the erection of the Maitland Synagogue in 1879. However, when the synagogue ceased functioning as a place of worship in 1898, it was evident that the presence of the Jewish community in Maitland was wavering. As the numbers of the community slowly dwindled, so too did the number of burials occurring at the cemetery. After the last burial in 1934, the cemetery was considered to be \\"full\\". As the years passed, the cemetery experienced periods of neglect. The cottage was removed, occasional floods swept through the site and vegetation slowly took control. Renewed community interest in the historic site has evolved in recent decades and the cemetery was reconsecrated in 1979. Ownership was transferred to Maitland City Council in 1992 and one final burial took place in 2010. Following this, the cemetery was officially closed.  Description  Located from the centre of Maitland, the Jewish Cemetery is sited at the end of a narrow unsealed laneway in a rural field landscape. In keeping with Jewish tradition, the cemetery was established beyond the outskirts of the township and the graves positioned to face west away from the neighbouring settlement and its residents. Bounded by a post and wire fence (which replaced an earlier timber paling fence), the cemetery contains 53 burial sites. Positioned in four rows, the graves are laid out in a north-south direction with the earlier burials at its highest point while the later graves continue down the sloping site. A row of children's graves is positioned along the northern boundary. Of the 53 grave sites, 46 headstones remain in varying states of repair. Dating mostly from 1849 to 1909, the Hebrew and English inscriptions may have faded with age but the form and ornamentation of the monuments indicate the importance of adherence to the Jewish faith during the interment process. Mostly discreet in nature, the monuments reflect the Jewish tradition that \\"in death, all are equal\\". = Condition = As at 18 July 2013, of the 53 grave sites, 46 headstones remain in varying states of repair. Dating mostly from 1849 to 1909, many of the Hebrew and English inscriptions have faded with age and weather exposure. Some headstones have also collapsed but recent conservation works (2013-14) has seen the restoration of many of the stones. The rural nature of the site is reflected in the grassed condition of the cemetery. However, this receives regular maintenance. The post and wire fence enclosing the cemetery allows neighbouring livestock to graze the outskirts of the cemetery which could cause subsidence or collapse of the outlying monuments. The current fence replaced an earlier timber paling fence which could be a replacement enclosure at some future point in time. Of the 53 burial sites within the cemetery, the retention of 46 headstone monuments makes the cemetery the most intact dedicated Jewish cemetery in NSW. = Modifications and dates = * 1846 - cemetery established * 1849 - first burial took place * s - general repairs * 1934 - last burial took place * s - cottage was removed/demolished or collapsed * - monument restoration following floods * mid 20th century - original timber paling fence removed * 1978 - renewed maintenance of site involved vegetation clearance * 2010 - new burial took place  Heritage listing  Maitland Jewish Cemetery is of state heritage significance as the earliest and largest dedicated Jewish cemetery in NSW. With 53 burials in total (dating, in the most part, from 1849 to 1909), the cemetery retains 46 of its original headstones which makes this site the most intact dedicated Jewish cemetery in the state. Established in 1846 by prominent Jewish settlers of the Maitland region, the cemetery served the Orthodox Jewish community of the surrounding Hunter Valley region and the broader Jewish community of NSW. The cemetery is a physical record of the Jewish community in the region and its survival demonstrates the ongoing public interest and connection to the place. Of the three dedicated Jewish cemeteries established in NSW, Maitland Jewish Cemetery is a rare surviving example that demonstrates the traditions and rituals of life and death in the Jewish faith. The location of the cemetery, the positioning of the grave sites and the form, design and style of the monuments demonstrate the community's adherence to their faith and the importance of observing traditions when laying their dead to rest. Maitland Jewish Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 7 March 2014 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Maitland Jewish Cemetery is of state heritage significance as the earliest and largest dedicated Jewish cemetery in NSW. Established in 1846, the cemetery contains 53 burial sites and, with 46 headstone monuments remaining on site, it is the most intact of the three dedicated Jewish cemeteries in NSW. The early establishment of a dedicated burial ground is a tradition of the Orthodox Jewish faith and the Maitland Jewish Cemetery played an important part in the development of the Jewish community in the region. The location of the cemetery, positioning of the grave sites and the design and ornamentation of the headstones also reflects the traditions of the Orthodox Jewish faith and the community's commitment to their religion. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Maitland Jewish Cemetery has a particular association with the prominent Jewish settlers of the Hunter Valley region. At the core of the Jewish community of the Maitland area in the mid-19th century were a number of wealthy and influential Jewish businessmen who played an important role in the development of the region. The prominence of these particular people is reflected in the early establishment of a dedicated Jewish cemetery and associated synagogue in the region. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Positioned in a rural landscape on the outskirts of the town, the Maitland Jewish Cemetery is a small regional burial ground that reflects the traditions of the Orthodox Jewish faith. A discreetly located site, the cemetery contains a number of modest monuments that demonstrates \\"that, in death, all are equal and ostentation is out of place\\". The layout, monument form and ornamentation suggest a deliberate observance to the traditions of the Orthodox Jewish faith. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Maitland Jewish Cemetery is of state heritage significance for its social value to the Jewish community of Maitland as well as its broader connection to the Jewish community of NSW. Cemeteries demonstrate the rituals of life and death and reflect how a community manages its grief. Furthermore, the importance of a dedicated Jewish cemetery to the broader Jewish community is reflected in its use by the people of Maitland as well as those from afar who were interred at the site. The cemetery is a physical record of the Jewish community in the region and its survival demonstrates the ongoing public interest and connection to the place. This contemporary social value is demonstrated by the establishment of the Friends of the Maitland Jewish Cemetery to maintain the site and the ongoing release of research and written material about the history of the cemetery. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Maitland Jewish Cemetery has some potential to reveal further information about the traditional burial practices and rituals of the Orthodox Jewish faith in NSW in the mid-19th century. Although the remaining monuments are in a varying state of repair, further analysis of their form, design style and use of liturgical symbolism could provide further insight into how death was celebrated by the Orthodox Jewish faith. Cemeteries are also a valuable genealogical resource and provide evidence of the social history of the Jewish faith in the Hunter Valley region. There is some potential that the archaeological remains of the cottage building could be investigated further. The likely position of the building in the south western corner is evident but no formal archaeological investigation of the site has been undertaken. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Maitland Jewish Cemetery is of state heritage significance as a rare example of a dedicated Jewish burial ground in NSW. Many multi-denominational cemeteries contain Jewish sections but only three dedicated Jewish cemeteries have ever been established in NSW - Maitland in 1846, Goulburn Jewish Cemetery in 1848 and Raphael's Ground in Lidcombe in 1867. Of the three cemeteries, only those at Maitland and Goulburn remain today. (Raphael's Ground was disbanded and monuments relocated to Rookwood Cemetery in 1970.) As the largest and most intact of the two Jewish cemeteries in NSW (Maitland contains 53 grave sites and 46 headstones while Goulburn has 35 burials and retains only 11 headstones), Maitland Jewish Cemetery has state heritage significance for its rarity value. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Maitland Jewish Cemetery is a representative example of a small regional burial ground that reflects the traditional burial rites and rituals of a religious faith. The design and form of the monuments reflect the masonry practices of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the liturgical inscriptions demonstrate the traditional symbolism of the Jewish faith.

Its name honors Army explorer George B. McClellan who visited the area in 1853. McClellan Peak forms part of the south rim of The Enchantments lake basin within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and it belongs to the Stuart Range which is subset of the Cascade Range. McClellan Peak is situated 1.29 miles east of Little Annapurna which is its nearest higher neighbor. Precipitation runoff drains into tributaries of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Early life and education  Akers was born in Charlotte, Texas, and attended the University of Texas at Austin. He later graduated from Columbia Law School.  Career  Enlisting in the United States Navy in 1940, he served in the Pacific War as lieutenant commander of a PT boat, and was awarded a Silver Star and two Presidential citations. He was one of four officers who became the fictionalized heroes of William L. White's 1942 novel They Were Expendable, based on his Squadron 3's evacuation of General Douglas MacArthur and President Manuel Quezon from Corregidor to Australia. When John Ford filmed the story, Akers served as a technical advisor. During the Korean War, Akers served as Deputy Assistant Secretary and Deputy United States Under Secretary of the Air Force. He was director of the New York City office of the State Department of Commerce until 1958. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat in the East Side 17th District three times: in 1954, 1956 and 1958. Akers had first met John F. Kennedy in World War II. Akers ran the motor torpedo boat training squadron in Melville, Rhode Island where Kennedy trained. Kennedy campaigned for Akers in the latter's 1956 bid for Congress, and Akers served as executive chairman of the NY Citizens' Committee for Kennedy–Johnson in 1960. After winning the presidency, Kennedy appointed Akers Ambassador to New Zealand in June 1961, where he represented the United States until August 25, 1963. During his time in New Zealand, he lobbied the ANZUS to send advisory personnel to Vietnam. Akers returned to the United States, intending to take over the job of Chief of Protocol from Angier Biddle Duke. After the President's assassination, Akers returned to practicing law. He later worked as an advisor on the Robert F. Kennedy 1968 presidential campaign, and was present at the Ambassador Hotel when Kennedy was assassinated.  Personal life  Akers was married to Jane Pope, the daughter of architect John Russell Pope. Akers and his wife had two daughters: Andra Akers, an actress, and Ellery Akers, a poet and naturalist. Akers died of a heart attack on April 1, 1976, in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, aged 61.

Her father was a baker and confectioner in Waterford. After his death when Mernin was young, the children were raised by his family in Dungarvan. In the 1910s, Mernin worked as a typist in a number of Dublin companies, and by 1914 she was a shorthand typist in Dublin Castle at the garrison adjutant's office. She was a member of the Keating branch of the Gaelic League, and through this her cousin, Piaras Béaslaí, introduced her to Michael Collins in 1918. From 1919 she began working for Collins as an intelligence agent. She used her position in Dublin Castle to obtain important documents, and in 1920 intelligence on the British intelligence officers and the auxiliary police. Under the alias of \\"Little Gentleman\\" or \\"Lt. G.\\", she was one of Collin's most important agents, so much so many believed that the Little Gentleman was a British intelligence officer.

The original design was attributed to Edward Charles Close, with later additions by Edmund Blacket and John Horbury Hunt and built from 1837 to 1875 by Edward Charles Close and James Sherwood. The precinct also includes the St. James' rectory and parish hall (formerly schoolhouse). The property is vested in the Trustees of Church Property for the Diocese of Newcastle. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 January 2017.  History  =Pre- and post-contact aboriginal custodianship= The place now called Morpeth, situated on the Hunter River some 29 water miles from Newcastle, appears to have been occupied by the Wonnarua (or Wanaruah) people, and to have been known to them as Illulong, Illalaung or Illullaung. They may have given the title Waywerryghein to the landing place that later evolved into Queen's Wharf, while the ridge to the south of the river may have been Baybeg. The Wonnarua seem to have called the river Coonanbarra. The site of West Maitland may have been called Boyen, while that of East Maitland may have been called Cooloogooloogheit.'Memorandum of E.C. Close', in Australian Town and Country Journal, 12 January 1878, p.8 =European settlement= The European settlement ultimately called Morpeth was privately founded in the early 1820s by Lieutenant Edward Charles Close. Morpeth, or Green Hills as it was then known, was at the time at the head of navigation for ocean-going vessels from Sydney and other ports proceeding up-river from Newcastle; and although vessels of lighter draught could navigate as far as Wallis Plains (also called Molly Morgan's, now known as Maitland), the distance by land was so much shorter than that by water as to give Green Hills the advantage as a landing place. Even after the completion of a road between Newcastle and Wallis Plains, the river remained the main artery of communication. Morpeth was the major port of the Hunter Region, New England and North-Western NSW. Until the 1880s it also served the Darling Downs in Queensland. The great majority of goods and passengers were handled at Morpeth, with the local customs house playing an important role. Wool was sometimes despatched direct to England, while large numbers of immigrants also passed through the port on their way up-country. Not until the introduction in 1889 of differential railway freight rates, which from 1901 deliberately made it cheaper to send wool to Sydney than to Morpeth or Newcastle, did the port begin to decline. This placated Sydney merchants; undercut coastal shipping; and helped to pay for the very expensive Homebush to Waratah railway (now part of the Main Northern line). Lieutenant Close, a veteran of the Peninsular War of 1807 - 1814, was born in Rangamatti, Bengal, on 12 March 1790. He and his mother some seven years later removed to England, where at the age of 18 he joined the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot to defend his country against Napoleon Bonaparte. Having survived several significant engagements, including the great battles of Albuera and Talavera, in 1817 Close arrived in Sydney with a detachment of his Regiment. In 1821, Close decided to sell his Commission and was promised 1,200 acres of land at the Illalaung, or Green Hills (now Morpeth). Morpeth was a private town and long remained so. The failure by Sir Thomas Brisbane to reserve the site for a government town was condemned by John Dunmore Lang. In assuming control of so valuable a site, as well as much other land besides, Close had undoubtedly made the most of his military connections. These came under strain when, as a magistrate, he helped investigate the alleged murder of Aboriginal prisoners by a mounted force under the command of Lieutenant Nathaniel Lowe. Close so frustrated the enquiry that the Governor, Sir Ralph Darling, with whom Close had already clashed when Darling had tried to resume the site of Morpeth for inadequate compensation, suggested that Close resign as a magistrate. Close, much offended, acted on the suggestion, but maintained an undiminished reputation throughout the Colony; yet his role in the Lowe affair, one of considerable importance in the legal history of NSW, and particularly with regard to the question of the rights of Aboriginal people before the law, pending further research must remain controversial. The first subdivision (1834) of the township of Morpeth, situated on an east–west ridge overlooking the river, allowed Close to donate land on both sides of the intersection of High Street and Tank Street. Here would eventually be built a church, rectory (in those days often called a parsonage), stone-built parish schoolhouse and schoolteacher's house. The church and parish schoolhouse, sited so as to form a focal point and entry for the embryonic township when viewed from the approach roads from all four cardinal directions, and no doubt to enable the identification of the township much in the style of an English village, were paid for by Close, while the rectory was partly paid for by him. Conrad Martens' 1841 sketch of Morpeth demonstrates the success of Close's vision. Close was himself a capable artist whose paintings and sketches, once attributed to Sophia Campbell, are held in the National Library of Australia. By way of preparation, Close had built a two-storied temporary schoolhouse- cum-chapel some little distance to the east. Not long after the establishment in 1862 of the government-sponsored Morpeth National School, the parish school closed; the building was then used as the parish hall. The local population was small, hardly requiring a church; Close, however, believed that a village must have a place of worship. In addition, he had a very personal reason for the establishment of a local place of worship: the satisfaction of an oath, made during the Battle of Albuera (May 1811) with his comrades falling on every side, that if his life were spared he would one day build a Church to the Glory of God. In January 1837 the foundation stone was laid by Edward Close Jnr., the 13-year-old son of E. C. Close. It is probable that the building was in fact designed by E. C. Close, who as military engineer at Newcastle had undertaken some important harbour and other works, including the designing of a house for the keeper of the coal-fired harbour beacon. Close's skill in designing this extraordinary structure, reminiscent of his place of birth, proves his architectural skill, while his clear pride and interest in St. James' is suggestive. It is, however, also possible that the church was designed by Lieutenant Thomas Owen, who like Close had experience as Government engineer at Newcastle, and had designed St Thomas' Anglican Church (1828) at Port Macquarie. In December 1840 the church was consecrated by Bishop William Broughton under the patronage of St. James. By this time Close had dedicated land some distance to the south of the church for use as the St. James' graveyard. This was later expanded to provide for Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, Methodist and non-denominational burials. In 1848 Bishop William Tyrrell, first Bishop of Newcastle, arrived from England via Sydney, and took advantage of Close's ready hospitality in using Morpeth as a base for his first efforts within the newly-created Diocese of Newcastle. So convenient did he find the locality, and so superior did he think the modest St. James' to his Cathedral, the larger but tumbledown convict-built Christ Church Cathedral high on the hill at Newcastle, that he chose Morpeth for his place of residence, effectively making it the centre of the Diocese. This centrality persisted during Tyrrell's lifetime, as it was to do until the partial completion of the first stage of Christ Church Cathedral in 1902 and the 1920s relocation of the Bishops to Newcastle. Tyrrell initially lived in the St. James' Rectory; and it may have been at this time that, as argued by Stuart Read of the Garden Historical Society of Australia, he planted in its grounds a still-extant camellia bush from John Macarthur's Camden Park. Tyrrell later moved to E.C. Close's nearby home, called Closebourne,SHR No 5045646 renamed as the Bishop's Palace and afterwards as Bishopscourt. In the 1890s, Bishop George Henry Stanton planted an avenue of trees providing a visual link between the house and the church. The rectory grounds originally included a paddock for the parson's horse. Much of this area was later sold, considerably reducing the extent of the property. Close's influence on St. James' was reflected in other ways also, such as the dedication of a prominent marble wall monument to his friend Captain Rinaldo Sheberras (originally Sceberras) of the 80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers), one of several Officers and Other Ranks who fell in capturing one of the black standards of the Nihang (Akali) Sikh warriors at the Battle of Ferozeshah during the Anglo- Sikh war of 1845-1846. This standard now hangs in Lichfield Cathedral, Staffordshire. Close most probably contributed to the wall monument, and is known to have bestowed the parish schoolhouse (1849), now the parish hall. The church as originally built was too small to accommodate a growing population, and was also less than suitable for the High Church ecclesiology to which Bishop Tyrrell subscribed. This led to the engagement in the early 1860s of architect Edmund Blacket, who designed a chancel and vestry, joined to the existing nave via a high chancel arch. This work, including the introduction of a carved stone pulpit and font, both designed by Blacket, was completed in 1862. The sandstone pulpit, a replica of the 13th-century example in Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, where Tyrrell had formerly been parish priest, was carved by Maitland stonemason Daniel Yeates from Blacket's copy of measured drawings in 'Weale's Quarterly Papers' (1844), an English journal. Joan Kerr describes it as \\"really something special\\", and \\"one of the glories of the church\\". Like Blacket's later design for the Pulpit of St Thomas' Anglican Church, North Sydney, a variant on that of St. James', it was corbelled, in this case out of the east wall of the nave. As distinct from that of St. Thomas', the pulpit of St. James' was able to be entered only from the vestry, a quite unusual feature. In this, as well as in its exquisite detail, the pulpit demonstrates the Anglo-Catholic aspirations of Tyrrell, as well as the very close interest that this exceedingly busy and resilient man took in St. James'. The Yeates family was also responsible for the font and pulpit of St. Paul's West Maitland. In 1864, pews of local cedar, with elaborately-carved ends, were installed, replacing the original enclosed pews. The bench-ends are of some interest, being typical of Blacket's earlier practice, as by the 1870s he was already beginning to embrace much simpler pew designs. The pulpit, font and pews also demonstrate Blacket's considerable interest in furniture design as a reflection of his preferred High Church ecclesiology, an ideal to which he was able to give full expression in the \\"High Church\\" Diocese of Newcastle, as distinct from the constraints of the Diocese of Sydney, always predominantly \\"low church\\" but in those days still recognisably Anglican. In 1871–1872, the stained glass East Window, replacing plain glass, was installed in memory of E. C. Close. Designed by Bishop Tyrrell, it illustrates the central beliefs of catholic Christianity. Made in England and paid for by local citizens, its five columns display scenes from the Last Supper, Crucifixion, and Resurrection. A rose window above depicts Christus Panocrator: Christ All- powerful. In 1877 a William Davidson pipe organ was installed on the northern side of the nave, adjacent to the chancel arch. In the 1940s, the organ was relocated to the rear of the nave, while hand operation was replaced by an electric motor. In 2004 the instrument was renovated by Peter Jewkes, the facade pipes being replaced. In 1874 a fire caused major damage to the roof, which had retained its timber shingles. John Horbury Hunt, who had previously collaborated with Blacket and understood his work, was engaged to oversee the repairs. Hunt not only reconstructed the roof and replaced the timber shingles in slate, but also rebuilt the sandstone nave walls, removing the internal brick lining and raising the walls by two courses. The increased height was supported by the modification of the buttresses from octagonal to square form. Hunt's restraint makes his work at St. James' quite atypical of his wider church practice. Perhaps by way of compensation, he excelled himself in his design for the hammerbeam truss roof, which as befits a river port rather resembles a ship's hull. Hunt appears also to have designed the picket fence by which both rectory and church were protected. The completion of the roof, described by Professor A. P. Elkin as \\"a thrilling conception and a most remarkable feature\\", did much to alter St. James' from a rustic place of worship to a Parish Church in the traditional sense. The roof design, which has been described as a radical departure from his customary unadorned \\"as from saw\\" construction, appears to have been intended to impress Bishop Tyrrell, and was inspired by that of St. Wendreda's, March, Cambridgeshire, although Hunt did not seek to replicate its exact detail. Hunt also designed hammerbeam truss roofs for All Saints', Hunters Hill and for the Cathedral of Christ the King, Grafton, although these are not so delicately executed as that at St. James'. The nave was dedicated in December 1875. The completion of the works was commemorated in the relaying of the foundation stone. This ceremony, like the first, was undertaken by Edward Close Jnr. After the death of Bishop Tyrrell in 1879, a brass lectern in the church, modelled on the Eagle of St. John's gospel, was dedicated to his memory. In the Church grounds is an oak tree, grown from an acorn acquired in Hyde Park, London, by a Mr Hill (probably Private Lyall George Hilll, Australian Imperial Force, enlisted 5 June 1916), a local resident. In 1916, the gift of the Eales family of encaustic tiles from Duckenfield Park House, demolished in that year, transformed the floor of the Nave. In 1924 the narthex, or porch, was tiled in a different pattern. In 1927 a new altar was installed, further reflecting the High Church ideal, while in 1939 the roof slates were replaced with asbestos tiles and some rafters were replaced. When in the 1960s the picket fence partially collapsed, it was removed and not replaced. In the early 1970s a City of Westminster gas lamp was brought to Morpeth and installed just outside the entry to the church. In 1972 a columbarium was built, despite the proximity of the cemetery. In 1989, the church suffered major structural damage from the 1989 Newcastle earthquake. Sydney architects H. O. Woodhouse and Danks Pty Ltd oversaw the repairs, completed in 1994. It was at this time, too, that most of the memorial plaques were removed to the bapistry in the north-west corner of the church. Statues at the western end of the nave, carved by Englebert Piccolrautz, an Austrian woodcarver, are understood to date from 2005. Joan Kerr assesses the church as having 'Close's tower, Blacket's east end and Hunt's nave, quite harmoniously combined because of the continuous use of sandstone and the emulative English ambitions of the parish'.  Description  =Church= The church is a modestly sized stone- built building executed in what has been described as an Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque style.Heritas Heritage and Conservation, St. James' Anglican Church Morpeth CMP, 2014 The building was completed in three stages: the first, for which Edward Charles Close is thought to have been responsible, was completed in 1840; the second, built in 1862, was designed by Edmund Blacket; the third, designed by John Horbury Hunt, was constructed in 1875. The siting of the building at the crest of the ridge running east–west to the south of the Hunter River renders it visible across a wide area on both sides of the waterway, and assists in defining it as a structure both geographically prominent and physically substantial. The unfenced grounds, which are used for parish and community functions, are characterised by sweeping lawns and mature trees. The sandstone building presents a simple form of a gabled nave with a chancel in the east and a square tower in the west. The chancel has a vestry on the southern side. The tower, the oldest element of the church, is visible across a wide area, and displays less detail, with simple lancet (pointed arch) windows to the first two levels, and a small roundel window to the third and highest level. The tower castellations conceal a steeply-pitched roof, from which district views are available. The lowest two levels of the tower are supported by undecorated stone buttresses. The lancet windows are simply highlighted with stone hood moulds, and the small wheel windows to the upper tower are encircled with stone mouldings. Two stone string courses add a simple horizontal detail to the upper tower, and highlight the roundel windows. The main entry door is a large timber door set into a pointed segmental arch opening, also with a hood mould. The nave, and smaller projecting eastern chancel, are more decorative in their detail, while keeping the same character as the tower. The nave is broken into four bays by simple stone buttresses. Each of the western three bays displays a double lancet window and a rudimentary plate tracery motif of a small circular piercing above. The eastern bay, which coincides with the original location of the organ and choir stalls, has a triple lancet window on each side, with a quatrefoil window above. The lancet windows at each location are positioned under an equilateral pointed stone arch, with simple hood mould complete with a cube form label stop.Heritas Architecture CMP 2014, pp.14-16 The parapeted gable roof, covered in compressed fibrous cement shingles, has small gabled roof vents - one for each bay - near the ridge line. The eastern parapet is topped with a cross finial, and the skew stones of the parapet are detailed with a trefoil carving. The chancel continues the parapeted gable form of the nave, with cross finial and skew stones, however the eastern end is where the Gothic decoration of the exterior is most notable. The large stained glass window sits within an elaborate stone tracery frame housing five windows at its base, surmounted by a carved rose window motif and incorporating numerous modulated trefoil and several sexfoil motifs (six leaves radiating from a common centre). The large window is framed over the top with a hood mould, but here has carved label stops.CMP 2014, pp.14-16 The small vestry to the southern side sits snugly in the internal corner junction of the nave and chancel. The repetitive detail of buttressing, parapeted gable, cross finial and carved skew stones on the small size of the vestry form make this section of the church appear elaborately detailed. The pointed arch entry with hood mould and carved label stops sits below a small equilateral arched window in the gable. An elaborate window on the eastern side of the vestry is of stone tracery within a segmental arch opening. A strong hood mould with carved label stops highlights the opening. The two window bays are carved in an ogee arch form with a trefoil head.While the source of the sandstone is unknown, that used in the original building at least may have come from a nearby quarry, one known to have supplied good quality stone for several local structures. It is quite possible that the stone employed in the subsequent stages, if not for the initial element, may have been cut at Ravensfield near Farley. Stone from this quarry was used to build Aberglassyn House in the 1840s.Cynthia Hunter, Hearths and Homes: 19 Decades of Residential Design, 2008, p.87 In his 1915 survey of building and ornamental stones, R. T. Baker, curator at the Sydney Technological Museum, described the Ravensfield sandstone as \\"amongst the best in the State\\", being excellent for carving purposes.R.T. Baker, Building and Ornamental Stones of Australia, 1915, p.125 The stone is a fine ashlar block, sparrow pecked with a margin, much more distinct and refined on Blacket's 1862 sections than on Hunt's 1875 nave or the 1840 tower. Despite this, close observation of the detail in the 1840 tower and the 1862 chancel and vestry brings new understanding to the detail that Hunt employed in his 1875 redesigning of the nave, skillfully merging the two styles displayed on either end of the structure to produce a homogeneous whole. =Rectory= St. James' rectory is a Victorian Georgian-style, sandstock brick-built dwelling with high ceilings and cedar joinery. Located just south of the church, it is a simple symmetrical structure with a steeply-pitched metal roof with prominent dormers. It has wide, all-round verandahs, originally paved in flagstones, now obscured by concrete. The face brick is relieved by french doors with shutters, providing both security and regulation of ventilation as necessary. Plantings screen the rectory from an increasingly busy Tank Street. A freestanding weatherboard garage and a freestanding brick-built studio with metal roof are located in the rectory yard. The garage, associated with an asphalt driveway and carriage sweep, has little heritage significance, while the studio (formerly the laundry and bathroom) is contemporaneous with the rectory. The grounds, characterised by lawns, mature trees and flowering shrubs, are unfenced. =Parish Hall= St. James parish hall is a simple, symmetrical sandstone structure with a belfry over the central entry; simply- formed window apertures; and a substantial early 1980s addition at rear. High Street separates the hall from the remainder of the St. James' Group. The unfenced grounds are characterised by lawns and shrubs. = Condition = The church was reported to be generally in fair condition as at 10 June 2016, although some of the sandstone, which has in places been degraded by salt damp, movement, and general weathering, is in poor condition. There is also notable biological growth on the southern and eastern elevations. Weathering of the sandstone at the tower parapet is noticeably advanced. The sandstone has also previously been subject to the installation of Knapen tubes. Developed in England in the early 20th century, this form of treatment for rising damp was introduced into Australia in the late 1960s, during which decade it was extensively installed in public and private masonry buildings. In the case of St. James', as for so many buildings, the Knapen tubes failed in their purpose, and their installation and removal has entailed damage to the stone by way of penetrations. A structural assessment of the church, undertaken in 2012, addressed minor foundation movements due to reactive clay soil; roof movement due to wind action and the 1989 and 1994 earthquakes; rusting iron window frames; and significant salt damage and potential damage to masonry. Some areas of Portland cement-rich mortar, the use of which has accelerated deterioration of the sandstone, are also evident. The fabric of the church nonetheless maintains its historic integrity.CMP 2014, p.22 The rectory, conserved in the early 1990s, stands in good condition, and is well- maintained. The grounds, too, which feature some ornamental plantings, are well maintained, as is the freestanding studio (former laundry). The hall, to which additions were made in the early 1980s, stands in fair condition. The original element of the parish hall has in many places been affected by damp. Portland cement-rich mortar has been used in some areas, leading to further damp problems through capillary action aided by plant encroachment into sub- floor ventilators. As a result of historic ground movement, window apertures are out of true, their casement windows (1920s) having been designed and executed to suit. The Group retains its physical integrity, although the church as it stands is the result of three distinct stages of construction, the rectory was internally modified in the 1960s, and the parish hall was extended in the 1980s.  Modifications and dates  =Church= The original church was completed and consecrated in 1840. In the early 1860s, architect Edmund Blacket was engaged to undertake alterations and additions to the church. Blacket designed a chancel and vestry, joined to the existing nave via a high chancel arch. The work, which included the introduction of a carved stone pulpit and font, both of them designed by Blacket, was completed in 1862. In 1866, cedar pews with elaborately-carved ends, made of local cedar, were installed, replacing the original enclosed pews. In 1874 a fire caused major damage to the roof, which retained its timber shingles, and appears to have called into question the suitability of the walls of the nave. John Horbury Hunt, who had collaborated with Blacket and therefore understood his work, was engaged to oversee the repairs. Hunt not only reconstructed the roof and replaced the timber shingles in slate, but also removed the internal brick lining of the Nave and raised the walls by two courses of sandstone. The increased height of the walls was supported by the modification of the buttresses. A new hammerbeam truss roof, remarkable in design and execution, was constructed. The rustic fence protecting both the church and the rectory was replaced with a picket fence, probably of Hunt's design. This was removed in the 1960s, and has not been replaced. In 1877, a William Davidson organ was introduced on the left side of the nave, replacing an inferior instrument formerly housed in the organ loft, which was not rebuilt after the fire. In the 1950s it was removed to its present position in the western extremity of the nave, and fitted with an electric blower to replace its hand-worked bellows. It appears to have been in the 1940s, also, that the roof slates were replaced by asbestos tiles, involving also the deletion of the roof dormer vents. In 2004, the restoration of the William Davidson organ, one of the few remaining in NSW, was completed. Interior alterations have included the deletion of the choir within the chancel; the provision of electric lighting to replace ceiling-hung oil lamps; the installation of commemorative and memorial plaques; and the introduction of a Crucifix and statues. Many of the original windows have been replaced in stained glass, generally donated in memory of members of the parish. The beautifully executed East Window, designed by Bishop William Tyrrell, first Bishop of Newcastle, in memory of his friend E. C. Close, was installed in 1871. Tyrrell himself, as well as the third Bishop, George Stanton, is commemorated in memorial windows. Other works have included the introduction of a concrete floor, tiled in parts, and the reroofing of the Church, which was originally of shingles, then of slate, then of asbestos tiles, and is now of fibrous cement tiles. In 1972 a two-walled columbarium was provided just east of the church, while in the early 1970s a City of Westminster gas lamp, imported from the UK, was installed near the main entry. =Rectory= The rectory, completed in 1843, will like the church originally have had a timber shingled roof. These appear to have been replaced with slate in the mid-1850s. At some stage, the face brick external walls were rendered, and the flagstones of the wide verandah were concealed in cement. In 1847, attic servants' rooms were added in preparation for the use of the dwelling as Bishop Tyrrell's temporary residence. The originally extensive grounds, constituting the parson's horse paddock, were much reduced by the sale of their southern portion. In the mid-1960s, the rectory underwent major alterations, including the introduction of cement roof tiles; the provision of an indoor kitchen, bathroom and lavatory; and the placing out of use of the loft rooms. The latter work involved the removal of the internal staircase and the sealing of the stairwell, and the removal of the now-redundant dormer windows. At some stage the external render was removed. At an unknown date, the rectory grounds were modified by the provision of an asphalt driveway and carriage sweep, and by the construction of a timber-framed garage. The rectory having been slightly damaged by the 1989 earthquake, in conjunction with the necessary repairs its roof tiles were replaced with metal sheeting; the loft rooms were reopened, necessitating the rebuilding of the staircase; the dormer windows were reinstated; and the badly-damaged chimneys were reconstructed. The freestanding laundry, formerly the laundry/bathroom, will also originally have had timber shingled roof. =Parish Hall= The parish hall, built in 1849 as the parish schoolhouse, appears to have undergone little alteration, apart from reroofing and the building of a small weatherboard addition at rear, until in 1971 the bell was removed from the stone belfry and later mounted inside the building. In 1983, comparatively substantial additions, including new amenities, replaced the weatherboard element. The parish infants' school, later the Diocesan Book Depository and later the Diocesan Registry, an 1862 building that stood on the corner of Tank Street and High Street, addressing Tank Street and adjacent to and just north of the hall, was demolished in the 1940s. Although the building materials were reused elsewhere, the site remains vacant. A concrete path leads from High Street to the front door of the hall, and continues along the western elevation to provide access to the rear entry, which is the most often used. Between the path and the western wall is a narrow garden. The grounds, which were formerly protected by a picket fence, are now unfenced.  Heritage listing  The St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is of state heritage significance for its strong association with the prolific 19th century architects Edmund Blacket and John Horbury Hunt, both of whom are recognised as having made important contributions to the development of ecclesiastical buildings in NSW, and especially in the Hunter Region. The prominent siting of the group in the township of Morpeth is evidence of the initial town plan prepared by the private founder of Morpeth, Lieutenant Edward Charles Close. Its position demonstrates the historic importance of religious observance in the early European settlement of regional NSW. This is emphasised by the fact that the church was one of the first permanent buildings to be established at Morpeth, a settlement important in the history of NSW, while the rectory and parish hall are also among the earliest buildings in the township. Inspired by the example of English church properties, Close deliberately made the group visually prominent so as to mark the location of the township when viewed from river vessels and from the approach roads, a function it continues to perform. The group both marks the entry to the township and demonstrates the central role of the Church of England in the establishment of Morpeth, a settlement important in the history of NSW. The ecclesiastical group has strong associations with many historically important clergy and locally prominent families, including most notably Bishop William Tyrrell, first Bishop of Newcastle, who regarded St. James' as his parish church. Tyrrell is thought to have planted in the rectory grounds a camelia bush grown from a cutting from the plant nursury at the Macarthur family's Camden Park.SHR 00341 Bishop Broughton, the first and only Bishop of Australia and an important figure in the ecclesiastical history of NSW, consecrated the original church on 31 December 1840. The group constitutes a tangible and legible link to the early European settlement of the Morpeth township and with the Church of England in Australia (now known as the Anglican Church of Australia), a nationally important institution. The St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is of state heritage significance for the Horbury Hunt-designed hammerbeam truss roof with boarded ceiling within the church, which is significant for the integrity of its design and skill involved in its execution. Other moveable heritage items that are significant include the sandstone pulpit, a replica of the 13th century example in Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, and the ornately-carved stone baptismal font, designed by architect Edmund Blacket and installed in 1864. The St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is also of state heritage significance for its potential to contribute to an understanding of the manner in which the original church was enlarged and altered by prominent 19th century architects, and also the way in which the fabric has been adapted by succeeding generations. The hall (1849), originally the parish school has the potential to contribute to an understanding of the manner in which denominational educational institutions were affected by the establishment of National Schools (later called Public Schools) by the colonial government, particularly through the influence of Sir Henry Parkes. The pipe organ, installed in 1877, is one of only a few surviving William Davidson organs in NSW. It has attracted considerable interest from the Organ Historical Trust of Australia, and has the potential to provide information as to the fabric and design of colonial pipe organs. St James' Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 27 January 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is of state historical significance as it constitutes a tangible and legible link to the early European settlement of the township and Port of Morpeth, and as such with the early colonisation of NSW. The siting of the St. James' Group in the township is evidence of the initial town plan prepared by Lieutenant Edward Charles Close, founder of Morpeth, a private township important in the physical and economic development of NSW. Its location in a prominent position, both visually and in proximity to the main thoroughfares, demonstrates the historic importance of religious observance in the early European settlement of regional NSW. This is emphasised by the fact that the church, marking the location and entry to the embryonic village, was one of the first permanent buildings to be established at Morpeth, while the rectory (with external bathroom/laundry) and parish hall were among the township's earliest buildings, and are certainly some of the earliest to survive. The church furthermore provides evidence as to the nature and early development of local religious institutions, not least in its fabric and layout. It also provides evidence as to liturgical practices with regard to the local application of the High Church/Oxford Movement as favoured by William Tyrrell and his successors. Morpeth, rather than Newcastle was, until the early 20th century, the centre of the Diocese of Newcastle, an institution of historical importance to the colony and state of NSW, and the place of residence of the first four bishops of the Diocese of Newcastle. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is of state significance for its historic association with prolific 19th century architects Edmund Blacket and John Horbury Hunt, both of whom are recognised as having made important contributions to the development of ecclesiastical buildings in NSW, and especially in the Hunter Region. The St. James Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is of state significance for its association with Lieutenant Edward Charles Close, who conveyed to the Diocese of Newcastle the land on which the church, rectory and hall are located, and substantially funded the erection of the buildings. Close, a capable artist whose works provide invaluable evidence of early colonial life in Sydney, the Illawarra and the Hunter River district, may have designed the church, and potentially the parish hall (originally the parish schoolhouse). The ecclesiastical group has strong historical associations with many historically important clergy and locally-prominent families, including most notably Bishop William Tyrrell, first Bishop of Newcastle, who lived at the rectory, in the grounds of which he is said to have planted a camelia associated with the Macarthur family, and regarded St. James' as his parish church. Bishop Broughton, first and only Bishop of Australia and an important figure in the ecclesiastical history of NSW, consecrated the original Church on 31 December 1840. The group is also of state significance for its close relationship the Church of England in Australia (now known as the Anglican Church of Australia), an institution of historical importance to NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth is of state significance for its aesthetic characteristics and demonstration of creative and technical achievement. As a landmark in the early colonial townscape of Morpeth, the church building is a fine example of a small early colonial stone-built country church in the English manner executed in a restrained Colonial Gothic style, also described as Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque. The rectory is significant as an example of a Colonial Georgian brick country parsonage, distinguished by its steeply-pitched roof, simple verandah posts, and french doors with shutters to provide both security and the regulation of ventilation as required. The parish hall is significant as an example of a simple sandstone-built structure formerly used as a parish schoolhouse and reused as a hall. The furniture of the church is executed with particular care. The open pews, featuring late examples of Edmund Blacket bench ends, were installed in 1864. The encaustic tiles, reused from John Eales Jnr's celebrated Duckenfield Park House (demolished 1916), one of the great houses of the colony, are fine examples of their type. The E. C. Close memorial window (East Window), designed by Bishop Tyrrell in memory of his friend E. C. Close (d. 1866), made in England and paid for by Close's former tenants, and installed in 1871, graphically demonstrates the central doctrines of the Church of England as transplanted to Australia. It is a fine example of its type, and is beautiful in conception, fabric and function. The Horbury Hunt-designed hammerbeam truss roof with boarded ceiling, a defining feature of the interior and a very fine example of its type both in the integrity of its conception and the skill involved in its execution, is a radical departure from Hunt's customary unadorned \\"as from saw\\" construction, and is therefore of state heritage significance. The sandstone pulpit, a replica of the 13th century example in Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, is delicately carved. As a most unusual example of Blacket's work in its having, at Bishop Tyrrell's insistence, been executed from Blacket's copy of English measured drawings; in its being corbelled out of the nave wall; and in its being entered direct from the vestry, it is of state heritage significance. The finely-carved stone baptismal font, installed in 1864, designed by architect Edmund Blacket, is a fine example both of his work and of its type. The East Window (a memorial to E.C. Close), designed by Bishop Tyrrell himself and a fine example of its type, is also of state significance. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The intactness of the St. James' Anglican Church Group, Morpeth, as well as the quality of the design and execution of the pulpit and hammerbeam truss roof, indicates that the group is of state heritage significance as an important reference site for understanding the religious and physical development of Morpeth, a township of importance in the development of NSW. The church incorporates elements of the original building (1837), as well as 1860s and 1870s elements, providing evidence of the manner in which the original church was enlarged and altered by prominent 19th century architects, and also the way in which the fabric has been adapted by succeeding generations. The pipe organ, installed in 1877, is one of only a few surviving William Davidson organs in NSW. It has attracted considerable interest from the Organ Historical Trust of Australia, and has the potential to provide information as to the fabric and design of colonial pipe organs. The hall (1849), originally the parish schoolhouse, while undistinguished in terms of design and fabric, has the potential to contribute to an understanding of the manner in which denominational educational institutions were affected by the establishment of national schools (later called public schools) by the colonial government, particularly through the influence of Sir Henry Parkes. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. While most structural elements of St. James' Anglican Church, Morpeth are not rare in terms of execution and fabric, the John Horbury Hunt-designed hammerbeam truss roof is one of few in NSW, and is radically different from his other roof designs. This roof design, integral to the church, indicates that the church is of state heritage significance for its rarity value.

It was developed in the late 2010s and is expected to enter service with French operator SNCF in TGV service in the 2020s. It will likely be fairly similar to the newer Euroduplex sets. History In 2015, SNCF launched a program to select a supplier for a new generation of high speed trainsets, to be designed as a joint venture with the manufacturer. On 7 September 2016, SNCF and Alstom signed an agreement to design and build the trains, with the design phase scheduled to be complete by the end of 2017 and an entry into service in 2022. SNCF specified that the new trains be at least 20% cheaper to purchase than their predecessors, as well as have lower operating costs. To meet the goal, Alstom developed the trains as part of a broader family of high speed equipment offered for global sale, a change from previous TGV orders that were built specifically for the French market. In July 2018, with the design complete and publicly dubbed Avelia Horizon, SNCF placed a €2.7 billion order for 100 trainsets, options for change in the number of orders during construction, and maintenance. The first trains are scheduled to enter revenue service in 2023, with deliveries continuing through 2033. Design Avelia Horizon is a push–pull trainset, with power cars at both ends and seven to nine bilevel passenger cars in an articulated configuration. In the highest capacity interior layout, each trainset can carry up to 740 passengers. The total power output is , which gives the trains a top speed of .

Scheme theory emphasizes the relative point of view and, accordingly, the relative dimension of a morphism of schemes is also important.  Definition  By definition, the dimension of a scheme X is the dimension of the underlying topological space: the supremum of the lengths ℓ of chains of irreducible closed subsets: :\\\\emptyset e V_0 \\\\subsetneq V_1 \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots \\\\subsetneq V_\\\\ell \\\\subset X. In particular, if X = \\\\operatorname{Spec} A is an affine scheme, then such chains correspond to chains of prime ideals (inclusion reversed) and so the dimension of X is precisely the Krull dimension of A. If Y is an irreducible closed subset of a scheme X, then the codimension of Y in X is the supremum of the lengths ℓ of chains of irreducible closed subsets: :Y = V_0 \\\\subsetneq V_1 \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots \\\\subsetneq V_\\\\ell \\\\subset X. An irreducible subset of X is an irreducible component of X if and only if the codimension of it in X is zero. If X = \\\\operatorname{Spec} A is affine, then the codimension of Y in X is precisely the height of the prime ideal defining Y in X.  Examples  *If a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field is viewed as a scheme over the field,The Spec of the symmetric algebra of the dual vector space of V is the scheme structure on V. then the dimension of the scheme V is the same as the vector-space dimension of V. *Let X = \\\\operatorname{Spec} k[x, y, z]/(xy, yz), k a field. Then it has dimension 2 (since it contains the hyperplane H = \\\\\\\\{ x = 0 \\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{A}^3 as an irreducible component). If x is a closed point of X, then \\\\operatorname{codim}(x, X) is 2 if x lies in H and is 1 if it is in X - H. Thus, \\\\operatorname{codim}(x, X) for closed points x can vary. *Let X be an algebraic pre-variety; i.e., an integral scheme of finite type over a field k. Then the dimension of X is the transcendence degree of the function field k(X) of X over k. Also, if U is a nonempty open subset of X, then \\\\dim U = \\\\dim X. *Let R be a discrete valuation ring and X = \\\\mathbb{A}^1_R = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R[t]) the affine line over it. Let \\\\pi: X \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}R be the projection. \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R) = \\\\\\\\{ s, \\\\eta \\\\\\\\} consists of 2 points, s corresponding to the maximal ideal and closed and \\\\eta the zero ideal and open. Then the fibers \\\\pi^{-1}(s), \\\\pi^{-1}(\\\\eta) are closed and open, respectively. We note that \\\\pi^{-1}(\\\\eta) has dimension one,In fact, by definition, \\\\pi^{-1}(\\\\eta) is the fiber product of \\\\pi: X \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(R) and \\\\eta = \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k(\\\\eta)) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec} R and so it is the Spec of R[t] \\\\otimes_R k(\\\\eta) = k(\\\\eta)[t]. while X has dimension 2 = 1 + \\\\dim R and \\\\pi^{-1}(\\\\eta) is dense in X. Thus, the dimension of the closure of an open subset can be strictly bigger than that of the open set. *Continuing the same example, let \\\\mathfrak{m}_R be the maximal ideal of R and \\\\omega_R a generator. We note that R[t] has height-two and height-one maximal ideals; namely, \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 = (\\\\omega_R t - 1) and \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 = the kernel of R[t] \\\\to R/\\\\mathfrak{m}_R, f \\\\mapsto f(0) \\\\bmod\\\\mathfrak{m}_R. The first ideal \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 is maximal since R[t]/(\\\\omega_R t - 1) = R[\\\\omega_R^{-1}] = the field of fractions of R. Also, \\\\mathfrak{p}_1 has height one by Krull's principal ideal theorem and \\\\mathfrak{p}_2 has height two since \\\\mathfrak{m}_R[t] \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_2. Consequently, :: \\\\operatorname{codim}(\\\\mathfrak{p}_1, X) = 1, \\\\, \\\\operatorname{codim}(\\\\mathfrak{p}_2, X) = 2, :while X is irreducible. Equidimensional scheme An equidimensional scheme (or, pure dimensional scheme) is a scheme all of whose irreducible components are of the same dimension (implicitly assuming the dimensions are all well-defined). =Examples= All irreducible schemes are equidimensional.. In affine space, the union of a line and a point not on the line is not equidimensional. In general, if two closed subschemes of some scheme, neither containing the other, have unequal dimensions, then their union is not equidimensional. If a scheme is smooth (for instance, étale) over Spec k for some field k, then every connected component (which is then in fact an irreducible component), is equidimensional.

The magistracy was among the first health authorities in Europe to institute public inoculation projects to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Initially composed of three nobles, the magistracy was expanded in 1556 when two nobles were nominated in a supervisory role. The office of the Magistrato alla Sanità was retained until the Fall of the Republic of Venice, during which it was briefly replaced by a health committee and eventually superseded by other magistracies entirely.  Organisation  In the Venetian government, the term normally referred to a complex magistracy that was formed by the aggregation of individual committees. These could act together but, each having autonomous functions, also separately, at times with reciprocal control functions.Tiepolo, 'Venezia', p. 884 The was composed of two different committees and consisted in five nobles: the three (superintendents of health) and the two (supervisors of health). Supernumerary , with limited terms, could also be nominated by the Senate to investigate specific health-related matters. In addition, beginning in 1598, a (general superintendent for the plague) was designated during epidemics to control large geographical areas of the republic and coordinate containment efforts.Vanzan Marchini, I mali e i rimedi della Serenissima, p. 66 = Provveditori alla Sanità =  Origin  Venice's commercial dealings with vessels coming from other Mediterranean ports made the city particularly susceptible to foreign diseases; it was consequently one of the early urban centres in Europe to be devastated by the Black Death, the outbreak of the plague in 1347. It was in response to this outbreak that the Great Council first created a temporary committee of public health on 30 March 1348.Tiepolo, 'Venezia', p. 972 Yet given the limited knowledge of the causes of the disease at the time and the resulting inability to enact adequate containment measures, the committee was largely tasked with the removal and burial of the highly contagious corpses.Vanzan Marchini, 'Venezia e l'invenzione del Lazzaretto', pp. 17 and 24 Beginning in 1423, the authority to determine the most efficient means to contain and eradicate frequent infections and to coordinate efforts between various government offices was completely delegated to the Full College, the executive committee of the Senate. However, given the numerous duties of the Full College, ad hoc commissions had to be created during the epidemics of 1459, 1460, and 1468 in order to effectively deal with the health crises.Vanzan Marchini, 'Venezia e l'invenzione del Lazzaretto', pp. 26–27 Despite the need for a permanent committee of public health, there was resistance from other government offices whose own authority would be diminished, primarily on the part of the Salt Office whose tax revenues, derived from the government monopoly of the salt trade, largely financed the lazaretes, used for quarantine on islands away from the city.Vanzan Marchini, 'Venezia e l'invenzione del Lazzaretto', p. 19 Additional resistance to empowering a permanent government office stemmed from commercial interests which would be affected by the imposition of quarantine on ships and their cargo.Vanzan Marchini, Venezia, la salute e la fede, p. 77 Nevertheless, a dedicated committee, the three , was established by the Senate on 7 January 1486 (Venetian year 1485) to defend the city from the second major outbreak of the plague. At the conclusion of its twelve-month term, the committee was not renewed, and more delays ensued until 9 January 1490 (Venetian year 1489) when the were definitively established.Besta, Il senato veneziano…, p. 63Vanzan Marchini, Venezia, la salute e la fede, p. 78  Election and term  The were initially a (senatorial magistracy), a standing committee elected by the Senate from among its own members.Besta, Il senato veneziano…, pp. 160 and 163 But legislation on 9 November 1537 assigned the election of the to the Great Council. They were henceforth chosen from among the broader ruling patrician class and were aggregated to the Senate as an external committee with authority to propose legislation concerning health matters but without vote.Maranini, La Costituzione di Venezia, II, p. 156 They were consequently classified as , literally beneath , in reference to , the alternative title of the senators.The name Senate, of classical derivation, began to be used in the Renaissance. The early name of the assembly was the (Council of ) since the members were ('prayed', invited) to attend. See Besta, Il senato veneziano…, p. 20 and Da Mosto, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., p. 34.The were subdivided into three classes, termed , on the basis of their importance, the three being assigned to the second .

The were exonerated from the obligation to actually take part in the meetings of the Senate during their tenure, due to the need to manage urgent health-related matters. At the conclusion of their term of office, they sat in the Senate in an advisory capacity for a period equivalent to their term, initially one year but extended to sixteen months in 1745. The reform of 1745 also granted the the right to vote in the Senate.Vanzan Marchini, I mali e i rimedi della Serenissima, p. 65 = Sopraprovveditori alla Sanità =  Origin  The inferior hierarchical position of the , below senatorial dignity, limited their ability both to interact with higher- ranking offices throughout the government and to enforce the norms and directives aimed at safeguarding public health, particularly in the territories subject to Venice on the Italian mainland and overseas. This deficiency was increasingly problematic as the responsibilities of the office were increased, and it became acute during epidemics. Hence in 1556, at the first signs of a new outbreak of pestilence, the Senate had to compensate for the relative lack of authority of the by intervening directly to organize the necessary countermeasures. Later that same year, the Senate created a temporary committee to direct the work of the in the name of the republic. Similar temporary committees were created during later outbreaks of the plague until 1646 when the two were established as a permanent committee. Together with the , they formed the Magistrato alla Sanità. Their principal role was to coordinate with other magistracies. They also had the full authority of the Senate to enforce the public health measures of the Magistrato alla Sanità throughout the territories of the republic.  Election and term  When the office was made permanent in 1646, the were designated as a : they were chosen by the Senate from among its own members.Besta, Il senato veneziano..., p. 73 Legislation on 9 December 1674 further defined the as a magistratura serrata (closed magistracy): they could not be elected to an alternative committee until the end of their term, the objective being to ensure that they had sufficient time to gain practical experience in dealing with the complex and critical matters of public health.Besta, Il senato veneziano..., p. 167 The term of office, initially six months, was extended to one year in 1667. Functions Domenico Lovisa, \\"Veduta della Sanità et Granari Pubblici\\". From the office of the , inside the public granary near Saint Mark's Square, it was possible to sight arriving ships and inspect for disease. Upon its institution as a permanent body, the were tasked with safeguarding the public health of the state, with particular attention to preventing the spread of foreign diseases within the republic's territory, a regular threat for a city with an extensive reliance on international trade routes that facilitated contagion. From the offices of the magistracy, inside the public granaries near Saint Mark’s Square, it was possible to control the arrival of all ships and to prevent the disembarcking of passengers and the unloading of cargo until health inspections were conducted. Upon sighting the arrival of a ship into port, observers of the magistracy, stationed in the nearby bell tower, immediately notified the magistracy so that health officials could be sent to conduct inspections. All travelers, merchants, sailors, or pilgrims, had to obtain permission to enter the city. Suspected individuals and cargo were redirected to the lazarets for quarantine.Vanzan Marchini, Venezia, la salute e la fede, p. 82 In order to enable control and quarantine of disease outbreaks, officials of the Magistrato alla Sanità were able to impose periods of isolation of at least 14 days, upper length dependent on the situation in the port of question, and to cordon off areas of the city. Independent branches of the Venetian health services immediately discontinued trade and travel to and from Venice, functioning independently with the immediate isolation order of the Venetian Senate until the outbreak abated. Other methods of disease control included an intricate network of information and messaging, allowing for efficient reporting of and response to outbreaks, and the capacity to mobilise local coastal garrisons to carry out inspections, allowing isolation of plague-infested areas using pre-existing infrastructure. Despite these precautions, epidemics continued to occur regularly in Venice. The outbreak of plague of 1576–1577 killed around 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population;\\"Medicine and society in early modern Europe\\". Mary Lindemann (1999). Cambridge University Press. p. 41. . a similar proportion of the population was killed in 1630 in the Italian plague of 1629-31, when around 46,000 of the city's 140,000 citizens were killed. Within the city of Venice, the relied upon the network of , the elected administrators of the parishes, to control the spread of disease. Beginning in 1504, the were required to report all illnesses and deaths within the parish on a daily basis.Beltrami, Storia della popolazione di Venezia..., pp. 17–18 For illnesses, they were to record the signs and symptoms, particularly those indicative of plague, and to provide the names of any doctors that had been called.Vanzan Marchini, Venezia, la salute e la fede, p. 80 Burial licenses from the Magistrato alla Sanità were required with fines imposed for any unauthorized interments. Legislation in 1553 similarly required the heads of convents, monasteries, and recovering houses to report deaths.Beltrami, Storia della popolazione di Venezia..., p. 19 In all matters of public health, obtained supreme authority.Milan, Politi, and Vianello, Guida alle magistrature…, p. 150 It exercised authority in supervising a wide range of professions and services: in addition to the colleges of barbers and physicians, it regularly supervised the food industry, lazaretes, waste disposal, sewage and water management and mortuary services. Together with the , which regulated the sale of meat, and the , which protected the Venetian Lagoon from pollution, the also oversaw the trades that utilized animal remains, including the tanners and cobblers.Tiepolo, 'Venezia', p. 930 The was also known to interact with prostitutes, vagrants, beggars and guesthouses, further aiding the surveillance of possible transmission of foreign maladies within their jurisdiction. The Venetian was the second health provider in Italy to introduce variolation, which had only recently been introduced to Europe from eastern schools of medicine, as a means of inoculation against smallpox, preceded only by the Hospital of Santa Maria degli Innocenti in Florence, and the first to offer it freely to the public for purposes of herd immunity.  Authority  Receptacle in the sestiere of Dorsoduro for secret accusations concerning the violations of health laws The three had judicial authority to enforce the laws aimed at preventing the spread of infection. From 1504, their authority included the power to impose corporal punishment, notably torture and amputation, provided that there had been a unanimous vote of the . This authority was limited in 1539 when the Council of Ten, responsible for the security of the state, decreed that certain sentences could be appealed to the (executors against blasphemy) and the (sages for heresy). These cases included sentences against prostitutes in matters of public hygiene which could be appealed to the .Da Mosto, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., p. 175 With the first nomination of the two in 1556, the Senate extended the judicial authority of the to include capital punishment. This required a four-fifths vote of the entire magistracy. However, further limits were introduced in 1563: henceforth, the sentences of the could be presented in appeal by the , the state prosecuting attorneys, to the (College of Ten Sages of the Senate Body).Da Mosto, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., p. 105The was initially created to relieve the Full College of the responsibility for resolving disputes over tax exemptions and privileges for cities subject to Venice and for non-Venetians. It later came to also hear appeals for sentences issued by select standing committees of the Senate, including the . The was initially formed every six months by extracting ten senators by lot. In 1569, the number of members was increased to fifteen for exceptional cases, and in 1619 the number was increased to twenty, chosen by lot every four months from among the senators and former senators. With the reform of 1619, the organ was renamed the . See Andrea Da Mosto L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., p. 105. The were authorized to receive secret accusations concerning the violation of health laws and norms, provided that the accusations were signed and included the names of at least two witnesses. Pecuniary rewards, normally amounting to one-third or one-fourth of the fine imposed on the transgressors, were typically given to the accusers as a means of encouraging collaboration. The accusations, which could be deposited in receptacles located throughout Venice and in the subject cities, generally concerned the failure to observe quarantine procedures and the removal of infected goods from the lazaretes, the presence of beggars and migrants, the presence of medical charlatans and the trafficking in unauthorized medicines, the sale of infected meat or rotten food, the failure to maintain hygiene in stores and animal stalls, the polluting of the canals and streets, and unauthorized burials.Preto, 'Lo spionaggio sanitario', pp. 69–71 Although the had supreme authority in matters of public health, jurisdiction over vagrants and beggars was shared beginning in 1588 with the (superintendents of hospitals and recovery houses).Da Mosto, L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia..., p. 205 The authority of the extended not only to the entirety of the Venetian Lagoon but also to the other cities of the Venetian Republic by means of establishing health offices in each. Extensive infrastructure was introduced in the Ionian Islands, which were viewed particularly throughout the 17th and 18th centuries as likely sources of disease outbreaks due to their proximity to Asia Minor and, by extension, the Ottoman Empire. However, in many cases, the magistracy's authority was often not direct; for example, the lazaretes were able to bypass local health authorities and report directly to the regional government in times of low disease activity, only falling under the health office's direct jurisdiction in times of emergency. During the Fall of the Republic of Venice, as Napoleon’s troops were occupying the Republic's territory with numerous reforms to government and infrastructure, the office of the Magistrato alla Sanità was folded into the Health Committee () for a short period of time before eventually being disbanded, with its duties assigned to other magistracies. Archive The Archive of the superintendents of health contains nearly four centuries of documentation on not only the conditions of public health and sanitation within the Venetian Republic, but also of other contemporary states, on account of the extensive information gathered by the officials from their foreign counterparts as part of their regular surveillance of potential foreign-borne epidemics. The inventory for the archive, along with an index of names and locations, was published by Salvatore Carbone in 1962.Carbone, Salvatore.

The Era of Popular Violence (, minshū sōjō ki) was a series of violent mass protests and riots that occurred in Japan from 1905 to 1918. The Era of Popular Violence is considered to have begun with the Hibiya Incendiary Incident in September 1905 and culminated in the Rice riots of 1918, which lasted from July to September of that year. Background From 1600, Japan was under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate, a de facto military dictatorship under the Tokugawa clan in Edo, known as the Edo period. In the 1630s, the Tokugawa introduced the sakoku policies of national isolationism, limiting Japan's connections with the outside world to Chinese and Dutch traders. The Edo period saw strong political stability and economic growth in Japan until the early 1800s, when interactions with Western ships caused growing dissatisfaction with Tokugawa rule. The technologically superior Western ships were difficult to repel and were able to violate Japan with impunity, and Tokugawa's campaign of modernization to confront them was insufficient. In 1853, the Perry Expedition triggered a political upheaval in Japan called the Bakumatsu period. Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the United States arrived in Japan with a fleet of ships to forcibly end the centuries- old sakoku policy. In March 1854, Perry pressured the Tokugawa to sign the Convention of Kanagawa, widely perceived in Japan as an \\"unequal treaty\\" and a sign of weakness. The prestige and legitimacy of the Shōgun, who ruled with nominal appointment from the Emperor of Japan, was severely damaged to the public. As the convention was signed against the will of the Imperial Court in Kyoto, the de jure ruling authority, the anti-Tokugawa used this as evidence the Shōgun could no longer fulfil the Emperor's will, and therefore no longer fit to rule. In the 1860s, people who blamed the Tokugawa for Japan's \\"backwardness\\" and humiliation began agitating for their overthrow and the return of power to the Imperial Court. In 1868, the anti-Tokugawa launched the Meiji Restoration to restore practical imperial rule in the newly established Empire of Japan, and the Tokugawa were overthrown in the Boshin War the following year. The uncontested Meiji Government began a widespread campaign of reform in Japan, including modernization, westernization, and industrialization. Edo was renamed Tokyo and the city became both the official national capital and new seat of the Imperial House. Feudalism was abolished and political centralization saw the power of the domains progressively eliminated, and the domains themselves were soon transformed into prefectures, whose governors were appointed by the Emperor. In 1895, Japan defeated Qing China in the First Sino-Japanese War, shifting regional dominance in East Asia from China to Japan. The Treaty of Shimonoseki granted Japan sovereignty over the Chinese islands of Formosa (Taiwan) and Penghu (Pescadores), the lease for the Kwantung Leased Territory, and brought Korea into the Japanese sphere of influence. Events Destruction in Tokyo from the Hibiya Incendiary Incident By the turn of the 1900s, Japan's economy struggled to match the rapid territorial growth of the empire since the late 1800s. In February 1904, Japan entered in the Russo-Japanese War against the Russian Empire over competing imperialist interests in Northeast Asia. Japan decisively defeated the Russians and the war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth on 5 September 1905. A month of negotiations led to the treaty, which saw the return of the Kwantung Leased Territory (governed by the Russians as Russian Dalian since 1898) and the ceding of the island of Sakhalin south of the 50th parallel north. Despite the success of the war, the treaty outraged the Japanese public and sparked protests against terms considered to be too lenient towards the Russians. The protesters were especially incensed that Japanese territorial gains in the Liaodong Peninsula and the northern half of Sakhalin were to be returned to Russia, and that the Russian government would not pay any war reparations to Japan. Unknown to the public, largely ignorant of the actual war situation, the Japanese government had granted Russia these concessions because they feared the economy and military were too overstretched to enforce them. A diverse assortment of activist groups called for a rally at Hibiya Park in central Tokyo to protest the humiliating terms of the treaty, announced earlier that day. Police attempts to suppress the protest escalated into a violent riot known as the Hibiya incendiary incident, considered the first event of the Era of Popular Violence. Rioters targeted buildings associated with the police, Russia, the United States (who helped broker the treaty), and Japan's foreign affairs ministry. The Hibiya incendiary incident lasted until the 7 September, resulting in over 350 buildings damaged or destroyed, 17 people killed, hundreds injured, and led to the collapse of the government of Katsura Tarō in early 1906. Over 2000 were arrested for participation in the riots, with 104 reaching trial and 87 were found guilty of crimes. News of the violence in Tokyo touched off similar disturbances in Kobe and Yokohama, and further stimulated hundreds of nonviolent rallies, speeches, and meetings throughout Japan for the next several months. Further minor violent protests occurred across Japan over the next thirteen years, with nine different riots in Tokyo alone. The Era of Popular Violence is considered to have culminated with the Rice riots of 1918 that erupted throughout Japan from July to September 1918. A protest in the small fishing town of Uozu escalated into widespread violence due to popular dissatisfaction with post-World War I inflation. People in rural areas began hundreds of labor disputes over anger at the spiralling price of rice, a staple food. Rural people were infuriated by the Japanese government's failed attempts to relieve the problem, and the Siberian Intervention further inflamed the situation as the government bought existing rice stocks to support the troops overseas, driving rice prices even higher. People in urban areas joined the protests over the government's failure to fix inflation on rents and consumer goods as well as rice prices. The violence of the Rice riots of 1918 were unparalleled in modern Japanese history and brought about the collapse of the Terauchi Masatake administration.

Her diary was preserved when her husbands papers were donated to the Argentine National Archive. Biography Sáez was born in Montevideo, which at the time was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. She was the daughter of Francisco Sáez, a wealthy businessman, and Josefa Pérez. On 17 August 1819, she married Luis Vernet, whom she had met when he set up a commercial enterprise with Conrado Rücker. They had seven children. While living in Port Louis on the Falkland Islands Sáez kept a personal diary, which was preserved amongst the archive of her husband's papers donated to the Argentine National Archive. \\"En las páginas del diario de María, las cartas, papeles oficiales y contratas de trabajo, que hoy conservamos en el Archivo General de La Nación, aún late la vida de todos los días del Puerto de la Soledad de Malvinas.\\" She was accomplished at playing the piano; travelers and personalities who passed through the colony, referred to the \\"refinement\\" and cultural level of the Vernets. On several evenings she played the piano and sang. Robert Greenhow wrote that Sáez \\"played Rossini's music with great gusto.\\" Sáez died in Buenos Aires in 1858. The vault of the Vernet family is at La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires. Modern response The diary was referenced by the Argentine revisionist author Antonio Montarcé Lastra as part of his argument for Argentina's claimed sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. Sáez was also used as the basis of the principal character in two historical romance novels. Ernesto Cilley Hernández, Sáez's great-grandson, published the diary in bilingual Spanish-English form in 1989. In 2012, the National Library of the Argentine Republic held a research scholarship contest named for Sáez in relation to Argentina's claim over the Falkland Islands. As part of International Women's Day 2015, the Museo Malvinas e Islas del Atlántico Sur of Buenos Aires presented the exhibition Malvinas, mi casa, which included a series of watercolors reflecting life in the Falklands in 1829, based on Sáez's diary and lectures by her descendants on Argentina's claim to the Falklands.

Life and career  Brandon Perry was born and raised in Maryland, and grew up in a trailer park. He got into music at an early age when his parents would play Tupac, among others, when he was young. He cites \\"When I was ten or so I bought every Tupac CD. I bought all his music. My parents played him, Nas and Biggie in the car and stuff.

It was designed by John W. Pender and built in 1879 by James Pritchard. It is also known as The Old Synagogue. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  For at least the first half of the 150 years' history of Maitland, the Jewish community provided a strong contribution to the development of the district. As the number of Jewish settlers increased it was decided to build a Synagogue, and land was purchased in Church Street. J. W. Pender prepared alternative designs for the synagogue in 1878, and the present building was the less elaborate and probably the less expensive of the two. John Pender was the founder of the architectural practice known as Pender & Associates. The foundation stone was laid by Lewis W. Levy on 24 February 1879, when Morris Benjamin was president of the congregation. The building was constructed in 1879 by James Pritchard to meet the needs of the then substantial Jewish community. The synagogue was consecrated on 7 September 1879 by the Rev. A. B. Davis of the Great Synagogue, together with the Rev. S. A. Goldstein, Maitland's Minister. However, during the 1890s depression, the Jewish community declined in numbers to the point when in 1898, the Synagogue was finally closed.Australian Jewish Times, pp2, 1982. When it ceased to operate as a synagogue, the building became a private school, and then a Masonic lodge. Circa 1936 the original flooring was replaced with narrow, secret nailed boards more suitable for dancing than the original wide, shot-edge boards and was used during World War II as a dance hall to entertain soldiers. About this time the gallery and the Ark were demolished. In 1946 a large opening was made in the east wall and timber framed galvanised iron additions were made to the east and south sides.Pender & Associates P/L, undated.Branch Managers Report, 29 October 1981 and 17 January 1985. The building was later used as a motor vehicle repair shop. In 1981 a s.130 Order was placed over the building as a result of its poor condition and the possibility of demolition. In 1983 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the building. The then owners of the property advised that they wished to demolish the building in order to redevelop the site. The building was not considered beyond restoration and was in a good position for a sympathetic use. In 1985 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the building. In 1986 the building was converted into a credit union. In 2018, it houses a provider of occupational medicine services. The Maitland Jewish Cemetery is also listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.  Description  Side view, 2018 The building is a small symmetrical solid brick structure with slate roof and high elliptical lath and plaster ceiling. It was designed in the Romanesque Revival style and displays elaborate cement-rendered details, including corbelled arcades and columns, quatrefoil windows and round-headed arches. The interior retains its original cedar windows which are still in good condition, although parts of the walls have been altered by successive owners. It is approximately in size.Branch Managers Report 1983 It was reported to be in good physical condition as at 15 October 1999.  Heritage listing  The Maitland Synagogue is of historic significance in its associations with the strong Jewish community in the area and their contribution to the success and importance of Maitland as a trading centre in the latter half of the 19th century. The Synagogue is an important element in the streetscape of Church Street. Maitland Synagogue was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Much of the success and importance of Maitland as a trading centre in the latter half of the 19th century can be attributed to the strong Jewish community. The Maitland Synagogue was built two years after the erection of the Great Synagogue in Sydney and is the oldest surviving example outside Sydney of the very few synagogues built within New South Wales. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Synagogue is an important element in the streetscape of Church Street, complementing other heritage items including Grossman House, Brough House and the splendid Blacket Church, St Mary's the Virgin Anglican Church and its Rectory.

It was designed by the NSW Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet and built in 1881. The property is owned by Australia Post. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 December 1999.  History  The settlement began in 1818–1821 with some convicts put to work \\"cedar getting\\". Originally known as \\"The Camp\\", then as 'Molly Morgan's Plains' and \\"Wallis\\" Plains' after the commandant at Newcastle. Maitland is a coal-mining and regional centre, subject to severe flood damage, which was the cause of the East Maitland Post Office being vacated for a new post office on higher ground. The current post office building was designed by the Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet and completed in 1881, replacing the original Post and Telegraph Office which was situated on the opposite corner of Bourke Street. An addition to the building was added in 1900.  Description  A two-storey, stuccoed brick Victorian Italianate post office with a corner clock tower/campanile, and a corrugated iron clad roof. The building is located in a visually prominent position, near a major intersection. The main facade to High Street has a round arched loggia at street level surmounted by a balcony with cast iron column supports. Openings to the windows and doors have heavily moulded arched lintels and quoins are expressed by grooved mock ashlar jointing. The facade is bisected horizontally by a deeply moulded stringcourse and a bracketed cornice carries the projecting eave. The treatment of the return elevation is less imposing. A two-storey, twentieth-century addition on the south side is not included in the heritage-listing. The physical condition of the building was reported as good as at 23 November 1999. The integrity was fair, with the former main entrance replaced by a window and interior alterations.  Heritage listing  As a substantial public building the Maitland Post Office is an exemplar of the Victorian Italianate style, incorporating a corner tower of considerable land mark value. The building is associated with Colonial Architect James Barnet and is representative of the group of Italianate post offices designed by Barnet. It is substantially intact and of importance in these respects at the State level. Maitland Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 December 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Maitland Post Office is highly representative of its period and is associated with the NSW Colonial Architect's Office under James Barnet. It is part of an important group of works by James Barnet, a key practitioner of the Italianate style. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building is an exemplar of the Victorian Italianate style, incorporating the characteristic corner tower and loggia. It is part of a group of post office buildings (including Kempsey, 1886 (Kempsey Post Office), Kiama, 1878, Cootamundra, 1880-1881, Redfern, 1882 and Yass, 1884 (Yass Post Office)) designed in the Italianate style and collectively illustrating a representative type. The tower and asymmetrical facade impart considerable architectural presence to the narrow street and give the building landmark qualities. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a prominent and attractive civic building, the Maitland Post Office is considered to be significant to the community's sense of place.

In 1982, Reston Publishing released Murder in Irliss, a 149-page adventure written by Jeffrey Dillow for the High Fantasy system. The solo scenario adventure. is set in the kingdom of Irliss, where Prince Rand has been assassinated. The player takes on the role of Faren, Captain of the Guards, who is given the task of finding the murderer. The player starts the adventure at Scene 1 out of 605; the choice the player makes at the end of each scene determines the path taken through the book, ultimately leading to success or failure. It is replayable because the guilty party changes every time. There are actually five murder mysteries with different clues — the player chooses one of five \\"fatestones\\" at the start of the adventure; each fatestone leads the player down a different path through the adventure, each leading to a different murderer. Publication history Murder in Irliss was written by Jeffrey C. Dillow and published by Reston Publishing in 1982 as a 145-page book. Reception In the August 1982 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 54), David J. Arlington noted the relatively high purchase price ($10.95 in 1982), but highly recommended the adventure, saying, \\"If the high price doesn't put you off, you should purchase this just to see how well a solo adventure can be done when done properly.

It was designed by J. W. Pender and built from 1886 to 1927. The property is owned by Maitland Lodge of Unity. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 December 2014.  History  As the colony of New South Wales expanded outside of Sydney in the early 19th century, Europeans soon discovered the fertile lands of the Hunter Valley region and established a colonial outpost. With its rich alluvial lands, the township of Maitland (then called Wallis Plains) was settled soon after and its strategic position on the Hunter River, which could provide steamship transport from the region to Sydney in less than twelve hours, was the key to its success and development. Maitland quickly became an important agricultural provider for the colony and, by the 1840s, its booming commercial sector saw its population expand exponentially, exceeded only by that of Sydney itself. Much of the new population of Maitland were English settlers tasked with establishing an economically and socially viable community in the new and largely foreign environment. In an effort to maintain the traditions and familiarities of the British motherland, the colonists continued to pursue those activities and institutions from home and with this came freemasonry. Warranted under one of the three Grand Lodges of the British Isles (being England, Ireland and Scotland), freemasonry was first established in Sydney in 1820 with the formation of the Australian Social Lodge under the Grand Lodge of Ireland. This lodge was later followed by the establishment of the Leinster Marine Lodge of Australia (also established under the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1824), the Lodge of Australia (established under the Grand Lodge of England in 1828) and St Johns Lodge of Parramatta (an unaffiliated lodge, established in 1839). The fifth lodge established in NSW, and the first to be formed outside of the Sydney colony, was the Maitland Lodge of Unity. Upon the closure of St Johns Lodge of Parramatta (date unknown), the Maitland Lodge of Unity was renumbered as the fourth lodge of NSW. Formed in 1840, the original members of the Maitland Lodge of Unity (at this point, numbering 18) were those leading influential businessmen of the booming Maitland township who were tasked with developing and maintaining the cultural and social progress of the communities of the Hunter region. Although the lodge did not have a permanent meeting place (as was the case for many young lodges with fledgling numbers), meetings were held at a number of different venues that were available, discreet and confidential. As well as the private residences of members, early meetings of the Maitland Lodge of Unity were held at the Rose Inn (the publican, Philip Joseph Cohen, was himself a mason and lodge member) as well as the Waterloo Inn and the Australian Hotel. By the tenth anniversary of the formation of the Maitland Lodge of Unity in 1850, its membership had swelled to 50 but, over the next two decades, the lodge was to experience wavering support in its numbers. By the 1860s, Maitland's role as the chief town in the region was in decline. Its agricultural industry had been hit critically by a wheat rust outbreak and flooding of the Hunter River had damaged crops and made river travel increasingly difficult. By 1869, due largely to financial, conduct and attendance difficulties, membership of the lodge had hit a low of only 19 people. To survive the challenges facing the town, Maitland diversified its business into alternative industries, fundamentally changing how it used its landscape and subsequently witnessed a revival of its commercial interests. Only four years after its lowest membership numbers since its establishment, the lodge saw a resurgence and, by 1873, numbers had reached its highest point with 81 masons. With this increase in membership came an increase in funding which made the probability of the Maitland Lodge of Unity securing its first permanent venue plausible. The lodge soon purchased land at 280 High Street Maitland but quickly realised that the cost of developing this site was unachievable. The Greater Northern Permanent Building, Investment and Loan Society was to develop the site and rented two of its rooms to the lodge from 1877 for a ten year period with the option to purchase. In 1884 however, the lodge purchased land at Victoria Street, Maitland and commissioned prominent local architect, and also a lodge member, J. W. Pender to design a permanent purpose-built building for the lodge (Pender was, coincidentally, also the architect of the High Street development). On 3 August 1886, the existing two buildings on the site had been demolished and the foundation stone for the new lodge building was laid by the wife of lodge member, Brother Levy (traditionally a fraternal organisation, it is of note that a woman was invited to formally lay the foundation stone for the new Masonic lodge building). Completed in March 1887, the Maitland Lodge of Unity building was officially opened by the Master of the Lodge, Worshipful Master Thomas Browne. In 1888, and in an effort to achieve a Grand Lodge that was responsive to the needs and requirements of Australian freemasonry and independent of the Grand Lodges of the British Isles, the lodges of NSW (including the Maitland Lodge of Unity) amalgamated to form the United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory which would, from that time on, be the main governing body for freemasonry in the state. As the Maitland Lodge of Unity grew, the lodge slowly expanded its facilities and acquired plots of land surrounding the Victoria Street site. In 1927, the lodge constructed a second building, fronting Grant Street and called \\"The South\\", to be used as a supper room and for community social purposes.  Description  Designed by prominent regional architect and lodge member John W. Pender, the Masonic Hall of the Maitland Lodge of Unity is an ornately decorated building of the Late Victorian style with stylistic elements of \\"Arabesque\\" or \\"Moorish\\" influence. Of brick construction with a pitched timber framed roof, the lodge building has a rendered painted facade fronting Victoria Street with highly decorative elements including mouldings, mock domes and Masonic emblems. Fenced at street level with a palisade fence and gates, the lodge building is entered via a raised central porch with horse-shoe arches and ornate symbolic imagery. The lodge building is face brick on side elevations and is topped with a timber- framed roof lantern with glazed pivot windows and timber louvres. Internally, the Masonic Hall of the Maitland Lodge of Unity conforms to the measurements, principles and proportions of double cube construction which is the principle of freemasonry design. The lodge building includes two spaces: a simply designed and largely undecorated ante room that leads to a more ornately decorated temple room. Decorated with a central linoleum floor panel with Masonic imagery (including the 'blazing sun'), the temple has a coved roof, central lantern and triangular \\"G\\" icon suspended from the ceiling that symbolises God. The temple is highly decorated with mouldings, cornices, vents and Masonic emblems (including the eight-point star formed by the double cube). The second lodge building,constructed in 1927 and fronting Grant Street, is a simply detailed building without the detailing and Masonic references of the lodge building. Of brick construction with a gabled terracotta tile roof, the building contains a hall and kitchen that are both vernacular and functional in design and use. This building is of lesser heritage value but contributes to the use of the 1887 Masonic Hall. A small Victorian hall still used for its original purpose. Face brick sides, gabled iron roof with clerestory lights along ridge. Elaborate stuccoed facade and porch in Moorish/Indian influenced style incorporating masonic emblems. Side timber porch in similar style. Simple iron fence on masonry base. Set in a narrow street of other worth while Victorian buildings. Condition excellent. Interior not seen. Architectural Style: Moorish/Indian influenced. Building Material: Brick.NTA, 1984  Heritage listing  The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is of state heritage significance as the fifth Masonic lodge established in NSW, and the first to be formed outside Sydney.

The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is a fine representative example of a Masonic lodge designed to the perfect measurements and proportions of the double cube principle of freemasonry design. An aesthetically distinctive and decorative building of the Late Victorian style, the Masonic lodge building incorporates stylistic elements of \\"Arabesque\\" or \\"Moorish\\" influence which were rare aesthetic and architectural features in a regional colonial outpost in the 19th century.

Designed by prominent regional architect and lodge member J. W. Pender, the lodge building reflects the resurgence of Maitland as a regional commercial centre in the late 19th century. Members of the lodge included the leading community members and businessmen who were instrumental in the revival of Maitland in this period. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is of state heritage significance for its association with the prominent regional architect, John Wilshire Pender. A significant architect in the development of the Hunter region in the 19th century and a prominent community leader, Pender was a member of the Maitland Lodge of Unity from and was commissioned to design a permanent purpose-built venue for freemasonry activities in Maitland. J. W. Pender has also been attributed with the design of the following SHR-listed items: Cintra House, Maitland (1878, SHR No.1892), former Maitland Synagogue (1879, SHR No.376), Anambah House, Anambah (1889, SHR No.275) and Saumarez Homestead, Armidale (1888, SHR No.1505).

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is of state heritage significance as an aesthetically distinctive and decorative purpose-built Masonic hall. Designed by prominent regional architect and lodge member John W. Pender, the Masonic Hall of the Maitland Lodge of Unity is an ornately decorated building of the Late Victorian style. Designed in contrast to the functionalist Classical design of many other Masonic lodge halls in NSW, many of which adapted existing buildings for Masonic activities, Pender's design for the Maitland Masonic Hall also incorporated stylistic elements of \\"Arabesque\\" or \\"Moorish\\" influence which were rare aesthetic and architectural features in a regional colonial outpost in the 19th century. With a rendered painted brick facade fronting Victoria Street, the purpose-built Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall incorporates highly decorative elements including mouldings, archways, mock domes and Masonic emblems. Conforming to the perfect measurements of the double cube principle of freemasonry design (evident in the length, width and height of the building), both the exterior and interior of the Masonic hall is ornately decorated and highly detailed with symbolic images. Symbolism, a traditional and fundamental teaching of freemasonry, is evident throughout the Masonic Hall of the Maitland Lodge of Unity through the use of key emblems such as the eight-point star formed by the double cube, the blazing sun on the central floor panel and the triangular \\"G\\" icon suspended from the ceiling symbolising God. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is held in high social esteem by the community as it continues to retain its original use as a permanent purpose-built venue for freemasonry activities in the Hunter region. Since the lodge was formed in 1840 and the Masonic hall established in 1887, the Maitland Lodge of Unity has been valued by the Masonic membership and the community continues to retain an attachment and regard for the freemasons, their longevity in the community and their social and charitable practices for others. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Prior to the construction of the Masonic Hall of the Maitland Lodge of Unity in 1886-87, the Victoria Street site was occupied by two earlier buildings - the larger in the northern corner of the site and a smaller structure in the eastern corner. Demolished for the construction of the Masonic hall, there may be some potential for archaeological remnants of the earlier buildings to remain if further research was undertaken. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is of state heritage significance as a rare example of an architecturally inspired and distinctive purpose-built Masonic hall. Designed by prominent regional architect and lodge member John W Pender, the Masonic Hall of the Maitland Lodge of Unity is an ornately decorated building of the Late Victorian style. Designed in contrast to the functionalist, vernacular or Classical design of many other Masonic lodge halls in NSW (many of which adapted existing buildings for Masonic activities), Pender's design for the Maitland Masonic Hall creatively incorporated stylistic elements of \\"Arabesque\\" or \\"Moorish\\" influence which were rare aesthetic and architectural features in a regional colonial outpost in the 19th century. The features of the Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge are also of particular interest as the lodge was the first to be established in a newly settled and developing regional area outside of Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is of state heritage significance as a fine representative example of a Masonic lodge designed to the perfect measurements and proportions of the double cube principle of freemasonry design (evident in the length, width and height of the building). The Masonic hall incorporates many of the traditional symbolism of freemasonry that are fundamental to the teaching of the practice (such as the eight-point star formed by the double cube, the blazing sun on the central floor panel and the triangular \\"G\\" icon suspended from the ceiling symbolising God). Although the double cube principles and symbolism is practiced throughout the design of many Masonic lodges in NSW, the Maitland Lodge of Unity Masonic Hall and Lodge is a particularly fine and well maintained example in the state.

It was built from 1860 to 1862 by Isaac Beckett and Samuel Owen. It is also known as Grossman House. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW), and is associated with the neighbouring Brough House, which is also owned by the National Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.  History  During the nineteenth century, Maitland was an important commercial centre in the Hunter Valley. Its origins as a camp for convict timber loggers led to the realisation of the extremely fertile soil and potential for agricultural prosperity. By the 1840s Maitland was established as the chief town of the region, its population exceeding only that of Sydney. The business industry flourished as Maitland adopted the role of the trade centre, providing services and supplies to rural industries. It was during this successful period that local business partners Samuel Owens and Isaac Beckett built their two homes, Brough House and Grossmann House. The businessmen formed their partnership in 1838, however the houses were not built until 1860. In 1838 the Owen and Beckett Partnership established a business as general merchants, tailors, woolbrokers, wine and spirit and tobacco merchants. In 1860 Grossmann and Brough house were constructed opposite St Mary's the Virgin Anglican Church, near the railway and away from the threat of flood. In 1860 Grossmann House was occupied by the owner Isaac and his wife and daughter, Caroline and Sarah. After the death of Beckett in 1880 the property was left to his wife and then son, Thomas Cooper Beckett. In 1890 the property was sold to J. D Prentice. In 1893 both Grossmann and Brough House were purchased by the Department of Public Infrastructure for a Girls' High School, its name being derived from the first headmistress, Jeanette Grossmann. Grossmann was principal at the school from 1890-1913. In 1963 the house was presented to the Hunter Regional Trust for use as a house museum. The National Trust of Australia (NSW) decorated the interior to present artefacts from the 1860s. The upper floor also provides simple custodian accommodation. In 1966 the National Trust took control of the property and opened the house for public viewing. The Department of Education owned the property at the time, and the National Trust secured a permissive occupancy agreement. The rose garden at Grossmann House was planned and planted in 1973 by members of the Hunter Valley Rose Society. The garden remains largely unaltered since it was established. The idea was not to replicate roses entirely from the 1870s when Grossmann House was (newly) built, but rather to select heritage species (cultivars) which would give recurrent flowering over a long period. Different families of roses were selected, including species from China which are better suited to Australian conditions than are European varieties. The roses were selected from Ross Roses Nursery in South Australia.(Todd, 2014, 180. In 1978 the State Government added Grossmann House to the Brough House reserve for the preservation of historic sites and buildings and the National Trust of Australia (NSW) were appointed trust managers.(Tanner,1986:5) In 1986, the street-front verandahs to the house were restored and basic kitchen and bathroom facilities were introduced to serve a caretaker. A stone memorial was placed in the rose garden to commemorate Drs. John and Wilga Abrahams by their family in 2000. 2014 saw visitation increase by 34% with fundraising days, local house \\"open days\\", a candlelight soiree, sales of home produce and walking tours. A NSW Government grant enabled painting of the exteriors of Brough and Grossmann Houses in matching colours, another step towards linking the mirror-image properties as conceived over 140 years ago.  Description  ;House Isaac Beckett and Samuel Owen built Grossmann and the neighbouring Brough House in 1860 to 1862. The strong business partnership between the two merchants, Owen and Beckett, is reflected in the construction of their identical two storey Victorian houses next door to each other. Local red sandstone bricks are the primary medium and detailing incorporates a harmonious use of buff sandstone and painted cast iron and timber. Large verandahs at the front and rear (west and east) formed an integral part of the design. The hipped roof is covered with corrugated iron. Internal planning is sensible, providing easy circulation and spacious main rooms. Based on a centre hall plan the front entrances become side doors and the length of the house extends along Church Street, thereby optimising the verandah and views. Original internal joinery is cedar and this, along with other interior finishes (plaster, tiles, timber flooring) are presented with little embellishment. The gardens were generous in size and, perhaps predictably, given the symmetry of Owen and Beckett's arrangement, the laundry building is situated on the centre line of the properties. This simple, rectilinear structure has a central partition, dividing the area thus providing each resident with semi-private facilities.The National Trust of Australia (NSW),1976 = Garden = The rose garden was planned and planted in 1973. The garden remains largely unaltered since it was established. The idea was not to replicate roses entirely from the 1870s when Grossmann House was (newly) built, but rather to select heritage species (cultivars) which would give recurrent flowering over a long period. Different families of roses were selected, including species from China which are better suited to Australian conditions than are European varieties. The roses were selected from Ross Roses Nursery in South Australia (Todd, 2014, 180. A map made in 1976 of the 1973 rose garden plantings was used in 2003 as the basis of an updated inventory of the roses. Over 60% of the original plantings had survived over 30 years. Today there are 33 varieties of which 27 date from the 1973 plantings. Some of the species were developed around the time Grossmann House was (newly) built, 1870-71. \\"Zepherine Drouhin\\" (1868) is a climbing pink rose that is thornless and good for training over archways, \\"Paul Neyron\\" (1869) is nicknamed \\"the cabbage rose\\" and \\"Louise Odier\\", highly fragrant, is said to be used in the French perfume \\"Joy\\". \\"Aimee Vibert\\" (1828), another of the climbers planted in 1973, was one of the first roses in the colony, brought in originally for the Macarthurs' garden. In 2013 the Hunter Valley Rose Society offered to help look after the Grossmann House rose garden. More new species have been added. = Condition = The physical condition of the property was reported as good as at 30 June 2000. Grossman House is largely intact.  Heritage listing  A large Victorian town house, which forms an interesting group with its twin (Brough House) next door now largely, restored in its original form. Built by merchants in partnership, they form an impressive residential partnership of the 1860s. The historical associations of these two buildings make them of great interest in their relationship to the original owners and later use as part of the Maitland Girls' High School. Grossman House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Grossmann House reflects the introduction of public education in New South Wales. Historically the house reflect Maitland's nineteenth century prosperity and significance, especially in its location on the axis between the railway station and High streets. The architectural design of the Victorian Terraces also adds to the historical significance of developing a township. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Grossmann House forms an integral part of an historic nineteenth century townscape dominated by St Mary's Church, large fig trees, residences and gardens. Built on Church Street, directly adjacent to the Church of St. Mary, Grossman House mirrors its neighbour Brough House. Built side by side in Victorian style (with Georgian simplicity), these asymmetrical structures are characteristic of the substantial residential buildings of the era. The buildings reflect a prosperous period for Maitland. Therefore, the site makes a significant and attractive contribution to the present streetscape and to the district as a whole.(Tanner,1986:4) The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Grossman House is socially significant for its long association with the public as a schoolhouse, museum and art gallery add to the social recognition and use of the property. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Grossman House serves as a museum of early Maitland urban life and relates well to the other nineteenth century buildings nearby. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Grossmann House is a rare intact Victorian townhouse providing an accurate representation and presentation of the eighteenth century through its furnishings and architecture. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The properties represent the eighteenth century architecture by providing two intact identical Victorian Townhouses. The furnishings represent the times and the long associations with the Education Department.

Sebeok Fellow of the Semiotic Society of America. She is also International Visiting Research Fellow at the School of Psychology, the University of Adelaide, South Australia. Petrilli is a leading scholar in semiotics. She has been a central figure in the recent recognition by semioticians that Victoria Lady Welby acted as the foremother of modern semiotics, alongside Charles Peirce, its forefather. Petrilli's book, Signifying and Understanding: Reading the Works of Victoria Welby and the Signific Movement (2009), underscored the invaluable contribution made by Welby to semiotics, her development of the ‘significs’ theory, and the influence her theory and published works bore on contemporary semioticians such as Peirce, Ogden and Vailati. Petrilli devised, along with Augusto Ponzio, the theory of ‘semioethics’, located at the intersection of semiotics and ethics. This theory has been applied and reinterpreted in various scholarly fields, including law, medicine, language, communication, and architecture. She published over one hundred books and peer-reviewed articles in the field of semiotics and philosophy of language, in both English and Italian. Her works have been translated into several languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Greek, Portuguese, Serbian and Spanish. She was recognized as a leading modern semiotician under “Susan Petrilli,” entry by Paul Cobley (ed.), The Routledge Companion to Semiotics, London, Routledge, 2010.  Biography  Ferruccio Rossi-Landi commissioned Petrilli to write on Victoria Welby, for the Walter Schmitz volume Essays in Significs (1990). Sebeok thereafter invited her to examine the role played by Women in Semiotics, notably Victoria Lady Welby. What initially began as a short chapter on Welby, turned into years of archival research and a monumental book on Welby's published works and letters, namely Signifying and Understanding: Reading the Works of Victoria Welby and the Signific Movement. For this work, Petrilli consulted the Welby archives at York University, Toronto, Canada, the Lady Welby Library, University of London Library, and the British Library in London, United Kingdom. Welby's epistolary work was extensive, as she shared and tested ideas with approximately 460 contemporary semioticians and scholars. Paul Cobley remarked: ‘Petrilli’s odyssey (…) has taken her from Australia to Italy, from a PhD thesis idea to the depths of the archives, and now to a future for a politically inflected, ethnically permeated, semiotics’. Petrilli's book on Welby led to a Special Issue dedicated to Victoria Welby in the Semiotica Journal, co-directed by Petrilli, which brought together articles written by 35 authors. As noted by the late John Deely: ‘It is more than fitting that Susan Petrilli, who pioneered the development of semioethics within the major tradition of semiotics, is the one to whom Victoria Welby is indebted for being brought to the center stage of this major development’.  Works and ideas  = Semioethics = Petrilli's semioethics theory has been applied and discussed in over thirty five recently published essays and articles, including fifteen published in the American Journal of Semiotics since 2013, sixteen published in Semiotica since 2004, and others published in New Formations, Sign System Studies, Language and Dialogue, and in the legal field, notably in the International Journal for the Semiotics of Law, and the Cambridge International Law Journal, as it pertains to human rights and international law. Regarding her theory, Petrilli explains: > Semioethics is not intended as a new branch of semiotics, but rather it > refers to the human capacity for listening to the other, to the capacity for > critique, deliberation and responsibility. Following Sebeok’s “global > semiotics”, semioethics returns to the origin of semiotics understood as > “medical sem(e)iotics” or “symptomatology” and, recalling its ancient > vocation to care for life, thematizes the relation between signs and values, > semiotics and axiology, semiotics, ethics and pragmatism. Ronald C. Arnett adds: > [Petrilli] contends that the primary task of semioethics in this historical > moment is the detotalization of global communication production systems. She > intends semioethics as a critical and disruptive force capable of > questioning global communication systems that dominate this historical > moment. Semioethics challenges the characteristic unreflective social > development inherent in modernity’s love of process and procedure. Petrilli > connects semioethics to the mission of unmasking dominant ideologies that > constitute globalized communication systems. = Academic honours = Petrilli was awarded the 7th Thomas A. Sebeok Fellow of the Semiotic Society of America in 2008, the tri-annual award for excellence in scholarship and contribution to the development of the doctrine of signs, for originality in research and for contributing to the circulation of semiotic studies internationally. She became Fellow of the International Communicology Institute in 2008, as among the top 100 scholars at a world level who have most influenced and guided studies in the field of “communicology”.

A bottling truck collided with the school bus, causing the latter to enter a caliche pit filled with water. The driver of the truck was acquitted of negligent homicide charges. The payoffs from lawsuits compensating for the deaths of the students caused division in the Alton community. A middle school that was built in Alton was named in honor of the deceased. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), the Alton crash was the sole school bus accident in the United States in the period 1979-1989 in which passengers died due to submersion-related causes.NTSB Report, p. 35 (PDF p. 42/95). it was the deadliest school bus accident that had ever occurred in Texas.

The bus had, just prior to the accident, picked up its final student. There was no barrier that would have stopped the bus before it entered the caliche pit.NTSB report, p. 48 (PDF p. 55/95). The bus was built in 1977 and had a capacity of 84 seats. The truck was determined to have gone through a stop sign. The students on board, ranging in age from 12 to 19, attended Mission Junior High School and Mission High School in Mission, Texas, and were from the portion of Alton that had the lowest socioeconomic status. The bus had 42 students in senior high school and 39 students in junior high school. The bus fell into a caliche pit with about of water. Caliche pits in the area had filled with rainwater as time passed; there were no laws requiring owners of the pits to have them filled in after mining was finished. Of the 81 students on board, 11 students sustained no injuries, 46 sustained minor injuries, 3 sustained serious injuries, and 21 died; all 21 deaths were due to drowning or due to causes related to being in the water. 19 died on September 21, and an additional two died later in the hospital from complications related to the asphyxia they had experienced,NTSB report, p. 11 (PDF p. 18/95). with the final deceased victim dying on September 29. Both the drivers of the truck and the bus survived the accident. The bus filled with water within 30 to 60 seconds,NTSB report, p. 42 (PDF p. 49/95). resulting from openings in side windows, the front boarding door, and the windshield which had become dislodged. The students did not have an air pocket which would have given them time to determine how to escape.NTSB report, p. 41 (PDF p. 48/95). None of the passengers experienced trauma- related injuries which would have prevented them from exiting the bus.NTSB report, p. 38 (PDF p. 45/95). Most of the deceased students were away from the exits, in the bus's center. The lack of visibility in the caliche-filled water prevented students from seeing available exits. In addition, some students became trapped in the windows because of their large sizes, and multiple students attempted the same routes of egress at the same time. The NTSB named the small sizes of the exits as factors inhibiting escape. According to the NTSB, the available time was \\"inadequate time for 81 desperate students to escape through the available window openings and the rear emergency door that did not remain open before they were trapped underwater.\\" Agents from the U.S. Border Patrol and 125 emergency vehicles from various agencies assisted in the rescue. Aftermath and legacy An American football game scheduled for September 22 was converted into a memorial service held at the Mission stadium. The McAllen and Pharr-San Juan-Alamo districts also canceled their September 22 game. The driver of the truck, Ruben Perez, was charged in criminal court with 21 counts of homicide by negligence, but a jury acquitted him of all accounts in 1993. In February 1990 the bottling company made the first settlement with a victim's family. The bottling company paid a total of $133 million in settlements, and it gave each family $4.5 million per deceased victim. Blue Bird Body Company (now Blue Bird Corporation) also paid a total of $23 million in settlements. The lawyers for the plaintiffs of the lawsuits received about $50 million. About 30 brothers and sisters of deceased victims received trust funds ranging in size from $50,000 to $250,000, while parents received the remainder of, and the bulk of, the settlements for victims' relatives. Some community residents criticized some of the victims' families as they used the settlement money to make large automobile or house purchases, and some community members expected those receiving settlements to lend money to them; this caused estrangement between the recipients of the settlements and other community members. In May 1990 a guardrail system along FM 676 at the accident site was installed by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation, as the City of Alton had requested. Other guardrails were installed around area caliche pits. The 1991 novel The Sweet Hereafter received inspiration from the Alton bus crash; it was adapted into the 1997 film The Sweet Hereafter. Alton Memorial Junior High School in Alton was named in honor of the victims. On September 21, 2003 the school had its dedication ceremony.\\"History.\\" Alton Memorial Junior High School. Retrieved on August 2, 2018. In 2004 a park developed by the city of Alton as a memorial opened; it was funded by a Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) grant.

The film is directed by Jeff Fowler (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Pat Casey and Josh Miller. It stars Ben Schwartz as the voice of Sonic the Hedgehog and Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik, as well as James Marsden, Tika Sumpter, Natasha Rothwell, Adam Pally, and Neal McDonough. In the film, Sonic teams up with local town sheriff Tom Wachowski to find his lost rings and escape Dr. Robotnik. Development for a film began in the 1990s, but did not go beyond the planning stage until Sony Pictures acquired the film rights in 2013. Production involved the collaboration of Sega Sammy's Japanese studio Marza Animation Planet, with Fowler brought in to direct in 2016. After Sony put the project in turnaround, Paramount Pictures acquired it in 2017. The majority of the cast signed on by August 2018, and principal filming took place between September and October that year in Vancouver and on Vancouver Island. Following the negative reaction to the first trailer in 2019, the film's release was delayed by three months to redesign Sonic. Sonic the Hedgehog premiered at the Paramount Pictures studio lot on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 14, 2020. Critics praised the performances (particularly that of Schwartz and Carrey), Sonic's character design and animation, visual effects, action scenes, and its faithfulness to the source material, but criticized its story for its perceived lack of originality. The film set the record for the biggest opening weekend for a video game film in the United States and Canada. It grossed $308 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2020, and the highest-grossing video game film adaptation of all time in North America. A sequel is scheduled to be released on April 8, 2022. Plot Sonic, a blue hedgehog who can run at supersonic speeds, finds himself sought after by a tribe of echidnas for his power. His guardian, Longclaw the Owl, gives him a bag of rings that open portals to other planets. She uses one to send him to Earth while she fends off the echidnas. Ten years later, Sonic enjoys a secret life near the town of Green Hills, Montana, but longs to make friends. He idolizes the local sheriff, Tom Wachowski, and his veterinarian wife, Maddie, unaware the pair are planning to relocate to San Francisco soon, as Tom has been hired by the San Francisco Police Department. One night, Sonic becomes upset over his loneliness when playing baseball by himself, and runs at supersonic speed as a result, inadvertently triggering an electromagnetic pulse that knocks out power across the Pacific Northwest. Roboticist and scientific genius Dr. Robotnik is enlisted by the United States Department of Defense to uncover the source of the outage. Robotnik discovers and tracks Sonic, who hides in the Wachowskis' shed. Tom discovers Sonic and shoots him with a tranquilizer dart, causing Sonic to drop his bag of rings through a portal to San Francisco. Tom reluctantly agrees to help Sonic before Robotnik arrives at the Wachowskis' house and the two flee. As the pair evade Robotnik, who labels Tom a domestic terrorist, they slowly bond, with Tom learning about Sonic's desire for a real friend. Having discovered one of Sonic's quills, Robotnik discovers the power in it has the potential to fuel his robots, and becomes obsessed with capturing Sonic. As he tracks them down, Tom discusses his plans to leave Green Hills, and Sonic disapproves. Shortly after defeating a robot sent by Robotnik, an explosion injures Sonic. Arriving at San Francisco, Tom brings him to Maddie, who revives him. While Tom explains about their situation to Maddie, Sonic receives a new pair of sneakers from Maddie's niece. The group soon head to the roof of the Transamerica Pyramid, where Sonic's bag of rings landed, and recover them. Robotnik arrives in a hovercraft and attacks them, forcing Sonic to use a ring to send Tom and Maddie back to Green Hills. Sonic flees from Robotnik, who uses the power of Sonic's quill to match his speed. The two engage in a chase across the world, ultimately returning to Green Hills. Robotnik incapacitates Sonic, but Tom intervenes, allowing Sonic to regain his strength and reclaim his lost energy. Overcoming Robotnik, Sonic defeats him by sending him to a mushroom planet. Following the incident, Tom and Maddie decide to stay in Green Hills and let Sonic live with them. The government erases all evidence of the events, including records of Robotnik's existence. Meanwhile, Robotnik, still in possession of Sonic's quill, begins plotting his revenge. On Earth, Tails, a fox from Sonic's world, emerges from a ring portal in search of Sonic.

Production  = Development = Development for a film adaptation of the Sonic the Hedgehog video games began in 1993 during production of DIC Entertainment's television show Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. Michealene Risley, the newly appointed consumer products director who helped license the character for Adventures, negotiated with several Hollywood producers. Sega CEO Tom Kalinske, however, was wary of damaging the brand and deemed it unacceptable, citing the commercial and critical failures of the Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter films. Despite Kalinske's concerns, Sega was enthusiastic about a film adaptation. In August 1994, Sega struck a development deal with MGM and Trilogy Entertainment Group, with Pen Densham as the executive producer of the film. MGM and Sega hired Richard Jefferies, an associate of Risley from her days at Marvel Comics, to write a film treatment. At the time, Sega was developing Sonic X-treme (which was cancelled in late 1996) for its next console, the Sega Saturn, and asked Jefferies to feature the Saturn in the screenplay. Jefferies' treatment, entitled Sonic the Hedgehog: Wonders of the World, was submitted in May 1995. While the draft received a positive response among MGM and Sega executives, Sega COO Shinobu Toyoda suggested Kalinske replace Robotnik with a meaner villain. MGM canceled the project after a failed attempt to revive the film at DreamWorks; Jeffries suggested that the film was scrapped as both Sega and MGM wanted a higher share of the profits, while Densham said it followed creative differences between Sega and Trilogy. In 2013, Sony Pictures Entertainment acquired the rights to produce and distribute a film based on Sonic the Hedgehog. On June 10, 2014, a live-action animated film was announced as a joint venture between Sony Pictures and Marza Animation Planet, a Japan-based subsidiary of Sega Sammy Group who had produced pre-rendered cutscenes for several Sonic the Hedgehog games. It would be produced by Neal H. Moritz by his Original Film banner alongside Takeshi Ito, Mie Onishi, and Toru Nakahara, and written by Evan Susser and Van Robichaux. In February 2016, Sega CEO Hajime Satomi said the film was scheduled for 2018. Blur Studio's Tim Miller and Jeff Fowler were hired in 2016 to develop it; Fowler would make his feature directorial debut, and Miller and Fowler would executive produce. Patrick Casey, Josh Miller, and Oren Uziel were writing the screenplay, while Casey and Miller wrote the story. On October 2, 2017, Paramount Pictures announced that they had acquired the rights after Sony's Columbia Pictures put the film into a turnaround. Almost all of the production team remained unchanged and intact. In February 2018, it was announced that the film would be released in November 2019. Early drafts for the film featured Sonic's \\"Super Sonic\\" form from the video games. However, the ideas was discarded, as Fowler felt \\"[i]t didn't make sense to obviously bring in the Super Sonic thing just yet\\", and wanted the film to focus on the origins of Sonic and Robotnik's relationship. Early drafts also featured more scenes in Sonic's world, with Tails being presented as Sonic's best friend in his world. Another draft also featured Tails as a main character in the film. However, Tails' role was eventually reduced to a cameo in a post-credits scene when the filmmakers choose to develop the story around Sonic being alone on Earth, and choose to instead use Tails in order to tease a potential sequel. = Casting = On May 29, 2018, it was reported that Paul Rudd was in talks for a lead role as Tom, \\"a cop who befriends Sonic and will likely team up to defeat Dr. Robotnik\\", but was later denied. A day later, it was announced that James Marsden was cast in an undisclosed role, but later revealed to be Tom Wachowski. In June 2018, Tika Sumpter was cast as Tom's wife. Jim Carrey was cast to play the villain, Dr. Robotnik. In August 2018, Ben Schwartz joined as the voice of Sonic. Schwartz, a fan of the original video games, was chosen for the role after Fowler and Miller casted him for a test reading as they pitched the project to several studios. Having enjoyed his performance, they officially casted Schwartz as the voice of Sonic. A few days after Schwartz' casting, Adam Pally and Neal McDonough were cast. Debs Howard and Elfina Luk joined the cast the following November. Riff Raff was cast in an undisclosed role, but was cut from the film. = Filming = Principal photography began in mid-September 2018 and ended in Vancouver, Ladysmith, and Vancouver Island on October 16, 2018. Post-production and additional photography took place in October in New York, where Carrey shot his scenes. Key production scenes were also filmed in Liwa Oasis, United Arab Emirates. = Visual effects and design = Comparison of Sonic's design in both trailers: Original in April's trailer (top); Edited in November's trailer (bottom) The visual effects are provided by Moving Picture Company (MPC), Marza Animation Planet, Blur Studio, Trixter, and Digital Domain. The production team created a realistic version of Sonic using computer animation, adding fur, new running sneakers, two separate eyes, and a more humanlike physique. They used Ted, the living teddy bear from the Ted films, as a reference to insert a CGI character into a real-world setting. Executive producer Miller said: \\"It would be weird and it would feel like he was running around nude if he was some sort of otter-like thing. It was always, for us, fur, and we never considered anything different. It's part of what integrates him into the real world and makes him a real creature.\\" According to Miller, Sega was not \\"entirely happy\\" with the design of Sonic's eyes. According to animator Max Schneider, Paramount expected that Sonic fans would object to the redesign but that general audiences would not care, as had been the case with their 2014 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film. He said Paramount felt the design gelled with the real-world setting and characters. On May 2, 2019, in response to the near-universal criticism of the design, Fowler announced on Twitter that Sonic would be redesigned. The film was delayed from its original release date of November 8 to February 14, 2020 as a result. Artist Tyson Hesse, who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog media, was brought on to lead the redesign. Sonic was given larger and differently colored eyes, new sneakers, white gloves, and a less humanlike body to better resemble Sonic's video game design. Sonic was redesigned by the Japan-based Marza Animation Planet. The redesign added an estimated $5 million to the production budget, took around five months, and was achieved without stressful overtime. = Music = In February 2019, Tom Holkenborg, who previously worked with executive producer Miller on Deadpool, was hired to compose the score. The soundtrack was released alongside the film on February 14, 2020 in both digital and physical formats. Riff Raff, who had a role in the film but was cut, appears on the soundtrack. An original song, \\"Speed Me Up\\" by Wiz Khalifa, Ty Dolla Sign, Lil Yachty, and Sueco the Child, appears on the soundtrack; the single was released on January 24 by Atlantic Records. \\"Speed Me Up\\" received 15million streams, along with 1.8billion views for the \\"Speed Me Up\\" TikTok challenge. \\"Friends\\" by Hyper Potions, which previously appeared as the opening theme of Sonic Mania, also appears, along with arrangements of tracks from Masato Nakamura's score for the original Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). Holkenborg attempted to capture the feel of Nakamura's soundtracks for the Sonic and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (1992) games, using Yamaha FM synthesizers similar to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console's YM2612 sound chip.  Release  Sonic the Hedgehog was originally scheduled to be released sometime in 2018 by Sony Pictures Releasing, but in February 2018, shortly after taking over the rights, Paramount Pictures rescheduled it to November 15, 2019. The film was later moved a week earlier to November 8, 2019. Following the announcement of Sonic's redesign in May 2019, director Jeff Fowler announced that the film would again be delayed to February 14, 2020, to get \\"a little more time to make Sonic just right.\\" The film's world premiere took place at the Paramount Theatre in Los Angeles on January 25, 2020. =Marketing= Sonic’s initial design was heavily criticized for his humanoid appearance, prompting Fowler to delay the film's release for a further three months to redesign the character. Test footage was screened at the Comic Con Experience in Brazil on December 6, 2018, and was followed by a teaser poster was released on December 10, 2018, revealing the silhouette design of Sonic. It received a predominantly negative response from critics and fans, and was compared unfavorably to another 2019 video game film adaptation, Detective Pikachu, which had added fur and skin textures to the Pokémon characters. Sonic's humanoid appearance was described as evoking an uncanny valley response. Former members of Sonic Team, who created the Sonic the Hedgehog games, also expressed surprise. A second poster was leaked online shortly after. Fans complained of a lack of resemblance to the games and criticized the positioning of Sonic's legs, spawning an Internet meme in which users recreated the position. The film's official Twitter account posted an image of Sonic behind a sign reading: \\"Can't a guy work out?\\" Images of the Sonic design were leaked in March 2019 to more fan criticism. Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka was \\"shocked\\" by the design and felt the ratio of Sonic's head and abdomen was imbalanced. The first trailer premiered on April 4, 2019, at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, and was released online on April 30. It received near-unanimous criticism, with Gita Jackson of Kotaku calling it \\"horrific\\" and \\"a blight upon this weary earth\\". Sonic's design was heavily criticized for its humanoid appearance, while some writers found the use of Coolio's \\"Gangsta's Paradise\\" jarring. Conversely, CNET's Sean Keane praised the humor and references to the games. Within two days, the trailer was viewed more than 20million times on YouTube, and had received hundreds of thousands of \\"dislike\\" ratings, drastically outnumbering the \\"like\\" ratings. A second trailer revealing the redesigned Sonic was released on November 12, 2019. The trailer received far more positive responses, with many praising Sonic's new design. The tone and the humor also received positive reviews as well as the choice of song with J. J. Fad's \\"Supersonic\\". Naka said he felt the new design was \\"much more Sonic-like\\". The second trailer received thousand of likes and the highest like-to-dislike ratio of any trailer on Google in the last three years. The film's trailers have garnered a total of more than 500million views worldwide. As a promotional tie-in, the version of Sonic seen in the film was added as a playable character to the Sonic Dash and Sonic Forces mobile games. =Home media= On March 20, 2020, Paramount announced that Sonic the Hedgehog would be released to home media in the United States and Canada before the end of the usual 90-day theatrical run, as many film studios took the decision to release films earlier due to movie theaters closures in mid March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The digital version was released on March 31, with Blu-ray, 4K Ultra HD, and DVD versions following on May 19. All home media releases include an original short film entitled Around the World in 80 Seconds. Reception =Box office= Sonic the Hedgehog grossed $146.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $162.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $308.4 million. It is currently the fourth highest-grossing film of 2020. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Fantasy Island, The Photograph, and Downhill, and was initially projected to gross $40–50 million from 4,130 theaters in its four-day President's Day opening weekend. After making $21 million on its first day (including $3 million from Thursday night previews), estimates were raised to $64 million. It went on to top the box office with a $58 million debut over the three-day weekend, and $70 million over the four, breaking Detective Pikachus record for the biggest opening weekend by a video game- based film. It was also the fourth-best President's Day holiday weekend and Jim Carrey's second biggest opening weekend, behind Bruce Almighty (2003). The film's success was contributed in part to the redesign of the lead character and the publicity it created, and the resulting delay to the film's release that allowed it to open during a peak time when it would face less competition from other family films.

Sonic the Hedgehog made $16.3 million in its third weekend and was dethroned by newcomer The Invisible Man.

Sonic the Hedgehog was released in 40 countries during its three-day opening weekend, topping the international box office with . Its strongest international regions were Latin America and Europe, with its largest openings being in Mexico, in the United Kingdom, in France, in Germany, and in Brazil.

The film opened in 16 new markets, led by a number-one debut in Russia (). The film was released in Japan on June 26, 2020 after being postponed from a previous March release due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and debuted at #6 that weekend. In China, the release was also postponed due to the pandemic, eventually receiving a July 31 date and underperforming at the Chinese box office due to new pandemic-related theatre policies there. =Critical response= Jim Carrey (pictured in 2008) was praised by critics for his performance as Dr. Robotnik, who compared it to the energetic roles from earlier in his career. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 63%, based on 236 reviews, with an average rating of 5.84/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Fittingly fleet and frequently fun, Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game-inspired adventure the whole family can enjoyand a fine excuse for Jim Carrey to tap into the manic energy that launched his career.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 4 out of 5 stars, with 70% of viewers they surveyed saying they would definitely recommend it. Akeem Lawanson of IGN gave the film a score of 7 out of 10, praising the performances and the nostalgia, stating, \\"While this family-friendly action- comedy suffers from a simplistic story and leans too heavily on tired visual clichés, Sonic the Hedgehog is nevertheless boosted by solid performances from Ben Schwartz as Sonic and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Their ongoing cat-and- mouse game is entertaining, and passionate fans of the Sega franchise should appreciate all the nods to Sonic's history.\\" Dami Lee of The Verge gave the film a positive review, praising the nostalgic elements seen in the film, writing that it \\"shines when it remembers it's based on a video game, and there's some genuinely fun stuff—like when Sonic uses his time-stopping powers or Robotnik's elaborate 'evil-plotting' montage that makes you wonder why more movies don't feature bad guys with choreographed dance sequences. Carrey plays up Robotnik as the cartoon villain he is, and it's a true delight to watch him in his element.\\" Corey Plante of Inverse called it a \\"road trip superhero movie\\" and \\"the best superhero movie of 2020\\" so far. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter, gave the film a positive review, saying: \\"Flesh-and-blood actors help keep this game-derived kids' flick afloat.\\" Gene Park of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying, \\"The Sonic the Hedgehog film is the furthest thing from Cats, despite the early comparisons. Wary fans expecting the usual easy target to mock will instead find something to fervently celebrate for years.\\" Amon Warrman of Empire gave the film two out of five stars, writing, \\"An on-form Jim Carrey can't stop Sonic's live- action debut from feeling like a missed opportunity. If the teased sequels do materialize, here's hoping the storytelling levels up.\\" Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave the film a negative review and wrote, \\"Sonic now resembles a cartoon hedgehog instead of a spray-painted marmot. But if anything was done to de-genericize the script, it hasn't helped. Not that the Sega games—in which the fleet-footed hero zips around doing flips and collecting gold coins (which here encircle the Paramount mountain)—gave the director, Jeff Fowler, much to work with.\\" Varietys Owen Gleiberman criticized the tone: \\"For all the borderline tedium I felt at Sonic the Hedgehog, I do realize that this is a picture made for 8-year-olds. And they'll probably like it just fine. Yet I would also call the overly kiddified tone of the movie a mistake.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Steve Rose gave the film two out of five, saying elements were \\"clearly indebted\\" to other films, such as Quicksilver's powers in the X-Men movies, and finding the message of friendship \\"trite and familiar\\". Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com gave the film one out of four, writing, \\"Sonic the Hedgehog is only as successful as the amount of time you want to spend watching its animated protagonist go on instantly forgettable adventures, and boy, is that unfortunate.\\" Sequel In a promotional interview for the film, Carrey said he could imagine developing Robotnik for a sequel: \\"I wouldn't mind going to do another one because it was so much fun, first of all, and a real challenge to try to convince people that I have a triple-digit IQ... There is so much room, you know, Robotnik has not reached his apotheosis.\\" In February 2020, Fowler said planned a potential sequel to feature more elements from the video games. In March 2020, Marsden confirmed that he had signed on for multiple sequels, stating, \\"I believe, I don't know if I'm supposed to say, as many as they want to make. Yeah, that's my somewhat vague answer.\\" In April 2020, Marsden expressed interest in a sequel featuring Tails and additional characters from the games, while Fowler expressed interest in featuring Sonic and Tails' friendship from the games and further developing Robotnik. Later that month, Schwartz said he felt a sequel's lack of announcement makes sense because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Co-writer Pat Casey said there had been talks about a sequel featuring more elements from the games, but that it had not been approved yet. He expressed interest in a shared universe featuring both Sega and Nintendo characters, but saw it as unlikely. A sequel was announced on May 28, 2020, with Fowler returning as director and Casey and Miller returning as writers. It was also confirmed that Tim Miller, Hajime Satomi, and Haruki Satomi will also be returning as executive producers and Neal H. Mortiz, Toby Ascher, and Toru Nakahara as producers. The sequel has been scheduled for a release on April 8, 2022.

It contains estradiol valerate (EV), an estrogen, and hydroxyprogesterone caproate (OHPC), a progestin. The medication is given by injection into muscle once a day to once a month depending on the indication. Medical uses EV/OHPC has been used in the treatment of threatened miscarriage (habitual abortion) and for other indications under the brand name Gravibinon among others in Europe and Latin America. The combination has also been used as a form of pseudopregnancy (high-dose estrogen/progestogen therapy), for instance to treat osteopenia due to hypogonadism, to induce feminization in hypogonadism/delayed puberty, and as a means of hormonal breast enhancement to produce breast enlargement. EV/OHPC is administered daily to once per week or less often for the treatment of threatened miscarriage, for use as a form of pseudopregnancy, and for other indications. EV/OHPC is used as a combined injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women under the brand name Injectable No. 1 (or Chinese Injectable No. 1) in China as well. When used as a combined injectable contraceptive, EV/OHPC is given twice in the first month and then once per month thereafter. =Available forms= EV/OHPC is available for general use (e.g., as Gravibinon) in the form of ampoules containing 5 to 10 mg estradiol valerate (EV) and 250 to 500 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate (OHPC). It is available for use as a combined injectable contraceptive specifically at a dose of 5 mg EV and 250 mg OHPC. Side effects EV/OHPC as a combined injectable contraceptive has a relatively short duration and is associated with a high incidence of menstrual irregularity, for instance polymenorrhea (short and hence fast cycles). This may be unacceptable to many women. Twice-monthly administration of half doses has not been found to improve breakthrough bleeding, though cycle length increased to 20 to 24 days. History EV/OHPC was reportedly first introduced for medical use in 1955. The medication was developed by Schering and marketed under the brand name Gravibinon for the treatment of habitual abortion in Europe by the late 1960s. EV/OHPC was the first combined injectable contraceptive to be studied. It was first evaluated by Siegel and colleagues in 1963. The doses used in their study were 10 mg EV and 500 mg OHPC. Around the same time as the Siegel study, a half-dose formulation containing 5 mg EV and 250 mg OHPC was developed and subsequently marketed for use in China under the brand name Injectable No. 1 (or Chinese Injectable No. 1). The formulation was also reported to be marketed in a few countries neighboring China. EV/OHPC was also studied at the same dose by a \\"major European pharmaceutical company\\" in 1971, but was found to produce short menstrual cycles of 17 to 18 days with once-monthly administration and 20 to 24 days with twice-monthly administration. As a result of these menstrual disturbances, the company abandoned development of the formulation. EV/OHPC was one of only two combined injectable contraceptives to have been marketed by 1976, and was one of only three combined injectable contraceptives with considerable clinical experience by 1976. The others were estradiol enanthate/algestone acetophenide (E2-EN/DHPA; brand names Perlutal, Topasel), which had been marketed in Spain and Latin America, and estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate (EC/MPA; code name Cyclo-Provera), which was still experimental by 1976 and did not become formally available for clinical use until the 1990s. By 1994, at which point EC/MPA (brand names Cyclofem and later Lunelle) and estradiol valerate/norethisterone enanthate (EV/NETE; brand name Mesigyna) had been introduced, EV/OHPC had been in use for many years. EV/OHPC and E2-EN/DHPA have been referred to as first- generation combined injectable contraceptives, while EC/MPA and EV/NETE have been referred to as second-generation combined injectable contraceptives. Society and culture =Brand names= EV/OHPC has been marketed under the brand names Deluteval (or Deluteval 2X), Gravibinon, Gravibinan, Gravidinona, and Gestadinona for the treatment of threatened abortion and other general uses. It has been marketed under the brand name Injectable No. 1 or Chinese Injectable No. 1 for use as a combined injectable contraceptive. =Availability= EV/OHPC is marketed under the brand names Gravidinona in Mexico and Gestadinona in Brazil for threatened abortion.https://www.drugs.com/international/hydroxyprogesterone.htmlhttp://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2/librarian/ It was also marketed under the brand name Gravidinona in Chile but was discontinued in this country. EV/OHPC was also marketed under the brand names Gravibinon (Schering) in Austria, Belgium, and Germany and Gravibinan (Schering) in France, Italy, and Turkey for threatened abortion as well, but has been discontinued in these countries. EV/OHPC is marketed for use as a combined injectable contraceptive under the brand name Injectable No. 1 or Chinese Injectable No.1 in the China. =Usage= It was estimated in 1995 that EV/OHPC had been used as a combined injectable contraceptive in China by about 1 million women. However, combined injectable contraceptives like EV/OHPC are unlikely to constitute a large proportion of contraceptive use in the countries in which they are available.

The record also notes that van Dapels was a citizen of Brussels. The last firm information about the artist is another record in the books of the Brussels Guild of St. Luke dated 1669 which lists him on becoming a master of the Guild.

Work River landscape with hikers and people gathering brushwood Philip van Dapels was a landscape painter who specialized in wooded landscapes with figures. He has only been rediscovered not so long ago and very few works have been attributed to him. These include two works with the monogram 'PVD' in private collections. Two more works, recently in auctions, have also been attributed to the artist.Philip van Dapels, River landscape with hikers and people gathering brushwood, Hampel Munich auction of 30 June 2006, lot 428Philip van Dapels, Forest landscape with figures, Hampel Munich auction of 21 September 2007, lot 414 His works are close to those of Cornelis Huysmans, although they are more quiet and posed. His themes are those already covered by the masters of the Brussels school of landscape painting (also referred to as the School of Painters of the Sonian Forest). This School included painters like Lodewijk de Vadder, Jacques d'Arthois and Lucas Achtschellinck who often depicted the woods and sand banks in the Sonian Forest near Brussels. Van Dapels' style is distinguished by a rather mechanical touch in his depiction of foliage and a palette limited to browns and greens. Van Dapels and Cornelis Huysmans, as well as Cornelis' brother Jan Baptist Huysmans form the last generation of the School of Painters of the Sonian Forest.

It contains estradiol enantate (E2-EN), an estrogen, and algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide; DHPA), a progestin. The medication is given once a month by injection into muscle. E2-EN/DHPA is used widely throughout Latin America, is also marketed in Hong Kong, and was previously available in Portugal and Spain as well but was discontinued in these countries. Medical uses E2-EN/DHPA is used in combination as a once- monthly combined injectable contraceptive to prevent pregnancy in women in Latin America and Hong Kong. E2-EN/DHPA has been said to be used by \\"travestis\\" (a term for transgender women in some cultures, especially in South America) as a means of feminizing hormone therapy as well. =Available forms= The following forms of E2-EN/DHPA are or have been available for use: * E2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 150 mg (brand names Perlutal, Topasel, many others) * E2-EN 5 mg and DHPA 75 mg (brand names Anafertin, Patector NF, Yectames) * E2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 120 mg (brand names Unalmes, Yectuna) * E2-EN 10 mg and DHPA 75 mg (brand name Ova Repos; discontinued) A 6 mg E2-EN and 90 mg DHPA formulation was also studied, but was never marketed. The combination of E2-EN and DHPA has also been studied at other doses ranging from 5 to 50 mg E2-EN and 75 to 200 mg DHPA. Pharmacology =Pharmacology= Clinical studies have found that, on the basis of endometrial changes, E2-EN/DHPA appears, at the doses used, to be an estrogen-dominant combination. =Pharmacokinetics= By intramuscular injection, the elimination half-life of E2-EN has been found to be 5.6 to 7.5 days, while the half-life of algestone acetophenide and its metabolites has been found to be 24 days. Following a single injection, E2-EN and DHPA are detectable in the circulation for up to 30 to 60 days. History E2-EN/DHPA was first studied as a combined injectable contraceptive in 1964. It was developed by Squibb under the developmental code name and tentative brand name Deladroxate for potential use as a combined injectable contraceptive in the United States. Due to toxicological findings of DHPA of pituitary hyperplasia in rats, mammary tumors in beagle dogs, and \\"uterine swellings\\" in animals, as well as concerns about possible accumulation of DHPA, Squibb discontinued the development of E2-EN/DHPA in the late 1960s. Subsequently, in 1973, a pharmacokinetic study of E2-EN/DHPA in women generated concerns about potential accumulation of E2-EN with once- monthly use as well. In spite of these concerns however, no toxicity or tumorigenicity has been observed with E2-EN/DHPA in humans in extensive clinical studies, and there are doubts about the relevance of the animal findings to humans. In addition, only very limited accumulation of E2-EN has been found to occur with the preparation. Manufacturers in other countries, including EuroPharma, Farmitalia, and Promeco, resumed development of E2-EN/DHPA following the discontinuation of its development by Squibb, and introduced it for clinical use as a combined injectable contraceptive, under the brand names Perlutal and Topasel, in Spain and Latin America in the 1970s. It was one of only two combined injectable contraceptives to have been marketed by 1976, and was one of only three combined injectable contraceptives with considerable clinical experience by 1976. The others were estradiol valerate/hydroxyprogesterone caproate (EV/OHPC; brand name Injectable No. 1), which had been marketed in China, and estradiol cypionate/medroxyprogesterone acetate (EC/MPA; code name Cyclo-Provera), which was still experimental by 1976 and did not become formally available for clinical use until the 1990s.

E2-EN/DHPA and EV/OHPC have been referred to as first-generation combined injectable contraceptives, while EC/MPA and EV/NETE have been referred to as second- generation combined injectable contraceptives. Society and culture =Brand names= E2-EN has been marketed under a wide variety of brand names. It has been marketed in a few different preparations, with varying doses of E2-EN and DHPA.

Morozov joined the Red Army during the Russian Civil War as a teenager, and following the end of the war served in the Caucasus region, rising to command positions in the cavalry. During the mid-1930s he was moved to the far east of Russia, to take several peacetime commands and deputy commands, and served as a battalion chief of staff at the Battle of Lake Khasan. He reached the rank of colonel before taking over what would eventually be the 422nd Rifle Division, the highest-numbered such division to actually see combat in the Soviet-German War. In recognition of the 422nd's achievements in Operation Ring, it was re-designated as the 81st Guards Rifle Division on March 1, 1943, and Morozov was promoted to the rank of major general the same day. He continued to lead the 81st Guards until September 14, returning to command on December 12. He remained there until November 11, 1944, when he was replaced. Morozov was retired from the Soviet Army on February 15, 1955, due to illness. During his retirement he lived in Voronezh and Stalingrad (Volgograd) and wrote several volumes of memoirs before he died on July 11, 1979. Early life and Russian Civil War Morozov was born on January 6, 1905 at the Kagalnitskaya stanitsa in the Don Host Oblast, and graduated from a parochial school in 1914. In June 1918 he joined the Red Army in Rakov (now Novobataisk) during the Russian Civil War. Serving as a Red Army man and a scout in the Sreda detachment of the 1st Peasant Regiment, Morozov fought against the Volunteer Army and the White Cossacks at Kushevka in the Don Host Oblast, and in the Kuban on the Manych. The detachment was defeated in March 1919 and Morozov with a group of fighters escaped towards Bataysk. Having linked up with Red Army units south of Rostov, he became a scout in the 3rd Squadron of the 20th Salsk Cavalry Regiment in the 4th Cavalry Division, which subsequently became part of the 1st Cavalry Army. With the army, Morozov fought in battles at Tsaritsyn, the Voronezh–Kastornoye operation, the Kharkiv operation, the Donbass operation (1919), the Rostov–Novocherkassk operation, the North Caucasus operation, and the Battle of Yegorlykskaya. He was thrice wounded, in 1919 at Malyy Bal and Sinyavinskaya, and in 1920 at Yekaterinoslav. With the division, from May 1920 he fought in the Polish–Soviet War, participating in engagements at Zhytomyr, Novohrad-Volynskyi, Lviv, and Zamość. Following the Soviet defeat in the war the division transferred to Crimea to fight in the Perekop-Chongar Offensive against White forces in November, then fought against the anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. For his actions, Morozov was awarded a ceremonial shashka by the Revolutionary Military Council in 1922.  Interwar period  From June 1923 he served in the 25th Novocherkassk Rifle Regiment of the 9th Don Rifle Division in the North Caucasus Military District. Between April 1923 and April 1924 Morozov studied at the 11th courses for Red Army commanders in Novocherkassk. Upon his return to the regiment, he served as a section commander, company starshina, and commander of a mounted reconnaissance platoon. On November 20, 1927 he became a cadet in the North Caucasus Mountain Peoples Cavalry School in Krasnodar, rising to successively become assistant platoon commander, starshina of the 2nd squadron, and acting cadet commander at the school. In 1930 he participated in the suppression of a revolt in the Karachay Autonomous Oblast, before graduating in May of that year. Assigned to the 77th Buzuluk Cavalry Regiment of the 10th Cavalry Division in Mozdok, Morozov became a platoon commander in the machine gun squadron and regimental school, political officer of the 5th Squadron, and commander and political officer of a squadron. Morozov was placed at the disposal of the head of the Yeysk Naval Flying School on August 11, 1934, before transferring to the Far East to become assistant chief of staff and commandant of the 30th Naval Cruiser Aviation Squadron, part of the Pacific Fleet at Sukhodol Bay. He was seconded to the sixth department of the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army in late May 1935, then made commander and commissar of a separate cavalry squadron in the 1st Pacific Rifle Division, stationed in the Far Eastern Krai. Morozov became chief of staff of a separate reconnaissance battalion of the 39th Rifle Division (the former 1st Pacific Rifle Division) in April 1936, which later became part of the 1st Red Banner Army. Between August 5 and 30, 1938, Morozov fought with the battalion in the Battle of Lake Khasan. He was appointed chief of staff of the 116th Rifle Regiment of the division in October but did not serve in the position due to his being on leave. Morozov became chief of staff of the 84th Cavalry Regiment of the 31st Cavalry Division, part of the 1st Red Banner Army at Lazo in December 1938, then took command of the 79th Cavalry Regiment of the division in August 1939; the regiment was soon renumbered as the 12th Altai Cavalry. In March, 1941, he was given command of the 29th Motorcycle Regiment of Far Eastern Front's 30th Mechanized Corps.Valeriy Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, Helion & Co., Ltd, Solihull, UK, 2017, p. 156. Zamulin incorrectly identifies the unit as the 29th Reconnaissance Battalion, though no unit with that designation was part of the corps.  World War II  In January, 1942, Morozov became deputy commander of the 66th Rifle Division in 35th Army of the Far Eastern Front, but on March 4 he took command of the new 422nd Rifle Division, in the same Army. At the time, the commander of 35th Army, Major Geneneral Vladimir Aleksandrovich Zaitsev,http://www.generals.dk/general/Zaitsev/Vladimir_Aleksandrovich/Soviet_Union.html described Morozov as follows:In July, the 422nd was transferred to the Stalingrad area by rail, where it joined the Stalingrad Front. As part of the 4th Tank Army, it fought in the defeat of German troops around Buzinovskaya between August 3–4. On August 4, the division transferred to the 57th Army and fought in fierce defensive battles, covering the southern approaches to the city. At the end of August, the division defended the line of Tundutovo and Chapurniki, before transferring to the 64th Army less the 1334th Rifle Regiment, on the night of September 18–19. It concentrated on the northern outskirts of Beketovka, then fought in heavy fighting in the Kuporosnoe area. The 422nd advanced from the Gornaya Polyana area towards Yelshanka and the northwestern outskirts of the city centre during the second half of October with an army shock group tasked with capturing Kuporosnoe, Yelshanka and the southern part of Stalingrad to the Darnitsa River, then clearing the city centre of German troops to link up with the 62nd Army. It returned to the 57th Army on November 6, and was relocated to the area to the west of Krasnoarmeysk on November 7–8. Morozov led his division through Operation Uranus, the Soviet counteroffensive at Stalingrad, beginning in the second half of November. By the end of November 22, advancing in conjunction with the 169th Rifle Division, the division had broken Axis resistance and reached the line of Nariman and Gavrilovka. It then advanced to the line of Tsybenko and Rakotino to relieve the encircled 13th Tank Corps. The 422nd repulsed fierce Axis counterattacks from 25 November while holding Kravtsov. At the beginning of December it was withdrawn into the army reserve, covering the front from Chervlenaya River to Tsybenko and Novy Rogachik. It went back into combat with the 64th Army between 4 and 15 December, then withdrew into front reserve before returning to the 57th Army on 16 December. As part of the Stalingrad Front and then the Don Front from 1 January 1943, the division fought in Operation Ring, the destruction of German troops trapped in the pocket created by Operation Uranus. On January 29, he personally took the surrender of Lieutenant General Edler von Daniels and his 376th Infantry Division in the ruins of the city.David M. Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2004, p. 550 Following the end of the battle, the division transferred to the 64th Army, which became part of the operational group of Lieutenant General Kuzma Trubnikov; the latter became the Stalingrad Group of Forces on 27 February. For its actions, the 422nd became the 81st Guards Rifle Division on 1 March 1943; Morozov was promoted to major general on the next day. Shortly afterwards, the 81st Guards were transferred with the 64th Army (redesignated 7th Guards Army on 1 May) to the Voronezh Front, where they defended the Seversky Donets in the Belgorod area. The division became part of the 25th Guards Rifle Corps on 4 May. The division staged an especially strong defense during the Battle of Kursk in and near the Stari Gorod (Old Town) suburb of Belgorod from 5–9 July before being forced to break out of partial encirclement on 10 July due to the retreat of the forces on its flanks. On 27 August Morozov was recognized for his leadership with the award of the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd Class.Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, p. 473 The division transferred to the 48th Rifle Corps of the 69th Army on July 12, then back to the 7th Guards Army, now with the Steppe Front (renamed the 2nd Ukrainian on October 20), on July 29. Morozov subsequently led the 81st Guards in the Battle of Kursk, during which it fought in the Battle of Prokhorovka, the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation, and the Battle of the Dnieper. On September 14 he left his command, and was replaced by Col. Sergeii Grigorevich Nikolaiev five days later. Morozov returned to the 81st on December 12.Zamulin states, and Morozov's 1945 photo indicates, with his red wound stripe, that he received a severe wound at some point in his service after Kursk. He went on to lead the division in the recapture of Left-bank Ukraine, the Kirovograd Offensive, the Uman–Botoșani Offensive, the Jassy–Kishinev Offensive, and the advance into Romania and Bulgaria. He last led the division during the Battle of Debrecen in October 1944. In November 1944, Morozov was sent to study in the Higher Academic Courses at the Military Academy of the General Staff, and upon his graduation in April 1945, became a student at the main faculty of the academy.  Postwar  While still studying at the academy in October, Morozov was appointed commander of the 21st Guards Rifle Division, part of the 6th Guards Army in the Baltic Military District. He transferred to command the 51st Guards Rifle Division of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps in May 1946. After a period at the disposal of the Main Personnel Directorate from April 1950, he became head of the military department of the Stalingrad Agricultural Institute in December of that year, his last position before retirement in February 1955. He died in Volgograd on 11 July 1979.

Her older sister, Letifah, was stabbed in the neck but survived. Tashiya was not physically harmed. Cowell, aged 27, was identified as the suspect immediately following the attack, and he was caught the following day. Cowell had been paroled in May 2018 after serving time for second degree robbery, and had previous charges for assault and possession of methamphetamine. Initial perception of the attack as apparently racially-motivated spurred protests at MacArthur BART station and online. Cowell's parents stated their belief that the attack was possibly motivated by Cowell's mental illness. Authorities have yet to establish a motive for the attack and have also stated that there is no evidence that the attack was racially motivated. Background =Victims= Nia Wilson (1999-2018) was a cheerleader and a rapper. She dreamed of having a dance studio. She and her cousins were in a music group called Girlz N The Hood. The album \\"Fake Shit\\" was released post-Wilson's death; the group planned to reshoot the video shop they did not release it until after she passed. Fake Shit is now on iTunes. Wilson was known as being talented with makeup, and was known by the nickname PG (pretty girl). Nia recently graduated from Dewey Academy. Nia was the daughter of Ansar El Muhommad and Alicia Grayson. She is the youngest of six sisters (including Malika Harris, Letifah Wilson, Nishiya Wilson, Tashiya Wilson) and two brothers. Her cousin, Tijanae Lafleur, 19, has also spoken about Wilson's character and stated they had previously had a conversation on what he should do in the event that someone ever hurt her. Lafleur told reporters that Wilson told him to not let anyone who hurt her get away with it. Wilson's other cousin, Byron Brown, stated Wilson would have wanted more than one protest. He remembers her stating, “justice is never served when black people were killed.\\" At a 2016 vigil for her boyfriend and his best friend, who had drowned in a reservoir, a shot was fired into the crowd of 3000 hitting 16 year old Reggin’a Jefferies in the neck. Jefferies was standing right next to Wilson. Wilson stayed with Jefferies until medical help arrived. According to her father, she was set to graduate with honors from an Oakland continuation school, Dewey Academy. At the time of the attack, Letifah Wilson was aged 26. Diamond Rogers, 19, who is Wilson's cousin, is arguing for Wilson's murder to be prosecuted as a hate crime. Jada Rogers, Wilson’s 15-year-old cousin, also called for justice in the sentencing of John Cowell. Wilson's family created a GoFundMe titled Justice For Nia, which raised $91,000 in just 11 days (the original goal was $9,000). =Suspect= 27 year-old John Cowell has been described as a 5 feet, 8 inch tall white man. Cowell was raised in Concord, California where he lived on and off for years. Cowell's earliest brush with the law came when he was arrested for allegedly beating up a man and the man's daughter when he was 18. Four days before the stabbing, Cowell was confronted for not paying his BART fare. In 2016, Cowell had been found guilty of second degree robbery after he pulled a knife and a fake gun on a Lucky Store at El Cerrito Plaza after a security guard confronted him over stealing; he was arrested at El Cerrito BART Station, and was sentenced to two years in federal prison. Cowell had been released on parole in May 2018. Also in 2016 Cowell was arrested for petty theft, illegal possession of tear gas, possession of an illegal smoking device and drug possession, but these charges were dismissed due to the robbery conviction. In 2016, Kaiser Permanente Richmond Medical Center filed a restraining order against Cowell for threatening to kill one of their employees. Also, in 2015 Cowell's family filed a restraining order against him after he allegedly tried to enter their home while under the influence of drugs. Later that same year, Cowell was arrested for possession of a controlled substance after he was found high on methamphetamine and was sentenced to 90 days in jail. In 2013, Cowell was convicted of battery in Walnut Creek. In 2009, Cowell was arrested and charged with felony assault, for beating 51-year-old Shane Glick, and punching Glick's daughter after they confronted him about a recent burglary. Also, in both Alameda and Contra Costa counties, Cowell's arrest record lists charges of assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a controlled substance, vandalism and petty theft. He was arrested on July 23, 2018. Cowell was homeless before the attack. =Bay Area Rapid Transit= In five days, three unrelated homicides, including Wilson's murder, occurred at Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations. Violent crimes on BART have risen nearly 70 percent from 2007 to 2017. Hours after Wilson's funeral, another two people were stabbed at MacArthur BART station, causing the station to again be shut down. BART has stated they had been planning to make security improvements well before Nia Wilson's death. The plan involves massive security camera improvements. BART would need $15 million over four years to upgrade the current system to digital, $1.3 million per year to monitor the technology, and $4.9 million to install a Physical Security Information System (PSIM). The plan would cost $28 million total to implement.  Murder  =Event= On the night of July 22, 2018, Nia Wilson and two of her sisters (Letifah and Tashiya), were returning from a party at their aunt's in Concord, California. They had gotten on the train at Concord station and were transferring trains at MacArthur station, in order to go home. According to a BART spokesperson, the perpetrator also rode from Concord station. At approximately 9:30 pm at MacArthur station, the perpetrator slashed Nia's throat and stabbed her older sister Letifah in the neck. The attacker was silent and stood back watching as Nia bled out and died while Letifah, who survived with a serious neck wound, held her. Tashiya was not physically harmed. The perpetrator then fled. Police identified John Cowell based on security cameras at the scene, a backpack with Cowell's identification inside, and witness statements of him wiping the knife clean and fleeing after the attack. = Motive = The motive for the attack has not yet been identified. The Wilson sisters told reporters they had never seen Cowell before the stabbing. Activists and news outlets speculated the attack could have been racially motivated. Mayor Libby Schaaf released the statement: “The fact that his victims were both young African-American women stirs deep pain and palpable fear in all of us who acknowledge the reality that our country still suffers from a tragic and deeply racist history,” while still confirming the city \\"has no room for hate and the city stands against racial hatred and white supremacy,\\" but reinforced that officials have no evidence that the killing of Wilson was racially motivated. Bart Police Chief Rojas stated this was the \\"most vicious attack he had ever seen\\" during his 30-year police career. Cowell's parents released a public statement where they claimed the attack was possibly motivated by Cowell's mental illness. Cowell had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Wilson's family, and activists maintain the attack was targeted and racially motivated. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that Cowell, and a black friend have matching tattoos. The New Yorker has stated that the tattoo is not an indicator of whether or not the murder was a hate crime. = Arrest and trial = John Cowell was arrested on July 23, 2018, at Pleasant Hill BART Station at 6:27 p.m. A witness is reportedly responsible for his apprehension; the witness saw Cowell at the station and called the police. Cowell was then booked on charges of first-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon and violation of parole. His arraignment was scheduled for July 26, 2018, but was postponed until August 22. Cowell is currently being held at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin without bail. On August 22, 2018, Alameda County prosecutors added a charge of lying in wait. The added charge means if convicted, he would face life without parole or even the possibility of the death penalty. Cowell's lawyers requested more time to review the evidence, and the plea entry date was postponed until September 14, 2018. On September 14, 2018, attorneys further delayed entering a plea. The plea entry was delayed until the date of October 26, 2018. Specifically the defense is waiting for the prosecution to release the video of the fatal stabbing in order to inform their plea. On October 11, 2019, Judge Kevin Murphy agreed to seal a future motion to dismiss the case submitted by Cowell's public defender, and the motion will be argued in open court proceedings on November 22, 2019. Cowell is also expected to enter a plea on November 22, 2019. The court found Cowell competent to stand trial in July 2019 after three court-appointed doctors evaluated him. One of the evaluations found Cowell incompetent, one found him competent, and the third evaluation's author could not come to a conclusion. = Media coverage and public outcry =  Celebrity input  The hashtag #NiaWilson, #SayHerName, and #JusticeForNiaWilson went viral on Twitter July 23, 2018, sparking commentary from Anne Hathaway, Rose McGowan, Tracee Ellis Ross, Bruno Mars, Viola Davis, Common, Janelle Monae, Jada Pinkett Smith, journalist Shaun King (who called for the attacker's immediate arrest), and Grammy-nominated singer Kehlani called the attacker a “white supremacist.” NBA star Stephen Curry helped to raise over $21,000 during a game for young Bay Area athletes at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco, California which he streamed on his Facebook page.  Media critiques  Activists have widely critiqued the coverage of the murder from Fox affiliate KTVU after the station released a photo of Wilson holding a gun instead of the many other available photos of the teen. Later, ABC reported that the photo was actually of the teen holding a gun-shaped phone case and not an actual weapon. This photo sharing was condemned and critiqued by The National Association of Black Journalists, the Bay Area Black Journalists Association and the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. KTVU’s anchor, Frank Somerville, later issued an apology for the image. The San Francisco Chronicle was criticized for titling an article about the murder “bart Killing: Divergent Paths Met Tragically on Oakland Platform.” Critics said there was a difference between the way black victims are portrayed in the media and wrote that this title minimized Wilson's status as a victim. Newspapers have been largely responsible for covering Wilson's murder, and have critiqued cable news sources (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC) for not spending enough time on the event despite the public outcry and the frequent on the ground coverage.  National public protests and vigils  On July 23, 2018, over 1000 protestors attended a vigil for Nia Wilson and marched through the streets surrounding MacArthur BART station carrying signs with Nia Wilson's name and chanting, \\"No Justice, No Peace.\\" On August 2, a group of young activists gathered at Frank Ogawa Plaza for an event called “Youth Speak, Adults Listen,” where they discussed feeling unsafe in public and how Nia Wilson's death exemplifies this fear. Wilson's murder has sparked international conversations on racial violence. At the McArthur BART Station, there are two large publicly created monuments to Wilson, including large displays of flowers, balloons, candles, and public performances. On August 3, activist bike rider Najari Smith, cofounder of Rich City Rides, attached speakers and a microphone to his bike and dedicated a ride to Wilson. There were approximately 30 people on the group bicycle ride dedicated to Wilson.  Civil suit  The family of Wilson sued BART for failing to protect Nia and her sister. Specifically because transit officers had caught Cowell skipping fares a few days before the attack, and because of his previous arrest at a BART station, Wilson's family is stating that Cowell should not have been allowed back at the stations. The Arns Law Firm is preparing the suit—claiming Cowell's violence was foreseeable and preventable. The claim also contends that two weeks before Cowell attacked the Wilson sisters, he threatened to attack two other BART passengers but BART employees were not available to take a report. The suit also alleges that Letifah Wilson, El Muhammad, Tashiya Wilson, suffered physical injuries and emotional distress for witnessing the attack. Specifically the family is seeking, financial compensation for Nia Wilson’s death, Letifah Wilson’s injuries and the family’s emotional distress in addition to improved safety measures in order to prevent further attacks from taking place.  Memorial  Wilson's memorial was held on August 3, 2018, at 11 a.m. at the Acts Full Gospel Church in East Oakland. Her funeral was live-streamed. 18 doves were released at the service, one to represent each year of Wilson's life. Her casket was brought to her resting place in a horse drawn carriage. A letter from California Congresswoman Maxine Waters was read aloud at the memorial. Nia's name was spelled in flowers and displayed in front of her casket. Oakland Congresswoman Barbara Lee also spoke at the service.

It was designed by John Wiltshire Pender with a garden by Sydney landscape architect R. Culbert. It was built from 1879 by Robert James with an 1887 extension by H. Noad. It is also known as Cintra. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 August 2012.  History  =Cintra House and Garden= The early history of Cintra is connected to the Levy and Cohen families, part of an important Jewish merchant family locally and internationally. Cintra was designed and constructed as a private residence for Benn W. Levy in 1878 by Maitland architect J. W. Pender. Benn Levy became the head of the Cohen business in London in 1886, moving there in 1887. This saw ownership of Cintra transferred to his cousin Neville Cohen. In 1887 Pender designed extensions to Cintra for Neville Cohen and his family. Originally the house had 23 rooms, and the extensions added a second wing on the northern side, making it 31 rooms including the attic and cellar. The new second wing consisted of a billiard room, servants' hall, housekeeper's room, an additional four bedrooms and bathroom facilities. Early in the 20th century, business and family dispersion rendered Cintra impracticable to the Cohen family and was sold to the Long family in 1917. Cintra was left in the charge of five sisters and was run as a private hospital from World War One until the late 1930s when it again became a private residence. The sisters, \\"though genteel, when left to their own devices, pursued life-long careers in art, music, nursing, physiotherapy and advertising.\\" Cintra as a private hospital was operated under the auspices of Nurse Eileen Long until its closure in the late 1930s or early 1940s due to lack of resources. The hospital is known to still be operating in 1938. Strong rumours surfaced during the period that the hospital closed that the property would be taken over by the Department of Defence. However, this did not take place. Instead, residential flats were established in the northern wing. Richard and Yvonne Long took possession in 1965 and the flats were left vacant until as they became unoccupied and were later restored as part of the private residence.(Long, 2012 & Council Rate books) The Long family undertook maintenance and restoration works to the interior and exterior, including painting, garden works and fencing. Although there is an extensive movable heritage collection, inclusive of personal possessions from the last century onwards which contribute to Cintra's appearance, these are not original to the property. The garden, complete with its original planting schemes and garden features contributes significantly to the house and as evidence of the period to which it belongs.Shellshear, 1990 In 1988, the building was refurbished, with the demolition and replacement of unoriginal bathrooms and kitchen. In 1990-92 Cintra received two loans allowing the owners to conserve its original intact verandah over a two-year period of works. Tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys) was used as a substitute for the original beech wood, which had become unsafe due to water damage. =The David Cohen Company in Australia= The growing Jewish community in Maitland in the late nineteenth century contributed to the urban and economic development of Maitland. More importantly, the families of the David Cohen Company played a central role in the development of commercial ventures in the region and expanded the trade of the colony. The David Cohen company's store and warehouse was notable, as its \\"size and opulence visually marked the prosperity of its proprietors and of the town, and when connected to other buildings constructed for the company and its family of owners in Maitland, Newcastle and Sydney, the success of David Cohen & Company is clearly widespread, deep, awe inspiring and formidable\\". Benn Levy and Neville Cohen were the descendants of the founders of David Cohen & Co. Ltd. Benn Levy was the nephew of David Lewis Levy who founded the renowned Lewis' department store in Liverpool in the United Kingdom while Neville Cohen was the cousin of George Judah Cohen, the chairman of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney in the early 20th century and who was praised as the \\"doyen\\" of Australian banking. Brothers David, Lewis and Samuel Cohen arrived in Australia between 1831 and 1840. In 1835 Lewis and Samuel bought land in High Street, Maitland which later became the site of their warehouse. In 1836 Samuel opened a shop selling a wide variety of goods and known as Lambeth House. This was the beginning of the Cohen family company in Australia. In 1837 Lewis and Samuel established a business partnership. However, this only lasted until 1839. Samuel continued to trade in Maitland while Lewis set up business in Campbelltown and Sydney. In 1840 their first cousin, Lewis Wolfe Levy migrated to Australia. He lived briefly in Maitland before opening a successful store in Tamworth. Lewis returned to Maitland in 1854. The brother's business interests were consolidated between 1843 and 1845. Samuel Levy filed for insolvency in 1843 and his brother David took over the debts. In 1845 Lewis Levy joined the firm. David Cohen's name (the youngest brother) was given to the firm due to the quality of his reputation and the company became the largest firm in the Maitland district. The company constructed a warehouse on their land in High Street in 1865 that was designed by John Horbury Hunt. From 1880 onwards they commissioned and leased a number of other warehouses including constructing the six-storey warehouse at their Newcastle East site in 1890. David Cohen and Co. sold whatever goods were popular and could be imported in reasonable condition at the time. These included tools, clocks, sewing machines and electro-plated ware imported from America. From around 1900 they concentrated on English branded grocery lines and teas in their advertising. Lewis Levy led a vigorous expansion of David Cohen and Co. The company prospered, the firm grew and the partners of the company became more prominent in society. In 1912 David Cohen and Co became a public company and George Cohen, Chairman of the CBC Bank and the United Insurance Company, became its first Chairman. A resolution ensured that the company remained firmly in the control of the family. David Cohen & Co. Ltd continued the business of wholesale grocery and market of products from outside Australia until its decline when local manufacturing and delivery in Australia took over. The company never recovered from the Depression. The company name is preserved on the Frederick Menkens designed David Cohen & Co. Warehouse facade in Bolton Street, Newcastle. =The Cohen and Levy families= Samuel Cohen and Lewis Levy both became members of parliament for country seats. Members of both families also served charities, local community organisations and hospitals during their lifetime. Dr R. J. Pierce of Maitland Hospital Committee commented that few firms in the colony were as generous to charitable causes as David Cohen & Co. In 1888 Lewis Levy's family gave to Sydney the marble fountain topped by a bronze figure near the Woolloomooloo gates of the Botanical Gardens. Neville and Samuel Cohen were president of Maitland and Newcastle hospitals respectively during their rebuilding. George, Samuel and Neville all held office in the Great Synagogue of Sydney and the family exercised influential leadership in the small Jewish communities of Maitland and Newcastle. The family, particularly Samuel (the elder) and George Cohen, were integral to the establishment of the Maitland Synagogue, 1879, the first outside of Sydney. Samuel Cohen established the German Jewish Relief Fund which became the Australian Jewish Welfare Society and raised funds, with Commonwealth government support from 1938, to select and provide for deserving refugees to migrate to Australia. =Comparative information= A review of Hunter Region heritage listings identifies a small number of large Victorian Italianate boom style villas constructed in the 1870-90s, which originally enjoyed substantial gardens and outbuildings. Most have since been subdivided or adapted for residential flats and significantly altered internally. Regional Victorian villas of similar age to Cintra, but smaller in scale, in more restricted settings and internally altered include Grossman House, Bishops Residence, Benholm, Moncrieff and 86-88 Victoria Street in Maitland, and Atherstone in Muswellbrook. Cintra is the principal intact example of the highly creative work of the architectural firm of J.W. Pender in this period; Anambah House at Rutherford and Belltrees at Scone being later. Cintra, however, retains its entire original garden setting, mature plantings and stables outbuilding. Its outstanding architectural integrity and its remarkable intactness sets it apart in terms of its aesthetic significance. Its historic association with the Cohen and Levy families, and the continual stewardship of the Long family has effectively conserved and maintained the authenticity and integrity of this remarkable property. JW Pender's architectural practice operated for 125 years, with his son Walter, and grandson Ian continuing his work. Pender's work includes aforementioned Benhome, Leeholme and numerous civic and business buildings around the Hunter Valley and further afield. The firm's original drawings, specifications and other records are now conserved in the University of Newcastle library, including the documents for their grand Villa design, Cintra.  Description  =House= Cintra is a large two-storey villa built in the late Victorian era in the Italianate boom style of architecture. It is situated on its original block with driveways, paths, gardens, lawns, stables etc. in their original layout. The house is built of brick on a concrete foundation, and rendered with a slate roof. The house has 31 rooms, balconies, verandahs and a three-storey tower totalling over 965 square metres. The tower reaches to 14 metres above the entry vestibule and is topped with cast iron embellishments. Above the smoking room/ attic within the tower was a 2,000 gallon water tank fed by a pumping system from a 7,500 gallon circular underground tank at the rear of the house. Linked to this a rectangular underground tank was constructed to hold a further 20,000 gallons. The home was therefore serviced interiorly by both gravity feed or if necessary by pumping, as also were the gardens. The mansard roofed tower is also covered in Bangor slates. The balconies have iron roofs supported at the corners by curved solid timber beams and finely fluted cast iron Corinthian columns over 4.3 metres tall, produced by Taylor and Wearing of Redfern. There is extensive and intricate cast-iron lace balustrading and trellis on the balconies. The cast iron verandah friezes feature a design of grape vine and leaf with pendant fruit painted and highlighted. The villa has two wings to the rear which form a U-shaped courtyard. Internally, there are two staircases in addition to the servants' stairs, attic stairs and cellar stairs. The main staircase rises from the entrance hall and has finely turned cedar balusters and decorative newel posts. The second staircase is in the north wing. The rooms are lofty (ceiling height downstairs is 4 metres and upstairs 3.7m), well-proportioned with cedar joinery and elaborate cornices to the major rooms. The rooms opening onto the verandahs have stone thresholds, French doors and louvered shutters. Many of the rooms have marble mantlepieces with tessellated tile hearths. The bathrooms for the upstairs bedrooms were fitted with hot and cold water, a shower bath and lavatory. The main public rooms feature marble mantlepieces. The original interior detailing, exuded luxury, from the costly imported gas light fittings to the ebony and gold or white and gold door furniture. The single storey wing on the southwest side of the building contains the original kitchen, scullery and laundry. The external barred airshaft to the cellar is visible on the south wall. Beneath the house is a cellar and a strong room arched in solid brickwork, which may have been fitted with an iron safe door prior to 1915. When Benn W. Levy relocated from Cintra back to London in 1887 to operate the Cohen company there, the original household furniture and effects were put up for sale by auction. The auction notice that ran in the Maitland Mercury describes the contents of the house in full with descriptive detail including shape, colour, and design of the furniture and contents. No original contents remain except for a cupboard (possibly used as a kitchen sideboard/shelves but now functions as a bookcase). =Garden= Cintra has retained its original driveways, garden, stables and coach house. The formal late nineteenth century town/ villa garden is entered through the original wrought iron carriage and pedestrian gates hung on moulded sandstone posts at the front of the property. The gates lead onto the brick edged heart shaped lawn which surrounds a carriage loop. The lawn in the centre of the loop is adorned with a pair of terracotta urns on pedestals, by the Sydney potter Thomas Field. Two tall elaborate iron light standards flank the stone steps to the house. A gravelled drive continues from the loop, around the house to allow carriage access to the coach house at the rear. The drive is lined with hedges of may bush (Spiraea sp.), Cape plumbago (P.capensis), olive (Olea europaea), Wisteria sp. and leads to random built stone walls delineating the service area. Formal lawns and pathways border the house. To each side of the carriage loop are irregularly curving beds, which still contain the descendants and original palms and bird-of-paradise-flowers (Strelitzia sp.), along with other plantings including shrubs and perennials popular in the Victorian age. A brick edged path runs parallel to the northern eastern boundary fence, separated by a border of shrubs. The brick edging was originally tiles, fragments of which remain beneath the ground. To the north of the house another open rectangular lawn, originally described as being for croquet and bowls, has two very large elaborate cast and wrought iron flower jardinieres along the path on the eastern end. After the First World War a tennis court was constructed on the northern lawn, but has since been removed to reinstate the original lawn. To the south and west (rear) of the house although there are some mature trees there is modest landscaping. Araucarias originally bordered the Regent Street entrance. Throughout Cintra's grounds are significant mature Bunya Bunya (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), Cape chestnut (Calodendrum capense), lemon scented gums (Corymbia citriodora), jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis), Brazilian pepper trees (Schinus molle var.areira), small leafed figs (Ficus sp.) and Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla). A summer house, now demolished, overlooked the lawn from the west. The property also contains a coach house and stables building along the rear boundary and two other garden sheds between the rear boundary and the house. =Stables= At the rear of the house is a two-storeyed sandstock brick gabled building which includes coach house and stables over a stone flagged floor with dish drain. In the Maitland Mercury April 26, 1879, the ground floor of the stables building is described as including a coach house, harness room, two stalled stable and loose box. The rooms were thoroughly ventilated with louvre windows. Above the stables on the first floor is a hay loft and a groom's room. This building was connected to the water tanks and sewer pits. = Condition = As at 24 April 2014, the house and garden have been maintained to an excellent standard, with the aim of conserving the property's authenticity and original architectural features, plantings and landscape elements. Although it is spaciously planted, the density of vegetation reflects its original appearance and is true to its Victorian design. Large plantings such as the Araucarias have been removed and replaced with young trees for safety reasons. The high scallop-topped front picket fence, which is shown in a c.1895 photograph, has also been replaced. However, the design and construction of the new fence replicates the original fencing, as closely as possible, and retains the original gates and piers. The paths and carriageway (currently a driveway) are maintained with locally sourced, finely graded washed river gravel as per the original paths and carriageway. Within the grounds there is archaeological potential for the footings and under-floor deposit of the Summer House. The underground water tanks remain in situ. Post holes may exist in an archaeological context where the horse yards were situated to the south east of the coach house and stables building. A 2010 report indicates that there is evidence of cracking and overall movement of the masonry walls within the house, which requires attention. Cintra is exceptionally intact, the house still sited on its original allotment. All original outbuildings except for the Summer House (now demolished) are extant, and the garden layout retains its original design and plantings, except for the replacement of a few key specimen trees with younger varieties. The front fence has been replaced with a new fence that replicates the original. A council footpath and roadway encroaches slightly in the south west corner.  Heritage listing  Cintra House, Garden and Stables is of State heritage significance for its exceptional aesthetic value as an outstanding, highly intact example of a Victorian Italianate style town villa with original and early interiors and extant outbuildings and service wings, including the original stables, kitchen, scullery and laundry, set within an historic landscaped garden setting. The house within its setting is a widely recognised architectural landmark in Maitland. It contributes to the heritage of the Hunter Valley, demonstrating the pattern of settlement and commercial expansion of the region prior to the growth of Newcastle. Constructed in 1878, it is significant for its historical associations with the eminent Hunter architectural firm of J. W. Pender, who designed the house and outbuildings; the famous Jewish merchant families of Levy and Cohen, for whom Cintra was built; and its association and links to the Jewish community in Maitland and Sydney, NSW, and the United Kingdom. It is rare in terms of its exceptional integrity and intactness and is a benchmark of its architectural style. Cintra House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cintra demonstrates the pattern of development of the Hunter region, as pastoralism establishes town development and commercial expansion, followed by civic infrastructure and community pride. Its detailed architectural design and complementary outbuilding and gates are evidence of the development of Maitland's permanent settlement and the expansion of Jewish commercial interests in the region. Cintra is physical evidence of the growth and expansion of the prominent architectural firm of J.W. Pender and of the local and regional development of quality tradesman and suppliers able to construct substantial buildings within the region. The house and garden form a cultural landscape demonstrating the continuous pattern of residential use and occupation by the Cohen and Long families over 125 years. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Cintra has significance for its strong and lengthy association with John W. Pender, a Maitland architect prominent in the development of the Hunter region in the nineteenth century. Cintra's extension was also designed by John W. Pender, who possessed a wide range of talents including cast iron frieze designs and manufacturing. He was a successful entrepreneur and well respected civic leader. The life and work of the Cohen and Levy families is especially associated with Cintra, which originally belonged to Benn Levy and Neville Cohen, part of a well-known Jewish merchant family important in the development of trade, commerce and the economy in Maitland, Newcastle, Sydney and the UK. Both families were generous to the community and charitable causes, the Levy fountain at the Woolloomooloo gates of the Sydney Botanical Gardens being testament to this. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Cintra is State significant for its ability to demonstrate the aesthetic characteristics of both the Victorian era town villa and the Victorian Italianate style of architecture. The property is an intact and representative example of boom period house and garden in rural towns of the late nineteenth century. The property's curved carriage loop, ornamental specimen plants, decorative urns, elaborate gates, intricate cast iron verandah friezes, asymmetrical massing, prominent tower, grouped openings, colonnaded loggia, rendered wall finish, stepped lintels, bracketed eaves, low pitched hipped verandah roof, charm, formality and status in the landscape, are all characteristics that epitomise the Victorian period Italianate design ( 1840- 1890). Not only is the house aesthetically significant at a State level, it is complemented by a garden of \\"attractive enclosed scenes with detail and focii, and a heart shaped carriage way\\". The villa complex is exceptionally intact with its original and early interiors and original stables, carriage house, water tanks, kitchen, laundry and scullery at the rear. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cintra has special associations with the early Jewish community in New South Wales. It represents the hard earned success of the Jewish merchant families and also their contribution to the Jewish community and Australian society. Their commercial ventures saw the Hunter Region well supplied with goods and products from the UK and the latest from America. The Cohen and Levy families created significant commercial and residential buildings such as Cintra, and the 1879 David Cohen and Co. warehouse (the lower storey of which still remains in High Street, Maitland). The Cohen and Levy families were well respected in both the Jewish and wider community. The Cohen family were also the prime instigators for church services and eventually the construction of the Maitland Synagogue, the first outside of Sydney. Many descendants of the original owners and others associated with these two Jewish families have visited Cintra both from the local area and as far as Jamaica, Montana and London. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cintra, together with its garden and stables, is State significant as a benchmark reference site for NSW's Boom style villas. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cintra is State significant as a rare example of a boom style Victorian Italianate Villa in a regional setting. This Late Victorian Villa is of exceptional integrity, with original house layout, original and early interiors, kitchen, scullery, laundry wing, coach house, stables and garden remaining intact. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Cintra is State significant as a benchmark property, important in demonstrating accurately the architectural and landscaping style of an Italianate Victorian country town villa, remarkably retaining special features including of note, the heart shaped carriage loop and lawn. Cintra is Maitland's principal residence of the High Victorian era, and its most intact and fine example of boom-style architecture. It retains all the dominant architectural style indicators including intricate cast iron friezes, asymmetrical massing, prominent tower, complemented by a period garden in its original layout, decorative urns, elaborate gates and the original coach house and stables building. The formality and authenticity of the house and garden have ensured that Cintra House epitomises the Victorian period Italianate design ( 1840- 1890).

Located in the mitochondrial nucleoid, this protein is a complex III assembly factor, playing a role in cytochrome b biogenesis along with the UQCC1 protein. It regulates insulin secretion and mitochondrial ATP production and oxygen consumption. In the sole recorded case, a mutation in the UQCC2 gene caused Complex III deficiency, characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, neonatal lactic acidosis, and renal tubular dysfunction.  Structure  The UQCC2 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 6 in position 21.31 and spans 14,990 base pairs. The gene produces a 14.9 kDa protein composed of 126 amino acids. This protein has no homologous domains with other known proteins. It is associated with the mitochondrial nucleoid, likely located in the peripheral region. This protein's distribution pattern is similar to other components of the mitochondrial nucleoid, like mtSSB and PHB1/PHB2.  Function  This gene encodes a nucleoid protein localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane and sublocalized to the mitochondrial matrix. The encoded protein permissively regulates insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells, positively regulates mitochondrial ATP production and oxygen consumption, and is involved in late skeletal muscle differentiation through modulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. This protein is required for the assembly of the Complex III. Expression of this protein is decreased in cells with low mtDNA.  Clinical Significance  In the sole recorded case, a homozygous mutation in intron 2 of the UQCC2 gene caused a splicing disruption; the patient presented with symptoms of nuclear type 7 Complex III deficiency, including neonatal lactic acidosis, renal tubulopathy, and severe intrauterine growth retardation. Additional clinical features included a dysmorphic facial appearance, delayed psychomotor development, autistic features, aggressive behavior, and mild sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, the patient had decreased levels of UQCC1.  Interactions  This protein interacts with UQCC1.

She sailed to England and then made six voyages for the British East India Company (EIC); during this period she also made one voyage carrying immigrants to South Africa. After the EIC gave up its maritime activities in 1833-1834, Barossa became a transport. She made three voyages transporting convicts to Australia. She was lost in 1847, without loss of life, while transporting coolies from Madras to Jamaica. Career Shortly after her launch Barossa sailed to England. =1st EIC voyage (1812)= Barossa was at Calcutta on 1 March 1812. Captain Benjamin Fergusson sailed from there and was at Saugor on 10 May. Barossa was at Madras on 12 June, reached St Helena on 6 September, and arrived at The Downs on 6 November. Barossa was sold in England and was admitted to the on 12 February 1813. She entered Lloyd's Register in 1813 with Ferguson as master and owner.Lloyd's Register (1813), Supple. pages \\"M\\", Seq.№B13. =Licensed trade with India= In 1814 the EIC lost its monopoly on the trade between England and India. Thereafter, many shipowners sailed there vessels in that trade under a license from the EIC. In 1816 her master and owner changed from Ferguson to Hawkey. Hawkey had purchased Barrosa and she was the first ship to take advantage of the new opportunity. One of the passenger's on Barrosas first voyage as a free trader was William's brother Captain Charles Hawkey, of the Royal Navy, who was returning to India. When Barrosa reached the Cape, Captain Charles Hawkey fought a duel with Major Clason of the EIC's service that resulted in Clason's death.Naval Chronicle, Vol.35, p.259. After she left the Cape, after a long detention, Barrosa encountered severe weather that damaged her and her cargo. She arrived at Madras and Calcutta later than Hawkey had intended and as a result other vessels had arrived before her and sold their cargoes, depressing the market. The EIC, exceptionally, authorized Hawkey to sail to China, which Hawkey hoped would re-establish the voyage's profitability. Captain William Hawkey died at sea on 19 September 1816, aged 33; his memorial is at St Paul's Hill, Malacca. Lloyd's List reported on 25 July 1817 that Barrosa, Hawkey, late master, had arrived in China.Lloyd's List №5196. Only three days earlier Lloyd's List had reported that she was one of four vessels that had been lost in a typhoon in the China Sea. She returned to Bengal from China, and then eventually to England. =2nd EIC voyage (1819–1820)= The EIC accepted on 5 February 1819 the tender of Barossa by John William Buckle for one journey. The rate was £12 per ton for destination Madras or Bombay, and £12 15s per ton for Bengal. Captain Henry Hutchinson sailed from The Downs on 5 May, bound for Bombay. Barossa reached the Cape on 12 August and arrived at Bombay on 9 October. She left Bombay on 11 January 1820, was at the Cape on 2 April, reached St Helena on 21 April, and arrived at Purfleet on 9 July. =3rd EIC voyage (1821–1822)= Captain Hutchinson sailed from The Downs on 21 June 1821, bound for Bengal. Barossa arrived at Diamond Harbour on 17 November and Calcutta on 6 December. Homeward bound, she was at Vizagapatam on 18 February 1822 and Madras on 16 March. She arrived at her moorings on 5 November. =Emigrants to South Africa (1823)= In 1823 a Mr. J. Ingram chartered Barossa to bring out 400 colonists from the south of Ireland to the Cape Colony. Fifty were to be at his expenses, and 200 men, 50 women, and 100 children were to be at the expense of the government. Ingram received an advance of £14 per person to cover transportation, provisions, bedding, and medical expenses. Barossa brought 352 persons: 188 men, 59 women, 78 boys, and 27 girls. A dispute arose between Ingram and the government over the reimbursement and whether Ingram had met the terms of his contract. On 26 July 1823 Captain Hutchinson sailed Barossa to Mauritius.Lloyd's Register (1823): \\"Ships trading to India - 1823\\". A hurricane on 23 February 1824 drove Barossa ashore at Port Louis. She sustained minor damage. She sailed for Bengal around 20 March. On 26 February 1824 Mr. & Mrs. Brownrigg brought with them on Barossa, from Mauritius, three male and two female domestic slaves.Slave Trade (1828), p.50. In 1825 the Register of Shipping reported Barossas trades as London–Cape of Good Hope, changing to London–Calcutta.Register of Shipping (1825), Seq.№B61 On 26 September 1826 Barrossa, Captain H. Hutchinson, sailed for Calcutta under a license from the EIC.Lloyd's Register (1826), \\"Ships trading to India\\". She returned to Gravesend on 14 December 1826. She had left Bengal on 5 May, Madras on 7 June, Mauritius on 5 September, and Saint Helena on 17 October.Lloyd's List 15 December 1826, №6177, Ship arrival and departure (SAD) data. =4th EIC voyage (1827–1828)= Captain Hutchinson sailed from The Downs on 16 April 1827, bound for China. She arrived at Whampoa on 3 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 30 October, reached St Helena on 14 January 1828, and arrived at Blackwall on 25 March. =5th EIC voyage (1828)= Captain Hutchinson sailed from East India Dock on 12 June 1828 and arrived at Calcutta on 10 December. On 4 June the EIC had accepted a tender by Buckles & Co. of £3 15s per man to carry troops to the Cape, Ceylon, and Bengal. =6th EIC voyage (1832–1833)= The EIC accepted 18 April 1832 Buckles & Co. tender of Barossa at a rate of £9 15s per ton for one voyage to China, Halifax, and Quebec. Captain Orlando Hart Wilson sailed from The Downs on 10 June, bound for China and Quebec. Barossa arrived at Whampoa on 29 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 24 January 1833 and arrived at Quebec on 18 June. She arrived at her moorings on 5 September. =Transport= In 1833 Joseph Somes purchased Barossa and hired her out as a transport. =First convict voyage (1839)= On 4 August 1839 Captain John Austin sailed from Dublin for New South Wales. Barrosa sailed via the Cape and arrived at Port Jackson on 8 December. She had embarked 336 male convicts and she disembarked 334, two having died on the voyage. =Second convict voyage (1841-1842)= Captain John Austin sailed from Sheerness on 30 August 1841, bound for Van Diemen’s Land. Barrosa sailed via Tenerife and arrived at Hobart on 13 January 1842. She had embarked 350 male convicts and she landed 347, having lost three on the voyage. =Third convict voyage (1844)= Captain Henry H. Greaves sailed from Dublin on 14 July 1844, bound for Van Diemen’s Land. She arrived at Hobart on 5 September. She had embarked 322 male convicts and she landed 320, having lost two on the voyage. Fate In 1846 Somes sold Barossa to Mitcheson & Co., London. Her master changed from Austin to Dodds, and her trade from London transport to London–Bombay.Lloyd's Register (1845), Seq.№B47. An item in The Spectator states that Barossa had wrecked at Port Morant while carrying coolies from Madras to Jamaica. The crew and emigrants were saved.The Spectator 13 February 1847, p.155. The Illustrated London News referenced a report from the Jamaica Dispatch that Barossa had wrecked on a reef on 10 January 1847 due to the negligence of the pilot. All 340 coolies were saved.Illustrated London News, 20 February 1847, Vol. 10, p.123. Lloyd's Register for 1846 carries the notation \\"LOST\\" by her name.Lloyd's Register (1846), Seq.№B51.

Multiple biographers and newspapers have documented that, two years after being widowed, the fortune she had inherited from her late husband was gone. Howard J. Banker described her savings as “suddenly swept away.” The contacts she had built as an educator and advocate for women, however, helped her survive. According to Banker, “She was offered important positions in Wellesley, Northwestern University, Vassar, the University of Denver, and the University of Southern California.\\" In 1888, she chose to become “the Chair of Literature in the University of Denver, where she labored for two years with such zeal and earnestness that her health became impaired and she was compelled to retire.”The Underwood Family in America, pp. 61-62. According to The Gazette of Fort Worth, Texas, she was paid “the same salary as a man in a corresponding position” during her time there.Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson, in “News and Notes.” Fort Worth, Texas: The Gazette, December 16, 1888, p. 4.”Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson” (illustrated image with caption).

Editorial and writing life According to biographer William Emerson, Mary Lowe Dickinson “wrote leaders for dailies, editorials for weeklies, serials, short travels, poems, articles on education and philanthropy, and Sunday School lessons, never free enough to work in any favorite line, but always shaping her work to suit the demand of the hour.”Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present, p. 103. In addition, she wrote about the lives and work of: Charles Kingsley, Harriet Martineau, George Sand, and others; edited The Open Window, a magazine produced by convalescing patients and other invalids by the Shut-In Society; served as an associate editor for the philanthropic magazine published by Edward Everett Hale and his Lend a Hand Society;Fitchburg, Massachusetts, Past and Present, pp. 103-104. contributed “A Tour Around the World\\" to the November 1882 edition of Chautauquan; Hoganson, Kristin L.

Philanthropic and community service efforts Announcement of Mary Lowe Dickinson's appointment as president, National Council of Women of the United States (Pacific Commercial Advertiser, April 18, 1895). During the mid-1880s, Mary Lowe Dickinson became active with other prominent women in the planning and launch of a new philanthropic organization, the International Order of the King’s Daughters and Sons. Appointed in 1887 as general secretary – a post which she held for the remainder of her life – she also edited the group’s magazine, The Silver Cross, beginning in 1888, and penned the lyrics for the group’s hymn, Lead Now as Forth We Go, which were set to the music of Nearer My God to Thee.Buck, Sue. “A Brief History.” Chautauqua, New York: International Order of the King’s Sons and Daughters, retrieved online August 1, 2018. Gradually garnering national attention for the organization and for herself in newspapers nationwide, she was invited to speak at the Dansville Water Cure during the late 1800s. According to historian Susan Cayleff, this health spa became known as “Our Home” to many of those who became involved with it as patrons or patients. In addition to serving “as a training ground for women physicians”, this facility was propelled to “the center of national reform politics” when James Caleb Jackson assumed leadership – due to his interest in abolition, temperance, women’s rights, the cooperative union of labor and capital, and mental therapeutics.” Other prominent women and men who lectured or received care here included: Bronson Alcott, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Frederick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Sojourner Truth.Cayleff, Susan E. Wash and Be Healed: The Water-Cure Movement and Women’s Health. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Temple University Press, 1987, p. 95. After advocating for uniform divorce laws for men and women in the United States in 1892,”Have Gained a Point,” Grand Rapids Herald. she was elected president, in 1895, of the National Council of Women of the United States. One of the oldest, nonsectarian women’s organizations in America, NCW was at the forefront, during the late 1890s, of efforts to ensure equal pay for women and reform dress codes. During her tenure as president, she oversaw revisions to the NCW’s constitution and structure, including the division of the organization into an “upper and lower council.””The Women of the Nation: Changes Made in the National Council’s Constitution.” Los Angeles, California: The Herald, February 27, 1895. During this era, she also issued an appeal (in 1898) for clothing and supplies to relieve “the suffering women and children of Cuba.””Free Transportation of Supplies.” Washington, D.C.: The Evening Star, March 22, 1898, p. 10. Additional service included appointments as secretary of the American Bible Society’s Women’s Branch, national superintendent of the Women’s Christian Temperance Union’s higher education department, and president of the Women’s National Indian Association.“Coming Congress: Some New Faces of the Lower House,” The Globe-Republican. Anti-war activism Mary Lowe Dickinson (1895) Three years before the turn of the century, she co-signed a letter with Maud D. Ballington-Booth (Salvation Army), Mary Louise Beebe, Elizabeth Bacon Custer (the widow of George Armstrong Custer), Grace Hoadley Dodge (Y.W.C.A. and Travelers Aid Society of New York), Mary Mapes Dodge (renowned children’s author), Hannah B.

Trautman, and Candace Wheeler (founder, the Society of Decorative art in New York, and co-founder, New York Exchange for Women’s Work) to prevent America’s entry into armed conflict. It ran in newspapers on February 10, 1897, and read as follows:”An Appeal to Women”, Twice-a-week Plain Dealer. > To the Women of the United States: We ask your earnest and prompt > cooperation in urging upon the senate of the United States that after full > consideration it should ratify the arbitration treaty between this country > and Great Britain, and without amendments which will cripple its efficiency. > The mothers, the wives and the homes of our land have the deepest interest > in the substitution of law for war.

The treaty referred to in this letter was an agreement between Great Britain and Venezuela “to provide for an amicable settlement of the question which has arisen between their respective Governments concerning the boundary between the Colony of British Guiana and the United States of Venezuela.””Treaty of Arbitration between Great Britain and the United States of Venezuela: Washington D.C., 2 February 1897”, in “UN Peacemaker.” New York, New York: United Nations, retrieved online August 1, 2018. Legal challenges and illness During the opening decade of the new century, Mary Lowe Dickinson suffered another series of financial and legal setbacks, this time resulting from her agreement in 1904 to purchase an expensive set of books due to a mistaken belief that she was creating a sound investment opportunity. Refusing to remit payment after realizing her error, she then fell ill in June 1909 after being harassed and sued by creditors. Newspapers nationwide chronicled the state of her affairs, including The Topeka State Journal, which noted that:”Mrs. Dickinson Ill: Founder of Kings Daughters Worries Over a Lawsuit.” Topeka, Kansas: The Topeka State Journal, June 19, 1909, p. 12. > Mrs. Mary Low Dickinson, the venerable authoress and founder of the > International Order of Kings Daughters, is quite ill at her home here, it > was announced today, following a lawsuit in which a judgment of $10,000 was > given against her recently in favor of a Boston publishing house. The > friends of Mrs. Dickinson, learning of her illness, because of worry over > the lawsuit, took up the matter and as a result a rehearing of the case has > been granted by the courts and is scheduled to start on Monday, but it is > not likely that Mrs. Dickinson will be able to leave her home then. According to The Sun of New York:”Suing Mrs. Dickinson: Publishing Firm Says She Agreed to Pay $7,500 for a Set of Books”. New York, New York: The Sun, June 19, 1909, p. 7. > The plaintiff alleges that Mrs. Dickinson, on November 21, 1904, contracted > to purchase from the [Frederick J. Quimby] company a set of the works of > Paul de Kock in fifty volumes for $7,500, and that the company was ready to > deliver them on December 1 of that year, but that Mrs. Dickinson refused to > take them. In her answer Mrs. Dickinson admits having signed a contract for > the books, but alleges that the firm represented to her that it only wished > to sell her the books for the use of her name and that it would resell them > for her at a good profit before delivery.... The matter was put to her, she > says, as an investment, and she signed the contract with that > understanding.... The book concern obtained a judgment against Mrs. > Dickinson by default last March while she was out of the city. On her return > her attorney, Melvin H. Dalberg … procured the setting aside of the judgment > by Justice Guy in Special Term, Part I., and a new trial was ordered. During the June 16, 1909 deposition process for that new trial and the actual trial itself on June 21 it was revealed that Mary Lowe Dickinson had initially agreed to purchase the company’s $2,500 edition of the books, but had been pressured into changing her order to a substantially more expensive one by a representative of the Quimby Company who had convinced her that she could earn a $500 profit if she re-sold it to “a woman in West Virginia who would ultimately rebuy the books from her,” but that the books had not even been ready for delivery to Dickinson and could not have later been resold because the purported buyer from West Virginia had never existed. As a result, New York Supreme Court Justice James Aloysius O’Gorman dismissed the lawsuit against Dickinson.”Quimby Suit Against Mrs. Dickinson Dismissed.” New York, New York: The Publisher’s Weekly, Vol. 76, No. 1954, p. 58, July 10, 1909. Final years, death and interment By 1910, she was a 71-year-old widow residing at the Manhattan, New York home of her friend, Kate Bond (aged 75), with whom she served in the International Order of the King’s Daughters and Sons, and Bond’s 70-year-old niece – both of whom were described on that year's federal census as being natives of Maryland who had their own income.

It was built from 1860 to 1862 by Isaac Beckett and Samuel Owens. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It is associated with neighbouring Grossmann House, which is also owned by the National Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.  History  During the nineteenth century, Maitland was an important commercial centre in the Hunter Valley. Its origins as a camp for convict timber loggers led to the realisation of the extremely fertile soil and potential for agricultural prosperity. By the 1840s Maitland was established as the chief town of the region, its population exceeding only that of Sydney. The business industry flourished as Maitland adopted the role of the trade centre, providing services and supplies to rural industries. It was during this successful period that local business partners Samuel Owens and Isaac Beckett built their two homes, Brough House and Grossmann House. The businessmen formed their partnership in 1838, however the houses were not built until 1860. In 1838 the Owen and Beckett Partnership established a business as general merchants, tailors, woolbrokers, wine and spirit and tobacco merchants. In 1860 Grossmann and Brough house were constructed opposite St Mary's the Virgin Anglican Church, near the railway and away from the threat of flood. In 1860 the house was occupied by Samuel Owen and his wife Margaret (Eyre) Owen. In 1919 the Department of Education purchased the house to convert into a school hostel. In 1972 the Department of Education granted permissive occupancy to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). In 1974 Maitland City Council agreed to house Maitland Art Gallery and share the upper floor with the Music Conservatorium. The Maitland City Council under the auspices of the National Trust manages Brough House. In 1975 the Maitland Art Gallery opened to the public. In 1978 the State Government added Grossman House to the Brough House reserve for the preservation of historic sites and buildings and the National Trust of Australia (NSW) were appointed trust managers.(Tanner,1986:5) The Maitland Art Gallery (now Maitland Regional Art Gallery) vacated the building and moved to new premises in 2003.  Description  Isaac Beckett and Samuel Owen built Grossmann and Brough House in 1860 to 1862. The strong business partnership between the two merchants, Owen and Beckett, is reflected in the construction of their identical two storey Victorian houses next door to each other. Local red sandstone bricks are the primary medium and detailing incorporates a harmonious use of buff sandstone and painted cast iron and timber. Large verandahs at the front and rear (west and east) formed an integral part of the design. The hipped roof is covered with corrugated iron. Internal planning is sensible, providing easy circulation and spacious main rooms. Based on a centre hall plan the front entrances become side doors and the length of the house extends along Church Street, thereby optimising the verandah and views. Original internal joinery is cedar and this, along with other interior finishes (plaster, tiles, timber flooring) are presented with little embellishment. The gardens were generous in size and, perhaps predictably, given the symmetry of Owen and Beckett's arrangement, the laundry building is situated on the centre line of the properties. This simple, rectilinear structure has a central partition, dividing the area thus providing each resident with semi-private facilities.(The National Trust of Australia (NSW),1976) Brough House was reported to be in good physical condition as at 30 June 2000, and is largely intact. = Modifications and dates = * 1920s - addition of a Kitchen and upper floor washrooms were added to Brough House. * 1965 - shutters were restored to the ground floor and a small flat installed on the first floor for a resident curator. * 1974 - minor changes were made to Brough House to facilitate an art gallery and enable limited use of two musical rehearsal rooms on the first floor by the Newcastle Conservatorium. * 1979 - front verandahs have been reinstated after a lengthy absence from both formal facades. * 1986 - Street-front verandahs to Brough House restored  Heritage listing  A large Victorian town house, which forms an interesting group with its twin (Grossman House) next door now largely, restored in its original form. Built by merchants in partnership, they form an impressive residential partnership of the 1860s. The historical associations of these two buildings make them of great interest in their relationship to the original owners and later use as part of the Maitland Girls' High School.National Trust, 1976 Brough House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Brough House reflects the introduction of public education in New South Wales. Historically the house reflect Maitland's nineteenth century prosperity and significance, especially in its location on the axis between the railway station and High streets. The architectural design of the Victorian Terraces also adds to the historical significance of developing a township. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Brough House forms an integral part of an historic nineteenth century townscape dominated by St Mary's Church, large fig trees, residences and gardens. Built on Church Street, directly adjacent to the Church of St. Mary, Brough House mirrors its neighbour Grossman House. Built side by side in Victorian style (with Georgian simplicity), these asymmetrical structures are characteristic of the substantial residential buildings of the era. The buildings reflect a prosperous period for Maitland. Therefore, the site makes a significant and attractive contribution to the present streetscape and to the district as a whole.(Tanner,1986:4) The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Brough House is socially significant for its long association with the public as a schoolhouse, museum and art gallery add to the social recognition and use of the property. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Brough House serves as a museum of early Maitland urban life and relates well to the other nineteenth century buildings nearby. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Brough House is a rare intact Victorian townhouse providing an accurate representation and presentation of the eighteenth century through its furnishings and architecture. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The properties represent the eighteenth century architecture by providing two intact identical Victorian Townhouses. The furnishings represent the times and the long associations with the Education Department.

Originally conceived as a Federation Arts and Crafts residence by Edward Jeaffreson Jackson in 1903, the main building served as a private hospital before being purchased by the Municipality of North Sydney for its new chambers in 1925, with sympathetic extensions being completed in 1926, 1938 and 1968 to accommodate for this new usage. While it has remained the seat of North Sydney Council since 1926, the Council Chambers have been further extended with the completion of the modernist Wyllie Wing by Harry Seidler in 1977 and the Carole Baker Building in 2000 by Feiko Bouman. History =Kelrose, 1903–1925= \\"Kelrose\\", sketch by B. J. Waterhouse c. 1908.The original house on a block of land on the corner of Miller and McLaren Streets, was purchased by Annie Capper in the 1880s from James Husband. This 1870 home of James Husband, was demolished in 1903 and a new house in the Arts and Crafts style known as “Kelrose”, was designed by Edward Jeaffreson Jackson who was commissioned by Capper to design a family house, which was completed in 1903 by R. G. Ochs. Jeaffreson Jackson, who is commemorated nearby with the Jeaffreson Jackson Reserve, was notable for being influential in developing the English Arts and Crafts style into an Australian architectural form known broadly as Federation style. As one of the first to introduce the bungalow to Sydney, it has been thought that he also introduced the terracotta Marseille- patterned tile to Australia. When Capper and her son, Dr. Capper, left the house a few years after its completion, it was used for a time as a private hospital. By the 1920s, the Municipality of North Sydney, which had been formed by amalgamation in 1890, started looking for new council offices and identified Kelrose on its corner block as the most suitable, with a council resolution to resume the land passed in December 1923. The council appropriated A£12,000 for the purposes of resumption and alterations in July 1924. =Council Chambers, first iteration 1925–1935= The 1925 extension of the Council Chambers, c. 1930.In April 1925, Council commissioned Albert Edmund Bates to design sympathetic extensions to the existing building to an estimated cost of £6000. Work by contractor Frank Cogan commenced in December 1925 and was completed in July 1926 at a total cost of £15,000, including land acquisition and construction costs. The new chambers building was officially opened by former Prime Minister and Member for North Sydney, Billy Hughes, on 10 July 1926, who declared that \\"Nothing can be got without effort - Risks must be taken, and money must be borrowed in order that we can develop this great country of ours\\". North Sydney Municipal Council vacated the 1885 East St Leonards Town Hall on Alfred Street, Milsons Point, that had originally been built for the former Borough of East St Leonards, and took up residence in the council chambers from 12 July 1926. =Council Chambers, extensions 1935–1968= St Leonards centenary plaque unveiling by Billy Hughes, 16 October 1938.In February 1935, Council commissioned Crows Nest architect Rupert V. Minett to prepare plans for expanded accommodation. In June 1937, Minett's plans for a mirror image extension of the existing building in the same style at a cost of £12,000 were approved by council and Girvan Brothers of St Leonards were appointed contractors for the project. The new extensions were completed by early August 1938 and were officially opened by the Secretary for Public Works and Minister for Local Government, Eric Spooner, on 13 August 1938. On its completion, Construction noted that the \\"design of the existing part has been continued in the new section, which contains a spacious entrance hall panelled in Queensland maple\\" and praised the location and setting of the chambers \\"where, surrounded by gardens, they have a more domestic character than is the case with some of the other recent municipal buildings.\\" From the upper floors, the Sydney Morning Herald noted, in a period when skylines were low, an \\"unimpeded view of the harbour and city.\\" On 10 October 1938, local member Billy Hughes officially unveiled a plaque commemorating the centenary of the township of St Leonards, which was gazetted in 1838, outside the council chambers. Further additions and extensions were carried out in 1961, 1965 and 1968 by the Council Architect, John L. Browne, who had completed the Stanton Library in 1964. The works included the addition of an aluminum framed bay window office at the corner of Miller and McLaren Streets in the original 1903 section of the council chambers, improvements to the mayoral suite, and the construction of offices behind the Miller Street wing. =Wyllie Wing and fire, 1975–1978= The extensions made in the 1960s were aimed at easing the pressures of a lack of working space in the existing council chambers, but by the 1970s it was clear to the council that more space would be needed. As a result, a new wing facing Mclaren Street immediately west of the existing buildings, was planned and designed by Harry Seidler and Associates in 1975. The new wing, which was to be named the \\"Wyllie Wing\\" was designed by Seidler in the Brutalist Modernism style, with a series of parallel bays of concrete stepping up the site from the street frontage. However, before this wing could be completed, on 8 April 1976 a fire destroyed the first floor and roof of the 1938 northern half of the Miller Street wing, affecting several council departments. At first, Council considered demolishing the entire Miller Street building and in September 1976 Harry Seidler and Associates prepared several schemes for its replacement, with a grassed area between a new Miller Street building and the Wyllie Wing. However, significant public opposition to the demolition of the historic council building, particularly from the North Sydney Civic Group, led to the decision to re-build the damaged portion of the Miller Street wing. The Wyllie Wing was completed in 1977 and the reconstruction of the fire-damaged section was completed in 1978. =Later works and extensions, 1997–date= On 29 July 1979, as part of the \\"North Sydney Civic Centre\\" project, a function hall was added to the rebuilt northern section of the council chambers, named the Fred Hutley Hall after the former alderman, and was opened by the local Member for Kirribili, Bruce McDonald. Later works were unveiled in September 1982 by the mayor, Ted Mack. In 1997, council commissioned a further extension to the council chambers to fill the space between the Miller Street wing and the Wyllie Wing. Designed by North Sydney Architect Feiko Bouman, the new building was completed by Gledhill’s Pty Ltd in 2000 at a cost of $2,900,000, and was named after a former mayor, Carole Baker. The North Sydney Council Chambers, along with the 1977 Wyllie Wing, are listed as heritage items in the North Sydney Local Environmental Plan 2013, and the Council Chambers was also listed on the heritage register of the National Trust of Australia (NSW).

It was designed by J. W. Pender and built from 1889 to 1906. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Anambah House was built in 1889 by the wealthy grazier J. K. Mackay for his son William. It was designed by architect J. W Pender of Maitland. Architectural drawings exist but they do not indicate a garden layout. This family is thought to have owned properties in Queensland which may have been the source of the bottle tree, often associated with droving, and the lacebark trees. Oral history sources suggest that cattle drives from Queensland properties terminated at the Anambah property before going to the Sydney markets. Early photos show the established carriage loop, formal garden beds filled with flowers set in the lawn and the tennis court. Over time the layout has become simplified. The courtyard garden was established by the present owners and the brick-edged carriage loop was re- surfaced during the filming of the movie \\"Country Life\\" in 1993. The tennis pavilion and a tree house were installed at this time. The original grantee, George Cobb's daughter Mary, married Francis White of Edinglassie in 1853 and 4 of their children were born at Anambah (in the earlier house.) These children later established Belltrees at Scone. The Mackay family bought both Anambah & Minimbah (at Singleton) from the Cobbs in the 1870s and built both the present Anambah and Minimbah houses. They also owned Redleaf House in Woollahra (now Woollahra Council Chambers). The Mackay family are descendants of Duncan Forbes Mackay, Superintendent of Prisons and Public Works in Newcastle in 1827, who settled at Dungog. Various famous people have stayed in the house, including Dame Nellie Melba () & the Governors the Earl of Dudley and Lord Gowrie. In the 1950s Anambah was the home of Hal Lashwood, one of the greats of Australian radio, and during this period radio entertainers such as Roy Rene (Mo) & Jack Davey stayed in the house.  Description  =Homestead= Homestead A large two storey Victorian grazier's mansion of sandstock brick & hipped slate roof with two storey cast-iron verandahs on three sides, punctuated by two elaborately stuccoed bays. At the rear is a courtyard enclosed on 3 sides by the main house, kitchen wing and servants' rooms & on the 4th side by the later (1906) billiard room, also to Pender's design. The house is in a good state of preservation internally & features polished cedar joinery throughout including the staircase and large folding doors are filled with small stained-glass panels depicting birds & butterflies. There are also two large stained glass windows & on the stair landing. The plasterwork to arches & ceiling cornices is also in good condition & quite elaborate. There are 2 pressed metal ceilings in upstairs bedrooms replacing earlier plaster ceilings & a pressed metal ceiling & dado in the billiard room. There are 10 fireplaces of pink, black, grey or white marble. All feature different tiles to hearths & grates. The brass, porcelain- tipped picture rails & several of the large brass curtain rods are still in position. The main entrance hallway & verandahs feature floors of encaustic tiles in geometric patterns. Electric servants bell-pushes are still in position in most main rooms, although the original bell-board has disappeared & some of the gas brackets are still intact from the time when the house had its own gas generating plant. The drawing room & dining rooms still have their original carpets although in somewhat worn condition. Externally the house is in good, if run-down, condition with original cast-iron lace all intact. =Gardens= Gardens Anambah House is set on a slight hill above a \\"lagoon\\" 5km north west of central Maitland. Its mature araucaria pines and silky oaks (Grevillea robusta) make it a prominent element in the surrounding countryside which is generally cleared of tree vegetation. It is approached via a service drive which has been planted with pines, native trees and African olives. The southern side of the formal garden is fenced by a picket fence and Cape plumbago (P.capensis) and Cape honeysuckle/ tecoma (Tecomaria capensis) hedges. These are punctuated by wrought iron gates hung off elaborate gate posts which lead to the gravelled carriage loop which has brick edging an drains. The perimeter plantings of African olive, tecoma and silky oak enclose the garden to the east. A lawn tennis court with a recently built pavilion lies to the north of the house. The garden has a collection of Brachychiton trees which include kurrajong (B. populneus), Queensland lacebark (B. discolor), bottle tree (B. rupestris) and an unusual hybrid Brachychiton. ;Design Elements The front garden has a simplified late 19th century layout. It is defined by its enclosing hedges and is dominated by the carriage loop, mature silky oaks, jacarandas, araucarias and brachychitons. More recent additions are tallow trees (Sapium sebiferum) which are in the process of being pleached. To the rear of the house are of the house are mature figs, stone pines (Pinus pinea) and African olives. There is an intimate courtyard featuring palms and a fountain linking the kitchen area and billiard room and which acts as the informal entrance to the main house. ;Perceptual Elements Prominent views out of the garden are to the hills to the north. The overall feeling in the garden, however, is one of enclosure with a focus on the strong design of the house and carriage loop. The vertical lines of the araucaria pines complement the height of the house. Small intimate spaces are provided by the billiard room lawn garden, the courtyard and the tennis court area. The sense of a country grazier's property is evoked by the combination of plant material and there is a feeling of quiet retreat into a former era. (AHC) The formal homestead garden is approached through wrought iron gates hung on elaborately stuccoed brick gate posts set in a timber picket fence. The driveway and paths within this area are brick edged & guttered & were originally gravelled although they are now overgrown. There is an overgrown lawn tennis court and many superb trees, including Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), jacarandas (J.mimosifolia), orchid trees (Bauhinia x variegata cv.s),frangipanis (Plumeria rubra cv.s) & a Queensland bottle tree. The garden was sheltered from the prevailing winds by windbreaks of native olives & hedges of \\"Orange Honeysuckle\\" (Cape honeysuckle/tecoma (Tecomaria capensis)). Outlines of formal beds can still be seen in what are now lawns. The house is set on a hill overlooking what is called the \\"lagoon\\". This is a picturesque small lake which is a habitat for the many water birds which frequent the area. The lagoon & the area between it and the house are considered very important to the house's setting..NTA, 1986 =Outbuildings= ;Stables 2 storey, sandstock brick stable block includes grooms quarters & hay loft over buggy room, harness room & horse boxes with original wood-blocked floors. ;Barn A typical rude timber farm building of the period, with slab sides & iron roof. ;Garage & Dairy Weatherboard structures important only as part of the homestead group. ;Outhouses Well constructed of sandstock brick. One for servants & one for family. Built over deep brick- arched pits. The family one is tiled to dado height and is a \\"2 seater\\". = Condition = The house is in a good state of preservation internally. The plasterwork to arches & ceiling cornices is also in good condition. The brass, porcelain-tipped picture rails & several of the large brass curtain rods are still in position. Electric servants bell-pushes are still in position in most main rooms, although the original bell-board has disappeared & some of the gas brackets are still intact from the time when the house had its own gas generating plant. The drawing room & dining rooms still have their original carpets although in somewhat worn condition. Externally the house is in good, if run-down, condition with original cast-iron lace all intact.NTA, 1983 The garden is in good condition and elements such as the hedges have been progressively restored by the present owners. Its basic layout is intact although there has been a reduction in the number of perennial and annual beds.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Anambah House with its house, billiard room, stables and gardens form a complete and intact example of a prosperous late 19th century graziers homestead. It is an important relic of the great agricultural heritage of the lower Hunter, now passing into history with the onset of the resources boom. The house is also significant as a major example of the work of J. W. Pender, an important architect of the Hunter region. Anambah House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The church is at 49 William Street while the cemetery is approximately away, approximately beyond the end of George St, also in East Maitland. The church was designed by Cyril and Arthur Blacket (Blacket Brothers) and built from 1884 to 1886. The cemetery is also known as Glebe Gully Burial Ground and Glebe Paddock. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 August 2012.  History  =St Peter's Anglican Church Precinct= The land on which the St. Peter's Church group stands was selected by Archdeacon William Broughton in 1829. A further lot to the south-west was gifted to the parish in 1867, two intermediate lots being purchased in 1881. These now compose the churchyard itself, while the denominational school, parsonage, curate's cottage, columbarium and Youth Centre are located on the original grant. St. Peter's, East Maitland, is one of the oldest Anglican parishes in Australia, having been established in 1834. From 1829, Church of England services were held inside the school house on Stockade Hill, very close to the later site of the first dedicated church. The present church was built further up the hill, on land underlaid by stone rather than by clay. Edmund Blacket's sons Cyril and Arthur, practising under the name of Blacket Brothers but with Cyril pre-eminent, designed the new church. The builder, Oliver Saunders, had laid the foundations before financial difficulties forced him into a breach of contract. The work was then supervised by Alexander Sellar, who did not recommission a builder. For aesthetic and practical reasons, local stone, rather than brick, was chosen for above-ground works. The design called for a tower and spire of great height. As these were to be built at a future time, finance permitting, detailed designs were not produced. Massive foundations for the tower were, however, laid in 1885. The church was dedicated by Bishop J. B. Pearson, on 29 September 1886. The fabric of the church has since remained substantially unchanged. Stained glass windows and furniture have been progressively added, in most cases not long after the church was built. St. Peter's Church Hall was once the East Maitland Denominational School. It is likely that the building was erected between 1842 and 1847. The school bell appears to have been transferred from an older school house after its closure. After 1867, the building was rented out; from 1885 until 1897 it was occupied by the Department of Lands. The old school then became the parish hall. It was then leased by Miss Barker, the principal of \\"Rydal\\", a private boarding school for girls and preparatory school for boys. During the Second World War the building was used by the National Emergency Service as a first aid post. It then reverted to use as a parish hall and office. The Rectory was built in 1860, to the south of the original church. Originally a four-roomed Victorian Georgian style brick cottage with a separate kitchen and shingled roof, alterations and additions have been made over a long period. Two extra rooms were added in 1873, and another in 1893. The roof shingles were replaced in slate at some stage between these two dates. In 1920, the rectory was substantially renovated and modified in a predominantly Arts and Crafts style, executed to a design by local architect Robert Scobie, although much of the 1860 fabric of the building remained substantially intact. Many of the original features remain internally and externally legible. The eastern portion of the slate roof appears to follow the ridge and roof lines of the 1860 parsonage. The Youth Centre building originated during the Second World War, when an important military camp (the Greta Army Camp) was established in the lower Hunter district near the township of Greta, some 42 km to the north- west. After the war, its more than two hundred timber-framed huts were used as a reception camp for migrants. One of these was purchased by the parish in 1960 and moved to Eastville, a newly developed, chiefly Housing Commission suburb at the eastern boundary of East Maitland. In 1961 the building was dedicated as the Church of St. Mark. It ceased to be used as such in 1976, although for a time the Sunday School continued to use it. The building, by then called St Mark's Hall, was used by the 3rd East Maitland Scouts until 1982, when it was relocated to the approximate site of the original church. Although the Scout group relocated in 1989, the Youth Centre, as it is now known, continues to serve the needs of young people of the parish and of the wider community. It is being used by the Samaritans, the Anglican charitable organisation, as a drop-in centre for those in physical need or seeking spiritual counsel. =The Glebe Cemetery= A glebe of was included in Major Thomas Mitchell's plan for the Township of Maitland and was marked out by Assistant Surveyor G. B. White in 1829. In 1830, however, Governor Darling received an instruction from the Secretary of State for Colonies that \\"the glebe allotted to each chaplain shall be to the extent of \\". In addition, each chaplain was to be allowed one or two convict labourers to keep his glebe in order, who would be fed and clothed at public expense. Accordingly, Major Mitchell instructed Assistant Surveyor White, on 5 September 1834, to add to the already marked out as the glebe at Maitland. White reported on 15 November 1834 that he had measured the glebe but had excluded from it containing a stone quarry and had made up the difference by including a part of the garden attached to the Government Cottage. Mitchell disapproved of those alterations and told White to reverse them, but shortly thereafter was over-ruled by Governor Bourke who ordered the quarry to be excluded from the glebe. As the glebe had to be , a deficiency therefore existed of , 2 roods and 6 perches. A small parcel of this extent was marked on the opposite side of the burial ground from the glebe. The glebe thus extended further up the hills than did the earlier glebe. It now included a large portion of the Mounted Police paddock and also a spur of the old line of road to Wisemans Ferry that served the stone quarry. Evidence of this road, which is marked on early plans, is still distinguishable in the form of a shallow cutting in the glebe gully. The stone quarry adjacent to the cemetery was already established by 1835 and being worked by various individuals, when Rev. G. K. Rusden expressed concern that it was being plundered to construct private dwellings and (even) a Catholic Chapel. Despite Rusden's attempt to require his written permission to work the quarry, it remained excluded from the glebe and has been Crown Land, ever since. The overgrown remains of the quarry are clearly evident. The burial ground itself was marked out, cleared and fenced in 1829. By 1832, however, it had fallen into an overgrown state of neglect and the catechist, Lieut. Wood, complained to the Archdeacon that, \\"there being no sexton, any persons having a corpse to inter placed it where and in any direction they pleased\\".J Waddell, 1996 Even deceased Roman Catholics made their way, informally, into the burial ground. The subsoil was so hard that the graves were scarcely more than two feet deep, \\"attracting native dogs to the spot & causing a noxious effluvia (sic) to passengers on the road\\".Rev. C. P. N. Wilton, April, 1832 A sexton was appointed in May, 1832. The burial ground was extended in 1835, consecrated in 1843 (on the same day as St Peter's Church) and extended, again, in 1850, by fencing the former access road to the quarry. The earliest gravestone in the cemetery dates from 1828, the burial having been moved there from elsewhere in 1835. The headstone of Andrew Sparke marks the first identified original burial in November, 1830. Subsequent monuments are notable for their quaint spelling, lurid descriptions and other idiosyncrasies. They provide a valuable insight into life - and death - in colonial NSW. The Glebe Cemetery is the resting place of several notable pioneers of the district including, reputedly but unmarked, Colonial Architect Francis Greenway. The cemetery remained in regular use until 1892. Title to was transferred to Maitland City Council in 1994.  Description  The Church Group is on ground rising from near Newcastle Street (New England Highway) up to St. Peter's Church which stands on the commanding eminence of Stockade Hill, East Maitland. It is thus situated at the western end of William Street, the principal axis of colonial East Maitland. This broad avenue still connects St Peter's visually and spatially to the Maitland Courthouse and the Maitland Gaol at the eastern end, providing a powerful reminder of the interplay between church and state in colonial NSW. The site, which has a double street frontage to Banks Street and William Street, slopes away to the north-west. =The Church= The walls of the church, which was completed in 1885, are constructed in substantial white sandstone quarried at nearby Two Mile Creek. The roof is of kauri pine, and is covered in best Welsh slate. A planned tower and steeple have never been built, although massive foundations are in place. The interior of the church conforms with the gothic scheme of the exterior. A lofty nave runs between the western door and the marble chancel steps. Beyond this is the chancel, flanked by a vestry and an organ chamber, while the sanctuary contains the altar and reredos. The sides of the nave are marked by granite columns with rounded capitals, with a series of lancet arches supporting the clerestory roof. These give way to two matching aisles. The kauri pine hammer beam king post roof trusses support a cedar-boarded ceiling. The concrete floor of the nave, the chancel and the sanctuary are covered with encaustic inlaid tiles imported from Shropshire. The stone windows contain mullions and cinquefoils. The stained glass is of a particularly high quality in both design and materials. The furniture is a mixture of Australian, British and continental items. The marble and alabaster pulpit, which is modelled on that in St Saviour's Cathedral in Goulburn and carved by John Roddis of Birmingham, is supported by marble columns and contains five panels depicting Biblical themes: Christ as the Good Shepherd, Elijah being fed by ravens, Moses with the Commandments, Peter holding the keys of salvation by faith and Paul holding the sharp two-edged sword of scripture. It was presented by Jane Eckford of East Maitland, in memory of her parents John and Eliza. John was the eldest son of William Eckford, convict harbour pilot at Newcastle. The brass lectern depicts an eagle standing on the sphere of the earth, around which it carries the Gospel on its back. It was presented by the surviving children of William and Elizabeth Eckford. The reredos, presented by the sons of Samuel and Ann Clift in memory of their parents, is of Oamaru stone and Carrara marble, its three panels symbolising the Trinity, and severally bearing the legends Alpha and Omega and the christogram IHS, surmounted by a Latin cross. It was carved by David Gourlay of Sydney and erected by William Hallam, also of Sydney. The font, of Caen stone with marble pilasters, features carved panels recording scriptural baptismal scenes, each separated by one of the four Evangelists. \\\\Erected in 1888 and paid for by those who had been baptised in the original church, it is a replica of that in St. Saviour's Cathedral, Goulburn, as is the pulpit; both are by John Roddis of Birmingham. The organ, with richly decorated pipes, was built by Henry Willis, of London, in 1876. Pending the building of the church, it was stored in the parish Denominational School. It is one of the best-preserved such instruments in the State, having been conserved with financial assistance from the Heritage Office. The nave seats were manufactured to the specification of Blacket Brothers, being very similar to those designed by their father for All Saints' Woollahra. Some of these were installed in 1959, well after the opening of the church. All follow the same design. The stained glass windows in the nave, the chief glory of the church, were executed by Lavers and Westlake of London. They depict various Scriptural scenes with a particular delicacy and sensitivity to detail. Some other windows, particularly those in the clerestory, are of later manufacture and have been progressively installed, chiefly as memorial gifts. The font was placed in the church in 1888, the pulpit in 1893 and the reredos in 1894. The gaslights, contemporaneous with the church were replaced with the present electric pendant lights in 1926. =St. Peter's Church Hall= The hall stands to the west of the site, near Banks Street. Its design is symmetrical, and accommodated pupils within large open spaces in which classes would be divided into groups rather than individual classrooms. While aesthetically undistinguished, the massing of the building toward gabled wings along a central axis does give an impression of solidity, as it was no doubt meant to do. A schoolmaster's residence, with dormer windows, was provided in the high roof void. The classroom now features a stage, while the master's residence is now a flat. Window and door lintels are of stone. A skillion weatherboard extension accommodates a meeting room, while much of the verandah to the north has been infilled in the same material. Large multi-pane, double-hung sash windows light the building by day. Internally, exposed queen post trusses and timber rafters support a timber-lined ceiling and zincalume roof. Floors are of timber; walls are lined with painted, compressed sheeting. =The Rectory= The present structure of the Rectory is the result of considerable alterations, renovations and extensions undertaken as the building grew along with the parish and town that it served. The original section, much of which survives, was a Victorian Georgian verandahed cottage. This was subsequently altered to the extent that it now conforms with the Arts and Crafts style while retaining many earlier features. Originally of brick, with flagged verandahs and a wooden shingled roof, the brick and weatherboard extensions transformed the cottage into a much larger dwelling. The stables were converted into garaging. One side of the verandah roof is supported by wooden posts, the remainder by brick pillars. A number of obsolete items, such as stone steps and a trap door to the cellar, remain in place but largely concealed by later works. =Youth Centre= This is a hardwood timber-framed, weatherboard-clad building typical of thousands built as elements of barrack blocks built during the Second World War and traditionally called \\"lines\\" after the regularity of their placement. It is of a standard design at once familiar to anyone who has done military service. Originally standing in the military camp, later a migrant camp, at Greta, the structure has so far been moved three times in the course of its many incarnations. It currently features a verandah running approximately half way down its south-eastern sides, together with a small chancel-like projection associated with its previous use as a church. It has sash windows, with kitchen and toilets. Internally, the building has a timber floor; the walls are lined with timber boards, while the ceiling is lined with compressed sheet. It currently caters to the needs of youth, and previously acted as a \\"drop-in\\" centre operated by the Samaritans, the Anglican charitable group. =The Glebe Cemetery= The cemetery and adjacent quarry together occupy an area of 2 acres (0.4 ha). The cemetery is the only historic built element in a broader cultural landscape of both Aboriginal and European significance. The remains of the Old South Road traverse the site and preserve important evidence of early road technology. = Condition = ;Church: While the fabric stands in generally good condition, the nature of the site as well as inappropriate earthworks previously employed have combined to create drainage problems. Absorption of water has caused considerable spalling to structurally important sections of lower stonework. Subsequent conservation works have improved drainage, although the damage to stonework cannot be remediated unless and until finances permit. The stonework is generally sound, although more damage is evident on the weather side. This applies particularly to butresses, together with window beading and sills. There are some rust stains caused by oxidisation of protective window grilles. The slate roof is weathered in places. The church is the subject of an approved Conservation Management Plan, completed in December 2010. Subsequent conservation works have involved repairs to guttering, downpipes and drainage. Earth has been regraded so as to direct water away from the walls. ;St. Peter's Parish Hall: The hall stands in good condition, with a sound roof. The bricks, stonework and pointing are generally in fair condition, although rising damp remains a problem in places. ;Rectory: This also stands in good condition, having undergone considerable repair and maintenance. Much of the original brickwork is protected by the verandah roof. ;Youth Centre: This building is well roofed and painted, with a sound hardwood frame. Its piers are high enough to avoid damage by damp or termites. The curtilage of the church has considerable archaeological potential. Apart from the brick and stone buildings that once stood in what is now the churchyard, the foundations for the tower as designed by Blacket Brothers are also extant. There is a high potential for the existence of archaeological relics, particularly foundations, on the site of the original church of 1838, demolished in 1890. The probability of finding Indigenous relics within the site cannot presently be quantified. ;The Glebe Cemetery The cemetery and adjacent quarry are poorly maintained and overgrown. Although some of the headstones have been re-erected and conserved, most are either broken, knocked over or both. An area where vaults have subsided has been fenced off. The cemetery has the potential to reveal burial customs, both formal and informal, in colonial NSW. =Integrity= The portions of the original grant along Newcastle Street (New England Highway) have been alienated and built on. The church has a very high level of integrity and intactness. Although certain items, such as some windows, furniture, choir tiling and pulpit, were introduced after completion of the main body of the building in 1886, most of these addressed deficiencies or constituted improvements as part of the Blackets' design scheme. The level of intactness is illustrated by the fact that electric lighting was not introduced until 1926, and that the fittings, circuit diagram, steel conduit and rubber- insulated wiring have survived without substantial modification. The hall is also substantially intact, having undergone surprisingly few modifications over the years, although these include the lining of the walls, partial infilling of the verandah, and a weatherboard extension. It remains instantly recognisable as an 1840s schoolroom with supporting rooms and master's residence. The Rectory retains many elements of its origins as an 1860s parsonage. While renovations, repairs and extensions have been carried out, these have mostly complemented or concealed, rather than destroyed, the original fabric, much of which remains legible within the context of the later works. The military origins of the Youth Centre are easily recognisable. The addition of a verandah, together with a small chancel, has hardly altered its original shape. The Glebe Cemetery has suffered extensive vandalism to most of its monuments, is overgrown and poorly maintained. Some conservation works were carried out in 2002. = Modifications and dates = ;The Site The first portion of the Newcastle Street frontage to be alienated was sold to the Crown for the Department of Lands in 1894. The Lands Office, designed by Walter Liberty Vernon, stands on this site, as does an associated cottage and outbuildings. The parson's paddock at the opposite end of the block, intended for the grazing of horses, was sold in 1962 and is now the site of a service station. The former tennis courts were sold in 1988, but their site has not yet been built upon. The land on which the St. Peter's Church group stands was selected by Archdeacon Broughton in 1829. A further lot to the south-west was gifted to the parish in 1867, two intermediate lots being purchased in 1881. These now compose the churchyard itself, while the denominational school, parsonage, curate's cottage, columbarium and Youth Centre are located on the original grant. ;The Church The stained glass windows in the sanctuary, aisle and narthex were installed at or shortly after the time of construction. Some clerestory windows, being less visible, were progressively installed between 1886 and the 1920s, with isolated exceptions completed in the 1950s and 1960s. The choir vestry window was installed in 1916, while that in the priests' vestry was not completed until 1968. The font was placed in the church in 1888, the pulpit in 1893, and the rederos in 1894. The gas lights, contemporaneous with the church, were replaced with the present electric pendant lights in 1926. ;St Peter's Church Hall The modifications to the hall include the infilling of part of the northern verandah during the 1950s, and a weatherboard skillion extension for a second Sunday School room in 1959. A stage was built inside the former schoolroom in about 1900. ;The Rectory The Rectory was extended in 1873, two additional rooms being provided. A third room was added in 1893. In 1920, significant alterations were performed to a plan prepared by local architect Robert Scobie. The stable, built in 1867, was converted into garaging when the horses were replaced by cars. ;The Youth Centre A small chancel was added to the eastern wall of the former barrack hut at some time before 1976, when it ceased to be used as a church. The verandah was added in the early 1980s, after it had been moved to its current site. ;The Glebe Cemetery In July, 2002, excavation, conservation and re-erection of 18 headstones was carried out and the subsided vaults/crypts were fenced off. There is evidence of ongoing unauthorised clearing/maintenance of several gravesites.  Heritage listing  St Peter's Anglican Church Group and the Glebe Cemetery are state significant elements of the colonial heritage of the Hunter Valley. Together, they exemplify the evolution of religious practice, architectural achievement and social life in the community from 1829 to the present day. St Peter's Church Group site, in continuous use for religious purposes since 1829, encompasses St Peter's Church (1886), Church Hall (1840s), Rectory (1860) and other built and archaeological items. The broad avenue of William Street, principal axis of colonial East Maitland, connects St Peter's visually and spatially to the Courthouse and the Gaol, providing a powerful reminder of the interplay between church and state in colonial NSW. The Church is one of the finest examples in New South Wales of a sandstone church in the Victorian Academic Gothic style as interpreted by a leading architectural practice of the time. The Church Hall is one of the earliest substantially intact large brick school buildings still extant in New South Wales. The Glebe Cemetery was marked out, cleared and fenced in 1829, although earlier, unmarked, graves are probably present. Its monuments form a record of the early families of the district, reputedly including the unmarked burial of Colonial Architect Francis Greenway. The adjacent quarry, established by 1835, provided stone for St Peter's Church, the Catholic Chapel, private dwellings and headstones for the cemetery. St Peter's Anglican Church and Glebe Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 31 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. St. Peter's church exemplifies the highest aspirations of the Anglo-Catholic tradition in New South Wales, which from the 1890s has been the dominant Anglican ecclesiastic tradition in New South Wales. The site has been continuously occupied for ecclesiastical purposes from 1836 onward, although services in the nearby schoolhouse were held even earlier. The present St. Peter's church is a notable example of the work of Cyril and Arthur Blacket, heirs to the practice and heritage of their father Edmund. While not designed by Edmund, the church is closely related to some of his other celebrated commissions executed in the Victorian Academic Gothic style, and represents a continuation of his influence even after his death. The church hall, formerly the Denominational School, provides evidence of the nineteenth century connection between religious and educational cultural endeavours. The Rectory illustrates attempts by church authorities to modify assets to reflect the growth and development of the parish within the context of the wider Colonial church, and also the close relationship between Anglo-Catholic clergy and the church buildings that reflect their theology. The Glebe Cemetery served the Anglican community between 1829 and 1892, although earlier, unmarked, graves and unrecorded burials of other denominations are probably present. Its headstones form a record of the early families, pioneers, settlers and prominent citizens of the district, reputedly including the unmarked burial of Colonial Architect Francis Greenway. The contentious history of the adjacent quarry bespeaks the competition among individuals and groups in colonial East Maitland for resources such as building materials. Aboriginal use of a ceremonial site in the vicinity of the cemetery continued through the Colonial Period and, perhaps, to the present day. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The church has a strong connection with architects Cyril and Arthur Blacket, and through them with their father, the leading Gothic architect within the Colony. The parish itself was established by Archdeacon William Grant Broughton, who later became Bishop of Australia, who dedicated the first church on the site. The site was once an important centre of social life, not only for parishioners but for members of the wider community. Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, a brilliant jurist and politician, as a boy attended East Maitland Superior School and was a member of the St. Peter's choir. \\"The Doc\\" went on to become a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and Australian House of Representatives, Commonwealth Attorney General and Minister for External Affairs, the youngest ever Justice of the High Court of Australia, Chief Justice of New South Wales, a founder of the United Nations Organisation and President of the United Nations General Assembly. The Glebe Cemetery is the final resting place of the early pioneers, settlers and prominent citizens of the district, and reputedly includes the unmarked burial of Colonial Architect Francis Greenway. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The church is situated at the western end of William Street, the principal axis of colonial East Maitland. This broad avenue still connects St Peter's visually and spacially to the Courthouse and the Gaol at the eastern end, providing a powerful reminder of the interplay between church and state in colonial NSW. The church is a prominent and highly legible example of the Victorian Academic Gothic style as interpreted by the Blacket family. The quality of craftsmanship and materials is very high, particularly with regard to stonework, stained glass windows, encaustic tiling and sacred furnishings in stone and marble. The mechanical pipe organ, by Henry Willis of London, is the only operable survivor of five similar organs built by Willis for the Maitland area in the nineteenth century. It was restored in 1998 with the financial assistance of the New South Wales Heritage Office. The rectory exemplifies the evolutionary and cultural influences upon clerical and parish life in New South Wales over the past 150 years, and the manner in which a Victorian Georgian cottage has been adapted in later architectural styles, using contemporary materials. The hall demonstrates both internally and externally the use of symmetry in constructing a large brick educational building of the Victorian Georgian style in the New South Wales context. Alterations and additions to the original fabric have not diminished the demonstrative value of the building. While the Youth Centre is a straightforwardly vernacular building, it provides an insight into the inherent strength and remarkable versatility of New South Wales timber barrack buildings of the Second World War, so many of which have been used outside their original contexts. The cemetery is aesthetically distinctive. Its headstones are notable for their quaint spelling, lurid descriptions and other idiosyncrasies. Maitland City Council notes that the relationship of gravestones and memorials in an overgrown landscape of grassland, creates an atmosphere which emphasises the historic nature of the cemetery in a somewhat neglected but \\"romantic\\" state. The broader visual catchment surrounding the cemetery has a \\"dramatic quality\\" that has been emphasised in prior assessments by the National Trust and the Australian Heritage Commission. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. St. Peter's church is exemplifies the highest aspirations of the Anglo-Catholic tradition in New South Wales, which from the 1890s has been the dominant in Anglican ecclesiastic tradition in New South Wales. It has a special association for those who are members of the parish or who were once members, and for citizens of the City of Maitland. The Rectory has special associations with the clerical families who have lived there for over 150 years, as well as with members of the parish over that period of time. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The fabric and furnishings of the church have both local and international connections. The origins of most of these have been carefully recorded in the Conservation Management Plan prepared in December 2010. The substantially original condition of the church allows an insight into Colonial ecclesiastical and cultural life in the 1880s. The rectory has the potential to provide an understanding of the evolution of clerical life between 1860 and the present day. The hall remains legible as an education facility, with religious instruction still continuing on site. The Youth Centre affords an insight into efforts by the Samaritans, the Anglican charitable organisation for the Diocese, to assist those in need. The cemetery has the potential to reveal archaeological information about nineteenth century burial practices, particularly unrecorded burials and those prior to 1829. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The quality and provenance of certain furnishings at St. Peter's are uncommon in New South Wales. The pulpit, font, rederos and many of the stained glass windows are fine expressions of the art of the mason, sculptor and glazier, no expense having been spared in importing these from artists and companies in Britain, Australia and the Continent. The Rectory is an uncommon example of a dwelling, continuously occupied and owned by a single religious organisation, that has evolved over a century and a half. Sunday School facilities, such as the hall, are increasingly rare in NSW, not only for financial and staffing reasons but due to a perceived lack of community interest. It may be necessary to canvas alternate uses for this building, if it is to survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The church demonstrates the principal characteristics of a large church in the Victorian Academic Gothic style as interpreted by Blacket Brothers. Failure to build the tower and spire does not detract from the demonstrative value of the completed and intact body of the church. The base of the proposed tower is legible, affording an example of the stages of the project as planned by the architect, Clerk of Works and the parish itself. The hall, substantially intact, exemplifies the way in which children and their schoolmaster were accommodated in a New South Wales denominational school of the 1840s. The original portion of the Rectory is demonstrative of domestic clerical life in the Colony.

It is the successor of the previous Galaxy Tab S3, and was announced alongside the cheaper Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.5.  History  The Tab S4 was revealed online on August 1 2018, with preorders for WiFi and cellular models beginning on the same day. In the United States at launch, LTE models are available for purchase via Verizon, with support from other carriers arriving in Q3 2018.  Specifications  = Hardware = Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 with keyboard and pen The Tab S4 features an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 with 4 GB of LPDDR4X memory. It is available in 64 or 256 GB storage variants, with expandable microSD card support for up to 400 GB. The Tab S4 has Bluetooth 5.0 support and a larger 7,300 mAh battery with adaptive fast charging, and a claimed video playback time of up to 16 hours. The device has integrated far-field microphones that allow Google Assistant to be controlled from far distances. Compared to the Galaxy Tab S3, the Tab S4 has a larger 10.5-inch 2560x1600 display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and slimmer bezels, allowing its footprint to be similar to its predecessor. As a result, the Tab S4 no longer features a fingerprint sensor or navigation and home buttons, and uses a facial and iris scanner instead. The front-facing selfie- camera has been upgraded to 8 megapixels and can record in 1080p resolution. The four stereo speakers have also been tuned by AKG and support Dolby Atmos surround sound. The front and back glass uses Gorilla Glass 3 and the front doesn't have the Samsung logo. = Software = The Tab S4 comes with Samsung Experience 9.5, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo. The device's firmware was made upgradable to One UI, which is based on Android 9, on a firmware upgrade rollout starting on April 2019. New features include Samsung Knox protection and a Daily Board mode, that allows for the display of photos, and weather and calendar information. Bixby 2.0 will be added in a future software update in 2019. Samsung DeX is also natively supported and is launched on the device when a keyboard cover is connected. The Tab S4 can run up to 20 multiple application windows simultaneously, and supports split screen, drag and drop, and right click functionality. When connected to an external monitor, the screen can be used as a trackpad. = Accessories = The Tab S4 is included with an improved S Pen stylus with a 0.7 mm tip and 4,096 pressure sensitivity levels, similar to the S Pen on the Galaxy Note 8. It weighs and supports features such as air commands, translation of on-screen text, screen-off memos, and live messages. A detachable keyboard accessory is also offered separately and magnetically latches onto the Tab S4. It has a holster for the S Pen but does not include a trackpad, requiring users to rely on the touchscreen, S Pen or a bluetooth mouse for input.

It was built from 1844 by John Smith. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  As early as 1830 emancipated convict John Smith, man of property, insisted on calling himself \\"Gentleman Smith\\". Despite the opinions of the Mitchells and other free settlers, Smith was determined to do well. He no doubt felt self-satlsfied when his carriage was used by Governor Fitzroy on a vice-regal visit to the Hunter Valley in 1847. It is possible that Smith named a road that traversed his Wallis Plains farm \\"Fitzroy Road\\" as a personal compliment to the Governor on this occasion. In 1838 Smith advertised a 250 acre farm at Wallis Plains to let, for five to seven years, 'ideal for newly-arrived emigrants.' In 1855, when the East Maitland and West Maitland communities were debating where the government should build a definitive courthouse, Smith had a lengthy letter printed in the Maitland Mercury, telling readers, and posterity, of his past and present largesse. He wroteL 'I have accommodated the community with a court house for ten or twelve years for a very trifling expense; and I should have no objection to giving half an acre of land for the purposes of a court house, providing it shall be erected'. In this letter he claimed that he was the oldest settler on the Hunter River, and stated:'The Maitland district was established in October 1818, by Governor Macquarie. Two others, with myself, were permitted to selecte each a farm in any part of Maitland where we thought proper, and he gave me a written order that I should have the first choice. This indulgence was given for the services rendered on the occasion. All three of us fixed on land in East Maitland, considering it was the best place for a township.' The \\"occasion\\" was probably Macquarie's visit to the district in August 1818. In the letter Smith avered, that, in the great flood of 1819:'I was one of those who, on that occasion, went to West Maitland to take some of the settlers from the tops of their houses, in a large boat, and landed them on the hill behind the old courthouse.' Smith's substantial steam flour mill at East Maitland was no longer economical when wheat growing declined in the Lower Hunter from about the 1860s. However in 1868 he came up with a proposal to form a company to turn the building into a woollen cloth manufactory. No investor came forward. Smith died in 1870, without seeing this plan materialise. Smith and his wife Mary are buried in the Christ Church cemetery, Newcastle. He is an interesting pioneer, having lived a long and active life, many records survive that reveal his character, dealings and achievements. They illustrate how a man might do well in colonial society, moving from lowly convict status to that of a self-appointed \\"gentleman\\" of considerable wealth and property, albeit one that many other more respectable people thought lacking in gentility and good manners.Hunter, 2012 The mill was subsequently used for retail and business premises, although it was vacant as of 2017.

It was built from 1835 to 1839. It is also known as Government Cottage, Denny Day's Cottage and Bonnie Doon. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  A small primitive structure was erected on this site in the early days of the township as a residence for dignitaries visiting the colonial settlement of Maitland. Governor Macquarie stayed there during his visit to Wallis Plains in 1818. In 1821 Macquarie visited again commenting that the new structure was a big improvement on the earlier one. It was then called Lachlan Cottage in honour of the Governor's son, born in Sydney in 1813. The site is shown as Government Cottage on the 1829 map of Maitland by Surveyor White. The third Government Cottage was built in 1827 and Governor Bourke stayed there during his 1833 Maitland visit. This cottage is thought to have been a short distance from the present cottage. The present cottage was the fourth residence erected on the site was erected sometime between 1835 and 1839. It was used by the Maitland Police Magistrate, including Denny Day. Magistrate Day won fame for capturing those responsible for the Myall Creek massacre in June 1838 and the Jewboy Davis gang in December, 1840. Day also laid the foundation stone of the Maitland Gaol in February, 1884 and also the foundation stones of Maitland Hospital and the Maitland Benevolent Society. Passing visitors were also accommodated, including Governor Gipps in 1839 and 1843 when it was grandly called \\"Government House\\". Edward Denny Day was born in Ireland in 1801, the son of an Irish clergyman. He chose the Army as a career and was a lieutenant in the 62nd Regiment in India when he retired in 1834 because of ill Health and came to Sydney. He was appointed clerk to the Executive Council and the following year to the Colonial Secretary's Department. He was appointed police magistrate at Maitland in September 1836 shortly after his marriage and came to Government Cottage. He was appointed to Muswellbrook in 1837, resigned in 1840 returned to Maitland to take up business and again appointed police magistrate in Maitland in 1840. While at Muswellbrook in 1838 Day was sent by Governor Gipps to search for the murderers of about 28 Aborigines who had been living on the banks of Myall Creek. The Myall Creek Massacre occurred on 10 June 1838 when a group of stockmen rounded up 28 Aboriginal men, women and children and killed them. Mr Day apprehended 11 white men, seven of whom were hanged following the subsequent trial. It is the first recorded hanging of white men for killing Aboriginal people. There was a public outcry at the hangings as the public believing that the killing of Aboriginals was not murder and white people should not be hung for such killings. Day was also responsible for the apprehension of the notorious Jew Boy bushranger gang who had terrorised the Hunter districts for several months in 1840. In December 1840 the gang raided stations at Muswellbrook and Scone and during a raid on Dangar's store at Scone a man named John Graham was killed. Day set out with a search party of 10 mounted men to search for the gang whom he found camped at Doughboy Hollow. The bushrangers were captured, found guilty and hanged. In 1843, part of Oldholme's verandah was enclosed and a kitchen added. After being appointed to other positions in the years after 1849, Day was returned to Maitland as police magistrate in 1858 and lived at Government Cottage, which he renamed Oldhome. Edward Denny Day was the first private owner of Government Cottage. It remained in the possession of the Day family until about 1920. It was known as \\"Bonnie Doon\\" at the time that Robert and Alice Blackman purchased it in the early 1950s, and retained that name for at least the twenty years that they owned the house. The Blackmans moved to Maitland from Neotsfield, Singleton in 1944 when that property was subdivided. Their initial house in Maitland was badly affected by the flood of 1949 and shortly after this (early 1950s) they bought Oldholme. The Blackmans rented an area to Gordon Mudd who operated it as a working farm. Later on some of the property was subdivided for residential use as there was a magnificent view overlooking Maitland township. It was bought by D. J. and M. F. Benson in 1975 who began a programme of restoration. In 1977 the property was purchased by Dr Lionel Fredman, a lecturer from the University of Newcastle. Oldholme was nominated for a Permanent Conservation Order in July 1978. A Permanent Conservation Order was gazetted over the property in 1981. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Looking along the front verandah Oldhome is set in spacious grounds amongst mature trees including Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla). Oldholme is a two-room, single story Georgian Colonial brick cottage, with verandah, with an interesting fanlight and door mouldings. Hipped iron roof extends over a verandah to three sides supported on later cast iron columns. One side of the verandah has been infilled with matching brickwork and joinery. The front door is of 6 panels with elaborate architrave with square fanlights above. On either side are two large double hung windows of triple opening sashes coupled in the pattern of 4:12:4 protected by wide timber louvered shutters. At the rear is a separate kitchen wing, now converted.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Oldholme is a single storey Colonial Georgian brick cottage, built about 1838 as a residence for special visitors and visiting governors of New South Wales. It replaced earlier cottages built under the direction of Governor Macquarie. The building was the fourth government cottage to be built on the site, the first being constructed in 1816. The site of the cottage is significant as it reflects the beginnings of official settlement in the area. The current house was visited by Governor Gibb and was home to Police Magistrate Denny Day. Day was responsible for the prosecution of the Myall Creek Massacre perpetrators and the capture of Jewboy Davis gang. Oldholme was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Description  The rectangular grave chamber is embedded in a round barrow of about 20 m diameter, framed by a ring of stones. The walls of the 6.5 x 1.7 metre chamber consist of 13 large uprights, tightly compacted with a fine wall of hewn stone tiles. On the exterior, the chamber is sealed with clay layered with crushed flint. The ceiling originally consisted of five large slabs of rock, of which three remain, complemented by two granite beams in 1961. The floor was laid with small flat stones covered in burnt flint. On the southern wall of the chamber, vertical stone plates form a separate section.

It was built in 1837. It operated as the Black Horse Inn from 1845 to 1878. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 April 2008.  History  The property now known as Englefield is believed to have been built by \\"Gentleman\\" John Smith 1837 at Wallis Creek on his Wallis Plains (now Maitland) farm. The land at Wallis Creek was originally \\"granted\\" to him (as 'tenant at will') by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1818, being one of the eleven early grants in the area permitting settlement to eleven \\"well-behaved\\" people. Smith was an emancipated convict who was sent to the penal settlement at Sydney, arriving in 1810 on the \\"Indian\\" under the name of James Sidebottom (born 1787 at Manchester), but managed to escape back to England. Then, apparently finding little opportunity there, he got himself into trouble again and was transported a second time, arriving in 1814 on the General Hewitt, under the new name of John Smith and was sent to the Newcastle penal settlement where he confessed his past to Major James Morisset, the Commandant (documented in the Bigge Report of 1819-1821). He was made Chief Constable in Newcastle under Commandants Wallis and Morisset to 1823, and in 1818 he was allowed to take up land at Wallis Creek, being formally emancipated in 1819. In 1823 Smith opened the first licensed inn in the Hunter Valley, the Ship Inn in Newcastle, and established the first store in it. He formed an agreement with the Waterloo Company in Sydney for the provision of flour to his store and bought the sloop Elizabeth to trade between Newcastle and Sydney. During this time he continued to expand his farm at Wallis Creek (and other parts of the Hunter) through grants and acquisition, and employed an overseer to run it, supplying wheat to the Commissariat in Newcastle in return for convict labour. In the 1828 Census, Smith was listed twice: in Newcastle as an innkeeper, and in Maitland as a farmer at Hazlewood of Wallis Plains (together with his wife Mary and their seven children) with a total acreage of 775 (of which 160 was under cultivation), 7 horses, 520 head of cattle and 300 sheep. Smith continued to expand his businesses in both locations and other parts of the state. On 18 August 1837, Governor Sir Richard Bourke ratified Smith's previous grants at Wallis Creek for around 148 acres (refer original indenture with the house signed by both Smith and his wife Mary) and it was around this time that Smith placed an order for stone window sills consistent with those in the original house now known as Englefield, built on that grant. It has not yet been established whether Smith used this house as his Maitland residence, but its size and elegance for the period, its location on his farm within walking distance of both his mill (Smith's Flour Mill, rebuilt as a steam mill in 1844) and his mill workers' accommodation (Smiths Row, later leased by Caroline Chisholm), suggest that it may have been. While many failed during the 1840s recession, Smith thrived on the available opportunities by \\"cashing up\\" and it was at this time (1 March 1843) that he and Mary sold the property to Henry Adams, innkeeper for one hundred pounds sterling, who then transferred his license for the Black Horse Inn from 46 Newcastle Street (across the road) to the property on 17 June 1845. It appears that around this time the house underwent extensions and alterations (as above) consistent with its conversion to an inn, which it remained until 1878 when Adams' sons re- converted it to a private residence and sold it (using the name Englefield for the first time). In 1856 a private racetrack was established in the paddock to the rear of the house and the first horse races in East Maitland were held there on Queen Victoria's birthday that year. During the 1870s, when the inn was leased by William Miles (licensee 1864-1877), the Black Horse Inn Races became a local fixture to celebrate special events such as the \\"Anniversary of the Colony\\". This was covered extensively in the Maitland Mercury, including the cooking of \\"kale cannon\\", a type of Irish stew, in the kitchen at the inn. In 1901 the architectural firm of John W. Pender (architect of Anambah House, Cintra House and Belltrees) was engaged to carry out restoration works on the property and a detailed specification is held in the Pender archives at the University of Newcastle. In 1910 John Hickling bought the property and the Hickling family, who were hay farmers, occupied it until 1968. During the period 1968 to 1986, it fell into disrepair. Gardens to one side of the house In 1986 Peter Gibbs bought the property and received special permission (viz. building restrictions on the floodplain) from the then Minister for Planning, Laurie Brereton MP, who visited the property in 1987, to build a workshop in the grounds, for the purpose of restoring the house and conducting a business from there, conserving Australian colonial furniture and building museum copies from old growth Hunter River red cedar (Toona ciliata) trees. During the next twenty years, Englefield went through its second major overhaul (after the 1843 works) to restore the original 1837 fabric and to make sense of the 1843 alterations and additions by adapting it to modern living. The garden at Englefield is a reconstruction around four remaining old trees (including three jacarandas of the 1940s, an over-100 year old mulberry and an old garden plan from the 1920s/30s (drawn from memory by a member of the family who occupied the property at that time). In both 1996 and 2006 the re- constructed garden was opened through Australia's Open Garden Scheme. A well at the rear of the building collapsed in 1997 and had to be filled in for safety reasons. In February 2005, her Excellency the Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir and Sir Nicholas Shehadie made an official visit to Englefield. Following completion of the conservation and restoration works, the owners nominated the house and garden to the State Heritage Register in 2006 with the support of Maitland City Council. Englefield (house and gardens) were listed on the State Heritage Register in April 2008.  Description  =House= Panelling in the hallways Englefield is a two-storey five-bay Georgian house with slender Doric columns to both levels of the verandah and sandstone flagging at ground level. It has six pane double hung sashes without horns and an iron roof with jerkin head gables. It is built of sandstock bricks held together with primitive lime mortar showing shell remnants, reinforced with animal hair. Its original shingle roof survives under the present iron. The main structural walls are fourteen inches thick with internal panelled reveals. It has six-panelled cedar doors and cedar chimneypieces. There are seven bedrooms, including two attic rooms (in very original condition), and maid's room over the old kitchen. On the first floor, at the street front, a single room runs the full width of the house, divided into two rooms and a hall by removable cedar floor-to-ceiling panelling incorporating a hinged door leaf. By virtue of its having a central ceiling rose, fireplaces at each end and a continuous boarded floor, the room architecturally reads as a single space, and may derive from the English model of a large first floor reception room that can be adapted for day-to-day use. (This feature is found in a number of Maitland residences all built around the same time: Walli House, Roseneath, the Eckford house and outside Maitland most notably at Franklin House in northern Tasmania.) It has a cellar, an early kitchen (that appears to pre-date the house, 1826) with wood-fired bread oven (and original hand made door), and back-to-back fireplaces with the adjoining flagged-floor scullery. Most of the lath and plaster ceilings remain, with original hand run ceiling roses in both the first floor reception room and the downstairs drawing room, the latter also retaining its original hand-run cornice. The house has an unusual architectural feature in that the front section of the house sits deliberately at an angle to the street front (less than 90). This appears to be due to the pre-existence of the kitchen, which may (along with a previous attached timber building) have been built at 90 degrees to a dirt road that had altered when the road was later formalised with stone gutters. =Site and gardens= Site plan The property consists of four lots, Lots 21-24, the house being on Lot 23. On the other three lots, a colonial-style garden has been reconstructed since 1986 by the current owner on architectural garden remains (including three jacaranda trees (Jacaranda mimosifolia) of the 1940s and a more than 100 year old mulberry (Morus sp.), and with loose reference to a garden plan of the 1920s/30s (drawn from memory by a member of the family who occupied the property at that time). Another side view of house and gardens Most plant varieties chosen have been known to exist in Australian gardens prior to 1850. The lack of grassed areas reflects the fact that \\"cottage beds\\" were easier to maintain than lawns. Areas are connected with gravel, stone or brick paths. An eccentric orchard under- planted with white evening primrose, alyssum and bulbs forms a second section. The orchard is bisected by a winding gravel path where azaleas grow. The left side of the orchard provides more circular forms and incorporates a stone folly to mark the ruin of a former stable and loft known to have existed at this position. The statue is placed at the intersection of various axes including those from the stair light window and back door. A third section is a drying court and kitchen garden (currently a herb garden and strawberry patch), which leads through the hedge to a formal parterre cottage garden with sundial centrepiece. The hedge is African olive (Olea europaea var.africana), a common form of colonial hedging. The seedlings were collected from surrounding paddocks and planted in 1989. The hedged parterre is being converted from self-seeding annuals to a rose garden of older European varieties (15th to 19th centuries), grown on their own roots (where available) and under-planted with hardy perennials.Gibbs & Kirkby, 2006 No outbuildings survived the 1955 flood. A workshop was sympathetically constructed in the grounds in 1987 by the current owner. Original sandstone guttering runs along the opposite side of the street. = Condition = The property, as at 21 November 2006, has been restored to \\"house museum\\" standard, retaining many original features. Englefield has integrity, with many original features and fabric. = Modifications and dates = * 1843: Alterations and additions, all in an early style and using early sandstock bricks and mortar, consistent with its adaptation as an inn, therefore probably done in 1843 when Henry Adams, innkeeper, bought the property and transferred his licence for the Black Horse Inn to the property. Changes as follows: (1) rear two-storey wall of northwest side of house removed, large beams inserted and two long rooms created (possibly men's dormitory upstairs and communal eating room downstairs), infilling area between original house and kitchen; (2) upper stair landing altered to provide more head room on main stairs, resulting in the simultaneous removal of the original upstairs service entrance, and new entrance knocked through from middle stair landing; (3) service stair removed (previously connecting rear lower southeast wing and servants' room diagonally above it) probably due to reduced space in upstairs servant's room when landing changed; (4) outside cellar entrance inserted or enlarged. Shortly after this, the kitchen roof was raised and a mezzanine level added; and a scullery was added to the rear of the kitchen;.Evidence discovered by Peter Gibbs during restoration; see Peter Gibbs, 2006 * 1878: Re-conversion to a private residence (notification in Maitland Mercury 5/10/1878; contractor was James Robinson). Key changes: (1) large street front window on front left side of house (over cellar) removed and two windows (matching right side windows) inserted; (2) cement rendering applied; (3) galvanised iron placed over roof shingles; (4) verandah replaced with a cast iron Victorian model.Victorian verandah was intrusive. The Georgian verandah was restored with a heritage grant in 1990 * 1901: Work by Pender and Silk Architects of West Maitland: mostly restoration of existing structure, including the 1878 Victorian verandah; redwood sashes replaced worn cedar ones. Remaining redwood sashes are intrusive (Specification No. 399, Pender Archives, University of Newcastle). *Staircase1986 - 2006: All works supervised by Peter Gibbs; joinery restoration and garden reconstruction by Peter Gibbs: # Restoration of original 1837 fabric including the Georgian verandah, Georgian staircase (damaged by fire and 1955 flood), upstairs partitions, cellar, utility areas and restoration of original paint schemes (from scrapings) on exterior of house and in downstairs drawing room, dining room, library, hall (approximate), whitewash in kitchen and scullery; # reconstruction of gardens and building of workshop in grounds (1987); # Modifications to the 1843 northwest wing additions to rectify building faults, and to adapt it for modern use, while retaining architectural and social history of the extension: ::(a) relocation/insertion of windows and doors in the northwest facing wall (doors from Trevallyn house demolished in the 1940s, and main windows from 1820s/30s house at 199 Newcastle Street [New England Highway] demolished in the 1980s) , returning symmetry and sunlight that was lost when the 1843 extension went in; ::(b) external sandstone colonnade constructed along northwest facing wall connecting doors at lower level and reconnecting garden to house (previously obstructed by 1843 extension); ::(c) modern kitchen, and bathrooms installed.Peter Gibbs, 2006  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Built in 1837 by John Smith on one of the eleven early 1818 \\"grants\\" from Governor Lachlan Macquarie at Wallis Creek, Englefield is a rare example of a pattern book, colonial, double pile Georgian house built in the style of an Irish farmhouse (jerkin head roof), retaining many original features (including its 1826 kitchen with working fireplace and wood-fired bread oven). It forms part of an important group of early colonial/Georgian houses clustered together on the road between Newcastle and Maitland in East Maitland. All of these houses are listed on the Register of the National Estate and can be seen from Englefield. In 1843 it underwent extensions and alterations at the rear (visible on the un-rendered southeast side of the northwest wing) to convert it to the Black Horse Inn, which achieved notoriety for the Black Horse Inn Races, and is significant in the social and economic history of inn development along the Newcastle - Maitland road. The significance of the property relates not only to its architecture and socio- economic history, but also to its association with Smith, an emancipated convict and an early entrepreneur in the Hunter Valley at a time when the Hunter was a key supplier of goods to the Sydney colony. The house stands on Smith's former Wallis Plains (now Maitland) farm, Hazlewood, close to two other important Smith buildings: Smith's Flour Mill and Caroline Chisholm Cottage (formerly Smith's Row), both listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. Englefield was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 April 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Englefield is of state heritage significance as one of the earliest surviving buildings (with original kitchen/scullery) of the early days of NSW settlement, demonstrating (within the building) the upward mobility of early settlers and especially emancipated convicts (starting with its earlier kitchen, then the construction of a finer house and later additions). It also demonstrates the changing fortunes of early settlers, especially during the 1840s recession and the house's later conversion to an inn, capitalising on the increasing trade along the Newcastle-Maitland road. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Englefield is locally significant for its associations with John Smith (an emancipated convict and early entrepreneur operating between the Newcastle-Maitland area and Sydney), Governors Lachlan Macquarie and Sir Richard Bourke, architect John W. Pender. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Englefield is of state heritage significance as an exceptional late Colonial period Georgian house/inn characterised by window and door proportions and detail, and slender Doric verandah columns. It is locally significant as a key townscape element on the bend of the New England Highway. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Englefield is locally significant for its strong association with the development of settlement in the Newcastle-Maitland area and the rise to prominence of Maitland (formerly Wallis Plains) when the Hunter was a key supplier of food, timber and goods to the Sydney colony. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Englefield is of state heritage significance for its ability to demonstrate the way of life of early settlers, the way they cooked, slept and entertained. Architecturally it shows materials, colour schemes (from original scrapings), detailing of joinery, and developments in these over time. I In its current condition, Englefield further demonstrates the philosophy and techniques typical of heritage conservation projects of the late 1980s, when this project was conceived. At that time, reconstruction, as defined in Article 1 of the then-current version of the Burra Charter,Revised, 1981 was a more widely favoured practice than it has subsequently become. The work carried out at Englefield exemplifies the principles expressed in Articles 17, 18 and 19 respecting reconstruction. Later revisions of the Burra Charter incorporated caveats advocating a minimalist approach. Locally significant attributes include: its skewed placement to the road signifies the changing nature of the original Newcastle-Maitland road, old coins, bottles, clay pipes, farm implements, ironwork and crockery frequently found in the garden and the original 1843 indentures signed by both John and Mary Smith and transferring the property to Adams which demonstrate the way land boundaries and ownership were defined and the way land was transferred at that time. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Englefield is of state heritage significance as a rare surviving example of a late colonial house/inn, built in the style of an Irish farmhouse and with many original features, including original kitchen and ovens. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It is representative of the architecture and building styles of the 1830s. It is also representative of the philosophy and techniques of heritage conservation in the late 1980s when the current reconstruction was conceived and of the numerous places restored to \\"house-museum\\" standard at that time.

It was built from 1831 to 1835 by John Smith. It is also known as Smith's Row, the Maitland Benevolent Asylum, the East Maitland Immigrants' Home and the Caroline Chisholm Barracks. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  East Maitland was planned in 1828 by the Surveyor George Bayal White. Originally named Maitland, the town was to be a centre that could provide marketing services and legal order for the growing population of the area. The cottage was constructed by John Smith between 1831 and 1835 as part of five cottage terraces which were rented to working-class people. In March 1842, the first two cottages, now being the only remaining structure of the terrace, were rented by Caroline Chisholm as the East Maitland Immigrant's Home, and used as a hostel for homeless immigrants who travelled to the Hunter region in search of work. Caroline Chisholm was born in 1808 near Northampton, England. She was reared in the tradition of Evangelical philanthropy and at 22 married Captain Archibald Chisholm on the condition that her philanthropic work should continue. The Chisholms arrived in Australia in 1838 and she dedicated herself to assisting immigrants, unemployed and the homeless. In November 1842 the building was converted into the first hospital in the district, known as the Maitland Benevolent Asylum. By October of the following year the demands made upon the building became too great and the service was moved to a new location. The Immigrants' Home continued to function at 1 Smith Street (now Mill Street) for at least ten years. In 1985 the owner of the cottage, announced it intended to move the cottage and place it in a historic park on the outskirts of East Maitland. The local community made representations to the Heritage Council. Following discussions with Maitland Council and the owner of the building, the Heritage Council recommended a Permanent Conservation order be placed over the building. A Permanent Conservation was gazetted in 27 March 1987. On 2 April 1999 the building was transferred onto the State Heritage Register. It had been in poor condition when assessed in 1985, but was restored by a new owner in the mid-1990s.  Description  Interior A single storey residence built of sandstone walls, timber floors and roof frames with a timber shingle roof that has been covered with corrugated iron. Consists of four front rooms, facing Mill Street on the west side, a room formerly used as a kitchen on the north east corner of the building and a new kitchen to the south of the old, in the middle of the eastern side and a bathroom on the south east corner. There are no passageways and rooms are connected to one another by simple doorways. There are two entrances into the building, located on the north and south end of the timber and corrugated iron verandah on the west side. A large double hung door is also located in the centre of the eastern elevation of the building which opens onto the garden area. It is a very simple, humble cottage with a minimum of decoration. Only the joinery of two of three fireplaces and some of the architraves provide any evidence of style. The windows, which are a very simple colonial style, and the stark nature of the rest of the fabric indicate that the building was built for a minimum cost for the use of low income earners.Stafford, 1985, 22 = Modifications and dates = * 1831-35 - Construction of terrace of five cottage terraces, rented to working-class people. * March 1842 - The first two cottages, now being the only remaining structure of the terrace, rented by Caroline Chisholm as the East Maitland Immigrant's Home, and used as a hostel for homeless immigrants who travelled to the Hunter region in search of work.

Life  H.M.S. Challenger in 1874 Capato hailed from a naval family on Cephalonia, which had been a British protectorate since 1815. Both his grandfather and his father participated in several military campaigns of the British Royal Navy. He left his home \\"while still a boy\\" and joined the British Navy at some point. He arrived in the Egyptian port town of Suez in 1870. Two years later he joined the crew of John Murray's Challenger expedition, a pioneering scientific mission in oceanography that went on until 1876. In 1882 he followed a British Nile exploration mission as a small merchant. Navy canteen in Suakin, 1884 In 1883, Capato arrived in the Sudanese port town of Suakin at the Red Sea as an agent of the Alexandria-based merchant house John Ross & Co. In 1884, while the indigenous Mahdist rebellion escalated in most of Sudan, he started supplying provisions to the British Army and Navy. After the fall of Khartoum in 1885 to the Mahdist forces, Suakin remained under British control and became an all the more strategically important outpost. In 1886, the partnership with Ross ended and Capato started his own enterprise. According to Antonis Chaldeos, who has written his PhD thesis about the history of the Greeks in Sudan, Capato in the same year obtained British citizenship. He became the main caterer of the Anglo-Egyptian forces, especially in fresh meat, set up a network of canteens, run by Greeks, and an ice factory. The business offered huge profits, but Capato also suffered heavy losses at times, especially due to animal diseases. At one point, he also recruited some 3.000 contract workers from Yemen for the British authorities in order to fortify Suakin: > \\"Capato parlayed supplying cattle into supplying men.\\" When an Anglo-Egyptian army under Herbert Kitchener started the reconquest of Sudan in 1896, Capato and other Greek merchants followed the invading forces from Wadi Halfa and again specialised in catering to the troops and officers. Once more, profit margins for supplying \\"highly-priced imports\\" were huge – as were the risks: after the defeat of the Mahdist regime in 1898 and the withdrawal of most of the foreign soldiers, Capato was left \\"with large stores of 'luxury products' that proved impossible to sell to Egyptian and Sudanese subalterns.\\" While the Sudanese merchant class struggled to recover from the shock of the defeat, the establishment of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium in 1899 opened vast business opportunities to foreign traders, mainly Greeks like Capato, Lebanese, and Syrians. Capato was especially well-positioned: he apparently not only spoke English and Arabic, but also nine local dialects. And according to Chaldeos, > \\"he was the closest partner of the government and General Commander itself.\\" Capato's nephew Contomichalos Thus, Capato quickly expanded his business activities beyond providing supplies to the colonial regime. In Khartoum, he became one of the \\"pioneers of construction.\\" He got engaged in the trade with ivory from what was then Southern Sudan and Gum arabic from Kordofan. For this, he set up a network of trading posts across the country with Greek agents, who bought ivory and gum while also catering to colonial officials. One of the boats owned by Capato and used for transporting goods on the White Nile was named after his home-island Cephalonia. Soon his business activities expanded into the Congo Free State as well, where he also set up a network of Greek agents - thereby contributing to the creation of a Greek community in Congo which still exists today. Likewise it may be argued that he was one of the founding father's of the Greek community in South Sudan. At the same time, Capato owned hotels, started a publishing company for postcards (see header photo), and ran a service for fitting out Big-game hunting parties. In addition, \\"he acquired large estates in the Gezira and around Khartoum\\" for cotton cultivation. According to Chaldeos, he leased some 6,000 hectares, which yielded 100,000 pounds of cotton in 1907. For his manyfold business activities, Capato recruited large numbers of Greeks, preferably family members like his nephew Gerasimos Contomichalos, who went on to succeed his uncle as the most eminent merchant magnate for almost half a century: > \\"This recruitment profile ensured the employment of trustworthy men to fill > important positions such as managers of store-houses or branches of the > firm. These young men usually stayed with the firm for a few years in order > to gain a working knowledge of Arabic, familiarise themselves with the new > environment and learn their jobs from the inside. Having completed their > 'apprenticeship,' many decided to try their luck on their own by setting up > a small canteen in a different part of the country.\\" As the number of Greeks in Sudan grew rapidly, Capato played a key role in establishing the Hellenic Community of Khartoum in 1902. He became its first deputy chairman and a few years later its president as well. Also in 1902, he was one of the founding members of the Omdurman Chamber of commerce and – in 1908 – of the Greek Chamber of Commerce of Khartoum. In 1907, another relative of Capato's – Paraskevas Capatos – became the founding chairman of the Hellenic Community of Port Sudan. Also in 1907, when the British strategists worried that an insurgency in Egypt could spread to Sudan, Capato founded upon the request by Governor-general Reginald Wingate the Greek Rifle Club, > \\"which could serve as the venue for covert military exercises. Whatever the > nature of this episode, it says something about how Capato – and probably > many other Greeks – saw themselves as stalwarts of the 'colonial' order.\\" At the height of Capato's wealth and power – in 1906 – the British archaeologist Reginald Campbell Thompson met Sudan's \\"Napoleon of finance\\" in Suakin and noted: > \\"so great was his name that one was inclined to think of Pope Gregory, Non > Anglo Sudan, Sed Angelo.\\" In the same year, however, Capato's fortunes started turning in the fashion of an Ancient-Greek tragedy: > \\"A string of bad luck began when a storm sank a large number of his boats > (some sailing northwards carrying gum, others going south with salt and > general merchandise) between Shellal and Wadi Halfa. Nothing was insured and > the combined loss totalled £46,200.

In the following years those misfortunes continued, while his Creditors grew ever more nervous about their dues. By 1912 the debt burden had grown so huge that Capato had to declare bankruptcy. Two years later, with support from his nephew Contomichalos, Capato made a comeback by starting a small canteen. In 1926, Capato received the Order of the British Empire. When his small business collapsed as well two years later, Capato moved to Alexandria, since there was a considerable community of Greeks in Egypt at the time. The US-dramatist Robert Hobart Davis interviewed him there in his eightieth year and found him > \\"with both legs broken, [..] writing his memoirs and contemplating his > dramatic past.\\" Little has been published about Capato's private life, except that he was \\"the father of a large family.\\" In his final years, he lived in 19 Rue Champollion of Alexandria with a monthly allowance of £55 from Contomichalos, who pledged to pay this sum until Capato's financial situation improved. Shortly before his death in 1937, Capato commented though laconically: > \\"better days never came.\\"  Legacy  The Hellenic Athletics Club in Khartoum (2018) The club premises (2018) The Greek Rifle Club, which Capato founded, continues to exist one century later as one of the most prominent places of Greek presence in Sudan in the form of the Hellenic Athletics Club (H.A.C.), since the Greek Rifle Club merged with the Hellenic Gymnastics Club in 1913. H.A.C. is especially popular with expatriates for its swimming pool. The Hellenic Community of Khartoum, which Capato co-founded, continues to exist as well, though its membership numbers dropped to about 150 in the mid-2010s – about the same level as at its creation in 1902. For Sudan academia, Capato's life-story is especially interesting, since he wrote – or dictated – his memoirs a few years before his death. The unpublished manuscript in English language was given by Edwin Geoffrey Sarsfield-Hall, who entered the colonial Sudan Political Service in 1909 and retired in 1936 as Governor of Khartoum, to the Sudan Archive of Durham University. The Greek anthropologist Gerasimos Makris, who is related to the Greeks of Sudan through marriage, and the Norwegian historian Endre Stiansen conclude: > \\"Capato's career demonstrates how a Greek trader (carrying a British > passport) of no private means exploited economic opportunities to build his > own business and become a pillar of the society. Moreover, his life history > provides an interesting perspective both on social and economic changes in > the Sudan during the first part of the Condominium period, as well as the > formation of a strong foreign community.\\" The Kontomichaleios High School and Lyceum in Khartoum (2015), named after Capato's nephew And: > \\"Capato belonged to the 'high class' of Greek settlers, but after the > collapse of his business ventures he did not have the means to play a > leading role in the society.

It was designed by Woodhouse Danks and built from 1839 to 1841. It is also known as Canterbury Sugar Works, Former Hutton Premises, Australian Sugar Company Mill, Canterbury Sugar House, ASC Sugar Mill Buildings and Australasian Sugar Company. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  = Aboriginal history = = Colonial history = European exploration of the Cooks River commenced with the colonisation of Sydney in 1788, when \\"officers of the First Fleet of 1788 negotiated the Cooks River as far as the districts of present-day Canterbury and Campsie. The officers noted the low and marshy aspect of the countryside and observed Aborigines fishing on the river\\"Howard & Lumby, 2003, p. 1. The earliest European settlement in the area took place when the Rev. Richard Johnson was granted , known as \\"Canterbury Vale\\" on 28 May 1793. Canterbury Vale was consolidated by a grant of on 15 September 1796 and a further grant of 260 cares on 5 October 1799. This was known as Sheep Pasture Plains. Johnson applied for leave to return to England for health reasons in 1798 and before his departure in October 1800 sold the farm to Lieutenant William Cox. Cox was a lieutenant in the new South Wales Corps but in 1803 was suspended from office due to overstraining his credit. Cox had purchased additional properties surrounding Canterbury Vale. In 1803 Robert Campbell procured of Cox's land consolidating a grant of land which he already held. Campbell was known as the \\"father of the mercantile community\\" in the colony of New South Wales. The main purpose of the purchase at Canterbury seems to have been for the accommodation of the overflow of imported cattle rejected by the government which he apparently purchased. During the latter part of the 1830s the colony was enjoying an economic boom with much English capital flowing into the country. A London-based company promoter, Francis Kemble, who had some previous experience in the sugar industry, persuaded William Knox Child, Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Kent and also inspector and director of the London and County Joint stock Bank to provide the capital for the establishment of a sugar works in Australia. In 1839 the Australian Sugar Company (ASC) was formed in London, purchase made of machinery and equipment after the sale of Child's assets, and on 11 March 1840 the directors of ASC and their families and forty operatives departed for Sydney, arriving on 12 July 1840. Because of the need for plentiful water and fuel supplies to expedite the manufacturer of sugar, a site on the Cooks River was chosen on part of Robert Campbell's Canterbury estate. As well, a dam had been erected near the site to prevent salt water reaching the upper portion of the stream - town supply was limited and this was the nearest available location close to Sydney. Some were chosen with a value of A£1,200 and the transaction was carried out by the exchange of A£50 shares in the company. Work commenced on erecting the main building beside the Cooks River. Scottish stonemasons quarried sandstone on the site, to erect the building. Ironbark was obtained from across the river. By September 1841 the Mill was sufficiently complete to warrant a detailed description in The Australian. As a result of disputes between Kemble and Childs, a slump in trade caused the dissolution of the company and the subsequent formation of the Australasian Sugar Company. Before the Mill began production, sugar was imported into Sydney from Java, Mauritius and the Philippines. The raw material to the Mill was imported from the Philippines. Apart from the cane which arrived in Sydney with the First Fleet, pioneering efforts production of cane was undertaken by T. A. Scott who settled in Australia in 1819 and spent several years growing sugar cane at Port Macquarie. In 1829 he went to Point Clare where he had received a grant of land, and continued to grow cane on a very small scale. It was not until the late 1860s that commercially viable crops were grown in the northern part of new South Wales. It was in the 1860s that cultivation of cane became viable in Queensland. Because of these circumstances the Mill at Canterbury processed imported material. The Sugar Company and Robert Campbell subdivided their land in 1841 and auctioned it. The nucleus of the Village of Canterbury thus formed on this land subdivided in 1841. The reason for the subdivision was to accommodate Mill workers and secondly to raise finances for the operation of the Mill. From 1843 to 1846 the Australasian Sugar Company was managed by Edward Knox, a close friend of Campbell. After 1846 he remained a director of the Company until 1854 when disagreements amongst the shareholders caused the dissolution of the concern. On 1 January 1855 the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was formed with Knox as manager and one of the directors. A decision was made to close the works and transfer them to a property in George Street West later that year. The Mill remained vacant and unused for many years. In 1880 the Sugar Mill was purchased by Frederick Clissold, who in turn sold it to Blacket and Co., Engineer in 1884. Blacket and Co. hoped to benefit from being located next to the promised suburban railway line. However the line was slow to arrive and the company was bankrupted before the line was built.Kass and Walker 1988 = Twentieth-century history = It was used as a butter factory by Foley Bros and from 1900 until 1908 by Denham Bros as the Canterbury Bacon Factory. Towards the end of this time the tall chimney, once such a prominent and unique feature of the Sugar Mill was demolished. In 1980 the former Sugar Mill was purchased by the firm J. C. Hutton and Co. The firm used the sugar works for the manufacture of smallgoods. In 1950 the killing licence expired. In 1983 Hutton sold the property to its present owner, Nick Scali and Co.

Heritage listing  As at 27 March 2007, the Old Sugarmill at Canterbury was of State significance for its involvement in the development of the sugar industry and CSR in Australia, and for its role in the industrial development of the locality of Canterbury - both in its original use as a sugar mill and for its later uses as a foundry, a butter factory and in the manufacture of processed foods. A five-storey sandstone building erected beside the Cooks River in 1841, it is believed to be the oldest surviving industrial building in the Sydney region. Statewide it is a rare example of a pre-1850s industrial building which has retained much of its external form. It is also of State aesthetic significance for its landmark appearance on the river and its symmetrical Georgian styling. It has scientific significance for the site's archaeological potential to reveal information about early industry in New South Wales. Although the Old Sugarmill was a ruin for many years and was further damaged by fire in 1996, it has been recently restored and adapted into a new use as an apartment block within a new residential complex. Old Sugarmill was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Old Sugarmill at Canterbury is of State historic significance because of its associations with the development of the sugar industry in Australia, especially with the nationally important company of CSR, and because of its important role in the development of the locality of Canterbury, both in its original use and because of its other uses as a foundry, butter factory and then processed food. It has additional historical significance as the oldest building in Canterbury and its role in the early subdivision and settlement in the locality.Howard 53:1995 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Old Sugarmill at Canterbury is of State aesthetic significance as a five-storey sandstone building with symmetrical Georgian styling in a landmark setting beside the Cooks River. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It has scientific significance because the site demonstrates great archaeological potential to reveal information about early occupation and industry in New South Wales and in this locality. Intact equipment and purpose-designed structures from the occupation of J.C. Hutton and Co - demonstrate past techniques relating to food processing and its associated technology.Howard 54:1995 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Sakamaki Hall, where the History department at the University of Hawaii is housed, was built after his death and named in his honor.  Early life and education  Sakamaki was born on July 15, 1906 in Keeau to Juzaburo and Haru Sakamaki. During the sugar strikes in the 1920s their home was dynamited after Juzaburo, an interpreter, sided with the Olaa Sugar Plantation managers. Sakamaki was raised as a Christian, which was unusual given that most other Japanese Americans in Hawaii at the time had maintained their Buddhist or Shintoist beliefs. He graduated from Hilo High School in 1923 and went on to study at the University of Hawaii. In 1927 his debate team won against Oxford University's team. Sakamaki also performed in plays, worked at the school newspaper, competed in speech contests, and was the president of the Japanese Students' Association. After graduating from the University of Hawaii Sakamaki received the Friend of Peace scholarship and studied at Doshisha University from 1928 to 1930. While there he also taught English to Doshisha students as a \\"student professor\\". He returned to Hawaii in 1931 and taught at the Mid-Pacific Institute.  University of Hawaii  A few years after teaching at MidPac, he was hired at the University of Hawaii to teach Tasuku Harada's classes when he retired. In 1939 he earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University. During World War II he was the chairman of the Board of Directors for the Oahu Citizens Committee for Home Defense. He worked to make it easier for dual citizens to renounce their Japanese citizenship so that they could serve in the military. Sakamaki was an intermediary between the FBI and the Japanese community. While he believed that most local Japanese were loyal to the United States, he suggested the internment of Shinto priests because of the role of the Emperor in Shintoism. In 1950 the Honolulu Record pointed out that Sakamaki, despite numerous years of service, had not been granted tenure. Newspaper editor Koji Ariyoshi suspected that it was because Sakamaki was Japanese. In 1953 Sakamaki was promoted to a full professor, and was the first Asian American to have that position at the University. He served as the Dean of summer sessions from 1955 onward. During his tenure as Dean the number of classes offered over the summer increased from 160 to 1,100 and the number of students enrolled increased from 7,800 in 1960 to 20,600 by 1968. While teaching at the University he expanded Japan and Asian Studies-related courses. Much of his research was on Ryukyuan culture. In the 1960s he bought a collection of books from the estate of Frank Hawley, a British linguist, which was then added to Sakamaki's own collection. He gave the entire collection to Hamilton Library when he retired in 1971 after being diagnosed with throat cancer.  Legacy  Sakamaki Hall Sakamaki died in 1973.

It is a heritage-listed former convent and now private residence at 9 Fore Street, Canterbury in the City of Canterbury- Bankstown local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by Varney Parkes and built during 1896. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Bethungra was constructed for the Quigg family by Varney Parkes, the son of Sir Henry Parkes. Varney Parkes was a Liverpool Council Alderman, State Parliamentarian (1885 - 1913), MLA for Canterbury 1895-1900 and 1907-1913, Postmaster-General (1889 -1899) and successful architect. He trained under the Colonial Architect, James Barnet between 1878 and 1880. He established a successful architectural practice with C. H. E. Blackmann and was responsible for the design of a wide range of buildings over much of urban and rural New South Wales, including hotels, warehouses, banks, commercial premises and domestic residences. One of his best known designs was the \\"Marble Bar\\" for George Adams's hotel in Pitt Street, begun in 1891 (now re-erected within the redeveloped Hilton Hotel on George Street). Parkes was known for his use of pattern books in the design of his buildings, and the houses he designed in Canterbury for the Quigg and Nicholas families demonstrate his enthusiasm to adopt architectural ideas from overseas for his work in New South Wales. Houses in Fore Street designed by Parkes around the turn of the 19th century, particularly Wyuna at no.10, are characteristic of the transition between the late Victorian Italianate style and the Federation Queen Anne style of domestic architecture. Although these have render decoration characteristic of the Italianate style, the \\"tower\\" with conical roof at the end of the veranda of \\"Wyuna\\" is typical of the later Federation style, and the house is an important landmark in the transition from one domestic style to another. Iserbrook, the house that Parkes designed for himself and lived in until 1925, was unfortunately demolished in the 1960s, and replaced by featureless red brick home units. The Estates surrounding the house, large sections of the Bridgewater Estate, were owned and subdivided by Alderman John Quigg, the Mayor of Canterbury (1891), and his son-in-law Frederick Augustus Nicholas. They engaged Varney Parkes to build several other houses on their land, and Parkes remained a family friend and their preferred architect. Another relative by marriage, Jeffrey Denniss, also lived in Fore Street, ran a successful tannery at the eastern junction of Cup and Saucer Creek with Cooks River, and became Mayor of Canterbury from 1900 to 1903. His friend, Frederick Augustus Nicholas, with his sons started a furniture manufacturing business in Canterbury just after World War I. This was a time of great expansion in the area, 10,000 houses were built in the Municipality between 1919 and 1929, and all of them needed furniture. The family prospered, eventually moving up the hill to land beside John Quigg's house, Austral Eden (now demolished). Fredederick Augustus Nicholas subdivided part of his land, creating a new street, Nicholas Avenue. In 1924, the family went on an overseas tour, and Frederick's wife, Elizabeth Amy Nicholas (formerly Quigg), became particularly impressed with the California Bungalow style of house. She brought back plans for a large residence in this style, and their friend, Varney Parkes, was entrusted with supervising the construction of a new family home in Nicholas Avenue (no.15). Some time between 1922 and 1931 three other houses were built for the Nicholas sons, probably under the supervision of Parkes, on the land at the southern end of Nicholas Avenue. John Augustus Nicholas married Annie Batting in 1922, and lived in no.18, and Vivian Price Nicholas married Beatrice Mackie in 1925, and lived in no.16. Adrian Howard Nicholas married Una D. Wiseman in 1927, and no.11 was built for him some time between 1927 and 1931. In 1901 Bethungra was sold to Mary McKillop (since canonised), the founder of the Sisters of St. Joseph, and was used as a convent for nuns of the Order who were attached to St. Anthony's Catholic Church. In 1980 the Heritage Council received a request for an Interim Heritage Order from the local historical society as Bethungra had been purchased and a development application submitted for its demolition and construction of a two-story block of six home unties. An Interim heritage Order was placed over the property on 16 July 1980. Following further consideration the Heritage Council placed a Permanent Conservation Order over the property on 23 July 1982. It was transferred to the State Heritage register on 2 April 1999.  Description  House and garden Bethungra is constructed of local sandstone quarried from what is now the cliff face above Karool Avenue, Canterbury. The house is a single-storey asymmetrical-form late Victorian style 3-4 bedroom residence. Its construction features rough dressed irregular and tuck-pointed masonry, with rusticated quoins and window dressings. Varney Parkes designed Bethungra. Parkes was known for his use of pattern books in the design of his buildings, and the houses he designed in Canterbury for the Quigg and Nicholas families demonstrate his enthusiasm to adopt architectural ideas from overseas for his work in NSW. Houses in Fore Street designed by Parkes around the turn of the 19th century, particularly Wyuna at no.10, are characteristic of the transition between the late Victorian Italianate style and the Federation Queen Anne style of domestic architecture.

Constructed , Bethungra is associated with Saint Mary McKillop, the founder of the Sisters of St. Joseph. It was also used as a convent for nuns of the Order who were attached to St. Anthony's Catholic Church. Bethungra was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

This high-level event was an opportunity to explore contemporary air domain challenges faced by African Air Forces and discuss the conference's central theme, Building Air Partnerships Across Africa. The Conference was attended by forty-one participants and sixty-one observers representing twenty-four African countries. The conference aimed to provide African Air Chiefs and other senior-level military leaders with an opportunity to build rapport and discuss their shared air safety and security challenges. Throughout the conference, attendees contributed a diversity of perspectives and exchanged ideas aimed at enhancing Africa's ability to manage its air domain. _Dakar, Senegal, August 2012_ : The United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) and the Senegalese Air Force, with support from the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, hosted the North/West African Regional Air Chief's Conference with the theme \\"Beyond partnerships: Building Operational Frameworks for Cooperation\\".

History  The club was formed in 1927 as the Flinders Park Methodist Church Football Club when a meeting was held on 15 March 1927. The team played in the United Church Football Association in the B Division and wore a brown and blue guernsey, capping off their first season in history with a premiership win. The club remained in the United Church Association for six seasons until 1933 when the club applied to join the South Australian Amateur Football League. They played for one season in the SAAFL but were evicted from the league due to poor spectator behaviour and were moved to the Adelaide & Suburban Football League, where the Reds remained until 1946 That year the club won a second senior grade premiership. In 1947, Flinders Park shifted leagues again, this time to the West Torrens District Football Association where they won another premiership that same year and the following year, in 1948, saw some more premiership success. The club moved back to the SAAFL in 1949 and over three decades, the Reds achieved a lot of success and the 1970s saw the club win back to back A-Grade premierships in 1976 and 1977. The 1978 season saw the club moving to the newly-formed South Australian Football Association (SAFA) which was then the second tier of Australian rules football in South Australia. Flinders Park competed in the SAFA for a number of years and won another A-Grade premiership that same year, in 1978, and won a back to back premiership in 1979. A third premiership was won in 1981 and a fourth in 1983. The SAFA disbanded after the 1995 season which saw Flinders Park and most of its other member clubs transfer to the SAAFL. Upon transferring, the Division 4 side won the premiership in 1996. In 2020 Flinders Park has senior A and B grade football teams competing in Division 3 and 3 Reserves of the Adelaide Footy League, C grade at C3 level, and a Senior Colts team competing in the Under 18.5 Red division as well as senior women's football in Division 4. Junior football is offered at all levels of SANFL Juniors for boys as well as two girls teams at under 12 and under 16 level, and the club has one of the strongest junior administrations in metropolitan Adelaide. Also part of the club are the Flinders Park Cricket Club competing in 2018/19 in the Adelaide Turf Cricket Association's A2, B2 and LO1 levels with juniors in the Western Suburbs Junior Cricket Association. In 2015 Flinders Park established netball teams that compete in the South Australian United Church Netball Association right across the grades, and has expanded at a rapid rate from the inaugural two winter teams in 2015 to some seven senior teams for summer 2018/19 and six during winter 2019.

It crosses the Cooks River to Thornley Street, Marrickville. It was designed by Sewerage Construction Branch and NSW Department of Public Works and built during 1895 by J. F. Carson, contractor. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  The Cooks River sewage aqueduct was completed in 1895. The aqueduct was constructed as the Main Western Carrier, later part of the Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer System (SWSOOS). The aqueduct was designed and built by the Sewerage Branch of the NSW Public Works Department,Contract No. 64 the design work being completed by 1893. The engineer-in-chief of this department at the time was Robert Hickson, who was also a Water Board member. The Main Western Carrier was designed to serve the western suburbs of Sydney. The line extended from the Rockdale end of the Arncliffe sewerage farm (which was enlarged for the scheme) to the sewer penstock at Premier Street, Marrickville. The contract necessitated the construction of aqueducts over the Cooks River, Wolli Creek and at Arncliffe between Rocky Point Road (Princess Highway) and Illawarra Road (Arncliffe Street) and extensive tunnelling. The work was undertaken in two contracts relating to the different construction types. The contract for the aqueducts was let to J. F. Carson. The original design of the aqueduct provided for a triplicate diameter wrought iron sewer carrier (although only two pipes were initially laid) supported on of segmental 17 brick arches of approximately span, two by steel lattice girder bridge spans, and of a series of mass concrete arches within embankment. The total length of the aqueduct is approximately . The bridge spans are of mild steel riveted construction, the sewer carrier pipes being carried on cross beams on two simple lattice girders (on trusses), with a series of small cross lattice girders for wind bracing. The bridge spans are supported on two metal circular piers. The piers of the brick arches are constructed from mass concrete, faced in decorative brick and seated on mass concrete foundations founded on a raft of timber piles. The arches are a combination of brick and sandstone and mass concrete construction. The two original sewer carrier pipes were fabricated from wrought iron and riveted. Expansion joints of sections were installed at the junction of the brick arches and the steel lattice bridge and above the ninth arch south of the bridge. The third (western) sewer pipe of welded mild steel was laid in 1929. The original pipes have been maintained over the years to the present, with selective replacement of defective sections. The Cooks River is one of six sewage aqueducts in Sydney completed in the period 1895–1901. Others include the reinforced concrete Monier arches at Whites Creek and Johnstons Creek (1897), the mass concrete/brick arches and iron pipe at Wolli Creek (1895), the Mosman Bay steel arch (1901), and the stone/concrete and steel pipe at Lewisham (1900).  Description  Brick arches over pedestrian path, Earlwood The aqueduct comprises the sewer carrier of three diameter wrought iron and steel pipes supported on a series of brick arches, and steel bridges. The brick arches are particularly decorative, being white glazed face bricks laid in English bond with decorative motifs picked out in red coloured brick. The springing points of the arch and cornice are constructed of dressed sandstone. The sewer carrier emerges from the brick faced northern abutment below Thornley Street, Marrickville crossing the river by the steel trusses and then continuing further across the river and Wanstead Reserve by brick arches to embankment at the end of Wanstead Avenue, Undercliffe. The northernmost terrestrial arch is used as a public path. The original contract drawings indicate that the original river crossing entailed only the two steel bridges, today it also requires 2 1/2 spans of the brick arches. The aqueduct is a major built item in the Cooks River valley basin. = Modifications and dates = The barrels were overhauled between 1981 and 1984, and the surface of the cast iron pipes was coated with a modern fibre- glass lining. The steelwork on the two bridge spans has been replaced where necessary. Fencing at either end of the carrier to prevent trespass.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 21 April 2005, the Cooks River Valley sewage aqueduct, completed in 1895, was an integral and highly visible component of the original Main Western Carrier (now part of Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer System), which was one the Board's major early sewerage schemes. The aqueduct being a combination of brick arches and steel bridges is an excellent and rare example of a late-nineteenth steel truss bridge (in non railway construction), and decorative face brick work in NSW. The two original sewer carriers are likely to be rare examples of large diameter, long run wrought iron pipes used for such a purpose. Elements of significance are past and ongoing use, construction technologies and setting with the Cooks River valley (inclusive of views). Cooks River Sewage Aqueduct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Cooks River sewage aqueduct, completed in 1895, is an integral and highly visible component of the Main Western Carrier which subsequently evolved into the Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer System. This sewer was one of the Board's earliest major sewer schemes, and was designed under engineer-in-chief Robert Hickson, a foundation board member of Sydney Water . The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The arches of the aqueduct are excellent examples of decorative face brick (in a basically utilitarian structure), which are unlikely to be built again . The aqueduct is now attractively sited within a public reserve adjacent the Cooks River. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The aqueduct is a major element of the historic built environment of the local government areas of City of Canterbury-Bankstown and Marrickville and provides a focus for an understanding to the contemporary community of the historical development of the local area. It is listed by groups such as the National Truct of Australia (NSW). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The aqueduct is an excellent example of a late-nineteenth steel truss bridge (in non-railway construction). The wrought pipes are likely to be a rare examples of a large diameter, long run of wrought iron pipe fabricated in 1895. The welded steel pipe of 1929 may also be of significance in consideration of the application of this technology at this early date on a pipe of this length. The face brickwork is a textbook example of the trade in a basically utilitarian structure. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare in consideration of its scale, siting and mixed use of materials and construction techniques. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

She was one of the most influential participants in the Swiss women's movement during the 1920s and 1930s.  Life  = Provenance and early years = Annie Reineck was born in Kannawurf, a village in the countryside between Erfurt and Magdeburg in Germany. Erhard Reineck (1841–1932), her father, was a protestant church minister and superintentant (church administrator) originally from Magdeburg. Her mother, born Marie Godet (1847–1936), was from Neuchâtel in francophone western Switzerland. Annie grew up in Kannawurf and then in nearby Heldrungen. She received her early education at the home of her elder sister, Theodora (Theodora Reineck, 1874–1963). Later, between 1895 and 1898, she attended the \\"École Vinet\\", a secondary school in Lausanne. The school was headed up by her aunt, Sophie Godet.Silke Redolfi: Frauen bauen Staat, 100 Jahre Bund Schweizerischer Frauenorganisationen, NZZ-Verlag Zürich, 2000, p. 70, = Student = Reineck enrolled at the University of Bern in 1901 or 1902. She studied Mathematics and various Natural Sciences, notably Physics and Earth Sciences. In 1905 she received a secondary school teaching certificate. There were still very few female students at the university, and several of the members of the small \\"Bern Female Students' Association\\" (\\"Berner Studentinnenverein\\") became, in different ways, pioneering feminists and lifelong friends. For Annie Reineck these included Gertrud Woker (1878 - 1968) and the physician Ida Hoff (1880 - 1952). = Teacher = In 1907 Annie Reineck became the first German-language woman at the University of Bern to receive a doctorate in Mathematics. Her dissertation concerned \\"The relationship between spherical functions and Bessel functions\\" (\\"Die Verwandtschaft zwischen Kugelfunktionen und Besselschen Funktionen\\"). From this point till 1925 she taught at the Girls' Secondary School in Bern (where Ida Hoff was appointed school doctor in 1913) and at the city's training college for women teachers. In 1913 she married the commercial lawyer Georg Leuch (1888 - 1959). He became a cantonal high court judge in 1920 and a Federal Supreme Court Judge in 1925, which involved relocating to Lausanne. By this time Annie Leuch-Reineck's time and energies had become divided between mathematics teaching and political campaigning: she now resigned from her teaching jobs in Bern. = Women's rights = In 1916 or 1918 she took on the leadership of the Bern section of the \\"Swiss Association for Women's Voting Rights\\" (\\"Schweizerischer Verband für Frauenstimmrecht\\"). In 1919 or 1921 she was a co-founder of the \\"Bernese Women's League\\" (\\"Berner Frauenbund\\"). Between 1920 and 1933 she campaigned for the rights of Swiss women o retain their Swiss citizenship rights if they married a foreigner. She was a member of various legal commissions established by the League of Swiss Women's Associations (\\"Bund Schweizerischer Frauenvereine\\"). In 1921 she co-organised the \\"Second Swiss Congress for Women's Interests\\" (\\"2. Schweizer Kongresses für Fraueninteressen\\"), held that year in Bern. In 1928 she was appointed to the national presidency of the \\"Swiss Association for Women's Voting Rights\\" (\\"Schweizerischer Verband für Frauenstimmrecht\\"), a post she retained till 1940. She was also, from 1928, one of those working on the 1929 \\"Swiss Exhibition for Women's Work\\" (\\"Schweizer Ausstellung für Frauenarbeit\\" / SAFFA). In 1929 she led that year's petition demanding for women the right to vote. She was a member of the national executive (\\"Vorstand\\") of the \\"Swiss Social Policy Union\\" (\\"Schweizer Vereinigung für Sozialpolitik\\") and a member of the commission set up by the Weltbund für Frauenstimmrecht (\\"International Alliance of Women\\") to enquire into the citizenship rights of wives.  Family  Annie Leuch-Reineck was a grand daughter of the reformist theologian Frédéric Louis Godet (1812–1900) from Neuchâtel. Her sister, Eva Reineck, was a professional violinist who built her career in Frankfurt am Main and married a graphic artist of Jewish provenance called David Spear. Annie Leuch-Reineck was thereby an aunt to this couple's son, Walter Eric Spear, a notable physicist who built his career in England and Scotland after the family managed to escape from Nazi Germany in 1938.

There are daily challenges the player can complete, which will give them options to customize their vehicle. There are three cups to choose from: Lasagna, Pizza, and Hamburger. There is also the hidden Ice Cream Cup, which is unlocked by completing all the other cups on 150cc difficulty. Each cup contains 4 maps, for 16 in total. There are also three difficulties to choose from: 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc. The Lasagna Cup is always free, and the Pizza Cup is free for 50cc, but for the 100cc and 150cc the player has to unlock the cups, or can pay to try them using in-game coins.  Reception  Garfield Kart was met with mostly negative reception from critics due to what they called unimaginative gameplay, low production value, and poorly designed mechanics. However, the game was met with very positive reception in user reviews on Steam and other platforms, most likely due to the game becoming an internet meme. In its review, Nintendo Life gave Garfield Kart a score of 3/10 while describing it as \\"a bland, horribly un-balanced Kart game\\". Hardcore Gamer gave Garfield Kart a rating of 1.5, criticizing the game as \\"absolutely dreadful\\".

The Wolli Creek Aqueduct crosses Wolli Creek to Thompson Street, Turella. It was designed by Public Works Department and built in 1895 by the NSW Public Works Department. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  The Wolli Creek sewage aqueduct was completed in 1895. The aqueduct was constructed for the Western Main Sewer, later known as the Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer and Southern and Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer No. 1 (SWSOOS). The aqueduct was designed and built by the Sewerage Branch of the Public Works Department (Contract No. 64). The design work was completed by late 1890. The engineer- in-chief of this department at the time was Robert Hickson. The Western Suburbs Ocean Outfall Sewer was designed to serve the western suburbs of Sydney. The line extended from the Rockdale end of the Arncliffe sewerage farm (enlarged for the scheme) to the sewer penstock at Premier Street, Marrickville. The contract necessitated the construction of aqueducts over the Cooks River, Wolli Creek and at Arncliffe between Rocky Point Road (Princess Highway) and Illawarra Road (Arncliffe Street) and extensive tunnelling. The work was undertaken in two contracts relating to the different construction types. The contract for the aqueducts was let to J. F. Carson. The design details of the aqueduct are the same for that of the aqueduct at Cooks River, except for the amendment to include a subway for pedestrians at the southern terminus of the arches at Arncliffe Road (now Turrella Street). Also constructed here was brick semi-circular abutment to the embankment. The original design of the aqueduct provided for a triplicate diameter wrought iron sewer (although only two pipes were initially laid), carried on of segmental 17 brick arches of approximately span, two by steel lattice girder bridge spans, and of a series of mass concrete arches within embankment. The total length of the aqueduct is approximately . The bridge spans are of mild steel riveted construction, the sewer carrier pipes being carried on cross beams on two simple lattice girders (on trusses), with a series of small cross lattice girders for wind bracing. The bridge spans are supported on two metal circular piers. The piers of the brick arches are constructed from mass concrete, faced in decorative brick and dressed sandstone and seated on mass concrete foundations founded on a raft of timber piles.

The Wolli Creek aqueduct is one of six sewage aqueducts in Sydney completed in the period 1895–1901. Others include the reinforced concrete Monier arches at Whites Creek and Johnstons Creek (1897), the mass concrete/brick arches and iron pipe at Cooks River (1895), the Mosman Bay steel arch (1901), and the stone/concrete and steel pipe at Lewisham (1900).  Description  The aqueduct comprises the sewer carrier of three diameter wrought iron and steel pipes supported on a series of brick arches, and steel bridges. The brick arches are particularly decorative, being white glazed face bricks laid in English bond with decorative motifs picked out in a red coloured brick. The springing points of the arch and cornice are in dressed sandstone. Access to this viaduct in general is difficult, and the exact configuration of the structure not easy to determine, but the carrier emerges from a brick northern abutment below Unwin Street, Undercliffe (known as Unwin's Hill) crossing the creek by the steel trusses and then continuing by the brick arches passing under the East Hills railway to arches and embankment at Turrella and Knoll Streets, Turrella. The aqueduct is a large and impressive built structure situated across the expanse of the Wolli Creek valley. = Modifications and dates = The barrels were overhauled between 1981 and 1984, and the surface of the cast iron pipes was coated with a modern fibre-glass lining.

The lodge on Allington Lane is just out of the picture, to the north of the church. Fair Oak Lodge is a former country house in the village of Fair Oak, Hampshire. Much of the original estate has been built upon with modern housing, but the house itself survives and is owned by the Hampshire Christian Education Trust, who operate the King's School from the building. The two entrance lodges to the property also still survive as do some of the woodland, ponds and specimen trees that formed part of the estate.  History  The land was part of the hunting grounds belonging to the Bishop of Winchester at the time of the Domesday Book. Being equidistant between Netley Abbey and Winchester, some historians have suggested it may have been occupied by a resting place or lodging house for monks travelling between the two locations in the 16th century, although there is no conclusive proof of this. The eastern lodge on Botley Road The 1810 Ordnance Survey map shows a building on the site named \\"New House\\", which was renamed Fair Oak Lodge by 1819. A further map in 1826 shows the house within a landscaped park, including carriage drives leading east and west from the house to Botley Road and Allington Lane respectively. John Twynham occupied the house in 1842 and had the building extended. A number of alterations to the grounds also followed, and the property was shown on Ordnance Survey maps in the early 1870s as Oak Lodge. A conservatory had been added to the southern side of the house by 1870, followed by an aviary on the eastern side by 1896. By the 1870s the garden was planted with a mixture of specimen trees and conifers, with an open terrace to the rear of the house which may have been used for lawn sports such as tennis or bowls. An avenue led southwards from the house to two lakes, named the Quobleigh Ponds, the water levels in each being controlled by separate sluices. Within the parkland were eight fenced areas containing two or three conifers each, and the estate's fields were bounded by trees. Twenty years on many of the trees had been felled and a walled garden created to the west of the house, accompanied by four glasshouses. A turning circle had been added to the driveway in front of the house, and additional buildings around the Quobliegh Ponds: a boathouse on the northern side and a hide to the southeast. The avenue southwards from the house is not shown on maps from this era but some of the trees remained in place. The Gillett family resided in the house in 1891 along with eight staff. In 1900 Mr Gillet's orchids won a silver gilt medal, but he died the same year and the house was put up for sale in 1901, described as a \\"sporting estate with fishing, shooting and golf\\". Sir Arthur Grant of Moneymusk, Mrs Gillet's brother-in-law, purchased the property and appealed for a rates reduction in 1903-4. In 1908 the estate, still owned by Grant, covered , including a lake. In 1924 the estate was owned by a Mr Wolff, who applied for permission to drain some land and make various other alterations. Wolff wrote to The Times in 1939 regarding eight cygnets that were hatching on the lake. Within two years the lakes were silting up considerably, with the Ordnance Survey map of 1941 showing the upper lake as a marshy area traversed by a stream as opposed to an open body of water, and the northeast part of the lower lake undertaking a similar transformation. A sundial was shown where the bird aviary had previously stood; the conservatory on the side of the house had gone, as had three of the four glasshouses. Ownership of the estate changed again, with it being owned by the Morrogh Bernard family by 1954. Lt Colonel Morrogh Bernard attempted to sell the house and of the estate in 1963. His advertisement in The Times read: \\"Main House built in 1842 on site of a much older house parts of which still form part of the present property, the grounds are a part of the Itchen valley and include a lake of 4 acres (1.6 ha) a market garden, pasture and woodland\\". Morrogh Bernard built a new house on the land he retained, retaining the name Fair Oak Lodge for this new building. The original house was converted into a convent by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton. By 1974 the driveway to Botley Road was gone, with the only driveway to the house linking to Allington Lane, and much of the land around the house laid to grass. To the west of the house were several large greenhouses and rows of saplings, together with an area of smaller plants behind the house and outbuildings. St Swithun Wells Roman Catholic Church The Diocese built St Swithun Wells Church next to the lodge on the Allington Lane in the late 1970s and relocated the nuns to alternative accommodation, selling the house and some of the land to a development company called Lakesmere. Lakesmere extended the house and constructed Rockford House, a block of ten flats, within the walled gardens. Lakesmere sold the house and of land to the King's School in 1987. In 2018, Eastleigh Borough Council gave planning permission to Bargate Homes to demolish Morrogh Bernard's Fair Oak Lodge and construct 50 new houses on the site.

She is known in particular for her work on the Medieval and Renaissance use of Classical sources and for her presidency of and advocacy for the Classical Association of New England. Career Coulter was born in 1885 in Ferguson, Missouri and was the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Joseph Hill Coulter. Coulter gained her BA from Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri in 1907 and her PhD from Bryn Mawr College in 1911. From 1909-1910 Coulter spent a year studying at the University of Munich. Coulter's PhD dissertation, Retractatio in the Ambrosian and Palatine Recensions of Plautus: A Study of the Persa, Poenulus, Pseudolus, Stichus and Trinummus, was published as a Bryn Mawr College Monograph in 1911. After her PhD, Coulter became Reader of Latin at Bryn Mawr College. From 1912-1914 she taught Latin and Greek at Saint Agnes School in New York. Coulter became Associate Professor of Latin and Greek at Vassar College in 1916 and moved to Mount Holyoke College in 1926, where she remained till her retirement in 1951. In 1927 Coulter became a member of the American Association of University Professors. At Mount Holyoke College Coulter was a professor of Latin and chairman of the Department from 1935-1948. After her retirement from Mount Holyoke College, Coulter taught for two years at Hiram College from 1951-1953 as a visiting professor for the John Hay Whitney Foundation. Following this Coulter returned to brief periods of teaching at Mount Holyoke College for a semester in 1957 and at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1959. Coulter's work on the reception of classical authors in Medieval and Renaissance scholarship returned repeatedly throughout her career and retirement to the use of classical sources in the work of Boccaccio and this work is still in use today in assessing Boccaccio's sources. Coulter served as President of the Classical Association of New England, the American Philological Association, and the Western Massachusetts Society of the Archaeological Institute of America. Legacy Coulter's work for the Classical Association of New England had particular impact and she was described in 1961 by Prof. Claude W. Barlow as 'in many ways the greatest single benefactress that the Classical Association of New England has ever had'. Coulter had joined the Association in 1927 and became a life member in 1953. She was vice-president in 1942-1943 and President in 1947-1948. Coulter also served as an officer and on a number of committees for the Association during her membership but she had the most impact in fundraising for the Association. Alongside this activity, in 1946 Coulter became the Chair of a special committee for summer scholarships to the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. Coulter was the largest single contributor to the Association's Rome Scholarship Fund, and for a number of years anonymously supplied the full funds for the annual awards. In 1961 the Classical Association of New England renamed the Rome Scholarship the Cornelia Catlin Coulter Rome Scholarship. Coulter was widely regarded as an excellent teacher who devoted her career to supporting the classics, students, and colleagues: The Cornelia Catlin Coulter papers are held in the Mount Holyoke College Archives including correspondence, poetry, and Coulter's PhD dissertation submitted to Bryn Mawr College in 1911.

It has been held by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam since it was bought in 1928, acquired with assistance from the Vereniging Rembrandt at a sale of works from the collection of in Berlin. Metsu painted in variety of styles and genres through artistic career. He painted The Sick Child towards the end of his life, when his style resembled Pieter de Hooch or Johannes Vermeer, with bright light, weak shadows, and fresh even colours, but with thicker paint and coarser brushstrokes so a less refined style than Vermeer. The painting was probably made after an outbreak of the bubonic plague in Amsterdam from 1663 to 1666: this killed a tenth of the population. The painting measures . The composition resembles a Pietà: a mother is cradling her listless child, probably a girl, on her lap, recalling religious works depicting the Virgin Mary cradling the dead body of Jesus. The positions of the mother and the child create diagonals crossing near the mother's heart. The child gazes out vacantly past the viewer and into the distance, with her mother leaning over her attentively. The mother's bright red skirt and blue apron, and the child's yellow and white clothes, contrast with the otherwise muted tones of the room. A pot with a spoon lies unheeded on a table to the left, with the child too lethargic to eat. To the right, some clothes lie on a chair. Hanging on the wall is a map of Europe, which bears the artist's signature \\"G. Metsue\\", and a drawing of Christ on the cross, echoing the suffering in the room. It is possible that Metsu's wife Isabella was the model for the mother in the painting: the woman wears the cap of a married woman and a wedding ring, and the earrings are seen in earlier portraits of Isabella (c.1658). The child may be theirs, although none is recorded, or possibly the child of Metsu's patron Jan Jacobszoon Hinlopen, whose family Metsu had painted in 1661 and 1663 (see Metsu's Portrait of the Family Hinlopen): Hinlopen's daughter Geertruit died of measles aged 19 months in August 1663.

Career From 1999 to 2000 Hareli was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California Los-Angeles working with causal attribution Prof. Bernard Weiner on causal attribution research. In 2000 Hareli took a position as lecturer at Kinneret College on the Sea of Galilee and then moved to the Department of Business Administration of the University of Haifa where he held the position of Associate Professor of Social psychology. He served as the head of the Interdisciplinary Center for Research on Emotions until 2017 and now directs the Laboratory for the Study of Social Perception of Emotions.. He sits on the executive committee of the Maritime Policy & Strategy Research Center (HMS). His research focuses on the social perception of emotions. In particular, he is interested in the way that people use the emotions of others to learn about social norms and social standards, about the character of people and their social power and competence. A related line of research focuses on social context influences on the social signal function of emotions. Much of this work was done in collaboration with Humboldt University Prof. Ursula Hess, specifically, on the impact of context information regarding this process. Finally, Hareli has also some interest at studying the evolutionary roots of social perception. For example, in one study Hareli tested how the shape of tree leaves surrounding houses affects its perceived value connecting it to the protective function of trees .

Its co-founders and participants include leading members of Germany's left-oriented parties as well as supporters from science and the arts. Their aim is to exert pressure on German political parties and to bring about a shift to the left in politics and society. This includes focusing on the issues concerning voters lost to new right-wing movements which have recently emerged in German politics. Inspirations for the movement include Jean-Luc Mélenchon movement La France Insoumise and Momentum, the organisation founded in support of the British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.  Founding  The founding of the movement had been debated for months when its website was launched on 4 August 2018. It was officially launched on 4 September 2018 at a press conference in Berlin. Among the founders are members of The Left, the SPD and the Greens. Notable figures involved include the sociologist Wolfgang Streeck and SPD politician Simone Lange, who was defeated for the leadership of the party in 2018 by Andrea Nahles. The background to the founding of the movement is the surge of right-wing parties worldwide, including Germany. The founders of Aufstehen argue against the rise in social injustice and urge leftist parties to unite in order to bring about a change in German politics. Wagenknecht has also stated that the continuation of the grand coalition of the CDU/CSU and the SPD after the 2017 federal election was also a stimulus to the founding of the movement, arguing that this would lead to a continuation of policies that would increase economic inequality and insecurity and benefit far-right groups such as the Alternative for Germany.  Policies  Aufstehen, an \\"extreme left\\" collective, is according to some media \\"hostile toward immigration\\". Wagenknecht, who advocates \\"against an open-border policy for Germany\\", considers open borders to be politically naïve.

In October 2019, he became British Champion Jockey. Murphy is a nephew of three-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Jim Culloty and grew up in Killarney, County Kerry. His ambition as a boy was to be a show- jumper, but after he sat on a racehorse for the first time at the age of 14, that changed. He learned his classic riding from his uncle Don before his maternal grandfather introduced him to flapper racing, at which he was very successful while also competing successfully in showjumping. His uncle made him cry when training him because he was so bad. He made an instant impact in his first year as a professional jockey in 2013, riding a four-timer at Scottish Racing’s Ayr Gold Cup day in September, including the Ayr Gold Cup itself, before going on to ride a winter in Australia, mainly for Danny O'Brien and gaining a total of 13 winners. Some British jockeys resented his success, which resulted in some violent incidents in the weighing room. Murphy concedes he was \\"probably a little cheeky\\". He gained his first Group success when partnering Hot Streak to victory in the Group 2 Temple Stakes at Haydock in May 2014 and went on to be crowned British Flat Racing Champion Apprentice later that year. A second Group 2 came in the German 2,000 Guineas on Karpino in May 2015, followed by his biggest prize up until that point - the Ebor Handicap on Litigant in August. In 2016, he became number one jockey to Qatar Racing and won 10 Group races on 10 different horses, including Lightning Spear (Celebration Mile) and Simple Verse (Park Hill Stakes). He gained his first Group 1 victory at the 2017 Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe meeting aboard the Martyn Meade-trained Aclaim in the Prix de la Foret. He has since gone on to ride eleven more winners at the highest level, notching his first two Group 1 winners in the UK in the Qatar Racing silks on Roaring Lion in the Coral- Eclipse, Juddmonte International Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and Lightning Spear in the Qatar Sussex Stakes. In June 2019, Murphy tested positive for alcohol in a breath test. Although he was under the legal drink- driving limit, this was over the limit for race riding and he had to miss a day's racing at Salisbury. The incident affected his racing, and he dropped behind in the jockeys' championship, having been 12 wins ahead. However, he caught up and in October became the British Champion Jockey. He stated his aim was to remain champion, while also winning big races. He is an ambassador for the QIPCO British Champions Series and writes regular blogs for their website. He can speak four languages, including German. He has spoken of his admiration for older jockeys such as Kieren Fallon as well as contemporaries like Silvestre De Sousa and Jim Crowley, but his idol is Frankie Dettori after whom he named his dog and whom he credits as being the best jockey he has raced against. Dettori has provided support to Murphy as he has progressed in his career.

Foundation On the sidelines of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on June 21, 2018, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, founder of Alliance of Democracies and Michael Chertoff, a former secretary of homeland security in America, launched the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which has Joe Biden, Nick Clegg, Toomas Ilves, and Felipe Calderón among its members. The commission is tasked with bolstering the defences of Western democracies against outside interference. The Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity is Transatlantic and bipartisan in nature. It seeks to share lessons learned between decision-makers and institutions in Europe and the US, raise public awareness about the risks of interference while working to develop new models and technologies to empower civil society and governments to defend democracy. Stated goals The Commission aims that over the next 20 elections to be held across EU and NATO countries between 2018 and the next American presidential contest in November 2020, they would advance a more collective approach to tackling election interference. The Commission attempts to bridge three critical gaps it has identified as having thus far prevented the West from effectively addressing the challenge: a transatlantic gap; a partisan gap; and the gap between the tech community and the rest of society. According to Politico, the commission also launched at the Munich Security Conference, an open call by 14 current and former political leaders for those running in the EU election to sign a pledge in which they promise to adhere to certain principles to counter foreign meddling.https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-eu-election-meddling-major- effort/ Russia EU election meddling major effort The call is for candidates not to spread data or materials for disinformation or propaganda purposesThe Pledge for Election Integrity Founding Members Co- chairs:http://www.allianceofdemocracies.org/initiatives/the-campaign/ * Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO Secretary General (2009-2014), Founder, Alliance of Democracies Foundation, Rasmussen Global * Michael Chertoff, United States Secretary of Homeland Security (2005-2009) Members:http://www.allianceofdemocracies.org/initiatives/the-campaign/ * Joe Biden, Vice President of the United States (2009-2017) * Felipe Calderon, President of Mexico (2006-2012) * Eileen Donahoe, Executive Director, Global Digital Policy Incubator, Stanford Centre for Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law * Toomas Ilves, President of Estonia (2006-2016) * Natalie Jaresko, Executive Director of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, Finance Minister of Ukraine (2014-2016) * Tanit Koch, Editor- in-Chief of Bild Magazine (2016-2018) * Jeanne Meserve, Anchor and correspondent at ABC news and CNN (1984-2011), Senior Fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security (2011-2017) * Victor Pinchuk, Ukrainian businessman and philanthropist, founder of the Victor Pinchuk Foundation * Marietje Schaake, Member of the European Parliament for D66 (ALDE), Vice-President of the European Parliament delegation to the US * Joanna Shields, Baroness Shields, CEO BenevolentAI and former Under Secretary of State and Minister for Internet Safety and Security, United Kingdom * John Negroponte, United States Deputy Secretary of State (2007-2009), Director of National Intelligence (2005-2007) References Category:Election commissions Category:Election commissions in the United States Category:Projects established in 2018 Category:Foreign electoral intervention ","title":"Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity"},{"id":"58061353","title":"Aden Baldwin"},{"id":"58061366","text":"Ramón Puig (21 August 1929 - 21 August 2016) was a Cuban rower.

One of the first tenants in the building was the priest Christian Bastholm (1740-1819). Royal actor Peter Jørgen Frydendahl (1766-1836) was a resident during the period of 1811–1813. Second ballet master at the Royal Danish Theatre Carl Dahlén and the actress Johanna Elisabeth Dahlén lived on the first floor in the early 1820s. Carl Dahlén accepted a young Hans Christian Andersen as a ballet student in 1821. Andersen often visited his home in Badstuestræde. The attorney Gustav Edvard Brock was a resident in the building from 1849 to 1856. He served as public prosecutor in the impeachment against the Cabinet of Ørsted-Bluhme while he lived in the building.

Name The name of the settlement is of Māori origin, meaning ‘to inspire fear in young animals’ or ‘roasted young’, probably relating to the good hunting and fishing grounds in the area.Carol Wright: Kuaotunu – Boom! Bustle! Bust! with excerpts from 'This is Kuaotunu' by R. A. (Alf) Simpson. Pages 16–20. In 2019, the name of the locality was officially gazetted as Kūaotunu.  Tourism  Kūaotunu is a popular destination for summer holidays for tourists on the Coromandel tourist circuit. It is one of the most northern beaches on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula and is popular with campers and beach lovers.  Mining  Mr Goldsworthy emerging from the Irene Tunnel at the Try Fluke Mine, Kuaotunu, 1890s The local mines and their stamping batteries, which were installed in the late 19th century, had hopeful names: Try Fluke, Carbine, Mariposa, John Bull, Great Mercury, Red Mercury, Irene, Waiawa, Otama and Kapai-Vermont. The Try Fluke Mine was a substantial gold mine close to Kūaotunu.Try Fluke Gold Mine (Coromandel). Retrieved on 3 August 2018. Its name goes back to its discovery in 1889, when prospectors asked the Maori Charles Kawhine, known locally as Coffin, what he was doing, and he replied: \\"Oh, try fluke.\\" At least this was understood instead of \\"Tryin’ luck\\", and the name stuck to the mine, which was established there. The mine consisted of several vertical shafts and horizontal tunnels, also known as adits or drives, down the hill side. It is still possible to explore some of these drives. One of them runs 50 m into the mountain, ending at a filled-in shaft. In front of the mine is a flat strip of ground, where mining railway used to run. More than 2760 ounces of gold have been extracted by January 1893, after implementing the Cassel cyanide process,The Cassel Process at Kuaotunu. New Zealand Herald, Volume XXX, Issue 9110, 30 January 1893, page 5. by which the level of gold recoverable was increased from 55% to 95%.Grace's Guide: Cassel Cyanide Co. Official production data by the Thames Mines show a yield of 2,327,619 oz bullion with a value of NZ$845 mio.  Logging  thumbuprightBushmen and their dogs travel by a logging train to the work site near Kuaotunu Logging played only a secondary role in the area, but mines needed Kauri timber both for construction and for heating the ore ovens. Local loggers thus operated a narrow gauge logging railway including a small steam engine. The locomotive with a gauge of probably had been imported from Manning, Wardle & Co in Hunslet, England with works number 859 from 1883. As the long line was flat and had no or little sidings, the empty log bogies were normally pushed out into the bush and pulled back after loading them with logs. This procedure reduced the risk of derailments of the loaded bogies, because pulling caused less derailments than pushing.Paul Mahoney: The era of the bush tram in New Zealand. IPL Books, Wellington, New Zealand, 1998. . The Kūaotunu bush contained approximately 6 mio super feet of timber. E.H. Irving worked it from 1907 to 1909 as a contractor to the Kauri Timber Company (KTC). He and his bushmen felled and transported the logs to the Whangapoua Harbour estuary, where they were dumped, made up into rafts, and towed by powerful steamer to a KTC sawmill.  Church  A church, St Columcille's, was built in 1893, when the town had approximately 2,000 inhabitants. The church cost 100 pounds to build, and was inaugurated free of debt. The material for the Roman Catholic Church at Kūaotunu arrived in January 1893 by ship, and was carted from the beach to the site near to the public school is. The building was disassembled in 1954 and re-erected at Tairua.The old days. External links *What's left to see? Kuaotunu's Mining Areas.

Life She was born to a family with Irish roots in Somerset, second daughter of Richard Hamilton (1805/6–1859), vicar of Kilmersdon, and his wife, Charlotte, née Cooper (1809–1882). She was baptised on 12 April 1841. As a child Hamilton was raised at the old vicarage but suffered a bout of typhoid fever and was extremely ill. Her father moved the family to a better house when she was eleven as a result. She was educated at home with her sister by governesses and learned French, Latin and Greek due to her father's influence. She taught in the local Sunday school and helped her father as he lost both his hearing and sight. His death in 1859 left the family unable to survive and they had to rely on relatives for support. They moved to Ballickmoyler, Queen’s County, Ireland where her mother's family had a home. Hamilton lived in Ireland for many years. Her sister married a widower, Wrigley Grimshaw, in 1875. Hamilton was living with her for the census in 1901. Career Hamilton published over twenty five books including drama, poetry and fiction. Initially she wrote under the pen name but after 1880 she started signing her work as C. J. Hamilton. Hamilton wrote religious fiction for children as well as shorter tales in illustrated journals aimed at children. She also wrote fiction for a wide number of journals such as Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine and Young Englishwoman, Dublin University Magazine, The Graphic, St. Paul's Magazine, The National Review and London Society. Hamilton wrote a series on notable women writers, actors and intellectuals which was eventually produced in volumes for publication. She was employed by the Weekly Irish Times from 1906 and Pall Mall Gazette from 1913. She was a member of the Women Writers' Club and the Institute of Journalists. By 1906 Hamilton had returned to London where she remained for about 10 years. She then moved to Devon and Bury St Edmunds. She died 28 February 1935 in Freckenham.

The union described itself as having been founded in 1860, although the Board of Trade claimed that it was founded in 1859. From its earliest years, it wanted to create a federal union, bringing together the various local unions of cardroom workers, and in 1865 it formed the United Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives of Great Britain. Despite its name, this union covered only Hyde and southern Lancashire, and it soon relocated its headquarters to Ashton-under-Lyne before disappearing. The union next attempted to revive the Unity of Cardroom and Weavers' Operatives Association, which had united some cotton industry workers in the 1850s, but this came to little. In 1886, the Hyde union was a founder constituent of the Cardroom Workers' Amalgamation (CWA), which for the first time proved an enduring association of local cardroom workers' unions. As part of the amalgamation, the Hyde union began a steady increase in membership, from 247 in 1886, to 738 in 1892 and 1,153 in 1900. The small Hadfield Cardroom Association merged into the Hyde union in 1908, followed by the Glossop Cardroom Association in 1909, and this boosted membership to over 2,500. Membership continued to grow through the 1910s, and reached a peak of 4,809 in 1927. It then began a gradual decline, in line with employment in the regional cotton industry. In 1967, the union merged with the South East Lancashire Provincial Card and Blowing Room Operatives' Association and the Stockport Cardroom and Ring Spinners' Association, forming the South East Lancashire and Cheshire Textile Operatives' Association.

He was an Assistant Professor of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Neurology and Pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-director of Laboratory for Precision Neuroimaging. Desikan's achievements became publicly known in a Washington Post article detailing his lifelong commitment to preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease and his continuing work as a scientist living with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Desikan was vocal about the need for increased awareness and research funding for ALS, and voiced his unique perspective as both ALS researcher and ALS patient in op-ed articles appearing in a regular column in the Washington Post as well as in the San Francisco Chronicle and Scientific American. Education and early influences Desikan graduated from The Bronx High School of Science, a school for gifted students, in 1995. Desikan completed his BA, MD and PhD training at Boston University, Radiology Residency at UCSD and Neuroradiology Fellowship at UCSF. He completed postdoctoral fellowships in Neuroimaging with Bruce Fischl at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and Neurogenetics with Anders Dale at UCSD. Research on neurodegenerative disease Desikan's work focused on investigating the pathobiology underlying neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. Using 'big data' acquired through ongoing global collaborations, he innovated a variety of cross disciplinary methods to identify novel risk factors for brain diseases. Scientific contributions morphology. Regions of the Desikan-Killiany atlas.Polygenic hazard score (PHS) for predicting Alzheimer's disease age of onset.Desikan's scientific career focused on helping to understand and treat neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease. His major scientific contributions included: 1) Development of an automated atlas of the human cerebral cortex (Desikan-Killiany Atlas in FreeSurfer), and its role as a quantitative biomarker for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. 2) Characterization of the synergistic relationship between amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. 3) Development of the polygenic hazard score (PHS) for predicting Alzheimer's disease age of onset, in collaboration with Chun Chieh Fan and Anders Dale. A commercial version of PHS, which calculates genetic risk for an individual using genomic data from 23andme and Ancestry.com, is available from Dash Genomics. 4) Helping develop and validate methods to quantify genetic pleiotropy. These genetic pleiotropy methods have provided valuable insights across a number of diseases and identified Novel Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased risk for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease. ALS diagnosis In February 2017, Desikan was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, one of the Neurodegenerative Diseases that has been the focus of his research. His battle with the disease, both personal and scientific, was featured in the Washington Post, in a cover story by reporter Laurie McGinley. Unable to speak, walk or use his hands, Desikan continues to pursue research and has published more than 25 papers since his diagnosis. His recent work focuses on development of a cardiovascular PHS for Alzheimer's disease and characterizing the genetic architecture of ALS. The ALS Association featured his unique story and groundbreaking work in a 2018 article. Boston University's Bostonia magazine featured Desikan in a 2018 article.

The face is rendered with much detail in line with the Northern portraiture of the period. At the time this portrait was painted, William the Silent was at the height of his career. This can also be seen in the portrait. He is not shown in armour, but in neat and opulent civilian clothes.Adriaen Thomasz. Key at Kunstbus In this portrait from Key's later period, the influence of Antonis Mor is shown in its increased interest in conveying the sitter's social status. The maker Adriaen Thomasz. Key was a Flemish painter of portraits and religious paintings, a draughtsman and a printmaker. He worked for a while in the Antwerp workshop of the prominent history and portrait painter Willem Key and later took over the workshop.Adriaen Thomasz.

He is best known for the World War I recruiting campaign using the slogan \\"Your Country Needs You\\". Lord Kitchener, the campaign being the work of Hedley Le Bas Early life He was born in Jersey on 19 May 1868, the son of ship's captain,Thomas Amice Le Bas, and educated there. In early life he was a professional soldier, serving seven years in the 15th Hussars from age 18. He then went into publishing, working for Blackie in Manchester. He became involved also in advertising to promote books, with the Caxton Publishing Company and Caxton Advertising Agency, both founded in 1899. In 1910 Le Bas bought out partners T. C. and E. C. Jack in Caxton Publishing, creating a private limited company. He went on to become a director of George Newnes, Ltd and C. Arthur Pearson, Ltd. On the board of Caxton Publishing he encountered George Riddell, who became a golfing companion and friend, for a time. Government work and World War I The work of Le Bas on army recruitment followed an October 1913 encounter over a golf match involving George Riddell, with J. E. B. Seely, the Secretary of State for War. It was launched by the Caxton agency in January 1914, with newspaper advertisements and a recruiting film, after Caxtons had consulted with Wareham Smith (1874–1938) and Thomas Baron Russell (1865–1931), who had worked as advertising managers, respectively with the Daily Mail and The Times.Brendan John Maartens, Recruitment for the British Armed Forces and Civil Defences: Organising and Producing ‘Advertising’, 1913-63, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Sussex 2013, at p. 69 Le Bas was a Liberal Party candidate, for , but stepped down in July 1914 for health reasons. On the outbreak of World War I, Le Bas was summoned by the British government, and he formed a committee of advertising men to promote recruitment. The celebrated poster of autumn 1914 was based on an image of Lord Kitchener by Alfred Leete. The poster campaign itself was in the hands of the Parliamentary Recruitment Committee. Le Bas and his colleague Eric Field from the Caxton Advertising Agency were also creative initiators in the Daddy, what did you do in the Great War? poster campaign of 1915. In 1915 Le Bas was recommended by Lord Northcliffe to Reginald McKenna as someone to promote the first British war loan. His view was that politicians of the time had little idea how to exploit the media. During 1915 his recruiting efforts turned to Ireland, and there he drew on his army service in Waterford, exploiting in a town with a substantial munitions industry the appeal of military bands.David Brian Hammond (2018), British Army Music in the Interwar Years: Culture, Performance, and Influence Ph.D. thesis The Open University at p. 261 In February of that year, he analysed for David Lloyd George the issue of Irish nationalist volunteers, and in particular the Irish Volunteers force, in the eyes of the army: taken for a Tory, he had been told they were not wanted, for the political reasons tied up with Irish Home Rule. Also in 1915, Le Bas fell out in a very public way with Riddell. Both significant in the Liberal Press, they were divided by the party faultline separating McKenna from Lloyd George, their respective golfing partners in a June 1915 match. Matters came to a head with Riddell suing Le Bas, over an alleged claim of fraud, and stating that Le Bas had tried to blackmail him over the divorce that ended his first marriage. Le Bas was knighted in 1916, the first advertising person to be honoured in that way. He stated a conviction that \\"publicity will find or create anything\\". In that year he became the publicity officer of the National Organising Committee for War Savings (NCWS).Leanne Green, Advertising War: Pictorial Publicity, 1914–1918, Ph.D. thesis Manchester Metropolitan University 2015 at p. 78 After Kitchener's death at sea in 1916, Le Bas organised the Lord Kitchener National Memorial Fund, and in 1917 edited the Lord Kitchener Memorial Book that raised funds for it. Later life Le Bas brought a libel action against the Daily Mail, alleging that in articles and letters the newspaper had published, he had been accused of trying to influence the press in corrupt ways. He lost the case, in April 1919. In the early 1920s, Le Bas was a director of the New Statesman, offering advice to make it financially viable. The editor at the time was Clifford Sharp. Le Bas discovered that the circulation was understated by a factor of nearly three, and proposed raising the advertising rate. In 1921 Le Bas founded, with friends, the Lucifer Golfing Society, a gentlemans' club that still exists; the story runs that the proposed name was the Match Club, but such a club already existed, and a pun (\\"lucifer\\" for match, as well as a euphemism for the Devil) was incorporated in the title. He was further involved in the Lord Kitchener National Memorial Fund, founding in 1922 an association of former Kitchener Scholars. In 1923, Le Bas's residence was given as Great Tylers, Reigate. At the end of his life, he lived at Chussex, Walton Heath, a 1908 house designed by Edwin Lutyens. In 1925 he was taking a further interest in the New Statesman, working to buy up shares in it on behalf of Ramsay MacDonald who was seeking control. Family Le Bas married in 1900 Emma Mary Barnes, daughter of Joseph Barnes of Dorchester. They had a son Hedley Ernest (1901–1942), and a daughter Joan Mary (1912-1994).

She had one sister ship, ; the ships were armed with a battery of fourteen guns. Augusta was laid down in 1863 at the Arman Brothers shipyard in Bordeaux, France, and was launched in early 1864. Originally ordered by the Confederate States Navy, her delivery was blocked by the French Emperor Napoleon III, and she was instead sold to the Prussian Navy in May 1864. The Prussians had been in search of vessels to strengthen their fleet before and during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, but Augusta arrived too late to see action in the conflict. Augusta was activated during the Austro- Prussian War of 1866, but since the Austrian Navy was occupied with the Italian fleet in the Adriatic Sea, she saw no action. In December 1867, she embarked on the first of three major overseas cruises under what was now the North German Federal Navy, with the secret objective of securing a naval base in Central America. Objections from the United States over an attempt to lease the port of Puerto Limón, Costa Rica caused a minor diplomatic incident and led the Germans to abandon the idea. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, Augusta was used as a commerce raider against neutral vessels carrying arms and other contraband to France; she captured three vessels, two of which were taken as war prizes before being blockaded by a superior French naval force in Vigo, Spain. The ship went on two more cruises abroad, the first in 1874–1876 and the second in 1876–1878. The first cruise again went to Central American waters, but also saw a stint off the coast of Spain to protect German interests amidst unrest in the country during the Third Carlist War. The second cruise saw Augusta travel to the Pacific Ocean, where her captain negotiated trade agreements with the chiefs in Samoa. She also spent time in China, enforcing treaties signed with the Chinese government. In 1885, Augusta embarked on one last voyage to bring replacement crews to several German ships in Australia, but she sank in a cyclone in the Gulf of Aden while en route; no trace of the vessel or her crew of 222 was ever found. Design The two Augusta-class corvettes were originally ordered by the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War from the French Arman Brothers shipyard, but after the French Emperor, Napoleon III intervened to block the sale, the Prussian Navy purchased the ships in 1864. The Kingdom of Prussia, in the midst of the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, initially anticipated a long war, and sought to acquire vessels that could be completed quickly to strengthen its fleet, though the war ended before the Augusta class entered service. Augusta was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 15 officers and 215 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove a pair of 2-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal- fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, Augusta was equipped with a full ship rig, but this was later reduced to a barque rig. Augusta was armed with a battery of eight 24-pounder guns and six 12-pounder guns. After 1872, these guns were replaced with four 22-caliber (cal.), six 23-cal. guns, and a single 23-cal. gun. Later in her career, she had six Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed. Service history Illustration of Augusta in 1864 The keel for Augusta had been laid down at the Arman Brothers shipyard in France in mid-1863 as part of a secret order from the Confederate States Navy; the ship was originally named Yeddo, supposedly for Japan. Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Ludwig von Henk inspected the ship, which was purchased on 13 May 1864. The contract was finalized on 25 May, which stipulated that the ship would be delivered complete, though without armament to Bremerhaven. Six days after the contract was signed, the ship's name was changed to Augusta in honor of King Wilhelm's wife, Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. After conducting brief sea trials, Augusta arrived in Bremerhaven on 20 June, where she received her battery of guns and conducted additional trials, including shooting trials, in the Jade Bight. On 20 July, Augusta joined the squadron sent by the Austrian Navy to fight the Danish fleet, though the ceasefire that ended the Second Schleswig War went into effect the following day. As a result, Augusta went to the recently-acquired port of Kiel on 20 November, which had become the Prussian fleet's primary base, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann having moved the bulk of the fleet there after the end of the conflict. Augusta spent the winter of 1864–1865 in service with a reduced crew. In early 1865, the ship received her full crew and began a series of short training cruises in the Baltic Sea, and from 20 to 24 April, was present in Sonderburg for the one-year anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Dybbøl, which the Prussians had decisively won during the Second Schleswig War. On 29 June, she returned to Sonderburg to participate in the commemoration of the crossing from Sonderburg to the island of Als. Toward the end of the year, she again had her crew reduced in Kiel over the winter of 1865–1866. She was reactivated on 1 July 1866 during the Austro-Prussian War, and was assigned to the squadron commanded by Jachmann in the North Sea. She saw no action during the war, however, as the Austrian Navy was forced to confront the Italian fleet in the Adriatic Sea and the German states that had allied with Austria possessed no significant naval forces. As a result, Augusta conducted training cruises in the Baltic and was decommissioned on 21 October in Danzig. =First overseas cruise= Illustration of Augusta underway Augusta was reactivated on 23 August 1867 for an extended cruise to Central American waters. In the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War, Prussia created the North German Confederation, and the Prussian Navy became the North German Federal Navy. To protect the expanded scale of North German maritime commerce and overseas interests, the new Federal Navy began to examine plans to acquire foreign stations where warships could be based. Initial plans called for bases in East Asia and Central America or the Caribbean, but Chancellor Otto von Bismarck was averse to provoking a conflict with the United States over its Monroe Doctrine, and so instructed the ship's captain, KK Franz Kinderling to avoid the appearance of having colonial designs on the region. Before Augusta could depart, however, repairs were necessary to reinforce the hull and patch leaks; the work was done in Bremerhaven. On 11 December, she left the port, but she had to stop in Portsmouth, Great Britain, after having been damaged in a storm in the North Sea. Repairs there lasted until February 1868, when she could resume her voyage to Central America. She stopped in Funchal, Madiera before crossing the Atlantic Ocean to Barbados and continuing on to visit the Venezuelan ports of Maracaibo and Caracas, Barranquilla, Colombia, and Colón, Panama. The ship reached Puerto Limón, Costa Rica on 10 April, where Kinderling visited José María Castro Madriz, the President of Costa Rica; Kinderling inquired about securing a lease on Puerto Limón for use as a naval base, but Castro refused the request. The United States learned of the request and strongly criticized it, and to preserve good relations, Bismarck declared that Kinderling had exceeded his authority. Kinderling and a group of officers then departed Puerto Limón and traveled overland to the Gulf of Nicoya on the Pacific coast of the country, before returning to Augusta on 15 May, which had since moved to Colón to avoid storms. The ship visited Puerto Barrios, Guatemala, and Kinderling intended to continue the voyage north to several Mexican ports, but he was prevented from doing so. The reason for the change of plans is unknown, but the historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Röhr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz speculated that an outbreak of yellow fever or political pressure relating to the Puerto Limón incident may have been the cause. Already on 30 April, Augusta had received orders to return home. On the way, she stopped in New Orleans in the mouth of the Mississippi River from 2 to 5 June, before arriving in Kiel on 27 July. There, she was decommissioned on 7 September for a thorough overhaul and modernization of her armament. =Franco-Prussian War= Augusta remained out of service until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July 1870. She was initially kept in reserve, since the more powerful corvette was more suitable for the task of harbor defense. After the defeat of the regular French armies and the formation of the French Third Republic, British and United States arms manufacturers began to ship weapons to arm the new French armies being formed, and so the German command decided to embark on a strategy of commerce raiding to interdict the arms shipments. Augusta was recommissioned for this purpose on 26 October, and owing to the lack of manpower, the crew from Nymphe had to be transferred to activate the ship. A shortage of coal delayed her sortie until 12 December. She remained in Swedish territorial waters to avoid Danish vessels that might warn France of her departure. Flying the flag of a merchant vessel, she crossed the North Sea to the Orkney Islands and proceeded to Bantry Bay, Ireland, on 21 December. While in Castletownbere the following day, she raised the North German naval ensign and began replenishing coal from a German steamer, which was completed on 25 December. Augusta, date unknown On the night of 25 December, Augusta left Bantry Bay in search of merchant vessels carrying weapons from the United States to France. The ship's commander, assuming that such shipments would be unloaded in Brest, began to patrol off the island of Ushant to the west of the port. The next day, Augusta stopped and inspected two neutral ships; not finding any contraband, she allowed them to proceed. Severe storms prevented the searching of any vessels for the next several days. On 2 January 1871, the ship's commander decided to move to the area off the Gironde estuary in the hopes of finding vessels carrying war materials. Two days later, she stopped the French brig St. Marc, which was carrying food intended for the French army, bound for Bordeaux. A naval cadet and five crewmen went aboard the ship, which was seized as a war prize, and taken north around Scotland back to a German port. Shortly thereafter, Augusta stopped the French barque Pierre Adolphe, which was also carrying food for the army. Another cadet and five sailors took Pierre Adolphe as a prize; with both vessels, the French crews continued to operate the vessels under the German officers' direction. Augusta then captured the French government steamship , which was discovered to be carrying a cargo of weapons, also on 4 January. Unable to provide a prize crew for the third vessel, Augusta took off the ship's crew and then sank her. By this time, Augustas coal stocks were running low, and the risk of encountering French warships grew as a result of her successes in the area. She accordingly sailed to Cape Finisterre, where she inspected three neutral vessels. On 7 January, she proceeded to Vigo, Spain, to replenish her coal supply. The ship's commander inexplicably did not order coaling to begin until 12 January, which allowed French warships to arrive and blockade the harbor, the first of which was the ironclad . Three more vessels arrived in the following days, trapping Augusta in the neutral harbor. The Armistice of Versailles was signed on 28 January, ending the fighting, and the French warships subsequently left the Spanish coast. On 7 February, Augusta also departed Vigo, and by way of a coaling stop in Mandal, Norway, arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 21 February. In the meantime, the prize Pierre Adolphe had evaded a French warship and reached the coast of Norway, but she ran aground there on 13 February. The crew was rescued by Norwegian fishermen and then picked up by St. Marc, which was then towed to Kiel by Augusta. Once the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed, officially ending the war, the French crews were repatriated aboard St. Marc. =Later career= Augusta was slated to leave for another deployment to Central America on 18 December 1871, but the voyage was cancelled and on 26 January 1872, the ship was decommissioned for another overhaul. During this period, she had her armament replaced with more modern guns. After the work finished in 1873, the naval command planned to send her to the Mediterranean Sea in November that year, but that deployment was also cancelled. She remained out of service until 1 March 1874, when she finally recommissioned for another overseas cruise, again to Central and South America. She left Wilhelmshaven on 19 March, under the command of KK Max von der Goltz. After arriving in the cruising area, Augusta began a tour of South American ports, including a stop in Montevideo, Uruguay on 5 January 1875. Unrest in Spain during the Third Carlist War prompted the naval command to send Augusta there to protect German interests. She arrived there on 29 January, and over the next three months, the situation calmed to the extent that the gunboats and were sufficient for the task. As a result, Augusta left and, after visiting Lisbon, Portugal from 5 to 25 May, returned to Central American waters. In July, Augusta visited Haiti, though her stay was interrupted by unrest in Uruguay that necessitated her presence. In August and September, she went to Colombia for the same reason. On 25 November, her sister ship arrived to replace her on the Central American station. Augusta began the voyage back to Germany and arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 6 January 1876. There, she was decommissioned for another overhaul, which included the replacement of her boilers. She returned to service on 20 September, and on 3 October departed for another cruise, this time to the South Pacific. She sailed around Africa, through the Indian Ocean, and then into the Pacific, arriving in the port of Apia, Samoa on 25 March 1877. The ship's commander and the German consul Weber negotiated trade agreements with the Samoan chiefs to ensure German equality with British and United States merchants. Augusta then went to Nukuʻalofa, the capital of Tonga, where an agreement that had been established previously by Eduard von Knorr was formally ratified. The ship remained there from 4 to 11 April. Augusta returned to Apia, where in December she received orders to move to the East Asia station. On 21 February 1878, she left Apia and joined the two gunboats on station on the Chinese coast, Nautilus and . The three ships were tasked with enforcing trade agreements with the Chinese government. Augustas stay on the station was short lived, and after her replacement, the corvette arrived, she left Chinese waters on 5 July to return to Germany. Her route home was via the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean, rather than around Africa, and she arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 14 October. Two weeks later, she was decommissioned again. From August 1879 to December 1881, the ship was overhauled and her rigging was reduced. An old ship by the mid-1880s, and cramped compared to newer vessels, Augusta was recommissioned on 14 April 1885 to transport replacement crews to ships on foreign stations. On 28 April, she embarked crews for the corvette and the gunboats Albatross and and left Germany, bound for Australia. She passed through the Suez Canal and reached the island of Perim on 31 May, where she coaled for the next day. She departed on the night of 1/2 June, but was not heard from again. She was due in Albany, Australia on 17 June, but four weeks after she left Perim, Augusta had still not arrived which prompted an investigation into the disappearance of the ship and her 222-man crew. Merchant ships that ran the route Augusta was to have taken reported no sighting of the ship, and German warships from the East Africa station were sent to search for wreckage. No trace of the ship or her crew was found, and on 13 October, she was officially declared lost. The investigation determined that a cyclone had sunk the ship, which was not strongly enough built to weather a powerful storm, in the Gulf of Aden; the cyclone also sank the French aviso , along with a British and an Ottoman steamer. The loss of Augusta was the third worst sinking in German naval history at that point, after the schooner in 1860 and the corvette in 1861.

She had one sister ship, ; the ships were armed with a battery of fourteen guns. Victoria was laid down in 1863 at the Arman Brothers shipyard in Bordeaux, France, and was launched in early 1864. Originally ordered by the Confederate States Navy, her delivery was blocked by the French Emperor Napoleon III, and she was instead sold to the Prussian Navy in May 1864. The Prussians had been in search of vessels to strengthen their fleet before and during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, but Victoria arrived too late to see action in the conflict. Victoria spent almost her entire active career abroad. After briefly serving in home waters in the mid-1860s, the ship went on three extended overseas deployments, all to the West Indies station. The first lasted from 1868 to 1869, and saw the ship protect German economic interests in Cuba and Haiti. Victoria remained largely out of service in the early 1870s, seeing no action during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. In 1875, she was reactivated for another deployment to the West Indies; this voyage was interrupted by a transfer to the Mediterranean Sea in 1877 during the Russo-Turkish War, which the German government considered might result in riots against Europeans in the Ottoman Empire. The ship returned to Germany in 1879 and began her third voyage abroad the following year. Assigned to the West Indies station for a third time, Victoria spent most of her time abroad elsewhere, taking part in an international naval demonstration in the Adriatic Sea in late 1880 and retaliating for an attack on a German merchant vessel in Liberia in 1881. Her time in the West Indies station was confined to a tour of South American ports in mid-1881. She returned to Germany in 1882 and was slated to become a training ship the following year, but the navy decided her crew spaces were too small, and so used another vessel instead. Victoria served intermittently as a fishery protection vessel between 1884 and 1890, before being stricken from the naval register in April 1891 and sold the following year. Design The two Augusta-class corvettes were originally ordered by the Confederate States Navy during the American Civil War from the French Arman Brothers shipyard, but after the French Emperor, Napoleon III intervened to block the sale, the Prussian Navy purchased the ships in 1864. The Kingdom of Prussia, in the midst of the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, initially anticipated a long war, and sought to acquire vessels that could be completed quickly to strengthen its fleet, though the war ended before the Augusta class entered service. Victoria was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 15 officers and 215 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove a pair of 2-bladed screw propellers, with steam provided by four coal- fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, Victoria was equipped with a full ship rig, but this was later reduced to a barque rig. Victoria was armed with a battery of eight 24-pounder guns and six 12-pounder guns, all of which were smoothbore guns; they were replaced with rifled guns of the same caliber in 1867. In 1871, her armament was replaced with four 22-caliber (cal.), six 23-cal. guns, and a single 23-cal. gun. Later in her career, she had six Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed. Service history =Construction and early career= The keel for Augusta had been laid down at the Arman Brothers shipyard in France in mid-1863 as part of a secret order from the Confederate States Navy; the ship was originally named Osaka, supposedly for Japan. After the Prussian government purchased the vessel, which was complete except for her armament, it sought to have the vessel, which had been renamed Victoria after the Prussian Crown Princess Victoria on 31 May, transferred to Bremerhaven, where she could be fitted with guns and placed into service. The French government had permitted the transfer of her sister ship , but by the time Victoria was ready to sail, Denmark had lobbied France to refuse to deliver a warship to an active belligerent in the Second Schleswig War. Denmark was supported in the effort by Great Britain, but the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck was able to convince the French to allow the unarmed vessel to be transferred to the Netherlands under a French flag, from where it could be picked up by a Prussian crew and taken to Bremerhaven. Victoria arrived there on 3 September, where her guns were installed and she was formally commissioned into the Prussian fleet on 14 September. She then began sea trials and shooting drills in the Jade Bight. Kiel became the Prussian fleet's primary base, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann having moved the bulk of the fleet there after the end of the conflict. On 1 October, she passed Skagen and steamed into the Baltic Sea, the war with Denmark all but over by that point, and three days later she anchored in the newly-acquired naval base at Kiel. Victoria joined the steam frigate on 2 November for a visit to Plymouth, Great Britain. On the way, they were joined by the training ships , , and . The latter three vessels were sail- powered only, so the ships could not cross the North Sea until 5 November due to calm winds. Victoria was delayed by bad weather and reached Plymouth on 28 November; on the way back home she stopped in Brest, France and reached Kiel on 22 December. There, she embarked the crew for the new ironclad turret ship , which had recently been completed in Britain. Victoria escorted Arminius on the trip back to Kiel, where they arrived on 15 May 1865. On 20 May, she left Kiel bound for Danzig, but she ran aground on the island of Fehmarn and after being pulled free had to return to Kiel. From 26 May to 1 June, she escorted the vessel carrying the remains of the Russian Crown Prince Nicholas, who had died on a tour of southern Europe. Victoria had her crew reduced in Kiel in July and was decommissioned there on 16 September. As the threat of war with Austria rose later in the year, Victoria was recommissioned on 1 January 1866 and assigned to the Baltic Sea Squadron. While towing the steam frigate , the hawser Victoria was using to pull the ship broke and got caught in her propeller, which had to be cleared in the shipyard. Victoria and Augusta later conducted shooting drills off Sonderburg, and on 31 October, the ship was decommissioned, having seen no action during the Austro-Prussian War. In 1867, Victoria went into the shipyard in Kiel to have her original smoothbore guns replaced with rifled guns of the same caliber. =First overseas deployment= Map of the Caribbean region She was recommissioned on 7 September 1868 for a deployment to the West Indies. She left Kiel on 29 September, but her voyage out was delayed by storm damage incurred in the North Sea, which forced her to go to Portsmouth for repairs that lasted from 15 to 27 October. She arrived in Saint-Pierre, Martinique on 26 November, and on 12 December she stopped in Havana, Cuba after unrest in the country threatened to block a shipment of tobacco that had been bought by a German firm. Victorias arrival deterred those blocking the shipment, and she thereafter went to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where European property had been confiscated by the government. She was successful in forcing the Haitian government to relinquish the seized property. On 9 January 1869, Victoria carried the business representative for what was now the North German Confederation from Havana to La Guaira, Venezuela. The Venezuelan government was at that time attempting to force foreign businesses to pay fees that would fund the Venezuelan military, and Victoria remained in Venezuelan waters to deter the practice. Renewed unrest in Cuba during the Ten Years' War forced the ship to return to Havana from 25 March to 22 April to protect German nationals in the area. Outbreaks of yellow fever and cholera strained the crew, and by this time, the ship's hull was in need of maintenance. The ship's captain requested permission to take the vessel to a shipyard in St. Pierre or Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but in the absence of an answer he took the ship to visit Colombia and various ports in the Caribbean Sea. While in Veracruz, Mexico in June, the ship received false rumors that a war had broken out between France and the North German Confederation. She therefore steamed to Havana to seek confirmation of the political situation; there, the crew learned that the countries were not at war, and they also received orders to return home on 25 July. On the way back, Victoria stopped in Norfolk in the United States, Fayal in the Azores, and Plymouth. In the last port, crewmen who had been seriously injured in a severe storm had to be sent ashore to a military hospital, and the ship itself required repairs. She arrived in Danzig on 8 October, where she was decommissioned on the 19th of the month. =Second overseas deployment= Victoria initially remained in reserve after the outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War in July 1870, but in January 1871 she was commissioned to attack French shipments of war material as a commerce raider, though she did not actually serve in that capacity. Instead, she remained in Danzig until November when she moved to Kiel. On 5 December she was decommissioned and sent into the shipyard, where she was equipped with more modern and built-up guns in place of the rifled guns she had received in 1867. She remained out of service until December 1874, when she was moved to Wilhelmshaven, though she thereafter remained in reserve. The ship conducted firing trials with the new guns from 20 March to 8 April 1875, although she was not formally commissioned for the tests. On 11 October, the ship was recommissioned for another tour in the West Indies, and she left Wilhelmshaven on 26 October. She reached Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies on 29 November, where she relieved her sister Augusta. Victoria then proceeded with a tour of ports in the Caribbean, though unrest in Haiti necessitated her presence in May 1876. Beginning in late June, she steamed further south, visiting ports in South America, as far south as Montevideo, Uruguay. By 14 December, she had returned to Saint Thomas, thereafter resuming a cruise in the Caribbean. The ship cruised in Venezuelan waters from 14 February to 3 March 1877. A conflict between Guatemala and El Salvador then broke out, and at the same time, Mexico was in the midst of the Revolution of Tuxtepec, and so Victoria stayed in Sabanilla, Colombia from 8 to 14 March and then in Havana from 21 March to 3 April in the event that her intervention in either conflict became necessary. The crises passed without threatening German interests, and so Victoria left Havana on 3 April for Saint Thomas, where she received orders to cross the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea. She arrived in the area on 16 April and continued on to Port Said, Egypt, which she reached on 14 June. At the time, the Ottoman Empire was fighting the Russo-Turkish War, and the German government feared that anti-European riots might break out in the Levant, threatening German holdings in Jerusalem. Victoria joined the frigate and they visited several ports in the region. Victoria was quickly recalled on 2 July, since a number of her crew had contracted an illness. The ship arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 29 July, and on 10 August she was decommissioned for a thorough overhaul, during which her rigging was reduced. She conducted sea trials from 12 to 13 August 1879 and was again decommissioned on 6 September. =Third overseas deployment and fate= On 1 July 1880, Victoria was recommissioned for another tour in the West Indies under the command of Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Victor Valois. She sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 16 July, but while in Plymouth from 19 to 22 July, she received new orders to proceed instead to Malta and await further orders. She reached Valletta, Malta on 1 August, where she was instructed to steam to Benghazi in Barqa. Senussites had attacked the German explorer Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs, who had been on an expedition to explore the northern Congo Basin, and so the German government ordered Victoria to protect the expedition and extract financial compensation for his losses. On 29 August, Victoria left Benghazi, having secured Ottoman agreements to protect Rohlfs' team and pay restitution. She returned to Valletta, where she received orders to sail to the Adriatic Sea to join an international naval demonstration to force the Ottoman government to relinquish the city of Ulcinj to Montenegro in accordance with the terms of the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Local Albanians, backed by the Ottoman government, held the city and refused to surrender it. Around twenty vessels from Britain, France, Italy, Austria- Hungary, and Russia took part in the blockade of Ulcinj and other coastal towns, under the command of British Vice Admiral Beauchamp Seymour. The blockade began on 20 September, and by 27 November, the Ottomans caved to the demands of the Great Powers and sent in troops to force the Albanians to relinquish the city. On 3 December, the international squadron was dissolved. Map of Liberia showing the location of Nana Kru On the night of 5–6 December, Victoria left the Adriatic and resumed her original orders to the West Indies. She stopped in Gibraltar on 23 December for repairs on the way; there, the ship received a letter of thanks from the British governor for her participation in the international squadron, as well as orders diverting her to Liberia on 27 December. Liberians from the town of Nana Kru had attacked the German steamship after it had run aground. Victoria left Gibraltar on 7 February 1881 and picked up the ship's captain in Funchal, Madiera, before proceeding to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. There, she embarked the German consul and two representatives from the Liberian government and took them to Nana Kru on 4 March. Valois sent a landing party ashore to attack the town; the men arrested nine men and took them aboard the ship, which returned to Monrovia to have the men tried for the attack. The Liberian government also agreed to pay damages for the attack. Victoria was now free to cross the Atlantic, stopping in Porto Grande Bay in Cape Verde on 17 March on the way. She visited numerous harbors in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. After arriving in São Francisco do Sul, Brazil, where a sizable German expatriate community was present, the harbor pilot accidentally put the ship onto a reef, which nearly capsized the ship at low tide. Valois then conducted a survey of the port to determine what other dangerous areas were present. While in Rio de Janeiro, Victoria received orders to return to Monrovia, because the Liberian government had failed to meet its financial obligation over the Carlos incident. She left Rio de Janeiro on 8 October and arrived in the Liberian capital on 27 October; that day, Valois threatened to bombard the city, which resulted in an immediate payment. Victoria left the port on 2 November and reached Porto Grande Bay six days later. There, she received orders to return to Germany, and she arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 21 December. She was decommissioned there on 4 January 1882 for another overhaul. Victoria was scheduled to return to service in 1883 as a training ship, but her crew spaces were deemed too small to accommodate enough trainees, and so her place was taken by the corvette . Instead, she served intermittently as a fishery protection vessel, from 1 to 31 July 1884, from 27 March to 6 August 1888, and from 18 March to 14 September 1890. She was present at the official transfer ceremony for the island of Helgoland to Germany on 9 August 1890, which had been traded from Great Britain in exchange for a protectorate over the island of Zanzibar. Victoria was stricken from the naval register on 14 April 1891 and sold for scrap the next year.

The paintings show the corporal works of mercy, with Jesus in the background viewing each, in this order: feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, burying the dead, sheltering the traveler, comforting the sick, and ransoming the captive. In the upper centre of the central panel the Last Judgement is depicted. According to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), a decisive factor in the Last Judgement will be the moral question if the corporal works of mercy were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the works of mercy was very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art, especially in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Era.Ralf van Bühren, Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples.

The picture series by the Master of Alkmaar was commissioned by the regents of the Holy Spirit almshouse in Alkmaar, before being moved to the church of St Lawrence in the town in 1574. The panel remained in St Lawrence until 24 June 1582. It was then bought from the church of St Lawrence in July 1918 by its present owner, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. From 2004 to 2010, it was loaned to the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. The paintings, bearing the stamp of Geertgen tot Sint Jans, are done in bright colors, and their figures are drawn in an exaggeratedly caricatured manner. It has been proposed that this artist is identical to Cornelis Buys I, the brother of Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen; he is known to have been active in Alkmaar between 1490 and 1524. More recently, the name of Pieter Gerritsz, originally of Haarlem, has been proposed, he being in Alkmaar beginning in 1502. This artist, in 1518, was compensated for a painting of Saint Bavo in Haarlem, and his name can be found in records of the Egmond Abbey and of the church of Saint Lawrence in Alkmaar, over a period covering the years 1515 to 1529.

The 114th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to , and their ninth in franchise history. This was the second World Series matchup between the two franchises, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in . The series was sponsored by the Internet television service YouTube TV and officially known as the 2018 World Series presented by YouTube TV. The Series was televised in the United States on Fox. Steve Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while Alex Cora became the fifth first-season manager and first manager from Puerto Rico to win the World Series. The Series was notable for its third game which lasted 18 innings, a World Series record. The 2018 World Series was the first since to feature two teams which had also reached the postseason in the prior year. Additionally, the Red Sox became the first team to win two World Series exactly one century apart, as they had defeated the Chicago Cubs in 1918, while the Dodgers were the first team since the 2011 Texas Rangers, and the first NL team since the 1992 Atlanta Braves, to lose consecutive Fall Classics. Background The Boston Red Sox' most recent World Series appearance was their 2013 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won a World Series in 1988 over the Oakland Athletics, made their second consecutive appearance, after losing to the Houston Astros in 2017. The two franchises faced each other in the 1916 World Series; the Red Sox won the series in five games against the then- Brooklyn Robins. Andrew Benintendi (left), Jackie Bradley Jr. (center), and Mookie Betts (right) Red Sox manager Alex Cora and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts were teammates on the Dodgers in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Although they did not play together on the Red Sox, both managers played and won a World Series championship with Boston—Roberts in 2004 and Cora in 2007. This was the first World Series with two managers of color; additionally, both managers were born outside the contiguous United States, as Cora was born in Puerto Rico and Roberts in Japan. =Boston Red Sox= The Red Sox finished with a record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees, and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason. The Red Sox surpassed the 100-win mark for the first time since 1946, broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912, and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116. The 2018 Red Sox were highlighted by All-Stars Mookie Betts, Craig Kimbrel, J. D. Martinez, Mitch Moreland, and Chris Sale. Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in. Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts. Kimbrel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters. The Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series. Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the League Championship Series. Including their 2004 win that ended the Curse of the Bambino, this was the fourth World Series appearance by the Red Sox in 15 years and their 13th appearance all-time. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Despite a start to the season and nine losses in an 11-game stretch in mid-August, the Dodgers made the playoffs for the sixth straight year by winning the division in a one-game tiebreaker over the Rockies. At the July trade deadline, the team traded for All-Star shortstop Manny Machado from the Orioles to replace injured shortstop Corey Seager and a former All-Star second baseman Brian Dozier from the Twins. In August, the Dodgers acquired former World Series MVP David Freese from the Pirates. For the second year in a row, the Dodgers broke their franchise record for most team home runs in a season. With a record, the team entered the playoffs as a second seed and went on to beat the Atlanta Braves in four games in the 2018 National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games in the 2018 National League Championship Series, becoming the first team in either league to win Game 7 of a League Championship Series on the road since the 2006 Cardinals. The 2018 Dodgers were the first team to make the World Series by winning their tie- breaker game since the 2007 Colorado Rockies, who also faced and lost to Boston in that World Series. This was the Dodgers' fifth back-to-back World Series appearance. Two came in Brooklyn in 1952–1953 and 1955–1956, and two came in Los Angeles in 1965–1966 and 1977–1978. Overall, this was the Dodgers' 20th World Series appearance. Summary Pre-game ceremonies * Game 1: The national anthem was performed by James Taylor.

Game summaries =Game 1= Eduardo Núñez hit a three-run home run for Boston in the seventh inning. The Red Sox started Chris Sale against the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw. Kershaw became the first pitcher to start the first game of the World Series in back-to-back years since Cliff Lee did so in 2009 (for the Phillies) and 2010 (for the Rangers) and the first to do so for the same team since Dave Stewart pitched three consecutive Game 1s for the Oakland Athletics from 1988 to 1990. The Red Sox struck in the first inning when Mookie Betts singled, stole second and then scored on a hit by Andrew Benintendi, who subsequently scored on a single by J. D. Martinez. Boston benefited from Dodgers' first baseman David Freese missing a foul pop-up by Betts, and right fielder Yasiel Puig allowing Benintendi to advance to second base on a late throw to the plate. A homer by Matt Kemp in the second inning gave the Dodgers a run, and an RBI single by Manny Machado in the third inning tied the score, 2–2. In the bottom of the third, Steve Pearce grounded into a fielder's choice—which was called an inning-ending double play on the field, but overturned by video review—and the Red Sox regained the lead on an RBI double by Martinez in the following at-bat. In the top of the fifth, a groundout by Machado plated Brian Dozier to even the score, 3–3. Sale wound up pitching into the fifth inning, allowing three runs on five hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. The Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the fifth, and scored the go-ahead run when Xander Bogaerts grounded into a fielder's choice. A single by Rafael Devers off reliever Ryan Madson in the next at-bat made it 5–3. Kershaw's final line was five runs on seven hits and three walks with five strikeouts in four-plus innings. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh off reliever Ryan Brasier and scored a run on a sacrifice fly by Machado. Eduardo Núñez hit a pinch-hit three run home run off Alex Wood in the bottom of the seventh to make it a four run lead for the Red Sox, 8–4, with no further scoring in the game. Boston reliever Matt Barnes, who finished the fifth inning after relieving Sale, got the win, while Kershaw took the loss for Los Angeles. =Game 2= David Price got the win in Game 2, his second win of the 2018 postseason. Game 2 featured another matchup of left-handed pitchers; Boston started David Price, who got the win in Game 5 of the 2018 American League Championship Series, while Los Angeles started Hyun-jin Ryu, who took the loss in Game 6 of the 2018 National League Championship Series. The Red Sox again scored first, this time in the second inning, when Xander Bogaerts doubled and then scored on a single by Ian Kinsler. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the fourth inning and David Freese scored on a sacrifice fly by Matt Kemp to tie the game; Yasiel Puig then singled to drive in Manny Machado with the go-ahead run. After the Red Sox loaded the bases against Ryu in the bottom of the fifth, reliever Ryan Madson walked in the tying run and J. D. Martinez drove in two more with a single. Ryu's final line was four runs allowed on six hits and one walk with five strikeouts in 4 innings. Price only allowed two runs on three hits and three walks in six innings while striking out five. Both bullpens prevented more runs from scoring as the Red Sox won, 4–2, to take a two games to none lead. Ryu took the loss for the Dodgers, while Price earned the win for Boston with closer Craig Kimbrel getting his sixth save this postseason. It was also the 100th postseason victory in Red Sox franchise history. =Game 3= Max Muncy hit the game-winning home run in the 18th inning of Game 3. After two games started by left-handed pitchers, both teams started right-handed pitchers for Game 3; Walker Buehler for the Dodgers and Rick Porcello for the Red Sox. With no designated hitter, J. D. Martinez started in left field for the Red Sox, in place of usual left fielder Andrew Benintendi. The Dodgers scored first, for the first time in the series, when Joc Pederson homered in the third inning. Porcello pitched 4 innings, allowing the one run on three hits and one walk while striking out five. Buehler pitched seven scoreless innings allowing only two hits with no walks and seven strikeouts. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a home run off Kenley Jansen with two outs in the eighth inning to tie the game. It was Jansen's first blown save in four opportunities this postseason. No one scored in the ninth after Cody Bellinger was caught between bases to end the ninth. and the game went into extra innings tied at one. In the top of the 10th inning, pinch-runner Ian Kinsler attempted to score from third on Rafael Devers's sacrifice fly, but a strong throw by center fielder Bellinger had Kinsler out at the plate. In the 13th inning, Brock Holt walked, advanced on a wild pitch and scored the go-ahead run on an infield single by Eduardo Núñez and a throwing error by pitcher Scott Alexander. Then in the bottom of the inning, Max Muncy walked against Nathan Eovaldi, advanced to second on a pop out to Núñez in foul territory (Nuñez made a great catch and tumbled into the stands after making the catch, which allowed Muncy to advance) and then scored the tying run after an infield hit by Yasiel Puig and a throwing error by Ian Kinsler. In the bottom of the 15th, Muncy appeared to hit a walk-off home run down the right- field line but the ball hooked foul. Muncy hit a walk-off home run off Eovaldi in the 18th inning to win it for the Dodgers, 3–2, to cut their series deficit to 2–1. Eovaldi had just begun his seventh inning of relief. At 18 innings and seven hours and 20 minutes, this contest became the longest World Series game by both innings and time, surpassing (in playing time) Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, which lasted 14 innings and five hours and 41 minutes, and breaking the record (in innings) first set in Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, when the Red Sox and Dodgers (then known as the Robins) played 14 innings. Muncy tied the record for latest (18th inning) walk-off hit in postseason history, equalling Chris Burke in Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series. It was also the Dodgers' first game-winning World Series home run since Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The game took longer to play than the entire 1939 World Series, which had seven hours and five minutes of total playing time over four games. =Game 4= Steve Pearce had four RBIs and scored twice in Boston's Game 4 win. Following the longest game in World Series history, the Dodgers started Rich Hill while Eduardo Rodríguez made his first start of the postseason for the Red Sox. At 38 years old, Hill was the oldest player to start a World Series game since 39-year-old Tim Hudson started two games for the San Francisco Giants in 2014 and the oldest for the Dodgers since Sal Maglie in 1956. As he had pitched in relief in Game 3, Rodríguez became just the sixth pitcher in history to start a World Series game with zero days rest, and the first since Firpo Marberry of the Washington Senators in the 1924 World Series. The Red Sox had intended to start Nathan Eovaldi, but he needed rest after throwing 97 pitches in relief in Game 3. With no designated hitter, the Red Sox started an outfield of Andrew Benintendi, Mookie Betts, and J. D. Martinez, with Jackie Bradley Jr. on the bench in place of Benintendi, who did not start the previous game. The game was scoreless through the first five innings. In the bottom of the sixth, the Dodgers loaded the bases against Rodríguez and scored the game's first run on a throwing error by catcher Christian Vázquez. The next batter, Yasiel Puig, hit a three-run home run to extend the lead to 4–0. Rodríguez was taken out after 5 innings, allowing the four runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. At that point, Red Sox ace Chris Sale made an angry speech that fired up his teammates in the dugout. In the top of the seventh, after striking out Eduardo Núñez with a runner on first, Hill was taken off the mound in favor of reliever Ryan Madson, a decision by Roberts which was criticized by several including President Donald Trump. Mitch Moreland hit a three-run pinch-hit home run off of Madson to make it a one run game. Hill was charged with one run in innings on one hit and three walks with seven strikeouts. Madson set a new World Series record by allowing seven inherited runners to score in the series. Steve Pearce hit a homer off Kenley Jansen in the eighth inning. This was the second straight day Jansen allowed a game tying home run in that inning. Jansen became just the second pitcher in World Series history to allow game-tying home runs in back-to-back games (Byung-hyun Kim for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001 was the other). In the top of the ninth, Brock Holt doubled off Dylan Floro and was driven in by a single by pinch hitter Rafael Devers to give Boston their first lead of the game. The Red Sox loaded the bases against Floro and Alex Wood and then Pearce doubled to right center off Kenta Maeda, scoring all three base runners to put the Red Sox up, 8–4. They added another run when Xander Bogaerts drove in Pearce with a single. Kiké Hernández hit a two-run homer off of Craig Kimbrel in the ninth to cut the lead to three. Kimbrel was able to get the last three outs and the Red Sox took a three games to one lead. =Game 5= Alex Cora, seen here as a player in 2008, led the Red Sox to the World Series championship in his first year as manager. On October 28, Los Angeles became the first city to host an MLB, NFL (Rams), NHL (Kings), MLS (Galaxy) and NBA (Clippers) game all on the same day. Clayton Kershaw started for the Dodgers, while David Price started for the Red Sox. Price became the first pitcher to start World Series games no more than four days apart while also pitching in relief between those games since Jack Billingham of the Cincinnati Reds did so in the 1972 World Series. Jackie Bradley Jr. again did not start in the outfield for Boston, but entered the game as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the ninth inning. Both teams scored in the first inning. The Red Sox scored in the top of the inning after a one out single by Andrew Benintendi followed by a two-run home run by Steve Pearce. David Freese led off the bottom of the inning with a home run for the Dodgers. No one else scored until the sixth inning, when Mookie Betts hit a home run with one out and then J. D. Martinez hit a lead-off homer in the seventh to make it 4–1. Kershaw pitched seven innings, allowing four runs on seven hits, with five strikeouts and no walks. In the eighth inning, Pearce hit another home run, this time off of Pedro Báez. Price pitched into the eighth, allowing only one run on three hits and two walks while striking out five. He became just the fifth pitcher to pitch 6+ innings and allow three or fewer hits in three straight postseason starts. Joe Kelly and Chris Sale pitched the last two innings and both struck out the side, Sale getting Manny Machado to strike out for the last out, the Red Sox winning the game 5–1 and the title 4–1. Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. With the Red Sox winning their ninth title, the 2018 season was over. =Series statistics= 2018 World Series (4–1): Boston Red Sox (AL) beat Los Angeles Dodgers (NL).

Sponsorship The Red Sox held a victory parade in Boston on October 31. The 2018 World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV, the second consecutive year that the service sponsored the series. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties, on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games. As part of the agreement, YouTube TV will also sponsor the 2019 World Series.  Celebration  On the morning of October 31, the Red Sox celebration parade began at Fenway Park and made its way downtown to its final destination on Staniford Street. During the celebration, the World Series trophy sustained minor damage from a beer can thrown by a spectator; it was subsequently repaired. An 80-minute documentary, 2018 World Series: Damage Done, which was produced by MLB and narrated by Uzo Aduba, was released on December 4. On December 3, Red Sox president Sam Kennedy announced that team accepted an invitation to visit the White House. Originally planned for February 15, 2019, the visit was postponed to May 9, 2019, due to the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown. Alex Cora announced that he would not attend, citing the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico. On May 9, various team members along with owner John W.

The union was founded in 1879 as the Rochdale Male and Female Card and Blowing Room and Ring Spinners' Association, and registered with the Board of Trade two years later. It was initially very small, with only 180 members in 1886. That year, it became a founder member of the Cardroom Workers' Amalgamation (CWA), and its membership rapidly increased, reaching 1,800 by 1892. After ten years of stagnation, it then grew rapidly once more, and in 1907 the Todmorden Cardroom Association merged in. Membership peaked at 7,770 in 1919, and despite dropping in the early 1920s, it recovered to 7,612 in 1936. After World War II, membership of the union fell in line with employment in the Lancashire cotton industry, but general secretary Harold Chorlton became the leader of the CWA, and the Rochdale union remained one of its most important affiliates. The Heywood Cardroom Association merged into the Rochdale union in 1967 and, to reflect this change, in 1970 the union became the National Union of Textile and Allied Workers, Rochdale and Districts. Following further membership declines, in 1984 the union merged into the Central Lancashire and Calderdale Amalgamated Textile Workers' Union, which two years later joined the GMB.

The relationship between the two heads was often tense. Under modern public law, the ordonnateur (Authorizing Officer) is a French administrator who authorises collection of revenue and payment of expenses. Typically this is a government minister at the national level, a departmental prefect, the head of a local government or the executive in charge of a state institution such as a university or hospital. The function is separated by law from that of the comptable (accountant), who handles the money. Colonial era From the late 17th century power in the French colonies was equally divided between a governor, responsible for the military, and an ordinnateur, responsible for finances. Typically the governor was a professional soldier and the ordinnateur was from the professional class of men of the robe. Usually they were commissioned naval commissaries, or officers of the pen. The position was based on the concept of the intendants who governed the provinces of France. It was also called commissaire-ordonnateur or premier conseilleur. The ordonnateurs had many of the powers of an intendant, but without the prestige of that title. The ordonnateur had the authority to order treasurers to make payments on behalf of the government of the colony, but did not handle the money, and did not have authority over those who did. The ordonnateur in French Louisiana supervised royal properties, issued royal supplies, collected tariffs and taxes and was the first judge of the Superior Council of Louisiana. Separate areas of responsibility and authority between the governor and ordinnateur were defined, but there were often clashes in areas of overlap or ambiguity. For example, building fortifications would have both military and financial aspects, and it might be unclear who had ultimate authority over trade or justice. =Early office holders= Two intendents, one in New France and the other in the West Indies were responsible for civil administration between 1680 and 1718. In 1704 André Deslandes arrived in Saint-Domingue as the first ordonnateur of the colony, and in 1705 he established a Superior Council at Cap Français. Jean-Jacques Mithon de Senneville served as a commissary under Intendent Robert in Martinique from 1697, in 1708 became ordonnateur of Saint-Domingue, and on 9 August 1718 was named the first intendant of the Leeward Islands. In 1725 Jean-Baptiste Dubois-Duclos was named ordonnateur of Saint-Domingue, and in 1728 Gilles Hocquart was named ordonnateur of Canada. It was not until 1731 that he was named intendant. Paul Lefebvre d'Albon was commissaire-ordonnateur in Cayenne from 1712 to 1746. Charles Mesnier was commissaire-ordonnateur in Guadeloupe from 1723 to 1729. On Île-Royale Pierre-August de Soubras was commissaire-ordonnateur from 1714 to 1718, succeeded by Jacques-Sébastien Le Normant de Mézy from 1718 to 1731. Modern administration =Position= The functions of the ordonnateur in the public administration are defined by decree 2012-1246 of 7 November 2012, which also defines the functions of the comptable (accountant). The title applies to the heads of national and local government departments and public institutions such as hospitals, educational establishments and resource centers. Ordonnateurs are financial decision makers, and have sole authority to assess whether an expense should be incurred or a receipt is due. The role of ordonnateur is reserved for senior administrative and political authorities. At the national level the ministers are ordonnateurs, in local governments the local executive has this function, and generally the executive head of a public institution has the function. There are two grades of ordonnateur in the public administration, primary and secondary. The ordonnateurs principaux have a directly assigned budget, which at the national level is assigned by parliament to each ministry. The ordonnateurs secondaires are delegated credits from the ordonnateurs principaux. Prefects are ordonnateurs secondaires of the state. There are no ordonnateurs secondaires at the local level. Ordonnateurs at both levels may delegate their signing authority, but remain responsible for the acts of their delegates. =Functions= Ordonnateurs authorise collection of revenue and payment of expenses. They determine rights and obligations, clear receipts, issue invoices and authorize expenses and credits where appropriate. They transmit orders to pay or collect to the competent comptable. Spending operations include commitment, liquidation and authorization. Commitment is the act by which the public body creates or discovers an obligation that will result in a charge, which should normally by settled from the approved budget. Liquidation verifies that an amount is payable and the appropriate documents have been submitted. Scheduling authorises payment by the accountant. The ordonnateur also sends the comptable orders for collection of payments such as rentals, fines and other non-tax revenue. Taxes are collected by separate authorities. =Relationship to comptable= The comptable (accountant) handles the funds and keeps the accounts. Usually they are a Public Treasury official appointed by the Ministry of Budget and Finance. Between them the two officials have full control over the budget. The functions cannot be combined. The ordonnateur cannot handle public money because it would \\"burn their fingers.\\" By separating the functions of authorization and payment or receipt there is greater control and less temptation to deviate from the rules. To ensure full separation, the comptable is not subordinate to the ordonnateur, and is ineligible for local election.

Prelude  The Red Army had successfully conducted the Voronezh-Kastornensk Operation, defeating the troops of the AFSR. The withdrawal of the Volunteer Army to the south exposed the left flank of the Don Army. Therefore, the Don Army was forced in mid-November 1919 to abandon any offensive towards the north, as the Red Army prepared an attack. By the time the operation began, the Don Army commanded by General Vladimir Sidorin, held a defensive line over Bobrov, Berezovka, and Archedinskaya. His forces amounted to about 13,700 bayonets, 13,200 sabers, 90 guns and 500 machine guns. The Red 9th Army, under command of Alexander Stepin, and the 10th Army Cavalry Corps, under command of Boris Dumenko, numbered in total 13,400 bayonets, 4,600 sabers, 160 guns and 660 machine guns. The Red Army command's plan was to attack with the main forces of the Ninth Army (the 36th, 23rd and 14th Rifle Divisions) and Dumenko's Cavalry Corps, at the junction between the 3rd and 2nd Don Corps, defeat them and occupy the city of Pavlovsk on the Don River. To ensure the success of the main offensive, two secondary attacks were also planned: one on the right flank of the army by Mikhail Blinov's cavalry division at Talovaya in cooperation with the left-flank divisions of the 8th Army of the Southern Front (33rd and 40th Rifle Divisions), with the aim of destroying the Likino-Bobrov group of the White Guards, and the other on the left flank by the 22nd Infantry Division in cooperation with the 32nd Infantry Division of the 10th Army, towards the villages of Kumylzhenskaya and Ust- Medveditskaya, with the task of destroying parts of the 1st Don Corps in the vicinity of the Medveditsa River.  The Battle  The offensive of the Red troops began on November 20. Blinov's cavalry division broke through the defense of the Don Army and on November 23 took Buturlinovka, in this battle the divisions commander Mikhail Blinov perished. However, the White 1st Don Cavalry Division, the 7th Don Cavalry Brigade of the 3rd Don Corps and the Cavalry group of the 2nd Don Corps made a flank counterattack on Blinov's cavalry division and by November 25 threw it back to the Talovaya area. On November 26, the Red forces forced the Khopyor River on a broad front, creating a bridgehead on its right bank. The main forces of the Ninth Army broke through the defense of the 7th and Consolidated Don divisions of the 2nd Don Corps and on November 28, Dumenko's cavalry corps captured Kalach. The 22nd Infantry Division attacked the 6th Don Plastun Division and by November 26 pushed it to the southern bank of the Don. The White Command decided to retake Kalach, by concentrating the Cavalry group of the 2nd Don Corps from the Buturlinovka area and the 14th Don Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Don Corps from the Nova Criusi area, to surround the Cavalry corps of Dumenko and defeat it. On November 28, the Don Army launched its counteroffensive. Under the onslaught of the White Guard combined division and the 14th Cavalry Brigade, the units of the 23rd Red Infantry Division were forced to go over to the defensive, and the 14th Infantry Division was forced to retreat. At this time, Blinov's cavalry division resumed its offensive with the support of the 21st Infantry Division (from the reserves of the Ninth Army), and defeated the Cavalry group of the Second Don Corps in the Buturlinovka area. Together with the Cavalry corps of Dumenko, they began to encircle the White troops in the south. Unable to withstand the pressure of the Red Army, the Don Army began a general retreat. The troops of the Ninth Army and the cavalry corps together with the 40th Infantry Division, followed in pursuit, and on December 8 reached the Don River at Rossosh and Ust-Medveditskaya.  Results  The successful choice of location for the main attack of the Red Army led to the division of the Don Army into two parts. This forced the White command to pull back towards the southern bank of the Don, to avoid complete defeat. The lack of cavalry prevented the Red troops from completing the encirclement of the enemy and gain a greater victory. The Red Army advanced up to 100 km at a slow rate, some 5 km per day.

Born in Thetford (Norfolk), she was the daughter of Robert George Burrell, a manufacturer of steam engines, and Ellen Alborough Cockayne. She showed a talent for watercolour: at the age of eleven, she won a prize in a local exhibition. She specialized in portraits, and by 1913, she had moved to London for a career as a society portraitist. Among those whose portraits she painted were actresses Gladys Cooper, Marie Löhr, Muriel Beaumont and Irene Vanbrugh, and society individuals, such as Miriam Rothschild as a young girl and Lady Marjorie Duff. In May 1913, an exhibition of her portraits was held in New Bond Street, London, and in March-April 1914, another was held at the Dudley Galleries, Piccadilly. Her exhibitions were reported by several newspapers and society magazines such as Tatler and The Sketch, which published black and white reproductions. Colour reproductions were sold during her exhibitions and as postcards. Reviewers noted that her style had \\"grace and simplicity\\"; despite the \\"over-prettiness\\" of her works, it evolved to \\"a happy knack of catching likenesses\\" and a \\"gift of depicting life-like expression\\". In 1915 she painted and exhibited portraits of soldiers. During a sitting, she met Major Boyd Alexander Cuninghame (born in Australia in 1871); who had fought in the Boer War and, during WWI, against the Germans in Rhodesia, in December 1914 and in 1915. He was wounded and sent back to Britain to recuperate. They married on 12 July 1916; the Tatler had published her photo with the caption \\"Miss Elsie Burrell. The well-known artist who is shortly to be married to Major Boyd Cuninghame (late Scots Greys), who has been serving with the Northern Rhodesia Rifles\\". As Major Cuninghame had two farms in Makeni (Lusaka, Rhodesia), Elsie followed him to Africa, abandoning her artistic career and watercolour practice. Less than one year later, in March 1917, Major Cunninghame died of typhoid fever in Elisabethville (Congo). Elsie continued to manage both farms successfully, and samples of wheat she had grown won a prize in London. In 1920, Randolf Baker, a British politician, met Elsie in Makeni. They married on 29 June 1920 in Livingstone (Rhodesia). The couple ran the farms and divided their time between Rhodesia and Ranston House, near Blandford Forum in Dorset. Their daughter Selina Baker was born in 1925. Elsie died at Ranston House on 1 February 1955.

The first state was engraved around 1639 - the composition has some similarities to a 1615 drawing by Pieter Feddes van Harlingen. Rembrandt began with the dark surfaces in the background and only sketched in the model. The second state was printed in 1640, with the arms and other details shown in more detail. Some argue that he abandoned the work, though Emmens instead argues that he produced it as a teaching aid for his students to show different stages in etching and engraving.

It is one of the two largest prints made by Rembrandt, about , similar to his 1653 engraving of The Three Crosses. It has been described by Christie's as \\"at the summit of the western printmaking tradition\\". Description The print depicts an episode from the Passion of Jesus in which Pontius Pilate presents Jesus to the people, saying \\"ecce homo\\" (\\"behold the man\\"), offering to free either Jesus or the notorious criminal Barabbas, and asks the crowd to choose between them. The scene echoes contemporary judicial practice in the Netherlands, in which magistrates bearing a staff of office would present a condemned criminal to the public from a raised balcony or platform. The building in the background resembles the new Town Hall in Amsterdam by Jacob van Campen, completed in 1655 and now the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. The main figures are on a platform above the crowd, in front of a dark archway. Accompanied by armed guards, Pilate stands with a long staff, wearing an oriental turban and long gown, gesturing to the two prisoners who stand bound to the right. To the left is a scribe and youth with an ewer of water, ready for Pilate to wash his hands. Niches in the building behind them have allegorical sculptures of Justice and Fortitude. The building continues with windows and balconies on either side above arched doorways, one window perhaps occupied by Pilate's wife. Rembrandt has included a motley collection of characters in the crowd, with some Jewish elders observing to the right. Rembrandt was inspired by Lucas van Leyden's 1510 etching of the same scene, of which he owned a copy. Rembrandt continued producing prints until the 1660s, but this was the last depicting the Passion. States Rembrandt's prints were made from a drypoint engraving on copper plate, and eight states are known. The first version, state i, measures , and the final version, state viii, is slightly shorter, measuring . Save for the architecture to the top right, the first state was nearly complete. Only eight versions of the first state are known, printed on expensively imported yellowish Japanese paper. Seven are in public collections, at Kupferstichkabinett Berlin of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, the British Museum in London, the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, two in Paris at the Dutuit collection at the Musée du Petit Palais and the collection of Edmond de Rothschild at the Musée du Louvre, and at the Graphische Sammlung Albertina in Vienna. The last remaining impression of the first state in private hands was sold at Christie's in July 2018 from the collection of the late Samuel Josefowitz for £2.2 million, setting a record for an Old Master print (passing the £410,000 paid for a print of Rembrandt's The Three Crosses in 2006). No impressions of the second to fourth states are held privately. Only minor changes were made in the next two states. The second state adds cross-hatched shading to the doorway to the left, and the third state adds similar shading to the right leg of the gesturing man on the left of the platform. The missing architecture to the top right is completed in the fourth state, with a balustrade added above the windows; at the same time, an inch (25 mm) was removed from the top of the print in this state, eliminating the architrave above the central building, allowing Rembrandt to print the whole composition on just a single sheet of paper: the first three impressions needed a thin strip of paper to be added along the top. By the fifth state, several dozen impressions have been made and the soft copper plate was showing signs of wear, and some shading is added to the windows to the right. The wear was countered in the sixth state by significant reworking in some areas, including removing the crowd of figures in front of the central platform: only two impressions are known of this version. By the seventh state, two arches have been added to the front wall of the platform. Rembrandt signed and dated the seventh version, and then added more changes to the eighth and last version. It is unclear why Rembrandt decided to print intermediate versions of the print, and indeed why they were printed on expensive imported paper. Usual practice was to take impression at each stage while the engraving developed on cheap paper which could be discarded, and then make several impressions of the completed version for sale. Only the last two states are signed and dated above the archway to the right of the central platform (\\"Rembrandt f. 1655\\"), suggesting he may have regarded the others as only intermediate stages or artist's proofs. However, Rembrandt may have been motivated by a commercial desire to sell rare limited editions to collectors. Arnold Houbraken noted in 1718 that Rembrandt would make small changes so he could sell prints as new designs.

Established in 1946, it included music, ballet, dramatic arts, painting and sculpting classes. Today it offers integrated studies of general classes and arts,music,sculpture classes. Most Albanian professional artists are alumni of the school.  History  The Artistic Lyceum was established in 1946 and was given the name of World War II People's Hero Jordan Misja, who had been a painter. For several decades it was the only artistic high school in Albania. It used to have five departments: Theoretical, Canto, Dramatic Arts, Choreography, and Figurative Arts (with several specialties). In 1973, following a speech from March by Enver Hoxha, then Albania's communist dictator, Agron Dushku, a delegate of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, reported to the Central Committee that the Lyceum had a low level of communist behavior and that there was indifference to the Party's big-character posters placed at the school. He also reported that Albanian folk music was not taught at the school, that there was heavy absenteeism, and that most of the communists at the school were in administrative rather than teaching positions. In 1990-1991 many protests, which ended up with the fall of communism in Albania, occurred in front of the building of the Lyceum. On December 9, 1990, one of the first anticommunist protests in Tirana, several thousand students began marching at Student City and ended right in front of the Lyceum. There, the police suppressed the protest with batons. On February 15, 1991, the students made it further past the Artistic Lyceum building, and were headed to the Blloku quarters where the nomenclature lived, but they were water hosed by police and had to disperse at the Enver Hoxha Museum and along the main boulevard, thereby not being able to reach their goal of the Blloku quarters.Abrahams, Fred C. (2016), pp. 81ff. As of 2014 the building housing the school was in a dire state and the school museum with its history of famous alumni no longer existed. In 2016 the building underwent a full reconstruction, whose inauguration was attended by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. In 2017 a public tender on a new concert hall, named after composer Tonin Harapi, was announced. The new hall will be adjacent to the existing school building. On December 7, 2017, students and professors of the school performed in a classical music concert at the Resurrection Cathedral in Tirana.  Teachers and alumni The school gives recognition to several renowned artists who were teachers at the school, including sculptors Odhise Paskali, Janaq Paço, Kristina Hoshi, (first Albanian woman sculptor), and Andrea Mano; painters Foto Stamo, Abdurrahim Buza, Kel Kodheli, Sadik Kaceli, Nexhmedin Zajmi, and Guri Madhi; dramatic arts teachers Mihal Popi, Zina Andri (Pano), Naim Frashëri, and Kadri Roshi; composers Çesk Zadeja, Tish Daija, Avni Mula, Kozma Laro, Feim Ibrahimi, and Simon Gjoni; orchestra directors Mustafa Krantja and Rifat Teqja; violinist Ludovik Naraçi; vocalists Marie Kraja, Nina Mula, Gjoni Thanasi, Jorgjie Truja, and Shpresa Nishani; musicologist Ramadan Sokoli; and choreographers Perkunji (Russian), Panajot Kanaçi, Xhemil Simitçiu, Ganimete Vendresha, Zoica Haxho, Agron Aliaj, and Petrit Vorpsi. The first director of the school was composer Konstandin Trako. Most Albanian professional artists are alumni of the Jordan Misja Lyceum. Alumni have worked for the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble, the National Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Albania, and the University of Arts, and have created works in all major genres. Many have successfully performed abroad as well. The most well known alumni include painters and sculptors Vilson Kilica, Kristaq Rama, Shaban Hadëri, Hektor Dule, Thoma Thomai, Mumtaz Dhrami, Ksenofon Dilo, Sali Shijaku, Fuat Dushku, Danish Jukniu, Thanas Papa, and Naxhi Bakalli; theatre and movie actors Kristaq Dhamo, Tinka Kurti, Ismail Hoxha, Hysen Hakani, Tomi Mato, Kujtim Spahivogli, and Mihallaq Luarasi; composer Nikolla Zoraqi; orchestra directors Milto Vako, Suzana Turku, and Ermir Krantja; tenors Gaqo Çako and Kristaq Paspali; pianist Margarita Kristidhi; violinists Rajmonda Koço, Bujar Sykja, Gjovalin Lazri, Nasho Paspali, and Rudina Banja; musicologists Hamide Stringa and Zana Shuteriqi; and ballerinas Ajshe Vaso, Nermin Strazimiri, and Keti Trajani.

His book, The Mountains of Snowdonia in Art was published by Gwasg Carreg Gwalch in 2015.  Early life and education  Peter Bishop was educated at Sibford School in Oxfordshire from 1964 to 1970. He did a two-year foundation course in art and design at Banbury and Bicester College from 1970 to 1972, then studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1972 to 1975 under Professor William Coldstream’s tenure. Tutors included Bernard Cohen and Rita Donagh. His degree show included Alpine landscape and pen and ink drawings of mountains, influenced by the writings and visual examples of John Ruskin. Later the same year he held his first solo exhibition of Alpine paintings at the Amwell Gallery, London. From 1976 to 1977 he studied art education at the Institute of Education, University of London. In 1983 he moved to live near Ludlow in south Shropshire. From 1985 to 2003 he was a lecturer in fine art at Shrewsbury College of Arts and Technology. He was also a visiting lecturer in art history at Birmingham University and a visiting tutor in painting at the University of Wolverhampton School of Art. In 1995 he obtained an MA with distinction in the history of art from the Birmingham Institute of Art and Design. In 1996 he returned to the Slade to study fine art on the PhD programme, whose tutors included Bernard Cohen (fine art) and David Bindman (history of art). After two years at the Slade he transferred to Aberystwyth University School of Art where he was supervised by Professor Alistair Crawford, obtaining his PhD in 2001.  Artistic career  The Alpine series of paintings continued until 1987, supplemented by landscape views of the high hills of Shropshire and the Malvern Hills. After a solo exhibition at the Hereford Museum and Art Gallery in 1987 the artist decided to concentrate on the mountains of Snowdonia as his main subject. Also in 1987 he joined the Kilvert Gallery in Clyro near Hay on Wye, at the invitation of its director Elizabeth Organ. The gallery represented the artist until it closed in 2009. Peter Bishop has been invited to participate in many group exhibitions including London's Royal Academy of Arts Summer Shows and has held ten solo exhibitions, the most recent at MOMA Wales in 2012. His work is in public and private collections. In an Arts Review, Anthony Vettise wrote 'What is very striking is the searching quality of this artist's working process, one senses the struggle to find solutions through trial and error, the building of marks and colour and the reworking of ideas. Ultimately he searches for pictorial equivalents of personal experience of his chosen landscape. The experience is romantic in its vision of grandeur of space and immensity of nature.' In 2016 the artist co-curated the exhibition ‘In Snowdonia’ at Storiel, Bangor. In October 2016 he was invited to give the annual Thomas Pennant Society lecture at Holywell. He is also an invited speaker and consultant on art in Snowdonia to various audiences. In March 2018 he became the Honorary President of the Ludlow Art Society.

History The railway link between Rome and Fiumicino was officially opened on 6 May 1878, when a branch of the Livorno–Rome railway (also called the ferrovia Tirrenica—\\"Tyrrhenian Railway\\"), which was completed in 1859. It ran from Ponte Galeria station to Fiumicino, where a station was located for passenger traffic and there was a connection for freight traffic to the river port, ending at Fiumicino Porto Canale goods yard. Electrification with overhead line at 3000 V DC was activated on 14 November 1938. Goods traffic began to decline from the 1960s, due to the decline of the Fiumicino river port. In 1990, rail traffic ended on the link to the river port, but it was another ten years before it was closed. However, the line began to assume a certain importance for passenger traffic with the opening of Fiumicino Airport. A study was carried out in September 1960 into the possible doubling of the line and the building of a branch from Porto station running directly to the airport. The project was initially shelved, but it was resumed in the mid- eighties. A variation was built that branches off a few metres before the entry to Porto station, running entirely on a viaduct to a station called Fiumicino Aeroporto. The new line was opened on 27 May 1990. At the same time, the former Porto station was closed; it had already lost its services because of its lack of patronage as it was too far from the airport. Direct Rome–Airport services were established (currently known as the Leonardo Express), initially operating from Roma Ostiense station. Later services were extended to Roma Termini station. With the establishment of these services, the freight trains on the Livorno–Rome railway were diverted to run on the Roma Trastevere–Roma San Pietro–Maccarese route. In 1994, the FR1 suburban services operated to/from Fara Sabina, with four services an hour to Fiumicino Airport and one to Fiumicino Città. On 30 January 2000. the Porto junction–Fiumicino Città services were abolished. After a few years of neglect, the railway infrastructure was removed and dismantled from 2007 as part of a redevelopment plan aimed at building a new district, including the new headquarters of the municipality of Fiumicino.  Route Departing from Roma Termini, the railway reaches Roma Trastevere station where it leaves the completed part of the ring railway, with a curve to the left. Subsequently the line touches the Tiber for a few metres and then runs through the Magliana district, where the stations of Villa Bonelli (opened in 1999) and Magliana are located. At this point the railway runs next to the Via della Magliana (passing through Muratella station), passes under the Grande Raccordo Anulare and runs between the Via della Magliana and the A91 motorway. At Ponte Galeria, the line reaches the station of the same name, where a line branches off to Fiumicino and Pisa. Turning left, the line passes under the A91; Fiera di Roma station is located a few metres past the flyover. The line subsequently continues parallel with the motorway (with a stop in the district of Parco Leonardo) to the airport, where, until 2001 there was an operating point called Porto junction where the line branched to Fiumicino Airport station and to Fiumicino station. The Airport branch continues on a viaduct for a few kilometres to the first floor of the international airport building, where the station is located. The old branch continued straight through the town of Porto (where Porto station was located), passing under the SS 296 road and reached Fiumicino at Coccia di Morto, where the only level crossing on the line was located. Fiumicino station, which had three tracks, one of which was used for goods traffic, was located at the end of Via Portuensis. This goods track crossed the Via degli Orti and passed, with a curve to the left, to the right bank of the navigable canal where Fiumicino Porto Canale goods yard was located.

The CPLEAR experiment used the antiproton beam of the LEAR facility - Low-Energy Antiproton Ring which operated at CERN from 1982 to 1996 - to produce neutral kaons through proton- antiproton annihilation in order to study CP, T and CPT violation in the neutral kaon system. Background According to the theory of the Big Bang, matter and antimatter would have existed in the same amount at the beginning of the Universe. If this was true, particles and antiparticles would have annihilated each other, creating photons, and thus the Universe would have been only compounded by light (one particle of matter for 1018 photons). However, only matter has remained and at a rate of one billion times more particles than expected. What happened then, for the antimatter to disappear in favor of matter? A possible answer to this question is baryogenesis, the hypothetical physical process that took place during the early universe that produced baryonic asymmetry, i.e. the imbalance of matter (baryons) and antimatter (antibaryons) in the observed universe. However, baryogenesis is only possible under following conditions proposed by Andrei Sakharov in 1967: * Baryon number B violation. * C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation. * Interactions out of thermal equilibrium. The first experimental test of CP violation came in 1964 with the Fitch-Cronin experiment. The experiment involved particles called neutral K-mesons, which fortuitously have the properties needed to test CP. First, as mesons, they're a combination of a quark and an anti-quark, in this case, down and antistrange, or anti-down and strange. Second, the two different particles have different CP values and different decay modes: K1 has CP = +1 and decays into two pions; K2 has CP = -1 and decays into three. Because decays with larger changes in mass occur more readily, the K1 decay happens 100 times faster than the K2 decay. This means that a sufficiently long beam of neutral Kaons will become arbitrarily pure K2 after a sufficient amount of time. The Fitch-Cronin experiment exploits this. If all the K1s are allowed to decay out of a beam of mixed Kaons, only K2 decays should be observed. If any K1 decays are found, it means that a K2 flipped to a K1, and the CP for the particles flipped from -1 to +1, and CP wasn't conserved. The experiment resulted in an excess of 45±9 events around cos(θ) = 1 in the correct mass range for 2-pion decays. This means that for every decay of K2 into three pions, there are (2.0±0.4)×10-3 decays into two pions. Because of this, neutral K mesons violate CP. The study of the ratio of neutral kaon and neutral anti-kaons production is thus an efficient tool to understand what happened in the early Universe that promoted the production of matter.  The experiment  CPLEAR is a collaboration of about 100 scientists, coming from 17 institutions from 9 different countries. Accepted in 1985, the experiment took data from 1990 until 1996. Its main aim was to study CP, T and 'CPT symmetries in the neutral kaon system. In addition, CPLEAR performed measurements about quantum coherence of wave functions, Bose-Einstein correlations in multi-pion states, regeneration of the short-lived kaon component in the matter, the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky paradox using entangled neutral-kaon pair states and the equivalence principle of general relativity. = Facility description = A scheme of the CPLEAR detector. The CPLEAR detector was able to determine the locations, the momenta and the charges of the tracks at the production of the neutral kaon and at its decay, thus visualizing the complete event. Strangeness is not conserved under weak interactions, meaning that under weak interactions a can transform into a and vice versa. To study the asymmetries between and decay rates in the various final states f (f = π+π−, π0π0, π+π−π0, π0π0π+, πlν), the CPLEAR collaboration used the fact that the strangeness of kaons is tagged by the charge of the accompanying kaon. Time-reversal invariance would imply that all details of one of the transformations could be deductible from the other one, i.e. the probability for a kaon to oscillate into an anti-kaon would be equal to the one for the reverse process. The measurement of these probabilities required the knowledge of the strangeness of a kaon at two different times of its life. Since the strangeness of the kaon is given by the charge of the accompanying kaon, and thus be known for each event, it was observed that this symmetry was not respected, thereby proving the T violation in neutral kaon systems under weak interaction. The neutral kaons are initially produced in the annihilation channels * p → π+ * p → π− which happen when the 106 anti- protons per second beam coming from the LEAR facility is stopped by a highly- pressurized hydrogen gas target. The low momentum of the antiprotons and the high pressure allowed to keep the size of the stopping region small in the detector. Since the proton-antiproton reaction happens at rest, the particles are produced isotropically, and as a consequence, the detector has to have a near-4π symmetry. The whole detector was embedded in a 3.6 m long and 2 m diameter warm solenoidal magnet providing a 0.44 T uniform magnetic field. The antiprotons stopped using pressurized hydrogen gas target. The hydrogen gas target used instead of liquid hydrogen to minimize the amount of matter in the decay volume. The target initially had a radius of 7 cm and subjected to a pressure of 16 bar. Changed in 1994, its radius became equal to 1.1 cm, under a 27 bar pressure. = Layout of the detector = upright=1.8 The detector had to fulfill the specific requirements of the experiment and thus had to be able to: * do an efficient kaon identification * select the annihilation channels mentioned in Facility description among the very large number of multi-pions annihilation channels * distinguish between the different neutral-kaon decay channels * measure the decay proper time * acquire a large number of statistics, and for this, it had to have both a high rate capability and a large geometrical coverage Cylindrical tracking detectors together with a solenoid field were used to determine the charge signs, momenta and positions of the charged particles. They were followed by the particle identification detector (PID) whose role was to identify the charged kaon. It was compounded by a Cherenkov detector, which carried out the kaon-pion separation; and scintillators, measuring the energy loss and the time of flight of the charged particles. It was also used for the electron-pion separation. The detection of photons produced in π0 decays was performed by ECAL, an outermost lead/gas sampling calorimeter, complementary to the PID by separating pions and electrons at higher momenta. Finally, hardwired processors (HWK) were used to analyze and select the events in a few microseconds, deleting the unwanted ones, by providing a full event reconstruction with sufficient precision.

Kunz (June 11, 1938 – April 13, 2020) was an American biologist specializing in the study of bats. He was credited with coining the study of aeroecology; additionally, he wrote several fundamental textbooks and publications on bat ecology. Early life Kunz grew up in Missouri. He credited his interest in biology to his fifth-grade teacher, who was passionate about silkworms. Education Kunz received a BA in biology in 1961 and MA in education in 1962 from the University of Central Missouri. He went on to receive another MA from Drake University in biology in 1968, and gained his PhD from the University of Kansas in systematics and ecology in 1971. Career Kunz taught high school in Kansas after receiving his MA in education. Kunz states that his first experience working with bats was before he attended Drake University. While caving, he and a friend encountered a banded bat. He called in the number on the band and later would collaborate with the professor who banded the bat. Kunz became a professor at Boston University in 1971. Kunz edited or coedited six books on the biology and ecology of bats. His book Ecological and Behavioral Methods for the Study of Bats \\"is widely praised as one of the best resources available for professional bat researchers, educators and conservationists.\\" He also helped establish the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador in 1995 to promote the study of rainforest ecology. He helped distinguish the new scientific discipline of aeroecology, which integrates geography, ecology, atmospheric science, and computational biology. A key concept of aeroecology is thinking of the aerosphere as part of the biosphere, as many organisms depend upon the aerosphere for resources. He conducted research on the ecosystem services of bats in a study published in Science, concluding that their services are worth $3-54 billion per year. He retired in 2011 after being seriously injured in an accident.M. Brock Fenton, Sharon Swartz (2020): Thomas H. Kunz (1938–2020).

He was the top-rated British-trained two-year- old of 2017, when he won three races including the Royal Lodge Stakes and suffered his only defeat when narrowly beaten by Saxon Warrior in the Racing Post Trophy. In the following year he won the Dante Stakes, the Eclipse Stakes, International Stakes, Irish Champion Stakes and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes as well as running third in the Craven Stakes, fifth in the 2000 Guineas and third in the Epsom Derby. He was euthanised following horse colic in 2019 at the age of four. Background Roaring Lion was a grey colt bred in Kentucky by RanJan Racing Inc. As a yearling he was offered for sale at Keeneland in September 2016 and bought for $160,000 by the bloodstock agent David Redvers. He subsequently entered the ownership of Qatar Racing and was exported to England where he was sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was ridden in all but one of his races by Oisin Murphy He was sired by Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey's stallion Kitten's Joy the U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse of 2004 whose other offspring include Stephanie's Kitten, Hawkbill, Bobby's Kitten and Big Blue Kitten. Roaring Lion was the first foal of his dam Vionnet, who won three minor races in the United States and finished third in the Rodeo Drive Stakes. As a descendant of the Irish broodmare Miss Albany (foaled 1938) she was distantly related to Flash of Steel and Rosdhu Queen. Racing career =2017: two-year-old season= Roaring Lion made his debut in a minor race over one mile at Newmarket's July Course on 18 August in which he was ridden by Harry Bentley and started at odds of 7/2 in a ten-runner field. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and won \\"quite comfortably\\" by one and three quarter lengths from the 25/1 outsider Abandon Ship. Three weeks later, on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse, the colt started 4/5 favourite for a similar event despite carrying a six pound weight penalty. He took the lead two furlongs out and despite hanging to the left he pulled away from his rivals to win \\"very readily\\" by six lengths. For his next race, Roaring Lion was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Royal Lodge Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket and started 11/4 second choice in the betting behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Nelson, the winner of the Juvenile Stakes. The only one of the other three runners to be given any chance was Mildenberger, who had won the Stonehenge Stakes and finished third in the Vintage Stakes. Roaring Lion took the lead from the front-running Mildenberger approaching the final furlong and held off a challenge from Nelson to win by a neck. When aked if the colt might be a contender for the following year's Epsom Derby Murphy replied \\"I haven't ridden a Derby horse in a while, so I'm not sure if he is one or not. But he certainly has a big future\\". On his final appearance of the season Roaring Lion was moved up again in class for the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 28 October. Starting at odds of 8/1 he was restrained by Murphy in the early stages before moving up to take the lead in the final furlong. He stayed on well despite hanging to the left but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by Saxon Warrior. In the official European Classification for 2017, Roaring Lion was rated the third-best two-year-old of the season behind the Irish-trained colts U S Navy Flag and Saxon Warrior. =2018: three-year-old season= Spring Roaring Lion began his second season by starting odds-on favourite for the Craven Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over the Rowley Mile on 19 April. He proved no match for Masar, who won by nine lengths and lost second place on the line to the 16/1 outsider White Mocha. In the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance sixteen days later he started a 14/1 outsider and came home fifth behind Saxon Warrior, Tip Two Win, Masar and Elarqam, beaten two and a half lengths by the winner. On 17 May the colt started 3/1 favourite for the Dante Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse against eight opponents including Mildenberger, White Mocha, Crossed Baton (Blue Riband Trial Stakes) and Wells Farhh Go (Acomb Stakes). He took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and accelerated away from the field to win \\"readily\\" by four and a half lengths. After the race his trainer John Gosden said \\"I’d have been disappointed if he hadn’t won like this, he’s been training beautifully at home and he’s woken up since the Guineas. He’s mentally in the zone, and I expected a big performance\\". Summer On 3 June 2018 Roaring Lion was one of twelve colts to contest the 239th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse and started the 6/1 second favourite behind Saxon Warrior. After racing towards the rear and turning into the straight in ninth place he moved up to challenge the leaders approaching the final furlong and finished third behind Masar and Dee Ex Bee. Gosden later explained \\"He was out on his feet in the last 150 yards... it was like a 1,500 metre runner going in a marathon\\". The Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 7 July saw Roaring Lion matched against older horses in a seven-runner field which included Saxon Warrior, Happily, Hawkbill and Cliffs of Moher. After being restrained by Murphy in fifth place, Roaring Lion moved up on the outside in the straight and in the closing stages he engaged in a sustained struggle with Saxon Warrior. He crossed the line a neck in front but appeared to have slightly hampered his rival when hanging to the right in the finals strides. The racecourse stewards held an immediate inquiry, but allowed the result to stand. After the race Murphy, who received four-day suspension for \\"careless riding\\" on the winner, commented \\"I was on the best horse in the race, that’s the bottom line\\". At York in August Roaring Lion started at 3/1 when he faced Saxon Warrior yet again in the International Stakes in an eight runner field which also included the Group 1 winners Poet's Word (the 8/5 favourite), Thunder Snow, Benbatl (Dubai Turf), Latrobe (Irish Derby) and Without Parole (St James's Palace Stakes). After tracking the leaders on the inside rail he gained valuable racing room when the field tracked right to race up the stands-side in the straight. He went to the front inside the last quarter mile, drew clear of his rivals and won by three and a quarter lengths from Poet's Word, with third place going to the 50/1 outsider Thundering Blue. Gosden said \\"I had a difficult spring with him and he wasn't enjoying it, but he's been getting better and better and this wasn't a fluke. He wasn't really with me at the time of the Craven and the Guineas but the Guineas put him right. He's a proper horse with a massive middle on him and he’s got stronger as the year’s gone on... the curve is upward all the way.\\" Autumn Roaring Lion at the 2018 Breeders' Cup The Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 15 September saw Roaring Lion start the 8/11 favourite ahead of his old rival Saxon Warrior in their sixth meeting. The other five runners were Rhododendron, Study of Man (Prix du Jockey Club), Verbal Dexterity (National Stakes), Deauville (Belmont Derby) and Athena (Belmont Oaks). Murphy held the colt up towards the rear before switching to the outside to make his challenge in the last quarter mile by which point Saxon Warrior had established a clear advantage. Roaring Lion produced a strong late run, caught Saxon Warrior in the final strides and won by a neck. Oisin Murphy, who had very little prior experience of top-class race-riding in Ireland said \\"Once he got rolling I was always going to get there but I had to really get after him. I haven’t much experience around Leopardstown. I was learning on the job. But I was on an exceptional horse\\". Roaring Lion was aimed at one of the major races on British Champions' Day at Ascot on 20 October with his connections eventually opting drop the colt back in distance for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile rather than contest the Champion Stakes. He started the 2/1 favourite ahead of Recoletos (Prix du Moulin) and Laurens while the other ten runners included Addeybb (Sandown Mile), Lord Glitters (Strensall Stakes), Lightning Spear (Sussex Stakes) and Romanised (Irish 2000 Guineas). Racing on soft ground he settled in mid-division as Hay Gaman set the pace Roaring Lion began to make progress down the centre of the track in the last quarter mile, he gained the advantage from the outsider Century Dream inside the final furlong and held off the challenge of the Irish filly I Can Fly to win by a neck. Gosden said \\"He has proven his class and his guts to get there, but I think he was hating every second of running on that ground. You could see from his action and the way he was carrying himself. I would not work him on that ground\\". After the race it was announced that the colt would be retired to his owner's Tweenhills Stud in Gloucestershire at the end of the year. For his final race, Roaring Lion was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Classic on dirt at Churchill Downs on 3 November and started the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting. After racing in mid-division he dropped out of contention in the last half mile and finished tailed-off last of the fourteen runners. At the 2018 Cartier Awards, Roaring Lion was named Champion Three-year-old Colt and European Horse of the Year. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Roaring Lion was rated the best three-year-old in the world and the fourth best horse of any age or sex. Stud career and demise Roaring Lion began his career as a stallion at Tweenhills Stud in Gloucestershire in 2019. His stud fee for his first season was announced in November 2018 as £40,000. In 2019, having covered 133 mares in Europe, he was shuttled to the Cambridge Stud in New Zealand for the southern hemisphere breeding season. In early August, shortly after leaving quarantine, Roaring Lion became seriously ill with horse colic and underwent surgery twice to remove sections of his small intestine. On 23 August he was found to be suffering from another bout of colic and was euthanised at the Cambridge Equine hospital.

It contains the Hochschloss (\\"High Palace\\"), built between 1530 and 1572, which is one of the best-preserved Renaissance palaces in Hesse. In the 1700s, the palace was expanded by John Ernst, Count of Nassau-Weilburg, and his builder, . The buildings and gardens now belong to the Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser und Gärten Hessen, and they can be visited as a museum on guided tours. Parts of the palace are venues for the music festival Weilburger Schlosskonzerte, which is named after the palace.  History  = Renaissance palace = The 1359 Gothic castle was demolished to make way for the Renaissance buildings. The Renaissance buildings are now called the Hochschloss (high palace). They form a square around a central courtyard (Renaissancehof). Construction was begun by Philip III, Count of Nassau-Weilburg. The east wing (also called the Neuer Bau or \\"New Building\\") was built first, by architect Nikolaus Schickedanz, from about 1530 to 1539. It incorporates some pieces of the old Gothic castle. The west and south wings were built from 1540 to 1545 by architect Balthasar Wolf. The west wing was formerly the stables but became the kitchens in the 1700s. The north wing was built last, from 1560 to 1572, by architect Ludwig Kempf. It has \\"Dutch\\"-style dormers and a \\"Venetian\\"-style arcade of Ionic twinned columns. Some alterations were made in 1661, including half-timbered dormers and an additional gate.

The new church was built from 1707 to 1713 and cost over 32,000 guilders. It served the county, the town and the court. The Schlosskirche is regarded as one of Germany's most notable Protestant Baroque church buildings, along with St. Michaelis in Hamburg and the Dresden Frauenkirche.  Gardens  Part of the gardens The Renaissance gardens covered . When the palace was transformed to a Baroque residential palace, the gardens were redesigned and substantially extended with seven terraces, so that they covered . Parts of the garden were created by Francois LeMarie from 1701.Schlossgarten world-qr.com Later notable gardeners included the brothers Johann Wilhelm Sckell and Johann Friedrich Sckell. The gardens are decorated with fountains and sculptures.  Water supply  Diagram of the Baroque water supply system The fountains, gardens, and baths of the Baroque palace required an abundant water supply, and a new system had to be built. The Baroque water supply system gathered water from a large number of springs, then carried it down, over the Lahn river, and up to the town and castle. The system supplied water until the end of the 1800s, when it had to be abandoned due to lack of maintenance. It is now being researched and restored. The waterpipes were originally carried over the Lahn by the Rothe Brücke. In 1784, high water and ice jamming destroyed this bridge, and in 1785-1786 it was replaced by the Kettenbrucke (\\"Chain Bridge\\"), which remained in service until 1934.  Northern buildings  At the north end, Viehhof was heavily redeveloped, with the building of the Marstall (formal stables), the Prinzessenbau, and the Kabinettbau. The Reithalle (\\"riding hall\\") was built from 1705 to 1708, and the Heuscheuer (haybarn) from 1743 to 1746. The Prinzessenbau and Marstall are now the Schlosshotel (\\"Castle Hotel\\") and the Kabinettsbau and Reitbahn are now the Stadthalle (city event space). = Later use = In the 18th century, plans for major changes were made but not realised; therefore, the Baroque palace has been preserved. The interior was renovated in Empire Style from 1801 to 1816. In 1935, the palace was sold to the Prussian state. Its administration of state palaces and gardens installed a museum from 1936 to 1942. After World War II, it was managed by the Hessian administration, , which is responsible for the preservation of the buildings and the gardens. There are guided tours. Several areas are venues of the Weilburger Schlosskonzerte music festival, which is held annually in the summer: the Renaissancehof, Alte Hofstube, Untere Orangerie, Obere Orangerie and the Stadthalle in the former riding hall.Spielstätten Weilburger Schlosskonzerte  See also  * Baroque architecture * French formal garden  Literature  Interior of the Schlosskirche * : Mittel- und Südhessen: Lahntal, Taunus, Rheingau, Wetterau, Frankfurt und Maintal, Kinzig, Vogelsberg, Rhön, Bergstraße und Odenwald.

The specific epithet basiramea means \\"branching from base\\". Description Aristida basiramea is an annual grass and freely branches from the base, reaching in height. The wiry culms are sparingly branched. The narrow leaves of the grass are flat and become involute towards their tip. The panicles are borne in the basal sheathes. The glabrous glumes at the base of the spikelets gradually taper to a point, averaging from in length. The glumes have a single vein and are unequal in length. The lemma, excluding the awns, is approximately long. The delicate lateral awns are in length and can be erect or spreading. The middle awn is much longer and stouter, being long, and loosely spirals when dry. The spikelets are light brown when mature. The seeds are chestnut brown and long. The grass flowers from August to October. Habitat and distribution Aristida basiramea is endemic to North America, particularly the midwest, though outliers in distribution include as far south as Texas and as far east as Maine. The grass is rare in Canada, only found in southern Ontario and Quebec. The grass is not found any farther north than the upper peninsula of Michigan. The species grows in weedy conditions such as roadsides or pastures and will often grow in pine barrens. In Canada the grass can be found occasionally in open and dry sand ridges or dunes. It prefers dry or sandy soil and warm climates, though it is the hardiest member of its genus. Ecology Despite being a poor forage grass as well as being harmful to grazing animals due to its calli, Aristida basiramea is an important source of forage in springtime, especially in its western distribution. Small mammals and quail will eat the hardy seeds. Conservation In Canada, Aristida basiramea is threatened by the decline and fragmentation of its sandy habitat. Prevention of fire in particular endangers the habitat of the species, as fire no longer maintains natural succession of the sand ridges. The greater competition arising from lack of wildfires in particular threatens the species. The glossy buckthorn, the spotted knapweed, and the white sweet clover are all invasive species which threaten the grass.

Margaret is best known for the lengthy legal battle she fought to regain co-ownership of The Theatre following her husband's death. The documents produced during this dispute provide a large quantity of information about the appearance and management of early modern playhouses as well as the area and contemporary inhabitants of Shoreditch. Marriage and family Little is known about Margaret's life before her marriage to grocer John Brayne on 14 January 1565, other than that her maiden name was Margaret Stowers and that she belonged to the parish of St Dionis Backchurch. Margaret and John had had four children by 1573: Robert (b. 1565), Roger (b. 1566), Rebecca (b. 1568), and John (b. 1573). All four children were baptised at St Stephen Walbrook (Bucklersbury) but soon died – at least three of them in infancy. Margaret had a fifth child (Katherine, d. 1593) after her husband's death in 1586. She insisted that the child's father was John Brayne, but was accused of adultery by her enemies. The Theatre In 1576, John Brayne partnered with James Burbage to build a public playhouse on the site of the dissolved priory of Holywell in Shoreditch. With no written agreement, Brayne agreed to supply most of the funds needed to erect the building on the understanding that Burbage was to have the lease put into both their names. The cost of the building project quickly escalated: Brayne and Burbage originally planned to spend around £200, but actually spent about £700. Margaret and John took the places of two manual labourers to reduce the cost of construction.Herbert Berry, The First Public Playhouse (Canada: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1979), p. 35, In 1586, around a decade after The Theatre opened for business, Margaret is recorded as being a ‘gatherer’ – a person who stood at one of the playhouse's entry points and collected money from entering playgoers.Herbert Berry, The First Public Playhouse (Canada: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1979), p. 36. Legal disputes John and Margaret Brayne were bankrupted as a result of the financial difficulties caused by the Theatre construction project and a later unfortunate investment (The George inn in Whitechapel). Burbage never added John Brayne's name to the playhouse lease, and the partners quarrelled. John Brayne died in 1586 while the dispute was unresolved. The Burbages continued to share the playhouse profits with Margaret Brayne for a time, but stopped in 1589. Margaret believed that Robert Miles – a friend and business partner of John Brayne – was responsible for her husband's death. Margaret pursued Miles at court for murder and sued him for a share in The George (the establishment which John Brayne and Miles had invested in together). Margaret evidently then gave birth to Katherine, and became close friends with Miles. The Burbages believed that Miles was Katherine Brayne's father and that he and Margaret had conspired to kill John Brayne. In 1588, supported financially by Miles, Margaret Brayne tried to reclaim the money that she and John Brayne had lost to the playhouse scheme. Margaret and Miles began trying in a court of common law to collect the value of two bonds that Burbage had given Brayne or, alternatively, to gain ownership of half of The Theatre and so collect half of its profits.Herbert Berry, The First Public Playhouse (Canada: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1979), p. 117. In 1588, Burbage sued Margaret and the creditors to get the bonds cancelled and to prevent any claims on The Theatre. Margaret soon counter-sued. These two lawsuits continued unresolved for seven years, by which time Margaret had died and Miles was continuing with the case alone. The dispute was never resolved: Miles did not collect the value of the bonds, and James Burbage died in 1597. Death and legacy Margaret died of the plague in 1593, and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Matfelon on 13 April 1593. Margaret's will names Miles as her heir; she left Miles her goods, her lawsuits, and also entrusted her daughter to his care (Katherine Brayne). Katherine also died of the plague three months after Margaret, and was buried in the same churchyard on 23 July. The numerous documents produced during the lengthy legal battle fought by Margaret Brayne and Robert Miles have been closely studied by scholars for more than 160 years.Herbert Berry, The First Public Playhouse (Canada: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1979), p.97. Now held at The National Archives in London, these documents feature a huge quantity of information about the early modern playing industry and the wider culture of the period.

He made 16 appearances in the Scottish League for Dundee and 382 in the English Football League for Brighton & Hove Albion. Life and career Farrell was born in Dundee. He began his football career with junior club Dundee North End before joining Dundee in 1926. According to the Dundee Courier, he was a \\"tall, well-built lad\\" who could \\"fill any position in the forward line, having played in junior circles on the right and left wings with equal success.\\" He made four Division One appearances in his first season and twelve in his second, and but was given a free transfer at the end of the 1927–28 season. Reports of his joining Dundee United proved premature, a trial with English First Division club Portsmouth came to nothing, and in September 1928, Farrell signed for another English club, Brighton & Hove Albion of the Third Division South. Farrell soon established himself at outside right in Brighton's first team, and continued in place for most of the next ten years. Stan Hurst took over the position during the 1938–39 season, and Farrell retired at the end of that campaign. For much of the 1930s, he had spent his summers as twelfth man and baggage master for Sussex County Cricket Club. He became landlord of a local pub, served in the RAF during the Second World War, and was still in the licensed trade at the time of his death in 1971 at the age of 65.

As a preprint server, EarthArXiv publishes articles from all subdomains of Earth Science and related domains of planetary science. These publications are versions of scholarly papers that precede publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. EarthArXiv is not itself a journal and does not evaluate the scientific quality of a paper. Instead, EarthArXiv serves as a platform for free hosting and rapid dissemination of scientific results. The EarthArXiv platform assigns each submission a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), therefore assigning provenance and making it citable in other scholarly works. EarthArXiv's mission is to promote open access, share open access and preprint resources, and participate in shared governance of the preprint server and its policies. EarthArXiv was launched on October 23, 2017.  History  The idea of an Earth Science-focused preprint service developed independently in the U.K and the U.S. in early-2017. Christopher Jackson, inspired by ArXiv, and preprints subsequent expansion into other fields (e.g. BioRxiv), began gathering European support for an Earth science preprint service. Jackson inquired with the Center for Open Science (COS), a U.S.-based non-profit about using their existing preprint infrastructure, which is based on the Open Science Framework (OSF), to host the service. COS was hosting (at the time) 20 domain specific preprint systems and was interested in expanding into the Earth sciences. COS would provide the technical infrastructure – storage space, DOI generation, web hosting, etc. - with a community of international Earth scientist volunteers providing shared governance. Around the same time, Bruce Caron and Tom Narock, having seen a COS demonstration at a meeting of the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP), also began discussing an Earth science themed preprint system with U.S. colleagues. COS put Caron and Narock in touch with Jackson in spring-2017, and a concerted effort was made to get the newly named EarthArXiv off the ground. The EarthArXiv principles resonated with ESIP, and they became a collaborating partner. ESIP supplied physical meeting space as well as multiple means of virtual communication to accelerate the effort. On June 1, 2017 the ESIP support coalesced into a formal working group, the Earth Sciences Pre-Print Cluster. The cluster held bi-weekly conference calls and hosted their first in-person meeting during a break-out session of the Summer 2017 ESIP Meeting in Bloomington, Indiana. The group spent six months community building, exploring other platforms (such as PLOS and PeerJ), and soliciting community feedback on how EarthArXiv should be constructed, and how it should operate. During this time, over 100 international volunteers came forward offering to promote and help run EarthArXiv. A final decision was made to partner with COS and on October 23, 2017 – the first day of Open Access Week 2017 – EarthArXiv began accepting preprints.Center For Open Science Press Release ESIP continues to support EarthArXiv; however, the Earth Sciences Pre-Print Cluster was disbanded and governance now maintained by the EarthArXiv Advisory Council. On October 1, 2020, EarthArXiv moved its hosting to the California Digital Library, and the Janeway preprint platform.CDL Press Release  Submission formats and moderation process  Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Associated files (data and software) can be uploaded at the time of submission and will be hosted alongside the paper. Currently, EarthArXiv has no limit on total upload size. Although, no single uploaded file can be larger than 1 GB. EarthArXiv is not a scientific journal and does not implement peer review. All submissions are accepted by default and then passed through a post-moderation policy. The moderation policy.EarthArXiv Moderation Policy checks for required information (author names, email addresses, etc.) and validates that the paper topic is within the scope of EarthArXiv. Papers deemed outside the scope of EarthArXiv are removed.  Logo and resources  EarthArXiv is intended to be a community-led resource. The Earth science community has participated in all aspects of development from governance to logo design. The EarthArXiv logo was developed as part of an open crowdsourcing campaignEarthArXiv Crowdsourced Logo Campaign in which logo designs were submitted by members of the earth science community. Voting was also open to the earth science community and Andrew Cross' logo was selected as the official logo of EarthArXiv. Many resources are shared by the community (talks, posters, frequently asked questions) via a GitHub companion website.EarthArXiv Community Contributed GitHub Resource Page  Governance  EarthArXiv uses Loomio for its on-line, asynchronous decision making. The EarthArXiv Loomio Group EarthArXiv Loomio Group is an open group that all interested persons can join. Decisions by the Advisory Council are made in a sub-group that is also open to view. The Advisory Council is selected for two-year terms through sortation for diversity, and a random selection from the list of those who have volunteered to serve. There is no nomination/election required.  Disciplines  EarthArXiv publishes pre- and postprints from all subdomains of Earth science and related domains of planetary science including geochemistry.

Robins Company's Dalkon Shield intrauterine device case, to biographies of public figures, including Hubert Humphrey and Martha Mitchell. History =Media and journalism= In 1967, Engelmayer was a features editor for The Jewish Press, an American weekly newspaper based in Brooklyn, New York. He then became an associate editor with the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA); at the age of 25, Engelmayer became the editor. United Features Syndicate (UFS) acquired and absorbed NANA, and from 1972 to 1979, Engelmayer edited under the banner of UFS. He became the first editor of Jack Anderson's \\"Washington Merry-Go- Round\\" column and was a part of Anderson's winning of the Pulitzer Prize. His own investigative work writing about the American natural gas shortage in the Seventies won him the Thomas L. Stokes Award for National Reporting, Washington Journalism Center. In the 1970s and 1980s, Engelmayer was almost a regular on the Barry Farber radio show, with Farber calling him \\"the big Shamm\\", referring to his Hebrew name, Shammai, which he began using professionally once he became a pulpit rabbi. In the early 1980s, Engelmayer replaced David Gross as the executive editor of the New York Jewish Week, a New York-based Jewish issues weekly newspaper. He left in 1991 and took a post as director of communications for the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, where he also renewed his rabbinical ordination, preparing him for his pulpit position. He was also briefly the editor of the MetroWest Jewish News from 1996-1998. In January 2007, Engelmayer established an award-winning column (\\"Keeping the Faith\\") for the New Jersey-based weekly newspaper The Jewish Standard, in which he discusses current issues through the prism of Jewish law. He was the editor of The Jewish Standard until he resigned in 2012. He continued his weekly column, but now had time to teach and run his synagogue, which has since merged with three other synagogues that were dwindling in numbers and looking for new leadership. In 1981, he and his frequent writing partner, Robert Wagman, NANA's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, produced a documentary called The Making of Lion of the Desert, a film about pre-WWII fascist Italy, starring Anthony Quinn, Oliver Reed, and Rod Steiger. =Rabbinate= Ordained as an Orthodox Jewish rabbi in 1967, he chose the field of journalism. In 1992, while working at the Jewish Theological Society he also enrolled in rabbinate courses and recertified his ordination through the Conservative Jewish movement. His first pulpit was the Lake Hopatcong Jewish Center in New Jersey. He would find a congregation closer to his home, Temple Israel in Cliffside Park, and merged with other neighboring congregations. =Personal life= Engelmayer was married to Roslyn Engelmayer, and then to the writer, Marilyn Henry, who died in 2011.

Biography Viviana Gorbato was born in Buenos Aires to an upper middle class Jewish family. When she was a teenager she created a magazine with her friends from high school, formed a theater group, and won a literary contest for a book of unpublished stories. She graduated as a professor of Literature at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA). She obtained a General Certificate of Education at the University of London. In her first years she worked as an advertising copywriter. She worked as a literature teacher until 1984. When journalist Jacobo Timerman (1923–1999) took over the management of the newspaper La Razón, she wrote asking him to allow her to work with him in his medium. Timerman hired her. After that, she worked as an editor at the weekly newspaper El Periodista de Buenos Aires, and published notes and contributions in the newspapers Clarín and Página/12. She was the creative director of the agency Johnson, Benton & Bowles. She taught on methods of journalistic research at the University of Belgrano and the UBA. In Fruta prohibida (2000) she explored the circles of homosexual encounters, and received praise and criticism; there were those who questioned the book, comparing it with \\"a walk through the zoo\\". To write La Argentina embrujada... el supermercadismo espiritual de los ricos y famosos (1996) she infiltrated the sect School of Yoga in Buenos Aires under the guise of writing a book in favor of its leader, Juan Percowich. The book dealt with mentalists and gurus and their influence on figures of politics and entertainment. It was temporarily banned by a judge at the request of a directive of a yoga school that appeared in photographs. When the book began to be sold throughout Argentina, Buenos Aires judge Luis Alberto Dupou banned the Atlántida publishing house from distributing it. Days later, Gorbato appeared on the program Almorzando con Mirtha Legrand, where she exposed the problem of destructive cults in Argentina. As a result of these statements, she later debated with – a follower of Sai Baba and promoter of sects in Argentina, like that of the pedophile Maestro Amor – on a talk show. Gorbato was a professor of Communication Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires. She directed a study on the influence of mass media on the formation of learning models in children. With a fellowship from the Chagas Foundation, she researched sexuality and power in Argentina. She was a professor of the subject Methods and Techniques of Journalistic Research at the University of Belgrano. Beginning in 2004, Gorbato hosted the program Generaciones en conflicto on Radio Cooperativa in Buenos Aires, along with journalists Bruno Gerondi and Gabriel Zicolillo. She was preparing an \\"unauthorized biography\\" of President Néstor Kirchner. On 10 May 2005 she suffered a \\"serious decompensation\\" in her apartment in downtown Buenos Aires. She was treated by paramedics from the (SAMU), but died after 9:00 am. On the same day, a newspaper claimed that she \\"had been carrying an illness\\" for some time.

On August 2, Nichols revealed the team name as the Enforcers and introduced the team's inaugural head coach as Brent Clarke, who had previously been the head coach of the Danville Dashers and Watertown Wolves. The Enforcers played their first game October 26, 2018, and played their first six games on the road with a 2–4 record. On November 16, the team played their first home game and set a league record with 4,310 announced attendance, beating the previous record set by the Williamsport Outlaws in 2012 of 3,447. The team continued to set single-season FHL attendance records, but also saw its share of controversies. On December 17, 2018, several Enforcers were arrested after getting into a bar fight, sending a man to the hospital, although the charges would later be dropped. On March 10, 2019, owner Nichols accosted a referee as the official was coming off the ice following the first period of a game against the Carolina Thunderbirds. The game was immediately cancelled by the officials, and subsequently led the FHL's officiating supervisor to resign and pull all referees from the FHL citing the need to protect his personnel. Nichols was issued the league-maximum fine of $25,000. The team, or someone using the Enforcers' name, posted a GoFundMe fundraiser for the fine, but was pulled down in about an hour. The team continued its inaugural season and finished second overall at the end of the regular season. They swept the third place Watertown Wolves in two game to set up a championship series against Carolina. The Enforcers lost the first game in Carolina 7–3. Game two went to overtime and the game-winning goal was scored by landing on the back of the outstretched Enforcers' goaltender Troy Passingham and fell across the goal line when he went to get back up. The Enforcers heavily contested the call, with team-leading scorer Ahmed Mahfouz verbally confronting the officials and leading to a physical altercation between head coach Brent Clarke and a linesman. Mahfouz then broke his stick over the goalpost and tossed it over the glass into the stands before leaving the ice. Finally, goaltender Passingham was still disputing the goal with the official before leaving for the visitor's locker room, with the walkway passing directly next the fans, and a fan threw a filled cup at Passingham. Passingham then attacked the fan before they were eventually separated. Clarke, Mahfouz, and Passingham were all suspended by the league: Mahfouz for one game, Passingham for two, and Clarke for five games. The Enforcers then won the next game at home 7–2 with former Elmira Jackals' player Nick Niedert in goal, but lost the championship in an overtime loss in game four. During the December 27, 2019 game against the Danbury Hat Tricks, due to a rash of injuries, owner Robbie Nichols was forced to suit up as an emergency player. He played two periods before sitting out the third due to exhaustion; Nichols, 55 years old at the time, had not played competitive hockey since 1998.

Early years and education Constance Fairbanks was born in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, May 10, 1866. She belonged to an old provincial family nearly all of whose representatives possessed more or less literary ability, and several of whom were long associated with the history of Nova Scotia. She was the second child and oldest daughter of Lewis Piers Fairbanks and Ella Augusta (DeWolfe) Fairbanks, granddaughter of Charles Rufus Fairbanks, and was one of a family of nine children. Owing to delicate health when a child, Piers was able to attend school in Dartmouth only in an irregular manner, but, being precocious and fond of the company of those older than herself, she gained much knowledge outside of the school-room. At the age of thirteen years, she ceased to have systematic instruction, and with patient determination she proceeded to carry on her education by means of careful reading. Career Finding it necessary to obtain employment, she became, in 1887, secretary to Charles Frederick Fraser, the blind editor of the Halifax Critic, and in that position, gained a practical knowledge of the work which became her occupation. Gradually, as her ability to write became known, and as she developed a keen recognition of what was required by the public, Piers was placed in charge of various departments of the paper, until in June, 1890, the management of the editorial and certain other departments was virtually transferred to her. She took editorial charge of the Halifax Critic, as assistant editor, 1890–92; and associate editor of the St. Johnsbury, Vermont Caledonian, 1893-94. Harry Piers On January 7, 1901, in Halifax, she married Harry Piers (curator of the Provincial Museum of Nova Scotia, and librarian of the Provincial Science Library). They had one son: Edward Stanyan Fairbanks Piers. She was a writer of numerous articles in the Critic, the Caledonian, and others, and many poems, which appeared in the Week (Toronto), Canadian Magazine (Toronto), and other journals, and some of which were contained in Dr. Theodore Harding Rand's A Treasury of Canadian Verse. She contributed papers to the Halifax Ladies' Musical Club and various literary societies. She selected and edited, jointly with husband, the poems of Mary Jane Katzmann, published under the title of Frankincense and Myrrh: Selections From the Poems of the Late Mrs. William Lawson (Halifax), 1893. Piers was interested in music, literature, and art. She favored woman suffrage, but not militant methods. She was a member of the Church of England, and the Ladies' Musical Club (a society organized for the study of music and of the lives of composers and their works). She died in 1939.

As Speaker of the Supreme Council of Estonia on 20 August 1991, he presided over the Supreme Council's historic session when it voted for the restoration of Estonia’s national independence from the Soviet Union.  Early life  Ülo Nugis was born on 28 April 1944 in Tallinn. He studied at Tallinn Technical Secondary School for Building and Mechanics from 1958 to 1962, at Tallinn Polytechnic Institute from 1962 to 1965, and finally at Belarusian State Polytechnic Institute from 1965 to 1967 graduating in mechanical engineering.  Career  Nugis worked as a teacher at Tallinn Technical Secondary School for Building and Mechanics from 1967 to 1968, and at various positions in the Pioneer and Tegur factories from 1968 to 1974. In 1974, Nugis became director of the building materials factory Ehitusdetail, and in 1980 director of a ski factory, Dünamo. In 1986, he became director of the Estoplast factory. Under his leadership, central Soviet Union control of Estoplast was transferred to local Estonian control in 1988. Together with other Estonian-minded industrial leaders, Nugis formed the Union of Work Collectives () where he became the leader. In 1990, Nugis was elected to the Estonian Supreme Council at the first mostly free elections, becoming Speaker. That same year, he left the Communist Party and founded the Republican Coalition Party. On 20 August 1991, he presided over the Supreme Council's historic session where it voted to restore Estonia’s national independence, with the gavel strike by Nugis confirming the result. In October, Nugis became the first Estonian politician to publicly state that the country should try to join NATO as soon as possible, even as Soviet troops were still present in the Baltic nation. Nugis and Ene Ergma In 1992 he became the speaker of the newly elected Riigikogu. Over the years he was in multiple different parties, including the Pro Patria National Coalition Party, People's Party of Republicans and Conservatives, and the Estonian Coalition Party.

In 2007, Black Enterprise magazine ranked Dallas as a \\"Top 10 city for African-Americans\\". History In the mid-1800s lynchings of African Americans took place in Dealey Plaza. In the late 1800s there were over 11,000 black people in Dallas. In the 1990s the number of African-Americans making annual incomes of $100,000 or more (adjusted to $75,000 as of 1990, from the circa 2005 number) increased by 300%. Around 2005 increasing numbers of African-Americans moved to suburban communities in Dallas County. In 1995, Dallas elected its first black mayor, Ron Kirk. The Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex gained approximately 233,000 new African-Americans between 2000 and 2010. Second only behind Atlanta, Georgia during that time span. According to the Brookings Institution, in years 2006-2010 the DFW area had an annual average of 7,678 black people migrate into the area, giving it the fourth highest inward black migration of all U.S. metropolitan areas. The Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex is home to the second largest black community in Texas and west of the Mississippi River. In 2012 Jamie Thompson of D Magazine stated that Dallas \\"still suffers from an image problem among black professionals who perceive other cities—Atlanta; Chicago; Houston; or Washington, D.C.—as being more friendly to blacks.\\" In 2019, Dallas elected its second black mayor, Eric Johnson.https://aframnews.com/news/politics/eric-johnson-becomes-dallas- second-african-american-mayor/ Geography In 1850 there were at least 207 black people in Dallas County, making up less than 10% of the county population. Historically, the black community was strongly concentrated in the inner-city of Dallas and Fort Worth but that has slowly changed since the 1980s.Crawford, Selwyn and Michael E. Young. \\"Census shows black population expanding in Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs.\\" The Dallas Morning News. February 27, 2011. Retrieved on August 5, 2016. In northern DFW suburbs, the black population rate has grown 178 percent since the 1990s. The strongest growth is in the southern suburbs, for example Cedar Hill was approximately 51.9 percent black in 2010, after a gain of more than 12,500 new black residents since the last decade. The southern suburbs (DeSoto, Duncanville, Lancaster, Cedar Hill) have been noted as the core of the African-American middle class and upper middle class community in the metroplex. Stop Six is a historically black neighborhood in Fort Worth. In 2005 Mansfield had 62 households of African- Americans with annual incomes of at least $100,000; there were none in 1990 with the equivalent ($75,000). That same year, the median income of African- American households in Rowlett was higher than the overall median income for that city. Politics and economy In 1995, the city of Dallas elected its first black mayor Ron Kirk. He held office from 1995 to 2002. In 2019, Dallas elected its second black mayor, Eric Johnson. Dallas' Black Chamber of Commerce was established in 1926 and is the oldest in the United States. Fort Worth and some surrounding cities also have a black chamber of commerce. Media The Dallas Weekly is the largest African-American centric publication based in the region. The Dallas Examiner is the other most widely circulated African-American centric publication based in the metroplex. Other black newspapers include the Dallas edition of African-American News & Issues, Black Economic Times, Community Quest, The Dallas Post Tribune, LaVita News/The Black Voice in Arlington, Minority Business News, and Minority Opportunity News Gazette.

Retrieved on November 21, 2015. The attached contemporary article \\"School Begins 'Great Effort' in Education\\" describes it as a \\"Negro High School\\" (a school legally earmarked for black children). Other schools for black children included George Washington Carver Elementary School (in West Dallas), Benjamin Franklin Darrell Elementary School, Frederick Douglass Elementary School, Eagle Ford Elementary School, Joseph J. Rhoads Elementary School, H.S. Thompson Elementary School, Phyllis Wheatley Elementary School, and Colonial School. 9th Ward School was the first secondary school for black children; its name was changed to Dallas Colored High School in 1893, and in 1927 the building was converted to B.F. Darrell Elementary School, named after a principal at Dallas Colored High. The former Dallas Colored transitioned into Booker T. Washington High School, which opened in 1922. Colored School No. 4 became Frederick Douglass Elementary School in 1902. In 1930 Phyllis Wheatley Elementary was built. In 1939 Lincoln High School, the second black high school, opened. Carver Elementary opened in 1954. In 1955, due to the increasing number of black students around Fair Park, the former Lagow Elementary School for white children was converted into the Joseph J. Rhoads Elementary School for black children; it was the first racially converted school in Dallas. In 1956 the former Forest Avenue High School for whites was converted into Madison High for blacks. Colonial School was converted into a school for black children in 1957. Roosevelt opened in 1963. The Catholic church operated St. Peter's Academy for black children in Dallas. Carrollton Colored School was the school for black children in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District in the segregation era. Post- segregation Circa 2005 increasing numbers of African-American students attended schools in the Best Southwest area. Wealthier African-American parents often moved to different school districts to get perceived better educations for their children. Around that same time period increasing numbers of wealthier African-American families were sending their children to private schools; in 2001 there were 5,400 black students in the region's private schools. From 2000 to 2010 the number of black students in Dallas ISD decreased by 20,000. In 2010 that was the lowest in the post-1965 history of DISD. One reason for the decline in the percentage of black students is the move of black people to suburbs; they did so due to a perception that public schools there have a higher quality than those in DISD, as well as general desires for higher quality housing and lower crime environments. Another reason was the growth in charter schools which take students who would otherwise attend DISD schools; in 2010 5,900 black students attending charter schools in the area lived in the DISD boundaries. Other reasons for the decline in the percentage of black students included a perception that DISD has moved its focus away from black students and towards Hispanic students, and the fact that many Hispanics have moved into traditionally black neighborhoods. =Colleges and universities= Paul Quinn College Paul Quinn College is the only HBCU in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In 1961, Bishop College, a black college in Marshall, moved to Dallas but was closed in 1988. In the late 1940s Texas Vocational School provided former black soldiers vocational courses.

Incident A white van carrying explosives was asked to stop at the Magkawit detachment, a security checkpoint situated at the converging boundaries of barangays Bulanting, Colonia, and Maganda in Lamitan, Basilan mainly manned by the Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU). The flagged down van which was to travel to Lamitan city proper exploded at around 5:50 am when soldiers requested the driver to disembark. The vehicle was left obliterated and left a crater and the blast could be heard as far as away. Casualties Ten people died from the explosions with five of them being member of the CAFGU. Four victims, all family relatives of CAFGU members, and a non-CAFGU soldier were also among the dead. Two CAFGU members and five Scout Rangers from the Philippine Army were also left wounded by the explosion. Three goats grazing nearby were also killed. Bomb An initial investigation concluded that the bombing was a result of an improvised explosive bomb made of ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil. The bomb was found to be similar to the one used in the 2013 Cotabato City bombing. Investigation =Possible perpetrators= Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) The militant group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the incident which it claimed as a suicide bombing. The ISIS-affiliated Amaq News Agency, dubbed the bombing \\"a martyrdom operation\\". It said that the supposed suicide attack was made by Abu Khatir Al-Maghribi, a Moroccan national. Rommel Banlaoi of the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research initially believed that the bombing could be an ISIS-directed attack. Local authorities are leaning on the idea that the attack was not a suicide attack contrary to ISIS' claim. According to their initial investigation. The driver of the van stopped from the checkpoint and asked for the people in the checkpoint to help push the vehicle. Investigators reasoned if the driver intended a suicide attack, they could have rammed the vehicle towards the checkpoint. The 20 minute gap between the stoppage of the van and the explosion was also noted by investigators. A burnt cover of a mobile phone was retrieved from the blast site. Banlaoi used this evidence to discount ISIS' claim that the attack was a suicide attack. The Armed Forces of the Philippines are skeptical of ISIS' claims and points out that the identity of the driver whose corpse was left in a bad state is yet to be identified. The military says that ground sources points to the identity of the driver being non-foreign. However, the military is not ruling out ISIS responsibility for the attack. Abu Sayyaf The Philippine military considers the Abu Sayyaf as its primary suspects for the bombing incident saying it has received \\"persistent reports\\" that the group was responsible for the attack. The militant group has three \\"hardcore\\" commanders in Basilan namely Furudji Indama, Radzmil Janatul, and Jobel Abdullah. Since August 1, 2018, text messages began to circulate alleging Abu Sayaff militant, Fathy \\"Mike\\" Lijal, an ethnic Yakan to be behind the bombing. The Western Mindanao Command of the military and the Philippine National Police are looking into the faction Lijal is part of and is confident that he has support from sources abroad. On July 30, 2018, prior to the incident the military received information that eight Abu Sayyaf militants lead by Lijal were sighted in Barangay Languyan in the town of Mohammad Ajul. 11 Abu Sayyaf gunmen from Sulu were also sighted in the town within the same day. Another report alleged that a Moroccan militant Abu Kathir al-Maghribi was behind the bombing who left his two sons under the custody of Abu Sayaff commander Hajan Sawadjaan before he detonated himself. Possible motive City officials suspects that the driver of the van planned to bomb a parade of at least 2,000 school children and teachers commemorating the national nutrition month. The event was deemed a success even as news of the bombing spread in the city causing tension among the event's participants. Julkipli Wadi, chair of the University of the Philippines-Institute of Islamic Studies has connected the Moro Islamic Liberation Front's (MILF) integration process with the government as part of the peace process following the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro and the signing of the Bangsamoro Organic Law to the attack. He said as the MILF integrate with the government, other radical militant groups may take advantage of the resulting power vacuum in the areas the MILF formerly controlled and points to the Basilan attack as an example. Rommel Banlaoi of Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research said the attack was an effort by extremist to sabotage the peace process.

The book has not survived intact, but around seventy fragments from the work survive in a polemic written against it in the 2nd-century CE by the philosopher-physician Galen. In addition Cicero summarises substantial portions of the work in his 1st-century BCE work Tusculan Disputations. On Passions consisted of four books; of which the first three discussed the Stoic theory of emotions and the fourth book discussed therapy and had a separate title—Therapeutics. Most surviving quotations come from Books 1 and 4, although Galen also provides an account of Book 2 drawn from the 1st-century BCE Stoic philosopher Posidonius. Little or nothing is known about Book 3. The Stoics believed that the mind was rational, and that emotions involve judgements. The Stoic passions are emotions such as fear, anger, and desire which cause suffering. In his On Passions, Chrysippus explained how the passions arise from the mistaken opinions of what is good and bad. They are excessive and disobedient to reason, which Chrysippus compared to a runner who is out-of-control. A person in the grip of passion has rejected reason, and therapy is a medical art needed to treat the mind. The treatment outlined by Chrysippus was mostly preventative, demonstrating by theory that the passions are neither natural or necessary, and showing through practice that the mind can be trained to reject them. Background Bust of Chrysippus, Uffizi Gallery, Florence Stoicism is a school of philosophy which began in the 3rd- century BCE. The first head (scholarch) of the school, Zeno of Citium, began teaching around 300 BCE, and laid down most of the fundamental doctrines of the school. His successors as head of the school were Cleanthes of Assos and then Chrysippus of Soli. The Stoics grounded their ethics in the belief that the world was rational, ordered, and structured. Only by living according to nature (human nature and cosmic nature) can humans flourish. Since nature is rational, only a life lived according to reason, i.e. according to virtue (aretē), will allow for a life that is smooth, consistent and happy. Failure to reason correctly brings about the occurrence of pathē—a word translated as passions, emotions, or affections. The Greek word pathos was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers. The Stoics used the word to discuss generic emotions such as anger, fear and joy. The word passion is often used as a translation of pathos so as not to suggest that the Stoics wanted to be rid of all feeling. However the Stoics were often talking straightforwardly about common emotions. The Stoics beginning with Zeno arranged the passions under four headings: distress (lupē), pleasure (hēdonē), fear (phobos) and desire (epithumia). Two of these (distress and pleasure) refer to passions currently present, and two of these (fear and desire) refer to passions directed at the future. Under these four headings can be found specific emotions such as anger, longing, envy, grief, and pride. Philosophers from the time of Plato had allowed for irrational impulses in the soul, but the Stoics saw the soul as a unified rational whole with a central ruling centre (hegemonikon). Thus the Stoics were the first philosophers to identify all emotions with judgements. A passion is a mistaken opinion. A passion has a passive aspect in that it brings suffering, but it also has an active aspect which the Stoics saw as an impulse (hormē), one which is excessive and disobedient to reason. The wise person who is free from the passions (apatheia) instead experiences good emotions (eupatheia) which are clear- headed feelings. It was against this background that Chrysippus wrote his therapeutic work On Passions. Cleanthes had maintained that to quell a passion such as fear, all one had to do was demonstrate that the emotion had nothing to do with what is bad. However as a form of therapy this was inadequate, and Chrysippus set himself the task of writing a treatise on the theory and therapy of emotions. Sources The principal source for the On Passions is the polemical commentary by Galen in his On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato which contains most of the surviving quotations. The other main source is Cicero's Tusculan Disputations Book IV which contains a discussion of the Stoic passions which is derived from Chrysippus. A small amount of supplementary information is provided by writers such as Diogenes Laërtius, Stobaeus, Calcidius, and Origen. =Galen= Galen quotes Chrysippus' On Passions around seventy times in his On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato, thus preserving up to twenty percent of the text. Galen wrote On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato to examine the main doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato and to demonstrate their truth and agreement (as Galen saw it). Plato had divided the soul into three parts representing reason, anger, and appetite. Since Chrysippus was the main representative of the Stoic view that the soul was unitary, Galen devotes most of the fourth and fifth books of his nine-volume treatise attacking the On Passions of Chrysippus. Galen maintains that most philosophers including Pythagoras, Aristotle and even many Stoics agreed with Plato's division of the soul, even if some of them understood the division in terms of powers rather than as parts. His goal is to show that Chrysippus represents a deviant position. He claims that Zeno and Cleanthes were really on Plato's side, but the evidence he presents is very meagre. He accepts he has little evidence for Zeno, and the only evidence he provides for Cleanthes is a brief versified dialogue between anger and reason which he thinks shows that Cleanthes accepted an irrational part of the soul. Throughout his polemic, Galen draws heavily on the Stoic philosopher Posidonius (1st-century BCE) who wrote his own On Passions as a commentary on Chrysippus. Galen claims Posidonius accepted an irrational part of the soul, although Posidonius may have held a more Stoic position than Galen admits to. Galen selects and quotes passages out of context, and he often shows incomprehension in his understanding of Chrysippus. =Cicero= Cicero uses Chrysippus' On Passions as a major source for the fourth book of his Tusculan Disputations. Some passages in his third book are also drawn from the same source. Cicero may well have used an epitome made by a later Stoic rather than the full text. He provides extra details not mentioned by Galen, and is comparatively unbiased. However, there are no direct quotations from Chrysippus in Cicero's account; he mixes in material drawn from other philosophy schools; and he intersperses his own comments. Cicero complains that Chrysippus devotes most of his efforts on theory and not therapy, but Cicero has a narrow definition of therapy: a strategy for helping someone in the sudden grip of emotion. Cicero is nevertheless a useful source for the practical side of Chrysippus' therapy, and its focus on prevention. Galen neglects this aspect because his aim is to attack the theory. Contents Although On Passions is one of the best attested works by Chrysippus, large sections of the work are lost. Galen appears to have only read, and made direct use of, Books 1 and 4. He derives his account of Book 2 entirely from the commentary of Posidonius, and he is silent about Book 3. The epitome used by Cicero may itself have been a summary of Books 1 and 4. This means that most of the surviving quotations are from Books 1 and 4 and our knowledge of Book 3 is non-existent. Galen refers to the first three books as the theoretical books (logika). Book 4 was known separately as the Therapeutics ()—a title which apparently goes back to Chrysippus, and it had some status as a stand-alone text. In Book 1 Chrysippus discusses the definitions of passion which had been laid down by Zeno, and analyses its various types. In Book 2 he examines the difficulties raised by everyday experience. Book 4 treats the therapy of the passions, although it too contains theory, summarising some of the material from Book 1. Theory itself plays an important role in Stoic therapy. =Book 1= In Book 1 Chrysippus begins with the definitions of passion which had been laid down by Zeno. Zeno had written his own work On Passions which had examined emotions based on common opinions held about them. Zeno defined passion as \\"an irrational and unnatural motion of the soul\\" and \\"an excessive impulse\\". Chrysippus stresses that \\"irrational\\" here means \\"disobedient to reason and having turned away from reason.\\" Acting emotionally is not being overcome by a lower non-rational part of the soul. Chrysippus compares an excessive impulse to a runner whose legs have such impetus that the runner cannot immediately will them to a halt: An excessive emotion is like a runner who is out-of-control because of external causes. In the case of out-of-control mind the external causes are external appearances, which when impressed upon a weakened mind result in a corresponding passion. Zeno, again borrowing from common usage, had added a third definition of passion as a \\"fluttering of the soul\\". For the Stoics all bodily processes have a material, corporeal cause, which for Chrysippus as well as Zeno meant physical movements in the soul. Having dealt with Zeno's three definitions of passion, Chrysippus passes on to the four generic passions as defined by Zeno. Zeno had defined distress as the opinion that one is in the presence of evil. The intensity of the distress is affected by the soul's resilience and the scale of the experience. Chrysippus adds that the opinion needs to be fresh to explain why distress can fade with time. Chrysippus defines distress as a shrinking before what is thought to be a thing to avoid, and pleasure as a swelling at what is thought to be a thing to choose. =Book 2= In Book 2 Chrysippus moves beyond Zeno's definitions to discuss various problems concerning passions. For Chrysippus emotions are judgements: a judgement that something good or bad is at hand and that it is appropriate to act accordingly. Thus a passion consists of two propositions: (1) this is something good/bad and (2) it is right that one should be affected by it. In the case of distress, people believe that (1) something bad has befallen them, and (2) that one should shrink before it, producing not only the inner pain but the outward signs of distress such as weeping. Eventually the distress diminishes which indicates a weakening of the second proposition, however the first proposition may remain in place. Thus one may stop mourning the death of a loved-one while still believing their death to be an evil. Chrysippus understands this in terms of abatement of inflammation, in much the same way a fever abates. The Stoics saw passions as a type of illness, so the medical analogy is deliberate. Chrysippus acknowledges that some emotional responses are not easily reasoned out. For example it is possible that both judgements may be present but that the manifestations of distress do not ensue. Chrysippus explains this as being due to other causal factors acting which we may be unaware of or whose origin may be unclear. This might include underlying characteristics of the mind, or the extent to which other errors have become entrenched in the mind. Chrysippus also discusses the origin of evil, and why children, even those brought up virtuously, become corrupted. Chrysippus relates this to his principle of oikeiôsis. Children are born in a natural state which should lead to goodness and virtue. However, the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain become associated from an early age with the supreme good. A similar process occurs with wealth and fame. Thus physical factors such as pleasure and pain, as well as societal pressures, hamper our natural development. The Stoics equated evil with the passions, and corruption arises in regards to good and evil because of \\"the persuasiveness of appearances and conversation.\\" =Book 4: Therapeutics= Chrysippus states near the beginning of Book 4 that just as there is an art called medicine concerned with the diseased body, so there is an equivalent art associated with the diseased mind. This is not just an analogy: a passion is a real illness brought on from the mind's deviation from its natural state. The soul's condition depends on physiological processes in the body. Chrysippus directly relates this to medical ideas concerning pneuma as the 'breath' that makes up the soul, and a passion involves a disturbance in the balance of the classical elements which make up the body and between physical principles such as hot and cold. Given this material relationship between body and soul, Chrysippus emphasizes the need for bodily health, and advocates a plain, simple diet. Chrysippus discusses the passions by quoting Greek literature. Thus in his examination of anger he makes use of Euripides' Medea: Here Chrysippus explains Medea's anger in terms of akrasia: a word meaning weak-will or incontinence. Akrasia is not an irrational force within the soul, instead it is the mind identifying with a bad reason against one's better judgement. During emotional conflict reason oscillates between rival judgements. Wrong reason will reside simultaneously in the mind with right reason. In Medea's case she chooses the option rooted in anger, which is thus wrong reason. Chrysippus once again explains this loss of control in terms of \\"runners who go counter to their impulse in running and [hence] in persons angered counter to their own reason.\\" Someone in the midst of an emotional crisis rejects right reason and cannot be easily helped. Chrysippus gives many examples of anger and other emotions such as people biting keys and kicking a door when it fails to open, or taking out anger on inanimate objects such as balls of wool. Such a person will appear changed to those people around them (i.e. people still in possession of right reason) and they can not be treated as the person they normally are. Similarly someone in the throes of love will reject good counsel whatever the price may be. They may recognise right reason, yet they will reject it. The passions obscure, they cause a mental clouding, a madness. They put an end to deliberation, leaving just one option as irresistible. Only recovery from this mental clouding permits deliberation and the return of right reason. Chrysippus describes two forms of treatment: (1) treating passions which have arisen, and (2) preventing passions from arising. Chrysippus stresses that the therapy of the first type has only limited value, to be used as a temporary measure. Thus his therapy is preventative. Since a passion is a temporary outbreak reflecting the diseased nature of the mind, therapy itself must be directed at the underlying disease. Chrysippus advocates the practice of 'dwelling in advance'—that is trying to foresee the numerous difficulties that life offers. Chrysippus gives two reasons for the impact of unexpected events: (1) that we have no time to assess the magnitude of the event, and (2) that we feel guilty for not having anticipated it: Thus the primary cause of distress is unforeseen events, and we need the ability to respond rationally instead of straight away assenting to appearances. Chrysippean therapy focuses on contemplation; training and improving the mind; strengthening the soul. The theory teaches us that the passions are misguided judgements, and thus are voluntary. It is the task of therapy to teach that these judgements have a wrong valuation, mistaking indifferent things for good or evil. Cicero's Tusculan Disputations Tusculan Disputations, 15th-century illuminated manuscript Cicero made use of On Passions, probably in epitome form, for his Tusculan Disputations. Most of his testimony can be found in the fourth book of the Tusculans, especially the coherent section at §11–33 and a rather muddled section at §58–81. A few extra passages can be found in Cicero's third book. =Book IV= Apart from the introduction (§1–10) and the conclusion (§82–4), Tusculan Disputations Book 4 can be divided into three parts, two of which are derived from Chrysippus' On Passions. The other part is a critique of the Peripatetic theory of moderate emotions at §34–57. Although Stoic, this central section is drawn from some other source. §11–33 This first section closely parallels Galen's account of Books 1 and 4 of On Passions. Cicero begins (§11) with Zeno's first two definitions of emotion, and moves on to an overview of the four generic passions as well as the three good-feelings attributable to the Stoic Sage (§14). He lists (§15) four physical effects of the four passions not found in Galen's account. He follows this (§16–21) with a lengthy catalogue of the emotions arranged under the headings of the four main passions—a list which is again missing from Galen. He then (§22) highlights the concept of akrasia (Latin: intemperamentia) as the source of the passions. Cicero then (§23–32) moves on to material which is drawn from the Therapeutics. It begins (§23) with a statement about how disturbances of the mind are like those of the body, and how the soul is disturbed by conflicting opinions. Cicero provides (§25–26) definitions and examples of the various passions. He explains (§27–28) the analogy between body and soul, and between disease and health. He describes (§31) the limitations of the analogy (a healthy soul cannot become diseased like a healthy body can); and explains (§32) how the clever are less prone to sickness. §58–81 In this section Cicero returns to the subject of therapy. However, although much of the material is sourced from Chrysippus, Cicero interweaves some Peripatetic ideas; adds his own remarks; and sources his own quotations from the Latin poets. After an introduction (§58), Cicero explains (§59–62) the Chrysippean position that one should direct treatment at the passion itself rather than the external cause. He then (§64–65) discusses passions caused by (supposedly) bad and good things respectively. Cicero add his own digression on the opinions offered by different philosophers. He then (§68–76) moves on to the theme of erotic love. Many of these ideas come from Chrysippus, but Cicero uses examples drawn from Latin poetry instead of the Greek poets. The therapeutic ideas (§74–5) about introducing distractions or substituting a new lover for an old one are presumably part of Cicero's \\"Peripatetic\\" cures. The next subject (§77–81) treats anger, again drawing his ideas from Chrysippus. =Book III= Cicero's Tusculan Disputations Book 3 is focused on the alleviation of distress rather than the passions generally. Cicero draws on many Stoic themes, some of which may be derived from Chrysippus. This includes a medical analogy (§1), and passions as forms of madness (§7–13). However, only a few passages can be directly attributed to On Passions. Of particular value is §52 which contains the doctrine of dwelling in advance which is directly attributed to Chrysippus. This can be supplemented with §29 which contains a Euripides' quote probably used by Chrysippus on the same theme. Other Chrysippean passages include a derivation of the word distress (lupē) at §61, and his therapy concerning mourning at §76 and §79. Legacy Chrysippus became a preeminent authority for the Stoic school, eclipsing his predecessors. Writers as doctrinally far-apart as Philodemus and Origen quote from his On Passions. Galen himself states that the Stoics of his day followed Chrysippus. =Posidonius= Posidonius wrote his own On Passions expanding on the treatise of Chrysippus. Almost everything which is known about the work is drawn from Galen's remarks. Galen claims Posidonius allowed for an irrational part of the soul. It is possible Posidonius did hold this position although it would have been at variance with mainstream Stoic thought, not just that of Chrysippus. Cicero, who had personally known Posidonius, shows no awareness of a disagreement between Posidonius and Chrysippus. Among the difficulties Posidonius wanted to explain were: how impulses become excessive; why different people vary in their emotional reactions; why emotions fade through time, yet judgements can remain intact; and why the manifestations of distress can be so unpredictable. In many cases the disagreement which Galen reports between Posidonius and Chrysippus may in fact have been attempts by Posidonius to refine and corroborate the Stoic position of Chrysippus. For example, Posidonius wanted to explain variations in emotional reactions: why do some people react inappropriately in the face of an emotion and others do not? Posidonius may have argued that human minds are predisposed to various emotional movements without necessarily being irrational. =Seneca= The influence of Chrysippus on Seneca is clearest in his long essay On Anger (). Seneca distinguishes three stages of anger as part of a chronological sequence. The first stage is shock, an initial agitation or movement which is involuntary. In the second stage the mind assents to appearance of injustice, and that it is thus appropriate to respond with vindictiveness. In the third stage the emotion is released. Reason, which was still present in the second stage is now let go and the mind turns away from it. Since the first stage is involuntary and the third stage lacks reason, therapy has to be directed at the second stage—only here can one recognise the nature of the shock and side with reason. =Epictetus= Epictetus tells his students to train themselves in their use of appearances through a series of exercises. This includes questioning whether a grand or beautiful passer-by involves something good, or whether a bereaved or hungry person has encountered something bad. Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between things in our power (eph' hēmin) and not in our power. Anything in our power is defined narrowly as our will or volition (prohairesis). This includes our judgements and desires, but nothing external such as our bodies. The influence of Chrysippus is obvious in a Discourse (ii. 18) on the correct use of impressions, where he explains how diseases grow in the mind in a manner very similar to a Chrysippean passage quoted by Cicero (Tusc. Disp. iv. 24): Notes a. Some older English translations of the Tusculan Disputations use a different numbering scheme for the sections. In these old texts the relevant parts of book IV, §11–33 and §58–81, are sections 6–14 and 27–37. For Book III, §29 and §52 are at sections 14 and 22. The other three passages §61, §76, §79 are at 25, 31, and 33.

Early life Timothy Alden was born in Swieqi in 1991. He spent many years in Germany at a young age. He currently lives in Naxxar. In 2016 he graduated jointly with both a Bachelors and Masters in International Management and Intercultural Studies. He attained his degrees respectively from the University of Stirling and the University of Passau. Upon returning to Malta from his studies, Alden was in talks with the President of Malta to encourage the creation of a Maltese language course on duolingo.  Environmental activism and political candidacy  Alden's environmental activism began through his work with the NGO, Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar. His first engagement with the NGO saw it present an open letter to the Prime Minister, demanding that the overdevelopment of the country be remedied. Through FAA he also organised the 75th Anniversary of Operation Pedestal. In the 2017 Maltese general elections, he agreed to contest with the Democratic Party as part of the Forza Nazzjonali alliance, contesting the 8th and 9th Districts. He believed that a third party was the only way to bring about desperately needed reform. Although the government retained its power after the election, the Democratic Party elected two members to Parliament, becoming the first third party to do since before the Independence of Malta. Wanting the party to evolve beyond its association with her own image, Marlene Farrugia resigned from the post of party leader in August 2017. In the resulting leadership race, Timothy Alden contested the post against Anthony Buttigieg, believing the Democratic Party to be the vehicle for the greatest positive change in Maltese political history. Timothy Alden stated his belief in the need for constitutional reform, an end to tribalism and a more inclusive society. During the contest, he organised a clean-up of St. George's Bay and invited Anthony Buttigieg. Due to the fact he was not yet ready to step down from his practical and bread-winning professional obligations in Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar, however, Timothy Alden decided to remove himself from the leadership contest, and supported the leadership bid of Anthony Buttigieg as his deputy leader.  Deputy Leader  As deputy leader, Timothy Alden participated in a delegation to meet the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party in Amsterdam. The Democratic Party was then accepted as a full member of ALDE. The Democratic Party's first major test came when the government attempted to extend the hunting hours of Majjistral Park, in collusion with the Nationalist Party under its new leader, Adrian Delia. The Democratic Party resisted this move in Parliament, acting as the first Parliamentary party to stand up to the hunting lobby. Noticing the vacancy left open by the Nationalist Party in Malta's Commission Against Corruption, the Democratic Party would also nominate its own candidate, Philip Micallef, to the post. These stands in favour of the environment and good governance led to Alden declaring that the Democratic Party was dictating the agenda in Parliament. The Democratic Party would also blow the whistle and raise resistance against an MP pensions reform bill, claiming that Parliamentarians should not be entitled to more public money until the country's other problems were taken care of. The Democratic Party was then able to claim victory against this bill, when the government and Nationalist Party backtracked on the proposal. Alden was part of the Democratic Party's first delegation to San Anton Palace to discuss Constitutional reform with President Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, a process kickstarted by a visit to Malta by the Venice Commission. In a statement, Alden said that the institutional system, the political system and public administration are not working in the way they should be in a modern democratic country. He would then lead two subsequent delegations to meet with the Steering Committee for Constitutional Reform. The second meeting took place on the 7th of January 2019, and the Democratic Party argued that the process of Constitutional reform should not be limited to the remit of the Steering Committee, but should instead transform into a full convention with broad participation and decision-making powers delegated to representatives of the general public. Alden led a third meeting to the committee where it was argued that the Constitution required the implementation of a rule of law control system, to empower the Constitutional Court, that the President be chosen by a two thirds majority and that timeframes and terms of reference be established for the work of the steering committee. Upon the resignation of Marlene Farrugia and Godfrey Farrugia from Partit Demokratiku, Timothy Alden insisted that he would remain loyal to the party, and that the Executive would meet to discuss the best way forward. On the 25th of September, during an Executive meeting, Alden appointed a negotiating team to discuss a merger with the Democratic Alternative. On the 28th of December, the anniversary of the murder of Karin Grech, Timothy Alden and Carmel Cacopardo announced that talks for the two parties to merge were at an advanced stage.  Platform  In April 2018, Alden would be one of the first to take an open and direct public stand against the system of clientelism which reigns in Malta, whereby each Ministry has a \\"customer care department\\". The existence of these departments was confessed by a government Minister. Alden received a phone call at his household in which a Ministry offered favours to the family, implying an attempt to buy their vote. Alden responded by writing a letter to the Commissioner of Police and later filed a report to the Police. Alden then went on to report the situation to the Commission Against Corruption when the Police took no action. He succeeded in stirring public debate about clientelism and others stepped forward to speak against it. He has been a strong advocate for the government to buy the remaining gardens, fields and other green enclaves in Malta's towns and villages, so as to convert them into public spaces. Alden has also been campaigning for alternative means of transportation. For ALDE's annual congress in 2018, Timothy Alden led a delegation to Madrid. The delegation included Dr. Anthony Buttigieg. During the congress, the Democratic Party ensured that the section of the ALDE manifesto dealing with defence was in line with Malta's constitution, which states that Malta is a neutral country. Alden also advocated a more pro-active approach to good governance reform in the EU. Alden accompanied Godfrey Farrugia in a meeting with the President of Malta, Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca, an hour before the two major parties, to discuss the potential roadmap to Constitutional reform. Alden has also been advocating the further development of women's rights and improving their representation in politics. However, he is against gender quotas in Parliament, believing instead in the empowerment of women based on merit and the provision of equality of opportunity.  Leader  Timothy Alden was elected as leader of the party during the party's AGM on 6 July 2020. He previously served as interim leader following the resignation of Godfrey Farrugia. His pledge as leader was to unite Partit Demokratiku with Alternattiva Demokratika by August. The two parties signed a memorandum of understanding to merge on the 1st August after nearly a year of negotiations. On the 17th of October, the two parties finally completed the merger process, and created AD+PD.

It was located near Lake Placid in the Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York. African Americans also settled in areas known as Negro Brook near Bloomingdale, and Blackville near Loon Lake, New York.  History  In 1846, New York State enacted a law that required free black men to own real estate worth at least $250 (this is equivalent to $7,700 as of 2019) or a house in order to be able to vote. This restriction only applied to free black men. Gerrit Smith, a wealthy abolitionist and land owner, gave away 120,000 acres of land to 3,000 black New Yorkers in 40 acre lots, creating the community of Timbuctoo. It created rural land ownership and self-sufficiency for black people as an alternative to urban city life; gave black men access to the right to vote, and was an alternative response to the influx of Irish and white immigrants competing for urban employment. Rural life also served as a way to escape from the racist atrocities that many black people faced during this time, especially from bounty hunters looking for fugitive slaves and protection from slave traders who would kidnap and sell blacks back into slavery. It was also an alternative way to live due to the housing shortages and epidemics that plagued their neighborhoods. Frederick Douglass worked with Smith to promote the land distribution and recruitment to North Elba. Smith wanted a certain type of person to inhabit Timbuctoo as they would be representing the masses. Some of the characteristics, that those who wanted to live in Timbuctoo, should possess included being completely sober, showing self-restraint, being responsible, having good morals, etc.In 1848, John Brown moved his family to North Elba to support the development Timbuctoo. Smith was a supporter of John Brown's antislavery activities was accused of supplying John Brown with guns for the 1859 raid on Harper's Ferry. In 1848, Gerrit Smith gave Willis Hodges, a free black man from Virginia, 200 acres to settle in the Loon Lake area with 10 families. The named it Blacksville. The community was disbanded after two winters due to harsh conditions. The difficulty of farming in the Adirondack region, coupled with the settlers' lack of experience in house-building and the bigotry of white neighbors, caused the Timbuctoo experiment to fail by 1855.Renehan, pp 17-18  Legacies of Timbuctoo inhabitants  Although Gerrit Smith proposed a good deal to those who were chosen to live in Timbuctoo, a lot of these families were not able to handle the transition from city life to rural farm life. Many of those chosen had previously worked in domestic professions and were not experienced farmers. Between 1850 and 1870 only thirteen families remained in the settlement and by 1871 that number dropped down to only two. = Lyman Epps Sr. = Lyman Epps Sr. family were one the two families that managed to stay and thrive in Timbuctoo. Lyman became a leader of the community and helped to found the Timbuctoo the local sabbath school, the Lake Placid public library, and the Lake Placid Bapist church. Epps was able to make a living by becoming a sheep herder and cultivating the land. His family lived in the area for over 100 years. Lynman Epps Sr. died at the age of eighty-three in 1897. The last member of the Epps family, Lyman Epps Jr died in 1942. = John Thomas = John Thomas was born into slavery on the eastern shore of Virginia. He escaped up north in 1839 to Philadelphia before he continued on to Troy, New York. He married Mary Vanderhyden and they began a family in upstate New York. John was one of the people to accept Gerritt Smith's offer for the land grant. Bounty hunters eventually came for him in the Adirondacks. Due to Smith's principles that helped found the settlement, many of the white men backed Thomas and warned the bounty hunters that they would protect him at all cost. They also warned that Thomas was armed and dangerous and would do anything to prevent being sold back into slavery. The bounty hunters left and never returned. Like many of the families residing in Timbuctoo, Thomas did not live there very long. An 1880 U.S census says that he lived in Franklin, NY. He remained there for the rest of his life and died in 1894 at the age of eighty-three.  Legacy  Unfortunately, there is no sign of Timbuctoo today. It cannot be found on many maps that showcase the Adirondacks and none of the homes that black people in the community resided in were historically preserved and have disappeared due to excavation. In 2001, there was an exhibition called John Brown \\"Dreaming of Timbuctoo\\" which opened at the Adirondack Experience, formerly known as the Adirondack Museum. The exhibit documents the story of the Black homesteaders that were given land in the Adirondacks in the mid-1840s. In 2016 the John Brown Farm State Historic Site became the permanent home of the “Dreaming of Timbuctoo” exhibition. There is an annual Blues at Timbuctoo festival in Lake Placid. The festival is held at the historic John Brown Farm. It is presented by Jerry Dugger, and by the organization John Brown Lives. The festival is a combination of blues music and conversation around race relations. The festival was launched in 2015. Martha Swan is the current executive director of John Brown Lives.
