Written by Walter Koenig and directed by Bob Lally, it first aired in the United States on October 12, 1974 on NBC. The episode guest stars Walker Edmiston. Plot While searching for edible food, the Marshalls discover a cave in which they find a mounted, glowing lozenge which seems to jerk them as they near it. The family is interrupted by the arrival of six Sleestak, and Rick threatens them with the lozenge. The scuffle is interrupted by the arrival of Enik, a Sleestak-like creature who calls himself an Altrusian. Enik waves his hands and the Sleestak flee. Enik explains that like the Marshalls, he has fallen through a \\"dimensional doorway\\" into the past of the Land of the Lost, and that the Sleestak are his evolutionary antecedents. He explains that the diamond is the Mageti, a \\"tool for traveling through the universe.\\" He plans to use it to return to his own time, and suggests that with the proper coordinates the Marshalls may be able to return to their own dimension. Enik also explains that the Mageti will up to a point carry out the impulses of those near it, but will self-destruct when surrounded by hostile or aggressive emotions. When Enik tries to take back the Mageti, Will becomes aggressive, and the Mageti self-destructs. In dismay, Enik explains that he has a smaller Mageti stone (a \\"fourth dimensional node\\"), but that it requires a power source to operate. The Marshalls point out the Lost City has many such nodes, which Enik finds hard to believe. On the way to the Lost City, a group of Sleestak attack the party, and Enik is unable to understand his ancestors' behavior (since future Altrusians always keep their emotions in check). Rick attracts the attention of Alice to frighten away the Sleestak, and the party reaches the Lost City. Upon seeing the ruins, Enik realizes that he has not, in fact, traveled to the past, but rather to the distant future, and that the Sleestak are the barbaric descendants of the Altrusians. He surmises that his people lost control of their emotions and devolved into the Sleestak. Understanding now that the Lost City is his own city, Enik leads the Marshalls to a room full of dimensional nodes where he plans to recharge his Mageti so that he can return to his proper time and warn the Altrusians of their imminent destruction. Will steals the Mageti, but Enik invokes a mist that shows each of the Marshalls their worst fears. Rick tells Enik that this sort of dispassionate attack is the product of the emotionlessness of the Altrusians, and that it is more likely that this is how they devolved into Sleestak. Enik agrees and removes the smoke, and Will returns the node. Three Sleestak come in, but Enik tells the Marshalls to place a blue and a green node together to create a force field. Unable to enter, the Sleestak leave, as does Enik. Reception The online review site Premium Hollywood described the episode in 2009 as \\"part sci-fi and part morality play\\" when \\"Land of the Lost really begins to take off\\", noting that the episode is written by \\"no less than\\" Walter Koenig. Edmiston's performance of Enik is described as \\"probably the best acting job in the entire series\\" and \\"a huge coup for the series\\", noting that \\"his mere introduction couldn’t help but alter the feel and direction of the show\\". Premium Hollywood went on to describe the episode as notably deeper, more complex, and more philosophical than those previous, with \\"hefty ideas on display.\\" The site concluded that \\"The Stranger\\" makes it \\"glaringly obvious that this is far more than just a kid’s show\\". In Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of Saturday Morning Children's Television, 1969-1993, film and television historian Hal Erickson calls this episode \\"superb\\" and praises it for the introduction of the character of Enik, whom Erickson describes as \\"the series' most fascinating character — and the one closest to the Star Trek brand of cerebral science-fiction/fantasy.\\" References Category:Land of the Lost (1974 TV series) episodes Category:1974 American television episodes ","title":"The Stranger (Land of the Lost)"},{"id":"23089519","text":"Omar al-Issawi (Arabic: عمر العيساوي) (born June 4, 1967), is a journalist, director, producer, and television personality.

NETA is accredited by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as a standards developing entity. It is guided by an active Board of Directors consisting of professionals within the electrical testing industry. The Board meets quarterly for official meetings. Board members also participate on various NETA committees, such as the Standards Review Council, Certification Exam, Membership, Finance, Association Development and Strategy, Promotions and Marketing, Nominations and Mission Based Programs. NETA's stated mission is \\"...to serve the electrical testing industry by establishing standards; publishing specifications; accrediting independent, third-party testing companies; certifying test technicians; and promoting the professional services of its members. The Association also collects and disseminates information and data of value to the electrical industry and educates the public and end user about the merits of electrical acceptance and maintenance testing.\\" History In the 1960s, the electrical industry was booming thanks to lower prices and the huge increase in the number and reach of power lines, making electricity more in demand than ever before. By 1972, it was widely recognized that this rapid growth demanded some oversight to promote safety, system reliability, and quality testing. Nine companies came together and channeled this need into the creation of NETA, the National Electrical Testing Association. That same year, NETA released its first standard, Acceptance Testing Specifications for Electrical Power Equipment and Systems. NETA then turned its attention to improving the work of electrical technicians. To that end, the NETA Electrical Testing Technician Certification program was established in 1975. In recognition that the association had reached beyond United States borders, the name was changed to the InterNational Electrical Testing Association in 1983. In its ever-increasing desire to keep ahead of the changing industry, the NETA Accredited Company (NAC) program was instituted in 1991. Shortly thereafter, a program was developed for individual professionals in the electrical power industry to join NETA as alliance partners. NETA became ANSI Accredited in 1996, and by 2000 had released the first ANSI Accredited Standard, the ANSI/NETA Standard for Certification of Electrical Testing Technicians. A version of the ANSI/NETA Standard for Maintenance Testing Specifications was first published in 1975, with the most recent edition released in 2015. In 2013, the latest version of NETA's very first publication, the ANSI/NETA Standard for Acceptance Testing Specifications for Electrical Power Equipment and Systems, was verified as an American National Standard. The association actively furthers their mission to serve the electrical industry by continuing to develop standards, most recently in 2015 with the publication of the ANSI/NETA Standard for Electrical Commissioning Specifications. NETA celebrated 45 years of continual improvement of the electrical testing industry in 2017. The organization is managed by a private company which is not responsible to the public or NETA Members. Establishing Standards The Standards Review Council (SRC) is a committee within NETA that is nominated by the NETA President and is appointed by the Technical Chair. The SRC is responsible for approving revisions to NETA's technical publications on a stated timetable. The revisions are based on technical input from all committees and the NETA office. Input is also taken from members of ballot pools, individuals who go through an application process to participate in the standards development process. Comments on the candidate standard from the general public can be submitted during the public review periods, which are announced in the ANSI Standards Action. The standards are for use by anyone responsible for the safe and reliable operation of electrical power equipment and systems. NETA currently has four ANSI Accredited Standards; ANSI/NETA Standard for Certification of Electrical Testing Technicians, ANSI/NETA Standard for Acceptance Testing Specifications for Electrical Power Equipment and Systems, ANSI/NETA Standard for Maintenance Testing Specifications for Electrical Power Equipment and Systems, and ANSI/NETA Standard for Electrical Commissioning Specifications for Electrical Power Equipment and Systems. Publishing As the publisher of American National Standards for the electrical testing industry, NETA is responsible for ensuring that these standards are periodically reviewed and kept up to date. These updated standards, along with other handbooks and training materials, are made available through NETA. NETA also publishes a quarterly technical magazine, the NETA World Journal. This periodical contains articles on technical updates, industry trends, case studies and training information. Accreditation The heart of the association is the NETA Accredited Companies (NAC). To qualify as an NAC, companies must first be third-party, independent firms that have no bias with potential clients or affiliation with a particular brand of equipment. The accreditation process is composed of two parts: accrediting the company and separately certifying the individual technicians that are employed by the company. Once all the requirements have been met and the company receives approval from the Board of Directors, they can begin taking full advantage of their member status, which includes identifying themselves in the marketplace as a NETA Accredited Company and associated use of the NETA logo. All NACs are periodically reviewed to ensure their continued status as a member in good standing. Certification NETA certifies three levels of electrical testing technicians: Certified Assistant Technician, Certified Technician, and Certified Senior Technician. Each level has progressively increasing requirements for number of years of training and related experience. An intensive written exam must be passed at each level. Technicians must pass each level sequentially to progress to elevated certification levels. To maintain their certification, technicians must complete Continuing Technical Development (CTD) credits periodically. This ensures that they stay up to date on industry safety and procedure standards. Certification through NETA is only available to individuals connected to an organization that is recognized/accredited by NETA. Alliance Program The Alliance Program at NETA is a network of professionals and companies who have vested interests in furthering the safety and reliability of electrical power equipment. These groups are not NETA accredited, but partner with NETA and NETA Accredited Companies to bring input from their perspectives throughout all sectors of the electrical power industry. Training To fully incorporate NETA's mission to propagate information on electrical testing, NETA offers various training courses covering many facets of the electrical testing industry. Online courses cover specific areas of acceptance testing and include interactive portions. Self-Paced Technical Seminars (SPTS) are a series of recorded seminars encompassing electrical power system commissioning, acceptance, and maintenance testing. The Electrical Safety Training System (ESTS) is a series of multi-media, interactive classes that are focused on teaching safety procedures in hazardous workplace environments. Enrollment in classes is open to anyone and can be submitted for Continuing Education units. NETA Certified Technicians can earn their Continuing Technical Development credits with these classes. PowerTest Conference NETA organizes and hosts PowerTest, an annual conference focused on electrical power systems commissioning, acceptance, maintenance, and safety. It consists of five days of presentations, panel discussions, half-day seminars, a trade show, new product innovations, and networking opportunities. The conference is typically attended by engineers, manufacturers, operators, technicians, contractors, managers, inspectors, and technicians - anyone who is interested in expanding their knowledge of the industry.

Established in 1839, it is the ninth-oldest still- active Jewish congregation in the United States. Temple Concord, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, is the leading Reform synagogue in Central New York, and maintains the largest Jewish religious school in the region. Religious services are held every Friday night and Saturday morning, and on Jewish holidays. Religious school and adult education programs take place twice a week. Temple Concord is also the setting for a wide array of educational, cultural and social events the serve then entire Syracuse-area community. Early history Temple Concord was founded in 1839 by German immigrants drawn to upstate New York by the new Erie Canal. The small group gathered in a back room of a local store for meetings and worship services. By 1841 they had moved to the second floor of a member's home on Mulberry Street, from where they hired their first religious leader (he was not formally trained or ordained as a rabbi). The group incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on February 24, 1942. and first took the name \\"Comrades of Peace\\" and shortly thereafter Keneseth Shalome, which they translated in formal English as Temple Society of Concord.

Syracuse: Syracuse, University Press, 1970, p. 1-3 Religious leaders and rabbis In its early years the congregation was served by many religious leaders. These men were referred to as \\"Reverends\\" and they served as cantors, teachers, Mohelim, and Schochetim. With the exception of Bernard Illowy, it is doubtful that any were formally trained or ordained as rabbis. Rabbi Adolph Guttman, who emigrated to America from Hohenems, Austria, was the first modern Reform rabbi, and he shaped the liturgy and organization for decades to come.Temple Society of Concord, Syracuse, New York, 1839-1964: Our First One Hundred Twenty-five Years (Syracuse, NY: 1964), p. 6 Congregational Religious Leaders (1841–present) * Abraham Gunzenhauser (1841-1846) * Joseph Goodman * Jacob Levi * Bernard Illowy * Herman Berkenthal * Rev.

History The church was designed by its first pastor, Lorenzo Lyons. on National Register of Historic Places web site A grass hut had been built on this spot for visiting preachers some time before 1832 when Rev. Lyons arrived. A new building was constructed of stone walls with a thatched roof between 1837 and 1843. One reason was the earthquake and tsunami of 1837 which caused some to believe (as preached by Millerism) that a new Advent of Christ would arrive in 1843. However, membership of the parish dropped from a high of almost 5,000 to about 1200 by 1841. By 1855 the stone church was in ruins, and a new church of about 40 by was started on August 29, 1855 made of koa wood (Acacia koa) from nearby forests. The altar of hand carved Hawaiian wood in the church was made by David McHattie Forbes and completed after his death in 1937 by his oldest son David Merlyn Lougher Forbes.\\"Mother Forbes, Kamaaina Resident Dies\\". Honolulu Star Bulletin, August 19, 1955. The calabash bowl light fixtures are a distinctive design feature inspired by the same native Hawaiian form. Some of the walls of the old church still stand, enclosing the grave site of Rev. Lyons, his wife, and a young son. The name comes from 'imi ola in the Hawaiian Language which means \\"seek salvation\\". Today In 1955 the paint was removed from the interior and natural finish of koa wood was restored. The church continues to be in use and is usually open to the public. The church belongs to the Hawaii Island Association of the Hawaii Conference of the United Church of Christ.

Later their mother is brutally murdered in an anti-Muslim rampage on their Mumbai slum, a reference to the anti-Muslim attacks of 1993. The boys flee for their lives and see a depiction of the Hindu God, Rama before they meet Latika. Salim is against having her travel with them but Jamal insists that she could \\"be the Third Musketeer\\". He invites her to stay with them and they eventually meet Maman, a gangster that exploits children to sing for begging money. Jamal is outside, describing the upper-class life that he, Latika, and Salim will one day have, when Maman sends Salim to get him so he can be blinded and make more money as a singer. Salim tips him off and the two escape Maman, while Latika is left behind, intentionally by Salim. Jamal and Salim spend the next few years on trains, selling goods, pickpocketing and sleeping in the luggage area, when one day they fall off of the train while trying to steal food and re-emerge as adolescents on the ground by the tracks. Early adolescence Jamal and Salim end up as fake tour guides at the Taj Mahal befriending the other slum children of Mumbai and selling stolen shoes from the Taj Mahal. Eventually Jamal persuades Salim to take the journey back to Mumbai so they can find Latika. They ask the locals and eventually, one of the other children from Maman's collection of children tells Jamal that Latika is working as a training prostitute on Pila Street, he also tells Arvind who is on the United States one hundred-dollar bill when Jamal presents him with one. Jamal gets Salim to accompany him to Pila Street despite the boy's warnings and they are quickly reunited with Latika, who is about to leave with them when they are confronted again by Maman, who strongly indicates they are all about to face retribution for their \\"crimes\\" against him years earlier. Salim draws a Colt Python revolver and robs Maman before killing him. The three flee for their lives to a closed hotel. They occupy an empty room, where Salim forces Jamal out, using the revolver once again. Late adolescence and legal adulthood Jamal is working alone in a call center when a co-worker asks him to cover for him so that the co-worker can try to enter the India version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. Jamal takes the opportunity to use the phone and call Salim and they are reunited where Jamal briefly contemplates killing Salim and himself but settles for punching Salim in the face. Salim begs for forgiveness and tells Jamal that Latika is \\"long gone\\". Jamal moves in with Salim and becomes curious about Salim's life as a criminal. Eventually he follows Salim to the home of his boss, Javed, and finds that Latika is married to him. Jamal bluffs his way in, first pretending to be a cook, then a dishwasher. He is let in and confesses his love for Latika, who is moved but unfazed, realizing she can do nothing. Jamal invites her to meet him at a railway station where he will wait for her every day at 5 o'clock. Javed kicks Jamal out, angry with Jamal's poor cooking abilities. Jamal is waiting for Latika one afternoon, when Salim, Javed, and a few other of Javed's lieutenants capture Latika and drive off with her, not before knifing her cheek. Jamal is furious and ends up on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, because he hopes that Latika will see him on the show. He is not intending to get rich, but to get Latika's attention so she may find him again. He tries to stay on as long as he can, answering the questions based on his past experiences. Because he is a \\"Slumdog\\" the host of the show believes he is cheating and his belief is strengthened when he tries to feed Jamal a wrong answer and Jamal still gets it right. He then has Jamal detained before he gets to answer the 20,000,000 Rs. question, and Jamal is tortured and interrogated to explain how he knew the answers. The Police find his explanations plausible and allow him to go back and answer the last question. He is supported by thousands of fans in Mumbai who give him their blessings to win the game. He answers the last question (Who is the third musketeer?) which Jamal never knew. He calls Salim, who has left his phone to Latika. She answers but cannot help Jamal because she doesn't know either. Eventually Jamal guesses, A: Aramis, and is right, but still depressed at his lack of success in re-uniting with Latika. However, Latika finds him at the railway station and they finally can be together, for Salim killed Javed and was in turn killed by Javed's minions. Jamal finally gets his dance with Latika at the end when the two dance with each other, sometimes alone, sometimes surrounded by a crowd and other times in their childhood. The end credits suggest that Jamal was \\"destined\\" to win the money and end up with Latika. Analysis Antonio Sison says in World Cinema, Theology, and the Human that Jamal is \\"the embodiment of the paradoxical character\\" of the slum Dharavi. He says, \\"In his dogged determination to live and to love though the odds are infinitely stacked up against him, Jamal shows himself to be a son of Dharavi indeed.\\" The author refers to Edward Schillebeeckx's theological writings about \\"negative contrast experiences\\" in how such experiences of human suffering \\"enkindles the lamp of resistance, which then militates against the negative experience of suffering\\". According to Sison, \\"Jamal, as a son of Dharavi, represents the human will to live though the social reality warrants suffering and death. The continuum of scenes depicting Jamal's refusal to acquiesce to impossible, oppressive situations, never losing his spirit in his determination to survive and win the game of life, is the locus within which to identify the divine presence, here sublimated in negative contrast experiences.\\" The character Jamal is used as a fictional case in the popular culture casebook Diagnosis and Treatment Planning Skills for Mental Health Professionals. The authors provide a basic case summary and diagnostic impressions and says they \\"describe what we portray as Jamal's clinically significant negative reactions to his exposure to the traumatic experience of police capture and torture\\".

Versions of the song exist in Ireland, Scotland and at times England, and several variants of the lyrics exist. The song variously describes the young man's conscription, the woman's grief at his death and her refusal to adorn herself or marry again, and sometimes a verse where the woman's mother advises her to find a new partner, or an account of the man's ship sinking. Background Several European nations used forced recruitment by various means. The best known example is the dependence of the English Navy on impressment as a means to crew its ships during wartime from the 17th to the early 19th centuries. \\"The Lowlands of Holland\\" probably originated during the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 17th century, and enjoyed revivals in popularity during the Wars of Louis XIV and the Napoleonic Wars. The vegetation mentioned suggests that the song refers to Dutch colonies in the West Indies. A lesser known version of the song, originating from Suffolk and probably a local adaptation, dates to the era of the Seven Years' War, fought in the Low Countries and Prussia/Silesia in the mid-eighteenth century. In this version the singer's love who is leaving is a soldier rather than a sailor; and one of the verses refers to his participation in the Battle of Minden in 1759. At this battle various British regiments advanced to meet the enemy. It is said that as they echeloned forward, the soldiers plucked wild roses from the hedgerows, and wore them in their shakos, as the flowers reminded them of home. The relevant verse of the song runs: > My love across the ocean > Wears a scarlet coat so fair, > With a musket at his shoulder > And roses in his hair.

Downtown Readyville is located along the east fork of the Stones River. Construction was completed on John Bragg Highway in approximately 1992, which provides a more direct connection between Murfreesboro and Woodbury, circumventing Readyville. Formerly, the only way to travel between the two much larger cities was to travel through downtown Readyville. This is no longer necessary, and traffic through Readyville has dropped significantly. Historic Readyville Mill, which was built by Charles Ready in 1812, has been brought back to life after once being burned to the ground after the American Civil War. It is privately owned and open to the public for breakfast and self-guided tours on most weekends. The mill is located almost directly across from the United States Post Office in the downtown area.

The Château d'en-bas (the \\"Lower Château\\") as it was called at first, formed an annex to the medieval château fort overlooking Joinville, a stronghold of the House of Guise that was demolished at the French Revolution. In addition to its grand festive hall, which dominated the interior, were a suite of semi- private rooms to which the duke and duchess could withdraw with their most honored guests; they included a chamber preceded by its antechamber and a more private garde-robe within, but no bedrooms, as the seat of the Duke, the château de Joinville itself, was so near at hand. The Château du Grand Jardin functioned as a banqueting house on the grandest scale, a fit demonstration of the power and prestige of the head of the House of Guise. The site, partly in ruins, was purchased at the beginning of the 1980s by the conseil général of Haute-Marne. The building was restored, and the grand park created in the 19th century has been restored and replanted (illustration). The site has also reacquired its original vocation as a place of culture: concerts of classical music are presented at the Grand Jardin, expositions of contemporary art, and colloquiums. The château du Grand Jardin is currently a member of the European network of Centres culturels de rencontre. Architecture The plan of the château, surrounded by its moat in the usual French manner,For a later château still surrounded by its moat, see Vaux-le-Vicomte. comprises a rectangular corps de logis without wings or outbuildings. Richly ornamented, it combines elements of Italian architectural style, under its prominent French slate roof with dormer windows. The interior is dominated by a vast reception hall. Beneath are wine cellars and kitchens. About 1544 a reception room (chambre d'apparat) was added in the northeast corner, and in 1546 a chapel was built at the southern corner, with a coffered ceiling in the Italian taste. The two ends of the structure contain spiral staircases, with military motifs and the princely monogram enriching the mouldings. The restored parterre planted with exotic tropicals in silver and bronze, combines 16th-century and 19th-century garden styles Garden The remarkable garden, now splendidly restored, once ranked with Villandry, (Indre-et-Loire) and Chamerolles (Loiret) among the great French gardens of the 16th century. Swept away in favor of a parc à l'anglaise in the 19th century, after the site had been purchased in 1856 by the foundry master Pierre Salin Capitaine, then left to run wild, the parterre was entirely remade in the 1990s to give the maison de plaisance a setting suited to its festive character. In a space of about four hectares, its shaped compartments are complemented by squares planted with flowers for the altar and aromatics and medicinal herbs. A collection of 365 fruit trees – in their natural state, or pruned as free-standing, or espaliered against walls, or free-standing palissades en treillageSuch \\"trellis-work palisades\\" are sometimes called \\"Belgian fences\\" by English-speaking gardeners. – enclose the parterre; they include traditional varieties of apples, pears, quinces, cherries, and plums. The English park also remains, as a kind of arboretum of specimen trees that include Chinese Ginkgo biloba, American bald cypresses, Liquidambar and Liriodendron and the dawn redwood Metasequoia. Water is an important element: the spring feeds a canal that traverses the garden and fills the moats, then as a natural brook flows through the park to a small pond. Though the garden was ravaged by the troops of Emperor Charles V in 1544, they were restored for the visit of François I in 1546;\\"Dossier pedagogique: cinq siècles d'histoire au Grand Jardin\\"; the garden in its heyday was described by the poet Rémy Belleau, a member of la Pléiade who was serving as tutor to Charles, son of the marquis d'Elboeuf, as \\"Le plus beau et le plus accompli qu'on pourrait souhaiter… soit pour le comptant d'arbres fruitiers… soit pour la beauté du parterre\\"— \\"the most beautiful and the most accomplished that one could wish, whether for the number of its fruit trees or for the beauty of the parterre.\\"Belleau, La bergerie, \\"seconde journée\\" (1565, published 1572), a bucolic example of the pastoral novel, set at Joinville, noted in the \\"Dossier pedagogique\\" to the gardens Notes External links * Château du Grand Jardin - official site Grand Jardin Category:Gardens in Haute-Marne ","title":"Château du Grand Jardin"},{"id":"23090151","text":"Vino is a lyrical rock album released by Draco Rosa in 2008 under Phantom Vox and a followup to Vagabundo.

Its visual style pays homage to arcade games of the 1980s. A PlayStation Vita port was released in August 2014 under the title Gravity Crash Ultra.http://www.jawltd.com/2013/08/gravity-crash-ultra-coming-to- playstation-vita/ Gameplay The player chooses a planet to visit from a top-level menu, and explores that planet in a two-dimensional side view. The planetary surfaces tend to be riddled with systems of caverns: manoeuvring through them while taking gravity into account is one of the game's principal challenges. Gravity Crash was inspired by three games in particular, Gravitar, Thrust and Oids. The player can choose one of two control modes: in the first, the player's craft can fire only in the direction it is currently facing. In the second, the direction of fire is independent of the craft's orientation, controlled by the second joystick on the controller. As an extra the game includes a shooting mini-game titled Gold Grabber, which is similar to the arcade game Robotron: 2084. Soundtrack The game features music by video game musician Tim Wright, who composed a 16-track remix album and double 'A'-side single to complement the game. Reception Gravity Crash received mostly positive reviews. Play's reviewer stated that the only bad thing was the \\"insane difficulty level.\\"Play magazine, Issue#187, p.87 Edge's reviewer also mentioned the difficulty, calling Gravity Crash \\"A stern, if unspectacular, challenge.\\"Edge magazine, Jan 2010, p.94 References External links * Just Add Water website Category:2009 video games Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Video games scored by Tim Wright Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Gravity Crash"},{"id":"23090221","text":"Orange Ball (オレンジボール), an indies mini-album, was Orange Range's first release.

He was inducted into five halls of fame, including the International Polka Association Hall of Fame as a \\"Living Legend\\" in 1989. He is best known for the songs \\"Memories of Vienna\\" and \\"El Rio Drive.\\" Meisner was known for playing Cleveland-style polka waltzes. Radio personality George Mlay said, \\"No one can play a waltz like Meisner.\\" He released 30 singles and 20 LPs/CDs, wrote over 60 songs, and sold approximately one million records in his career. He toured the United States, Canada, Europe, and Hawaii, playing 200 to 250 dates per year for 40 years. Career Meisner began playing polka music in a band as an 11-year-old after receiving his first accordion as an 8-year-old. He attended dances and learned how to play music by ear after several months of listening to Frankie Yankovic's music on his phonograph. Meisner formed his first band, which began performing in 1950 as \\"Verne Meisner and the Polka Boys\\". He briefly toured with Yankovic in 1955. His first recordings were created in 1957 when the band recorded the original tracks \\"Memories of Vienna Waltz\\" and \\"Polka Dancers Polka\\" on the Paragon Label. Meisner and his band began to be noticed around Milwaukee after they appeared on the Fritz the Plumber Radio Show. They recorded their second record, \\"The 400 Polka and Waltzing in Vienna\\", in 1957 and followed it up with 1959's \\"Pretty Polly and Till I Return\\". When Meisner's National Guard unit was called up in 1962, the band did not release a record until it came out with the LP album \\"A Polka and Waltz Holiday,\\" on Cuca Records. =Halls of fame= Meisner was inducted into five halls of fame. Besides his 1989 induction into the International Polka Association Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Cleveland Style Polka Hall of Fame and the Minnesota Polka Hall of Fame, and received the Wisconsin Polka Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement Award. Meisner and his son, Steve Meisner, were the first polka artists to receive the Wisconsin Area Music Industry (WAMI) award in 1988. Personal life Meisner was married to Judith Ann Kutz and the couple had three children (Steve, Daniel, and Michele Bush) before divorcing. His second wife, Shirley Tyson, died in the 1980s. He suffered from alcoholism after spending so much time performing in bars, but he became sober in his 40s and alcohol-free for the final 20 years of his life. Death He died from melanoma complications on June 10, 2005. He was living in Waukesha, Wisconsin at the time. In his death announcement in the New York Times, the newspaper said \\"Considered one of the titans of polka, Mr. Meisner was a bridge between the classics of the Lawrence Welk era and the pop-infused polkas of contemporary artists.

DVD: Old Friends' residents' races. Old Friends, 2006. Though Ogygian proved his merits at distances shorter than the classic mile-and-a quarter, his pedigree suggested classic distance ability. His sire, Damascus, had won the Belmont at a mile and a half and the Jockey Club Gold Cup, then two miles. His damsire, Francis S, won at classic distance in the Dwyer while that race was still run at a mile and a quarter. Nerud trained Ogygian toward the mile-and-a-quarter Travers Stakes (G1) but scratched him from that race due to a muddy track. Some sports columnists criticized his withdrawal from the race. Few were aware until later that throughout his three-year-old campaign, Ogygian battled chronic trouble from his ankle injury. After he finished third in the Pegasus Stakes (G2), seven more chips were discovered in the colt's ankle. He raced once as a four-year-old, for the first time in his life failing to place.

May 7, 1986. https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/sports/no-breeze-for-gone-west-in- withers.html In all, Ogygian raced 10 times, with 7 wins (4 stakes wins, 3 Grade 1 wins), 1 second place (G2) and 1 third place (G2). Though two other sons of Damascus, Desert Wine and Highland Blade, earned more on the track, and Highland Blade equaled Ogygian's three Grade 1 wins, neither had the distinction of earning them in only ten races. At Stud Retired in 1987, Ogygian stood at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Kentucky, until 1995, where he sired two dozen stakes winners, including Denim Yenem, D'hallevant, Dice Dancer, Digital Dan, Flyn J Bryan, and the speedy but ill-fated Ramblin Guy, among others. While at Claiborne, he lost his left eye in a breeding shed accident. Though a useful sire, he never replicated his own brilliance. In 1995, Ogygian went to East Stud in Japan, where he enjoyed success.

In 2009, Dimitrova qualified for the World Games in representation of the American continent, finished in 2nd place, and made history for Karate in the Dominican Republic and for Female Kata in America. In 2009, Dimitrova decided to form a Team Kata with two of her students (Franchell Velazquez and Heydi Reynoso), and three years later, the team became Panamerican Champion in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  Awards and honors  Dimitrova has been given the award of Karate Athlete of The Year, in recognition from the Dominican Federation of Karate (FEDOKARATE), the Sports Writers Association (ACD) and the Dominican Olympic Committee (COD) six times already, in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013.

During her TV production time, she was able to sign a contract with a European TV Satellite carrier to carry tourism programming to 24 countries in three languages. She describes a passion for TV production, but emphasizes that it's a time consuming task with a heavy toll of dedication for success, just like Karate, which made it very difficult for her to carry on with both projects.

A graduate of Adelphi University and Columbia University Teachers College he also attended the University of Illinois before serving as a combat infantryman in the American Army in World War II. Shapiro taught for many years in the public school system of New Rochelle, New York. It was as an English teacher at Isaac E. Young Junior High School (now Isaac E. Young Middle School) in the New Rochelle public schools that Shapiro, a founder and leader of the local unit of the American Federation of Teachers, began a collaboration with NYU education professor Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner to develop a model \\"school without walls\\" high school. This \\"Program for Inquiry, Involvement, and Independent Study \\" (\\"3Is\\") began operation within New Rochelle High School in 1970. The school eliminated grades, required courses, and required times of attendance and offered credit through seminars, community projects, and independent study efforts.

He also was a founder of Educators for Social Responsibility - Metropolitan Area (\\"ESR-Metro\\"), which became The Morningside Center for Teaching Social Responsibility.

Written by Dick Morgan and directed by Bob Lally, it first aired in the United States on October 19, 1974, on NBC. The episode guest stars Erica Hagen. Plot Will awakens in the early morning to a high-pitched whirring sound which fills the jungle, but eventually it goes away. Rick has Holly build a trap to catch whatever has been breaking into their stores, and Will goes to weed the garden. While outside, he again hears the sound and follows it to the Lost City. Within, he enters a chamber with a very crude-looking attempt to simulate a matrix table but filled with colored stones instead of crystals. On the ground is a pulsating blue crystal that attracts his attention. Picking it up, he sees his mother (Erica Hagen) materialize in a cloud of mist. Afterwards, he returns to High Bluff but doesn't speak of his encounter. The next day Holly's trap has not worked, and Will again hears the sound. Holly hears it briefly as well, but dismisses it. Will returns to the Lost City and again witnesses his mother while holding a blue stone. His mother calls for him, but he is interrupted by Holly, who sees nothing until she touches the blue crystal as well. Holding it together, they are both beckoned by their mother to \\"come home,\\" but then she quickly adds, \\"Too late. Come tomorrow. Don't tell.\\" Will explains to Holly that he wants to tell Rick about his discovery but for some reason he is unable to. Holly replies that she will tell their father if he does not and Will sincerely hopes that she can. Will theorizes that they were looking through a time doorway that is open to a period when she was still alive. When Holly asks why her image is not very clear, her brother suggests that it might be because they do not remember her very well. The next morning the trap has failed again, but both Will and Holly display utter disinterest, and when Rick pries into the issue, Will yells at him and leaves. He returns to apologize for snapping at Rick and while Rick says that he understands, he suspects something. The next evening Will and Holly again hear the sound and are drawn to the Lost City. Rick secretly follows after them. Inside the phantom of their mother again beckons them, this time accompanied by their father, dressed in a suit. They follow him and he leads them deeper into the tunnels. As they walk, his appearance occasionally flickers to that of a Sleestak from the viewpoint of the audience. Rick finds another pulsing blue crystal and see an illusion of his children cheerfully asking them to follow them and see what they have discovered. However, Rick is not easily deceived and angrily smashes the crystal onto the floor. Immediately the image disappears and he sees a Sleestak in the tunnel that appeared to be one of the time doorways. Realizing that his children are in great danger, he destroys the false matrix and chases after the Sleestak. He finds his children being led to the Sleestak god, and takes the blue stone from them immediately breaking the hypnotic spell. Rick shatters the crystal, knocking one Sleestak into the pit and grapples with another finally tossing it in as well. They escape the city and return to High Bluff. Rick surmises that the blue stones allow people to see what they love the most by exerting \\"some form of hypnosis.\\" Holly dismantles her trap, saying it reminds her too much of the trap into which they were nearly caught. Reception The online review site Premium Hollywood described \\"Album\\" in 2009 as a \\"tight installment\\" that shows how \\"twisted\\" the Sleestak can be. Film historian Hal Erickson criticized the episode for its inconsistent explanation of the powers of the fourth dimensional nodes. According to Erickson, the episode probably inspired the episode \\"Dreammaker\\" from the 1991 series.

The field is part of the Paradox Basin that extends from the states of Colorado to Utah and New Mexico. Tin Cup Federal 4-26 Tin Cup Federal 1-35 Water Injection Well The petroleum reservoir is a carbonate phylloid algal lime wackestone to packstone. The fields are mostly algal mounds, with thick sections saturated with oil. Tin Cup Field is approximately long and approximately wide, trending northwest–southeast.  Discovery  The Field was discovered in 1981 by Marathon Oil Company, with the drilling of the Marathon Oil Co., #1-25 Tin Cup Mesa. Initial shut in pressure was 2,046 psig at 5,500 feet. The initial well was completed in both the Desert Creek and the Ismay Formations. Additional development wells were drilled, and a water flood was initiated during 1985 for pressure maintenance. Currently the field is operated by Mar/Reg Oil Company, an independent oil company based in Nevada.  Geology  The field is composed of a natural gas cap, oil column and is underlain by an active water zone. Due to low energy prices during the late 1980s additional field development was stopped. Structural Cross section Algal Mound The field has cumulative oil production of 2.6 million barrels of oil and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The field consists of limestone horizon with vertical fractures that run northeast–southwest. Due to the fracturing, the field is not efficiently drained. Regional setting: South-central Paradox Basin. Producing formation(s): Pennsylvanian-Upper Ismay zone of the Paradox Formation approximately 5,500 feet depth. Additional production is from the Honaker Trail and the Desert Creek formations. Type of trap: Stratigraphic, carbonate algal-mound.

Development Viktor Nikolayevich Belyayev had an illustrious early career with TsAGI, AVIAVnito, Aeroflot, OMOS, AGOS, KOSOS and the Tupolev OKB. He also designed and built several gliders from 1920, including flying wing designs. Belalyev and V.I. Yukharin, at the Kazan Aviation Institute (KAI), designed a tandem seat single engined research aircraft to investigate the properties of Belyayev's forward swept wing with raked tips, used on the Belyayev DB-LK, particularly the resistance to structural instability and aileron reversal. The aircraft was to have had quite sharply swept forward inner wings, with the outer third swept back at a similar angle, all with ailerons, except for flaps on the inner half of the inner wings. Relatively small tail surfaces were envisioned at the end of a relatively long fuselage. The pilot and observer sat in enclosed cockpits, with the observer's cockpit halfway between the pilot's cockpit and the tail unit. Further work on the Babochka was abandoned after the German invasion. Specifications (Babochka)  See also References * Gunston, Bill. “The Osprey Encyclopaedia of Russian Aircraft 1875 – 1995”.

He also designed and built several gliders from 1920, including flying wing designs, and in 1934 he designed a transport aircraft with twin tail-booms each accommodating ten passengers. Belalyev developed the twin boom idea into the twin-fuselage DB-LK, which had two short fuselages either side of a very long chord wing centre section, with the outer wing sections swept forward 5 deg 42 min, tapering at 7:1 out to raked back tips. A large fin and rudder on a short central boom, carried a small tailplane with very large elevators. The airframe was of light alloy stressed skin construction with five spar wings covered with sheet aluminium alloy. Each fuselage pod carried a single M-88 engine in a long chord cowling, driving a three-bladed VISh-23D propeller, as well as a pilot/navigator cockpit and radio operator/gunner station in each of the extensively gazed tail-cones. The outer wings had slats, ailerons and 45deg Zap flaps, the raked tips also had small ailerons. The retractable undercarriage consisted of single main legs in the fuselage pods aft of the engines and a tail-wheel in the base of the fin. Before flight trials began, the test pilot, M.A. Nyukhtikov, carried out many fast taxis to assess the handling of the unconventional DB-LK, one of which ended in an undercarriage collapse. Flight trials eventually got under way early in 1940 revealing an excellent performance, but with a high sensitivity to centre of gravity changes. Production was not authorised.

The building was constructed by a local bridge builder and designed with a unique system of structural support. Because of this, there are no interior pillars to block the view of the stage. The large stage features three female Grecian statues representing Art, Music and Drama. These statues were works from renowned Illinois artist and Shelbyville native Robert Root. In 2009 Landmarks Illinois declared it one of the 10 most endangered historic places in Illinois. The building is in need of extensive repairs which are estimated to cost $1,750,000.

The students are not charged tuition, book fees, nor any other fees typically charged by the university, but transportation and food are not provided for students. Graduating from the Mathematics and Science Academy program grants you a Distinguished high school diploma as well as an Associates of Arts degree, if you complete the necessary college hours. MSA is only the second high school program of its kind; the University of North Texas hosts a similar program, the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science. History The Inaugural Class began its courses in 2007, averaging 18 college hours per semester per student. They were engaged in actual college lectures with normal university students, despite being high school students themselves. Five students of the inaugural class were not able to meet to requirements to stay in Mathematics and Science Academy and were instead forced to go back to their respective high schools. The following year, the second year class of MSA students were admitted. The group of forty students, from all around the Rio Grande Valley, participated in a variety of difficult college classes as well, and most were able to score a GPA of 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale. The Mathematics and Science Academy's third year of students graduated in May 2011, with several of them having gained acceptance to post-secondary schools such as Dartmouth College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Cornell University, Bowdoin College, the University of Texas, and other such prestigious schools. The school aims to remain small, so as to be able to provide individualized attention to each student, though it has experienced growth throughout the past several years. Requirements In order to apply for a slot in the MSA, you must meet the following requirements: * Applicants must be residents of Texas. * The Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT I) must be taken in the sophomore year. The score should be competitive with those of Texas college-bound high school seniors planning to major in math, science, or engineering (1070 composite score for Math and Reading with a minimum of 500 in both areas). * Transcripts of all school work from the ninth through tenth grades, showing excellent grades (more A's than B's), preferably in Honors, GT, and AP courses. * Completion of Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry prior to academy entry. * Evidence of interest in mathematics, science, and/or engineering as a career. This would include mathematics competitions, science fairs, etc. * A completed application, including a student essay and recommendations from a school administrator, mathematics, science, and English teachers. * Have a successful on-campus interview. =Graduation Requirements= Students must complete 60 - 68 required semester credit hours, with a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (B average). A wide range of elective course options are available to students. Graduates receive an advanced high school diploma, including college credits. The MSA academic advisers provide invaluable assistance with college applications and scholarship procurement. Seminar presentations covering college essay composition and other application essentials are offered. Student life Some Academy organizations offer numerous leadership and service opportunities, from yearbook and Student Council, to musical and theatrical groups, volunteer organizations, and intramural athletics. The University sponsors dances, game and activity nights, movies, plays, and recreation, with the Bougainvillea Ball an annual highlight, all available to Math and Science Academy students. Students are at liberty to participate in any of the UTB sponsored organizations and events, and are permitted usage of any and all facilities upon request. =Student Organizations= A wide variety of school organizations exist within the Math and Science Academy, including notably the Chess Club, National Honor Society, Fitness Club, Book Club, Global Culture Club and many others, with more being added each year by subsequent classes of students and others becoming inactive. =National Honor Society= Like many other high schools, the Mathematics and Science Academy does have a National Honor Society chapter. Many students are inducted into the National Honor Society their Senior year at the Academy, and most choose to actively participate in many of the volunteer opportunities offered. Typically holding monthly meetings, the National Honor Society of MSA has been involved in countless activities, from the Gladys Porter Zoo's annual Boo at the Zoo event, to beach cleanups at South Padre Island, and even promoting the use of reusable bags during Martin Luther King day. =Chess Club= President Diego Leal started the MSA Chess Club in late 2008. The first chess team usually met several times a week to practice tactics and strategies. Daniel Hung (FIDE 2100+) was, at the time, the team's chess coach. In the 2009 Scholastic State Tournament in Texas, the first official MSA trophy was won for 8th place. Recently, the team claimed 2nd place in Texas at the 2009 State Championship that occurred in late November. =Staff= The Math and Science Academy Staff consists of a group of three adults, that help coordinate student events, promote scholarly behavior, and push students year after year to work hard. Dr. Wilma Smetter - Principal, Mrs. Michelle Burkott - Counselor, Mrs. Brenda Valero - Secretary. Notably, the school does hire a few Senior-year students to help manage the day-to-day work at the Math and Science Academy, as well as several tutors to help adjust the first-year students into the fast-paced environment at the school.

St. James Press, Advertising Polaner All Fruit is best known for the \\"Don't DARE call it jelly\\" campaign in the 80s and 90s, in which a succession of well-to-do users of the product ask to \\"pass the Polaner All Fruit\\" before a decidedly more uncouth man asks to \\"please pass the jelly,\\" much to everyone's shock and disgust. History Max and his wife Lena Polaner started preserving fresh fruits and picking fresh vegetables before 1900. Together the two had a fruit and vegetable store located in Newark, New Jersey. As a side business they also sold jellies, preserves, sauerkraut, pickles, and many other goods. Eventually Max and Lena extended their business outside of just their neighborhood of Newark and into grocery stores throughout New York and New Jersey metropolitan areas. In 1910, their business needed to expand due to high demand. They ended up moving their business to larger quarters where their ten employees continued to work hard. The business grew to sending goods up to 100 miles away, thus causing another need for an even larger facility and workforce. A new facility was built in 1928 where 30 employees were welcomed into the Polaner family business. Consumers continued to buy Polaner goods for the next forty years. Once again the Polaner business decided to move to an even larger location. To keep up with other preserving plants, Polaner decided to modernize its capabilities. In 1968, the business decided to construct its facility on eight acres of land in Roseland, New Jersey. This facility took on two expansions, one in 1972 and the other in 1978 resulting in an 80,000 square foot facility which is still being used today. Max's grandson, Leonard Polaner decided to introduce the newest innovation in the preserve category, Polaner All Fruit. This new preserve is sweetened only with fruit and fruit juice.

In December 2010, the district administration reported that 273 pupils or 14.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the Bald Eagle Area School District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The Bald Eagle Area School District received a $1,157,713 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011–12, 2012–13, and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 =Gifted education= The district administration reported that 24 or 2.21% of its students were gifted in 2009.

To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Wellness policy Bald Eagle Area School Board established a district wellness policy in March 2009. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 – 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Pennsylvania Department of Education – Division of Food and Nutrition, Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval.

Other grants The Bald Eagle Area School District did not participate in: PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell), Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, 2012 and 2013 Hybrid Learning Grants, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal Stimulus grant= Bald Eagle Area School District received an extra $2,640,228in ARRA – Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009–10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Bald Eagle Area School District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in Bald Eagle Area School District for 2015-16 were set by the school board at 52.8900 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate – land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, major natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2014-15 – 51.5500 mills *2013-14 – 50.5500 mills *2012-13 – 48.5500 mills *2011-12 – 46.5500 mills *2010-11 – 43.6800 mills *2009-10 – 41.9600 mills. *2008-09 – 39.7600 mills. *2007-08 – 37.7600 mills. *2006-07 – 36.2600 mills. *2005-06 – 34.4300 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Centre County residents amounts to about 3.34% of their yearly income. Centre County ranked 438th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., The 2013 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances – Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009.  Act 1 Adjusted index  The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increasing rising health care costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.

Written by Dick Morgan and directed by Bob Lally, it first aired in the United States on October 26, 1974 on NBC. Plot Will and Holly spy a clutch of pink, white, and blue chicken-like creatures and Will tries to catch them, but they are scared off by Holly, who screams after seeing diamond-shaped objects fly around the Pylon. While signaling with mirrors to Rick, Will realizes the Pylon reacts to the light of his mirror, and together he and Holly head to investigate. On the way they witness Spot get eaten by Grumpy. At the Pylon, Will flashes his mirror, causing a small pyramidal piece to fall off. When he picks it up, the piece turns out to be extremely heavy, and seems to have a magnetic aversion to being placed back onto the Pylon, but finally reattaches. A doorway appears in the Pylon, and inside can be seen glowing stones. Grumpy returns from having eaten Spot and chases the children into the Pylon. When he tries to bite it, the Pylon emits an electric shock that scares him away. Rick goes in search of the children, but is forced to hide when he is pursued by Spike. Inside the Pylon, Holly and Will try touching the stones, which cause rain, thunder, and lightning to fill the jungle. After pressing the yellow stone, the storm dramatically increases and trees start getting blown over. Cha-Ka runs frightened to Rick and together they track Will and Holly's footprints. In the sky Will and Holly see the diamond-shaped objects, as does Rick. It begins to hail and Will is trapped by a falling tree. Rick finds them and helps Will out, but the frightened dinosaurs begin to surround them and the family escapes by jumping into the waterhole. While in hiding, Rick discovers that the diamonds are flashing colors in the opposite sequence to what Will and Holly touched. He tries to communicate with them using his mirror, but they seem to offer no response. The Marshalls return to the Pylon and touch the stones in the sequence indicated by the diamonds, and the storm comes to an end. Rick suggest that the diamonds were created by the Altrusians to maintain the pylons. Holly decides to name them Skylons because they resemble the Pylon, but are in the sky.

Development After working as an engineer under Tairov at the OKO in Kiev, Bisnovat was permitted to form his own OKB with the task of designing and building a high speed research aircraft, which emerged as the SK-1. This aircraft was designed to have the smallest airframe capable of flying powered by a large V-12 engine, with the smallest wings possible for safe landings on Soviet grass airfields. Construction of the SK-1 was of light-alloy stressed skin, with single plate web spar wings skinned with light-alloy sheet, smoothed to mirror finish accurate profiles using marquisette fabric, cork dust, open weave and adhesive as filler. Initially the wing was of NACA 23014.5 profile with slotted Vlasov style flaps, and fabric covered ailerons. The tail-unit also had fabric covered control surfaces, and trim tabs, with all controls 100% mass balanced. The M-105 engine was fitted in a low drag installation with a pressurised coolant system which required a radiator of only 0.17m^2 frontal area, (approx ½ that of a similar unpressurised coolant system). In the flush cockpit, the pilot sat on a hydraulically actuated seat which raised the hinged roof of the canopy to form a wind-shield for landing, allowing the fuselage to have a total frontal area of only 0.85 m^2. Hydraulically retractable main and tail undercarriages with fully closing doors reduced drag even further. Test flights began in January 1939 with the aircraft on skis, with surprisingly good handling and manoeuvrability as well as excellent performance.

(2017) \\"Estimates of illegal and unreported seafood imports to Japan\\". Marine Policy, 84: 42–51. . (later revised) The NOAA letter said it \\"strongly objects to the authors’ claims regarding U.S. seafood exports to Japan and doubts the validity of the methodology used to make such estimates.\\" In January 2019 it was reported that Marine Policy had retracted the study, and the article was formally retracted by the editor of Marine Policy in September 2019. The following month a revised version of the article was published in the same journal.Ganapathiraju, P., Pitcher, T.J. and Mantha, G. (2019) \\"Estimates of illegal and unreported seafood imports to Japan\\". Marine Policy, 108: 103439. .

Golden Sun follows the story of a group of magically-attuned \\"adepts\\" who are charged with preventing the potentially destructive power of alchemy from being released as it was in the past. Players navigate these characters through the game's fictional world by defeating enemies, solving puzzles and completing assigned missions to complete a pre-ordained storyline. The original two games, Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age, were released in 2001 and 2002, respectively, for the Game Boy Advance platform. A third game, Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, was released for the Nintendo DS platform in 2010. In Golden Sun, the player plays as protagonist Isaac and his companions as they set off into the world of Weyard to prevent a group of anti-heroes from releasing a mysterious power called \\"Alchemy\\" to the world. Golden Sun: The Lost Age follows the plight of the surviving members from the previous game's antagonists as they continue to pursue the release of Alchemy by means of lighting four elemental lighthouses. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn takes place thirty years later and follows the path of the descendants of the previous two games' heroes as they navigate a world adapting to the presence of Alchemy. The series has received a generally favorable reception by critics. The first Golden Sun game has been widely lauded as among the best games for the Game Boy Advance, with the first game receiving Nintendo Power's Best GBA Game of 2001 and ranking in IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 games ever, as number 94. The Lost Age performed even better than its predecessor, ranking 78 on IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 games ever. Dark Dawn, while still scoring highly on Metacritic's aggregation of critic scores, was less well received. Sales figures for the first two Golden Sun games exceeded one million in the United States and Japan, a figure that Dark Dawn failed to exceed. Common elements =Setting= Games in the Golden Sun series are set in the fictional world of Weyard, a flat and vaguely circular plane whose oceans perpetually spill off the edge of the world's entire perimeter into what seems to be an endless abyss.\\"Male villager: The huge waterfall at the edge of the world is known as Gaia Falls.\\"—\\"Old male villager: Well, at least Gaia Falls will put an end to a few silly arguments. After all, if it's got an edge and you can fall off it, the world is clearly FLAT!\\"— The first two installments, Golden Sun and The Lost Age, center around two groups of magically-attuned \\"adepts\\" who are alternately charged with achieving and preventing the release of a potentially destructive power known as Alchemy on the world. The force of Alchemy was prevalent in Weyard's ancient past, allowing for the development of great civilizations, but this eventually gave way to worldwide conflict that had subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy.In-game text: \\"Ages ago, or so the stories tell, the power of Alchemy ruled over the world of Weyard. Alchemy wrought the base elements of humanity into thriving civilizations, like lead into gold. But in time, man's dreams gave birth to untold strife. Dreams of endless riches, of eternal life, of dominion over all that lived... Dreams of conquest and war.\\" The keys to unlocking Alchemy, four magic jewels named the Elemental Stars, have been hidden within the mountain shrine, Mt. Aleph, which in turn has been guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain's base over the ages.\\"The Wise One: The world will be exposed to the threat of Alchemy. / Garet: Alchemy? A threat? / The Wise One: It can be a dangerous power if it is misused... If the Elemental Stars ignite the flames of the four lighthouses, that power will be released. As long as the four lighthouses remain unlit...\\"— The third installment, Dark Dawn, chronicles the events of Weyard thirty years after the return of Alchemy and the struggles the world's inhabitants face while adapting to their new reality. =Gameplay= alt=An image of series protagonist, Isaac, turning puddles of water into ice pillars to form a navigable jumping route to a new location with Psynergy. In the Golden Sun games, players guide a cast of characters as they journey through a fantasy- themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful magic spells and equipment, and take part in a building, predefined narrative. Much of the game's time spent outside of battle takes place in dungeons, caves, and other locales, which generally require the player to find items that grant the bearer new forms of \\"Psynergy\\", or magical spells, in order to solve the puzzles integrated into their layout. To complete these puzzles, players must either push pillars to construct negotiable paths between elevated areas, climb up and rappel down cliffs or obtain a special item to progress through the story and game world.. Outside of these dungeons and locales, the player must traverse through a large world map as they navigate between forests, rivers, mountain ranges, seas, and oceans. A key element in in-game exploration is the strategic use of the extensive pool of Psynergy spells available, which can be used both for battle and for solving puzzles in the game's locales. A portion of the game's Psynergy can only be used in combat; conversely, many spells are only used in the game's overworld and non-battle scenarios. At the same time, there are Psynergy spells can be used in both situations; for example, the \\"Whirlwind\\" spell that can be used to damage enemies in battle is also used out of battle to clear away overgrown foliage that may block the player's path. The player gains more Psynergy spells as the game progresses, both through leveling up and the acquisition of special Psynergy-bestowing items, and with each \\"utility\\" Psynergy spell the party gains access to more locations and secrets hidden in the game world. Regarding battle, Golden Sun games contain both random monster encounters, featuring randomly selected enemies, and compulsory battles involving set enemies, which advance the story. When a battle begins, a separate screen is brought up where the player's party and enemy party face- off on opposing sides. During a battle, the characters and the background rotate to give a pseudo-3D effect. Players can attack enemies directly using a variety of weapons and offensive Psynergy spells, or by summoning Djinn, powerful other-worldly entities that enhance an attached character's hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform. Djinns can be set to standby, where players forfeit stat enhancements in order to unleash a powerful one-time attack where the player summons an elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy. Plot =Golden Sun and The Lost Age= Three years prior to the start of the game's main story, Saturos and Menardi raid Mt. Aleph with the intent to steal the Elemental Stars, but fail to solve the riddles guarding them and are driven away by the mountain's trap, a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide.Menardi: How could we have anticipated Sol Sanctum would unleash such fury? / Saturos: It's a miracle that even the two of us were spared. / Menardi: That switch... It must have been a trap. / Saturos: But to think it could conjure up a storm this powerful! / Menardi:...Another demonstration of the awesome powers of Alchemy. / Saturos: Regardless, we must not fail the next time we challenge Sol Sanctum. Three years later, Isaac, Garet, and Jenna join Kraden on his research trip to Mt. Aleph and manage to solve the shrine's puzzles and retrieve the Elemental Stars.Dora: Where do you all plan to go today? / Garet: We're going to Mt. Aleph with Kraden. / Dora: Mountain climbing with Kraden, eh? Kids and their games... / Jenna: No! It's part of our studies... / Dora: Ah, yes... Alchemy. They are ambushed by Saturos and Menardi, along with Felix, a previous resident of Vale who was kidnapped during the storms three years earlier. They kidnap Jenna and Kraden and take three of the four Elemental Stars and depart to light the four lighthouses and release Alchemy on the world. Isaac's party is joined by two other young adepts named Ivan and Mia,Ivan: Your quest has been on my mind ever since I left Vault. Remember? I read everything that happened in your minds. I couldn't just leave, not with all these terrible things happening. If I can't rescue Master Hammet, then I want to help you... Please, allow me to join your quest. Mia: Well, I... Uh... I... I'll be joining Isaac on his quest. and together they pursue Saturos' party in a lengthy chase and journey that spans two continents, climaxing in a fierce battle that leads to Saturos and Menardi's death.Saturos: I hope you don't think you've finished us off. / Mia: You may not be finished, but you can barely stand. / Menardi: Right now, yes... But we'll be back on our feet... as soon as we do THIS! / Saturos: (Throws the Venus Star into the Venus Lighthouse well) / Ivan: Oh, no! He threw the Elemental Star into the lighthouse! / Mia: How could this happen... We couldn't keep them from lighting the beacon! / Saturos: That's not all... The energy of the beacon will restore our power. Saturos: How... How... did we lose? / Menardi: We are superior in every way, but still we were defeated... With Saturos and Menardi dead, Felix convinces Jenna and Kraden to join him on a quest to complete Saturos' original objective to activate the two remaining lighthouses that he failed to light. Joined by new companions Sheba and Piers, Felix and his party embark on an epic expedition while pursued by Isaac's party.Jenna: Believe me, I'd love to see Isaac again, but we just don't have the time to look for him. Plus... / Kraden: Even if we did find them, there's a good chance we'd end up fighting them. / Piers: Why? / Kraden: What we are trying to achieve, they are trying to prevent... And they will fight to stop us. Eventually, Felix's party is able to achieve entrance into a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean.Kraden: Ooo! Ooo! Finally! What could be waiting for me in Lemuria? I can't wait another moment! / Piers: Oh, hush. I'll keep a close eye on them. You have nothing to fear. / Lemurian soldier: Very well, Piers. We place our faith in you. Enter freely and peacably. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature: it is the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size and parts of the world to collapse into the abyss.Piers: However, the world seems even smaller now than it appears on Lunpa's map... / Consevato: What are you saying? / Kraden: Time itself has stopped... Think of Weyard as a living, breathing being, possessing its own life force... The four elements are the nourishment needed to sustain this being. / Lunpa: Kraden... This is exactly what King Hydros himself has said to me! / King Hydros: Ever since Alchemy was sealed away, the world has been cut off from its nourishment. It has gone into a state akin to hibernation. Armed with this new information, Felix manages to persuade Isaac and his party to join them, and together they fulfill the goal of releasing Alchemy and preventing Weyard's eventual decay.Mia: I'm just relieved we've sorted out our differences. / Piers\\" Me too, Mia... We could not have stood divided against a common foe. / Garet: Yeah, I guess I'm a little happy that we're not going to have to beat Felix up. / Isaac: Listen, this is Felix's quest now... We're just doing what we can to help out... =Dark Dawn= Thirty years after Isaac and his party of adepts return the power of Alchemy to Weyard, continents have shifted, new countries have emerged, and new species have appeared. However, Psynergy Vortexes, which suck the elemental Psynergy from both the land and the power-wielding Adepts, are appearing all over Weyard. The original games' heroes' descendants – Matthew, Karis, Rief, and Tyrell – set out to solve the mystery of the vortexes, and face a world adapting to the constant presence of psynergy. The game begins with Tyrell accidentally crashing one of Ivan's inventions, a Soarwing, so Isaac sends him out with Matthew and Karis to retrieve a feather of the mountain roc to build a new one. After meeting up with Kraden, Rief, and Nowell, they are ambushed by villains Blados, Chalis, and Arcanus and the party is separated. As Matthew's party travels across Weyard to reunite with Kraden and Nowell, they encounter a deadly eclipse heralded by the lighting of Luna Tower, causing suffering and destruction across the world. They manage to activate an ancient machine known as the Apollo's Lens to end the eclipse, and return home to discover a large Psynergy Vortex sitting ominously near their home.Karis: Ah, it's good to be back! / Matthew: (Point at a large Psynergy Vortex.) Development =Conception= Hiroyuki Takahashi conceived of and developed the Golden Sun games alongside his brother, Shugo Takahashi.alt=An image of Hiroyuki Takahashi during a 2005 interview. The Golden Sun games were created by the Takahashi Brothers, consisting of Hiroyuki Takahashi and Shugo Takahashi, and produced by Camelot Software Planning. According to co-creator Shugo Takahashi, the series was conceived as a way for Nintendo to compete against Sony's PlayStation console, which dominated the role-playing game market at the time. As a handheld title, Golden Sun was originally planned as a single game, but due to both the hardware limitations of putting the entire game on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers' own desire for what they wanted to do with the game, it was expanded to become two successive games, Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age. The Takahashi Brothers had previously designed Shining Force III, where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the \\"good\\" side and the \\"bad\\" side of the characters. Thinking that it was an effective way of conveying the full story of a fictional game world, they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two-game setup of the Golden Sun series, having the player control the \\"good guys\\" in Golden Sun and members of the antagonistic party in The Lost Age. =History= Originally, Camelot planned to create a single title instead of a series, and in the extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for the one Golden Sun game to be on the Nintendo 64 console. When it became apparent the N64 was to be superseded by the GameCube, Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance. Golden Sun games generally have longer development cycles than their peer games on similar consoles due to the series' complex gameplay mechanisms and storylines. Golden Sun, the first game in the series, underwent a development cycle of between twelve and eighteen months by Camelot Software Planning, which is considered a long period of time for the development of a handheld video game, and was described as a \\"testament\\" to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. It was shown in early, playable form at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan on August 2000. North American previewers received the game a few weeks before the release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld. The Lost Age was first revealed to Japan in early 2002, with the magazine Famitsu being the first publication to review the game. The Lost Age was highly anticipated; it topped IGN's list of Game Boy Advance \\"Most Wanted\\" games for 2003. The North American version of the game was playable at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2002, and IGN noted that the opening of the game did away with the slow opening sequence of Golden Sun, introducing the characters in between the action. GameSpot previewed a localized copy of The Lost Age in February 2003, and noted that the game built on its predecessor's graphics engine, with \\"the environments in the game featuring rich detail with little touches— such as birds that fly off as you approach.\\" Golden Sun: Dark Dawn was first revealed and introduced at the Nintendo E3 2009 conference by Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aime, as a series that \\"went dark six years ago\\" but has since been revisited and polished up for the Nintendo DS. The game received a larger development team than previous installments, giving the team luxuries such as visiting UNESCO World Heritage Sites for inspiration. In an interview with Nintendo Gamer in June 2012, series producer Hiroyuki Takahashi spoke about the possibility of a fourth Golden Sun game; \\"A big reason for us making RPGs comes from the requests from all the people who have enjoyed our RPGs in the past. Perhaps if there are enough Nintendo users asking for another game in the Golden Sun series, then this will naturally lead to the development of such a game.\\" =Music= The series' original music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, and his score for the first game in his series was his first attempt at composing music for the Game Boy Advance. The new technology offered by the console encouraged Sakuraba to attempt new styles, resulting in subtle rock influences in the series' music The collection of orchestral pieces that Sakuraba contributed to the series include an overworld theme, several battle themes that play during fight sequences, and a variety of individual themes for the games' various towns and other locales. Sakuraba returned to score both The Lost Age and Dark Dawn, with the latter released on a new platform with updated hardware. According to Sakuraba, the \\"sound design\\" for Dark Dawn was different and he preferred the music in the first two games. He has also expressed a desire for an official soundtrack release of the series' music. Sakuraba also contributed songs to two games in the Super Smash Bros. franchise, among which two were adapted from his works in The Lost Age and Dark Dawn. In other media Elements from the Golden Sun games have made appearances in other media. Isaac, the main protagonist of the original Golden Sun game, is an unlockable \\"Assist Trophy\\" character in the Nintendo fighting game Super Smash Bros. Brawl. When he is summoned during battle by an Assist Trophy item, Isaac uses Psynergy to conjure a large hand three times in succession to shove the player's opponents off the stage. Should enemies attempt to evade, Isaac will turn in sync to attack a selected opponent. In addition, a medley of music from The Lost Age was selected to be on Brawl's soundtrack. The game's sequel, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, did not feature Isaac but The Lost Age medley was featured along with the world map theme from Dark Dawn. However, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate marks Isaac's return to the series as an Assist Trophy, where he now is able to use more advanced tactics in battle and can now be fought, and a costume inspired by him for the Mii Swordfighter was developed. The game also features characters from all 3 titles as spirits including the adult Isaac from Dark Dawn. The characters from the first Golden Sun game also appear in a self-published doujinshi manga titled \\"Golden Sun 4-Koma Gag Battle\\", drawn by various artists and published by Kobunsha. It was released four months after the first game came out and is not officially sanctioned by Camelot. As a result, the manga was only released in Japan.  Reception  Sales figures for the Golden Sun series have decreased with each new installment. The original game sold 740,000 copies in the United States and 338,000 in Japan, while The Lost Age sold 437,000 and 249,000 units in the United States and Japan, respectively. By the end of 2012, two years after its release, Dark Dawn only sold 80,000 units in Japan. The series was met with many positive reviews. Reviewers praised the series' vibrant graphics, high- quality sound, and varied, refined RPG gameplay, with particular optimism on the Djinn-based gameplay system and Battle aspect despite the fact that the original two games were limited to the 32-bit cartridge. GamePro raved that Golden Sun was \\"A huge, fantastic, creative, and wickedly fun RPG that doesn't seem to care that it's 'just' on a GBA,\\" while they praised that The Lost Age's eye-popping magic effects are beautiful even by console standards. IGN, meanwhile, praised the plot's intricate structure, saying that it \\"has been so tightly integrated into every ounce of the adventure... such a rich and deep plot that it's almost easy to get lost if you're not paying attention.\\" 1UP praised Dark Dawn as being a huge step forward in terms of pacing and graphics compared to the previous games. Critics complained that the combat system lacked \\"smart\\" combat; if an enemy is killed before other party members attack it, those members switch to defense instead of intelligently attacking the remaining enemies. They also took issue to the long opening sequences in both games that \\"alienated new players\\" and \\"confused them by swamping them with new characters\\". In addition, some faulted Golden Sun for still relying on the traditional \\"wander around, get into a random battle, win battle, wander around, random battle, etc.\\" theme evident in many role-playing games. 1UP faulted Camelot for being unwilling to \\"trim its fat\\", and noted that all three games in the series \\"tend to ramble on anytime dialogue boxes start to show up. Its heroes and villains have an uncanny knack for saying incredibly simple things with about three or four times the words they actually need to convey those ideas.\\" Game Informer noted that the difficulty of Dark Dawn was greatly dumbed down compared to previous installments and complained that \\"characters level up at blazing speeds\\" while the djinn make \\"even the longest boss battles a cakewalk.\\" In 2001, Golden Sun won the Nintendo Power Award for best Game Boy Advance game of the year. Golden Sun was ranked 94 and The Lost Age was ranked 78 on IGN's Readers Choice Top 100 games ever. In 2007, Golden Sun was named 24th best Game Boy Advance game of all time in IGN's feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's long lifespan, and its Game of the Month for April 2003 due to its \\"amazing graphics and sound presentation, as well as a quest that lasts for more than thirty hours.\\" See also * List of Japanese role-playing game franchises  Notes  References External links *The official Nintendo Golden Sun website *The official Camelot Golden Sun website *The official Camelot Golden Sun: The Lost Age site *The official Nintendo Japan Golden Sun: Dark Dawn site Category:Nintendo franchises Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video game franchises Category:Video game franchises introduced in 2001 ","title":"Golden Sun"},{"id":"23090985","text":"(formerly Nihon Kaiheki Kogyo Co., Ltd.) is a designer and manufacturer of diversified industrial operational switches.

It has a population of 10,000 people. The main source of income of the people of Giao Xuan comes from marine life. Being 40% Christian, there is a collection of churches around the village. The other predominant religion is Buddhism. Xuan Thuy National Park http://www.ramsar.org/profile/profiles_vietnam.htm In January 1989, Xuân Thủy National Park was declared Vietnam's first Ramsar site; a wetland of international importance. The Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve was established in 1995 and was upgraded to a national park in 2003. Located in the Giao Thuy district forming part of the UNESCO Red River Biosphere Reserve, it is a rich, biodiverse, coastal wetland that houses about 220 species of birds (including 9 endangered species), 110 aquatic plants and 500 other aquatic organisms. Many highly valuable types of seafood like shellfish, shrimps, fish, crabs and oysters are also found in this area. It is also a critically important staging area and wintering area for migratory birds visiting and passing through Vietnam from northeast Asia and Siberia to Australia. Visiting It is possible to visit Giao Xuan and do a homestay with a local family in a traditional home. There is a twice-daily bus that runs directly between Hanoi and Giao Xuan. Most homes have hot water and western toilets. The people eat typical Vietnamese food including seafood, pork, rice, and fish sauce. The town has a: Nuoc Mam (Fish Sauce) Making House. Fish sauce is the one ingredient that is quintessentially Vietnamese and it lends a distinctive character to Vietnamese cooking. The sauce is made by fermenting highly salted fish in large ceramic vats for four to twelve months. Rice Wine House: In Vietnamese culture, rice wine is typically enjoyed with every meal. It is customary to invite the whole table to drink simultaneously. Most households produce their own rice wine resulting in each batch varying in alcoholic strength. Jellyfish processing: The jellyfish are freshly caught and brought to the local processing plant and prepared for export or local consumption. Churches and pagodas Cultural performances Local marketplace Near to Giao Xuan is the Xuan Thuy National Park which can be visited by boat along the Vop River or by foot through manrove forests. During migration and staging seasons, rare species of birds like spoon-billed sandpiper (Calidris pygmeus), Nordmann's greenshank (Tringa guttifer), grey-headed lapwing (Vanellus cinereus) and Asian dowitcher (Limnodromus semipalmatus) reside in the park. Eleven species of birds, found within the project area, are listed as globally threatened or near-threatened, including the endangered spotted greenshank (Tringa guttifer), the spoon- billed sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus), and the black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor), the near-threatened Asia dowitcher (Limnodromus semipalmatus), the black-headed ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus), the painted stork (Mycteria leucoephala) and the Japanese paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone atrocaudata), the least-concerned grey-headed lapwing (Vanellus cinereus), and the vulnerable Saunder's gull (Larus saundersi), the Chinese egret (Egretta eulophotes), and the spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis). Rare globally listed mammals existing in the park include the fishing cat (Felis viverrinus) and the finless porpoise (Neophocaera phocaenoides), as well as locally listed dolphin species. Birding tours: River Boat Cruise: Trekking: Eco-Tourism project: Volunteers’ Partnership For Bio- Diversity Through Eco-Tourism Promotion Volunteers for Peace Vietnam http://www.vpv.vn has started this project with the goal of furthering to develop ecotourism within the Giao Xuan—Xuan Thuy National Park communinty so as to provide an alternative, sustainable livelihood, address poverty by creating job opportunities, contribute to environmental conservation by reducing reliance on natural resources for income generation, promote cultural preservation and support community development. The project's three main objectives are: capacity building, raising awareness, marketing and promotional support (see below for details*). Within the park's buffer zone there are five communities with a total population of more than 45,000. These communities rely heavily on the natural resources of the park for food, shelter and their livelihoods. Over-fishing, destructive fishing, and the clearing of the mangrove forests for shrimp aquaculture have resulted in a loss of biodiversity. The national park is experiencing a loss of natural resource habitat and ecological productivity, as well as coastal accretion (sediment build-up). Since 2003, the Centre for Marinelife Conservation and Community development (MCD) http://www.vietnamtourism.gov.vn/english/index.php?cat=0110&itemid;=434 has been working with coastal communities to address the need for alternative, sustainable source of income. Ecotourism has been identified as a constructive way to improve livelihoods and help restore Vietnam's marine ecosystem, and MCD is helping communities develop ecobusiness in a sustainable way working to ensure a future for all. Giao Xuan, one of the five communes in the Xuan Thuy National Park's buffer area, has a population of approximately 10,000 people, (more than 2,000 households). Besides these 10,000 direct beneficiaries, the local communities in nearby areas, visitors, and local and international volunteers will also benefit from the project. The Giao Xuan community will directly benefit from the program because they are the closest in proximity to the areas that will support ecotourism activities and hold the most knowledge of the area and resources. However, the other communes in the buffer zone will also indirectly benefit from the increase in the economic development of the area, or when further development of the ecotourism program will take place. =Capacity building= VPV proposes to place two types of volunteers in the project area to assist in implementation of activities built around the theme of capacity building: long-term volunteers ranging from 3 months to a year and short-term groups for about 2 to 3 weeks. Together with the local community and other stakeholders, VPV's volunteers will actively contribute in planning, implementation and participation of activities. To ensure that volunteers will provide the highest standard of voluntary service to the community, VPV will give pre-arrival training to each volunteer. Training content shall include biodiversity and conservation, social and cultural situation of the communes, basic Vietnamese language skills and ecotourism development in the Park. Guidelines and training materials will be developed for long-term usage. VPV will also provide on-going contact and guidance to the volunteers during their stay in the Park. English teaching VPV's international, long-term volunteers, a great percentage of them with English as their primary language, will give English language lesson to community members, especially those working in ecotourism. The lesson will be on a regular basis, focusing on improving speaking and listening for practical, daily use. Volunteers will produce learning materials for ‘students’ and engage ‘students’ in mock conversations with international visitors. Intercultural and hospitality skills training Long-term volunteers will conduct workshops to train local community on the concepts of intercultural interactions. Real life examples can be given to demonstrate potential misunderstanding between international visitors and local people. Volunteers will lead discussions on how to appropriately interact with visitors to the Park. Volunteers will also provide some guidance on hospitality and customer service. The training can be combined with the English lesson. Volunteering at Visitor Centre and other Tourist Attraction Areas Long and short-term volunteers will offer assistance in tour guiding, interpretation and logistics when there are visitor groups in the Park. They can assist with problem solving when there are communication issues so as to allow the visitors the answers and provide the locals with experience on how to communicate in future situations. The volunteers can also provide this same support in the environmental study program groups. Participating in Tour and Homestay Trials Short-term volunteers will be hosted on mock tours and both long and short-term volunteers will be hosted on homestays. During and upon completion of the tours and stays, the volunteers will critique and provide comments and suggestions on the services they receive. This will also allow the local people with the opportunity to practice their language and communication skills. =Raising awareness= =Marketing and promotional support= Marketing and promotion activities consists of marking segmentation, developing marketing channels, building relations with private sector, producing and distributing promotional materials.

He was the eldest child and only son of Duke Przemysław of Racibórz by his wife Anna, daughter of Duke Konrad II of Masovia. Life After his father's death in 1306, Leszek succeeded him in the Duchy of Racibórz; but, because he was underage at that, he was placed under the regency of his uncle Mieszko I, Duke of Cieszyn until 1308. During this time the Dominican Order was confirmed with the authorization to complete the construction of a monastery in Wodzisław, an event who was celebrate by the Chapter with prayers on behalf of the Duke of Racibórz for all the facilities that he give to the Dominicans. On 19 February 1327, together with other Silesian rulers, Leszek paid homage to King John of Bohemia in Opawa. In 1332, Leszek married with Agnes (ca. 1321 – 7 July 1362), daughter of Duke Henry IV of Głogów-Żagań. The union proved to be childless. On 21 February 1334 Leszek increased his domains with the acquisition of the Duchy of Koźle by the amount of 4,000 pieces of silver from his cousin Duke Władysław of Bytom, with the compromise that, in the event of his death without issue, Koźle return to the Duchy of Bytom. Leszek died in 1336 and was buried in the Dominican monastery of Racibórz. After his death, as a result of the arbitrary decision of King John of Bohemia (and despite the strong resistance of the other Piast rulers in Upper Silesia who were their closest male relatives), the Duchy of Racibórz was given to Duke Nicholas II, Duke of Opava, who claimed the rights of his wife Anna, Leszek's oldest sister.

For its first two years of publication (1843–1844) the newspaper's name was spelled Kmetijſke in rokodélſke novize (using the Bohorič alphabet), and from 1845 onward Kmetijske in rokodélske novice (using Gaj's Latin alphabet). It was established in 1843 by the conservative editor Janez Bleiweis, who later became one of the main leaders of the Slovene national movement. Between 1843 and 1852, it was issued on a weekly basis, between 1852 and 1857 two times a week, and after 1857 again once a week. It was edited by Bleiweis until his death in 1881. Between the 1840s and the 1870s, it was the most influential newspaper in Slovene language and, together with the German language Laibacher Zeitung, the most widespread newspaper in the Slovene Lands. Its role in the cultural formation of the Slovene people was great. The newspaper was crucial in the development of the Slovene standard literary language in the mid 19th century, including the introduction of Gaj's Latin alphabet in the 1840s. Matija Majar's manifesto on United Slovenia was first published in the newspaper, as was France Prešeren's poem Zdravljica, the 7th stanza of which would later become the Slovenian national anthem. Many other important Slovene authors wrote in the newspapers, including Fran Levstik, Janez Trdina, Simon Jenko, and Josip Jurčič. In the beginning, the newspaper was mostly diffused in Carniola, but in the 1850s its readership spread throughout the Slovene Lands. In the early 1860s, it served as the main herald of the Slovene national movement. With the rise of political differentiation within Slovene nationalism in the late 1860s, and the establishment of two rival daily newspapers, the national liberal Slovenski narod (1868) and the national conservative Slovenec (1873), the influence of Novice declined. After the pluralization of the media scene in the 1880s and 1890s, it became completely marginal, and it ceased publication in 1902.

Football career Fleming was born in Leith, near Edinburgh and played for Vale of Leven in the early years of the Scottish Football League before joining the army with the 93rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. On 10 October 1891, Southampton St. Mary's played an exhibition match against the 93rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at the County Ground, Southampton which was lost 2–0. The St. Mary's management were so impressed by Fleming and his team-mate, Sandy McMillan, that they immediately signed them both in order that they might play in the forthcoming FA Cup match with Reading. The FA Cup 2nd Qualifying match was played at the Antelope Ground on 24 October, and ended in a 7–0 victory to the \\"Saints\\", in which Private Fleming featured strongly with his aggressive style of play earning him a hat-trick. At the reception after the match, the Reading secretary asked for, and received, an advance of £3 on the share of the gate money. With this he immediately sent a telegram of protest accompanied by the necessary fee of 2 guineas to the Football Association claiming that the Saints had fielded illegally registered players in Fleming and McMillan. The claim was upheld by the F.A., who found that the players had not been registered at least 28 days before the match, and as the Saints had not complied with the requirements of Rule 5 they were thus expelled from the competition. Fleming continued to play for Southampton until the end of December, when he was posted to India with his regiment. In May 1892, he left the army and returned to England, when he joined Aston Villa of the Football League First Division. He scored twice on his debut in a 4–1 victory over Everton, but only made three further (goal-less) appearances for Villa, before moving to join Lincoln City in October 1892.

On VE Day, White met his future wife, nurse Valerie Leighton. They have two daughters, Bronwen ( Bronwen White) and Rhiannon (Rhiannon White Kirkpatrick) whom they named for characters in The Mabinogion, the book of Welsh mythology. White returned to Cambridge after his military service, and in 1950 he graduated with an Honours degree in English, prehistoric archaeology, and oriental languages, receiving a diploma in anthropology. White's Egyptology studies earned him an offer to work for the Keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Department at the British Museum, but he opted instead to become a story editor for the newly created BBC Television Service, where he read scripts and worked on episodes of his own, including serial adaptations of Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford and his own Witch Hunt, famous - or notorious - for depicting the first, if brief, scene of a group of men and women, all naked, engaged in sexual congress. After a brief stint in the British Foreign Service, White went back to writing for television and film, including five years spent travelling and living in places such as Madrid and Paris, as a script doctor with Samuel Bronston Productions. There amongst other Bronston productions, he made contributions to such epic films as El Cid and 55 Days at Peking. He was also a script doctor on the science fiction film The Day of the Triffids. Later he finished his movie career as Walt Disney's European story editor, based in Berlin. By 1962, White was back to writing for television, including writing an episode of The Avengers (Series 2 episode). Throughout his film and television career, White was a prolific writer of novels and nonfiction, including books on travel, art and anthropology. In 1967 White left screenwriting and the UK behind to move to the United States and become writer-in-residence at the University of Texas at El Paso, where he began the school's creative writing department and eventually became a full professor. Ten years later White was hired by the Department of English at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, where he became the Lindsay Young Professor of English and founded another creative writing department. He was Professor Emeritus at the University of Tennessee, Phi Beta Kappa, a member of the Texas Institute of Letters and of the Welsh Academy.2005 Knoxville Writers' Guild Awards Gala Selected filmography * Mask of Dust (1954) (adapted from his novel The Last Race; released in the US as Race for Life) * A Day of Grace (1956) * The Camp on Blood Island (1958) * Mystery Submarine (1963) (aka Decoy) * Crack in the World (1965) * Naked Evil (1966) (aka Exorcism at Midnight in the US; based on his teleplay The Obi) Bibliography =Fiction= * The Last Race • London (Hodder & Stoughton, 1953) New York (Mill, 1953) Also: made into the feature film Mask of Dust, which White co-wrote) * Build Us A Dam • London (Hodder & Stoughton, 1955) Also: Corgi Books * The Girl from Indiana • London (Hodder & Stoughton, 1956) * No Home but Heaven • London (Hodder & Stoughton, 1957) * The Mercenaries • London (Long, 1958) Also: Arrow Books and Major Books * Hour of the Rat • London (Hutchinson, 1962) Also: Digit Books * The Rose in the Brandy Glass • London (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1965) * Nightclimber • London (Chatto & Windus, 1968) New York (Morrow, 1968) Also: Sphere Books and Ace Books * The Game of Troy • London (Chatto & Windus, 1971) New York (McKay, 1971), Also: Dell Books * The Garden Game • London (Hodder & Stoughton, 1973) Indianapolis (Bobbe Merrill, 1974) Also: Pinnacle Books * Send for Mr. Robinson • New York (Pinnacle, 1974) London (Panther, 1974) * The Moscow Papers • Canoga Park, CA (Major Books, 1979) * Death by Dreaming • Cambridge, MA (Apple-Wood Books, 1981) * Fevers and Chills • Woodstock, VT (Foul Play Press, 1983 - Omnibus edition, featuring Nightclimber, The Game of Troy, and The Garden Game. * The Last Grand Master • Woodstock, VT (Countryman Press, 1985) * Whistling Past the Churchyard • New York (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1992 - collection of short stories) * Echoes and Shadows • UK (Tartarus Press, 2003 - collection of short stories) * Solo Goya • Oak Ridge, TN (Iris Press, 2007) * Rawlins White: Patriot To Heaven • Oak Ridge, TN (Iris Press, 2011) * The Bird with Silver Wings • (Iris Press, 2012 - a collection of musically themed short stories) =Nonfiction= * Ancient Egypt • London (Allen Wingate, 1952), New York (Crowell, 1953) London (Allen & Unwin, 1970) * Anthropology • London (English Universities Press, 1954), New York (Philosophical Library, 1954) * Marshal of France: The Life and times of Maurice, Comte de Saxe • London (Hamish Hamilton, 1962) Chicago (Rand McNally, 1962) * Everyday Life in Ancient Egypt • London (Batsford, 1964) New York (Putman, 1965; Peter Bedrick, 1991, Also: Capricorn Books) * Diego Velázques, Painter and Courtier • London (Hamish Hamilton, 1969) Chicago (Rand McNally, 1969) * The Land God Made in Anger: Reflections on a Journey through South West Africa • London (Allen & Unwin, 1969) Chicago (Rand McNally, 1969) * Cortés and the Downfall of the Aztec Empire • London (Hamish Hamilton, 1971) New York (St. Martin's Press, 1971; Carroll & Graf, 1989) * A World Elsewhere: One Man’s Fascination with the American Southwest • New York (Crowell, 1975) London (as The Great American Desert - Allen & Unwin, 1976) Texas (Texas A&M; Press, 1988) * Everyday Life of the North American Indians • London (Batsford, 1979) New York (Holmes & Meier, 1979; Dorset Press, 1989) * What to Do When the Russians Come: A Survivors’ Handbook (with Robert Conquest)• New York (Stein & Day, 1984) * The Journeying Boy: Scenes from a Welsh Childhood • New York (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1991) =As Editor= * Life in Ancient Egypt by Adolf Erman • New York (Dover, 1970) * The Tomb of Tutankhamun by Howard Carter • New York (Dover, 1972) * Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians by E.

It starred Bhanu Bandopadhyay, Jahor Roy, Kamal Mitra and Lily Chakraborty. The film had music by Nachiketa Ghosh and lyrics by Gouri Prasanna Majumdar. Plot Bhanu Chitrakar (Bhanu Bandopadhyay) is a village- based clay modellist who earns a living selling earthen toys and singing. One day, he is presented a ticket for the Luck Velky Lottery by his Kolkata-based friend Jahar (Jahor Roy), with the first prize for the lottery standing at Rs 395,000. While Bhanu initially refuses to accept the ticket, he is finally coaxed into buying them, and goes to bed with the ticket stuck to his chest expecting the telegram announcing him as the winner to arrive anytime the next morning. Bhanu receives the telegram informing him that he indeed is the lucky winner of Rs 395,000. With Jahar in tow, he goes to Kolkata to collect his winnings. His awkwardness in the big city lead to innumerable faux pas, and things get more complicated for him when Mini Mitra or Mimi (Lily Chakraborty), Jahar's paramour, gives him her undivided attention with the intention of obtaining some of his prize money to forge a film production career for herself. When Jahar finds out that he is being cheated by his best friend, he threatens the latter with a gun. Bhanu escapes, and in the climax of a chase sequence, is shown flying through the air hanging onto a gas balloon, out of reach of his pursuers. The balloon however pops in the end and Bhanu falls straight into the Hooghly. At this point, Bhanu wakes up and realises that the entire Kolkata episode has been a dream. Jahar now comes with the news that Bhanu has won the lottery in reality. But horrified at the thought of sexual politics and the loss of his best friend over money, Bhanu now has no desire for the Rs 395,000 and urges Jahar to distribute his winnings among the needy.

The film is based on author Bruno Apitz's 1958 novel by the same name. The film was remade in 2015 under the direction of Philipp Kadelbach. Plot Buchenwald concentration camp, early 1945. A Polish prisoner named Jankowski, who has been on a death march from Auschwitz, brings a suitcase to the camp. When the inmates in the storage building open it, they discover a three-year-old child. Jankowski tells them he is the son of a couple from the Warsaw Ghetto, both of whom perished. Prisoner Kropinski becomes attached to the boy, and begs Kapo André Höfel to save him. Höfel, who is a member of the camp's secret communist underground, consults with senior member Bochow. He is instructed to send the child on the next transport to Sachsenhausen. Höfel cannot bring himself to do so, and hides him. Jankowski is deported to Sachsenhausen alone. SS man Zweiling stumbles upon Höfel and his friend, fellow communist Pippig, as they play with the child. Knowing well that the American Army is approaching, Zweiling is convinced to turn a blind eye, hoping to present himself as a humane guard to the Americans. His wife tells him to get rid of the boy to avoid punishment by his superiors. Zweiling writes a denunciation letter to the Gestapo, making it appear as if it was composed by a prisoner. Kluttig and Reineboth, two other SS officers, realize that Zweiling was the informant, but choose to ignore it; they begin to search for the child. Kluttig is keen on massacring the camp's surviving prisoners, but commandant Schwahl forbids it, fearing American retribution - although he knows of the secret resistance. Kluttig and Reineboth brutally torture Höfel and Kropinski, but they refuse to tell the boy's whereabouts. The resistance's leaders meet to discuss the crisis, that may bring about an SS crackdown before their planned uprising. They determine to save the child, who is hidden in a barrack. Reineboth takes all the personnel of the storage chamber to an investigation by the Gestapo. Pippig is subject to horrible torture. After seeing his injuries, prisoner August Rose has a nervous breakdown and confesses all. Pippig dies of his wounds. Kluttig raids the barrack, but cannot find the child. The SS plan to evacuate the camp. They order camp elder Krämer, who is also the communists' covert leader, to organize the prisoners for transport. Krämer manages to stall the preparations by pretending to cooperate. Resistance leader Bogorski, a Soviet prisoner-of-war, reveals that he hid the child on his own, where Kluttig would not find him. As the deadline for evacuation nears, the boy is taken out from his hiding. Kluttig enters the room where the inmates are gathered, intending to shoot the child, but the prisoners form a wall around him and force Kluttig to leave. Krämer orders an armed uprising. The prisoners, led by Bogorski, drive out the remaining SS. Most of them survive and flee wearing civilian clothing. Höfel and Kropinski are freed from their cells. Krämer takes the boy out as the camp is liberated.

He later recalled that in the last months before liberation, he heard about a little Jewish child who had been harbored by the International Camp Committee and protected from the SS guards. In a 1974 interview, Apitz claimed he swore that \\"If I will survive, I will tell the story of this child.\\"Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 13. After the war, Apitz resided in the German Democratic Republic, working as a journalist and as a dramatist in the state-owned DEFA Studio. On 27 November 1954, Apitz wrote to DEFA's director-general Hans Rodenberg and suggested producing a film about the child's story. Rodenberg rejected the proposal; officially, it was due to the emphasis laid by the East German cultural establishment on depicting active resistance to Fascism rather than passive suffering. Private correspondence also revealed that studio officials regarded Apitz as insufficiently talented to handle the task.Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 14. Apitz abandoned the idea to make a film and instead, turned his rudimentary screenplay into a novel. He wrote the book from 1955 to 1958.Langford. p. 171. Historian Bill Niven commented that since April 1955, the 10th anniversary of the camp's liberation, \\"the collective memory of Buchenwald's communist prisoners was transformed into the official memory of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany\\", and incorporated into the country's \\"anti-Fascist legitimization myth\\".Niven. p. 3. Apitz's novel Naked Among Wolves was published shortly before the dedication of the Buchenwald Memorial Site in 1958. It turned into an instant success, selling 500,000 copies within a year.Thiele. p. 235. By 1965, it had been translated into 25 languages and had sold 2,000,000 copies.McCauley. p. 96. It was also entered into the East German schools' curriculum.Rodden. p. 54. Apitz won the National Prize, 3rd class, in 1958.Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 27. Already in April 1959, DEFA chief dramatist Klaus Wischnewski contacted Apitz with a proposition to adapt his novel for the screen, but the author was unwilling and made demands which the studio was unable to accept. Representatives of the Deutscher Fernsehfunk station approached Apitz, and he agreed to produce a television film based on his novel, which was broadcast on 10 April 1960. Although DFF did not conduct regular rating surveys yet, the adaptation was considered a success.Heimann, pp. 74-76. The television critic of the newspaper Tribüne published a column praising the series, and called on DEFA to make a version of its own. During 1960, after prolonged negotiations, Apitz and DEFA settled on an arrangement. Director Wolfgang Langhoff was chosen to direct the planned picture.Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 15, 27-28. Being engaged in his duties as manager of the Deutsches Theater, he eventually declined the role. It was then passed on to the young Frank Beyer, who had been working on Star-Crossed Lovers. In early 1962, he and Apitz began working on the planned film.Poss. p. 187. Beyer originally intended to have Ernst Busch play the role of Krämer, but the singer declined because his face was half-paralyzed from injuries during a bombing raid in World War II. Erwin Geschonneck was chosen in his stead.Beyer. p. 39. The director also picked his neighbor's son, the four- year-old Jürgen Strauch, to portray the child saved by the resistance.Beyer. pp. 115-116. DEFA sought out foreign actors for the roles of the foreign members of the resistance, like Soviet actor Viktor Avdyushko, who was already well known in East Germany and cast as Bogorski.Niven. p. 130. A minor part was given to Apitz himself - he appeared as an old man caring for the child who is found dead after the camp's liberation.Thiele. p. 245. Beyer also retained several of the actors who performed in the television adaptation, like Wolfram Handel, Fred Delmare and Peter Sturm, who was called to depict August Rose for the second time. The actor was very reluctant to take the role and had to be pressured by Apitz and the director,Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 35. Sturm, who had been twice incarcerated in Buchenwald, was badly depressed by the work on the film, falling ill after it ended.Thiele. p. 244. Deputy Minister of Defence Admiral Waldemar Verner provided more than 3,000 soldiers to be used as extras. Principal photography took place in Buchenwald - which was partly renovated by the Ministry of Construction for this purposeNiven. p. 127. \\\\- and in the Babelsberg Studios from 4 May to 10 September 1962.Thiele. p. 236. Beyer told historian Bill Niven that the ending scene's score - which was not triumphant, but rather menacing - was the only manner in which he could hint to the existence of the postwar Soviet Special Camp no. 2 in Buchenwald, one of the NKVD special camps that became known to the public only after German reunification. His uncle was imprisoned in one such camp.Wie Stefan Jerzy Zweig seine Idnentität verlor. MDR Interview with Bill Niven. 13 April 2010. 06:30 - 08:00. Reception =Distribution= On 10 April 1963, the eve of 18th Anniversary of Buchenwald's Self-Liberation, the film had its premiere in East Berlin's Colosseum Cinema. It was released in 24 copies in East Germany,Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 46. and sold 806,915 tickets in the first year. By 1976, it had been viewed by 1.5 million people in cinemas, a number which rose to 2.5 million until 1994.Thile. pp. 248-249. In addition, 35mm reel copies were supplied to the National People's Army, the League of People's Friendship and to other public organizations. Private screenings were held in West Germany in April 1964 - for example, by the East-German-funded Uni-Doc-Verleih in Munich \\\\- but although the government never banned it, a local distributor, Pegasus Film, did not purchase the rights to it until 1967.Niven. p. 139. By that time, the film had already been exported to all the European countries, as well as to Canada, the United States, India, Japan, China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Guinea.Beutelschmidt, Steinlein. p. 47. DFF first broadcast it on television in September 1966 and re-ran it five times during the 1970s.Thiele. p. 248. =Awards= Beyer speaks with 280px Naked Among Wolves won a Silver Prize in the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival, in July 1963. Although the Communist Party of the USSR instructed the Soviet members of the jury to award the Grand Prix to the East German entry, Naked Among Wolves narrowly lost it to Federico Fellini's 8½; allegedly, during the thirty-six-hour debate of the jury before the choosing of the winner, members Stanley Kramer, Jean Marais and Sergio Amidei threatened to leave if Beyer received the prize rather than Fellini. Polish member Jan Rybkowski described Naked Among Wolves as a \\"glossing over of reality.\\"Niven. pp. 143-145. On 6 October 1963, Apitz, Beyer, cinematographer Günter Marczinkowsky and art director Alfred Hirschmeier received the National Prize of East Germany, 1st degree, for their work.DEFA chronicle: 1963. On 14 March 1964, actors Erik S. Klein, Herbert Köfer, Wolfram Handel and Gerry Wolf were all awarded the Heinrich Greif Prize, 1st class, in recognition of their appearance in Naked Among Wolves.DEFA chronicle: 1964. The Evangelical Film Guild of Frankfurt am Main chose Naked Among Wolves as Best Film of the Month for March 1968. The West German Wiesbaden-based National Review of Cinema and Media granted it the assessment \\"Valuable\\", its second-highest rating for motion pictures.Thiele, p. 250. =Critical response= A day after the premiere, Horst Knietzsch wrote in the Socialist Unity Party's newspaper Neues Deutschland that \\"with Naked Among Wolves, the filmmakers of our country have fulfilled a national duty. For the first time in German cinema, the human greatness, the courage, the revolutionary fervor and the international solidarity of the political prisoners in the Fascist concentration camps are displayed and set as the main theme of a motion picture... This film will go down in the history of German Socialist cinema.\\"Horst Knietzsch. Ein Lied vom wahren Menschen. Neues Deutschland. 11 March 1963, p. 4. Quoted in Thiele, p. 250. In a column published in East Berlin's Die Weltbühne magazine, Peter Edel noted that while it continued the tradition of DEFA anti-Fascist films like Marriage in the Shadows and Five Cartridges, Naked Among Wolves was the first such to be set in a concentration camp. He called it \\"the culmination of DEFA's cinematic work on this subject.\\"Peter Edel. Das Kind vom Ettersberg: Gedanken über ein kleines Bild und einen großen Film. Die Weltbühne. 8 May 1963, p. 597. Quoted by Thiele, p. 250. Helmut Ulrich wrote in Neue Zeit: \\"Young people - not only they, but they above all - must see this film.\\"Helmut Ulrich. Vom Triumph menschlicher Würde. Neue Zeit, 11 April 1963. Quoted by Thiele, p. 255. Former Buchenwald inmate and Commandant of the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, Major General Heinz Gronau, who viewed the film in a special screening for survivors before the premiere, told Neues Deutschland that he approved of the manner in which \\"the proletarian internationalism was emphasized.\\"Nackt unter Wölfen - ein großer Wurf. Vor der Premiere eines bedeutenden Filmkunstwerks. Neues Deutschland. 7 April 1963, p. 4. Quoted by Thiele, p. 248. The critic of the West German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, who watched the picture in a closed screening held during the 13th Berlin International Film Festival, wrote that \\"it has a wide scope, and fails to cover it all... It does not reach the level of DEFA works like Man of Straw or The Murderers Are Among Us, but is still an honest, well-made picture.\\"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. 11 July 1963. Quoted by Thiele, p. 252. Karl Feuerer from the Hamburg-based Die andere Zeitung wrote in 1964: \\"As long as the Brown past is not overcome... And people such as Globke and Bütefisch cling to their positions of power... Such pictures are required.\\" Thiele. p. 253. In 1968, after it was released in the Federal Republic, Hellmut Haffner from Hamburg's Sonntagblatt commented that \\"today, it may take five years until a film from Germany arrives in Germany.\\"Hellmut Haffner. Nackt unter Wölfen. Sonntagblatt. 28 April 1968. Quoted by Thiele, p. 255. Die Welt critic Friedrich Luft commented: \\"The exclusive appearance of the communists in the best roles... Makes the film all too partisan. Thus, one remains skeptical of its important moral more than one would wish. It is a pity that a DEFA film has to be taken in this manner, especially in this case.\\"Friedrich Luft. Das Kind von Buchenwald: der DEFA- Film Nackt unter Wölfen läuft jetzt auch im Westen. Die Welt. 20 July 1968, p. 4. Quoted by Thiele, p. 255. The critic of the Greek newspaper Ethnos complained that the film presented \\"a nice, well-tended Buchenwald, where only the disobedient and the communists are punished severely.\\"Ethnos. 10 March 1964. Quoted and translated by Niven, p. 142. The reviewer of Ta Nea commented: \\"All the 'terrible things' we see in the studio version are not even a pale imitation of Buchenwald's reality... Of course the film was made by Germans, but does it give them the right to talk about the noose without mentioning the victims?\\"Ta Nea. 10 March 1964. Quoted and translated by Niven, p. 142. Penelope Gilliatt, who reviewed the film for The Observer, commented that it was \\"an artistic micro-cosmos of the German situation from an East German perspective... Well photographed and better than it might have been.\\"Penelope Gilliatt. That Sinking Feeling. The Observer. 16 August 1964, p. 21. Quoted by Heimann, p. 98. Philip Oakes of The Sunday Telegraph opined that Naked Among Wolves was \\"rough, gory and realistic, but above all meant to serve as entertainment\\", that it contained \\"propaganda\\" and was \\"a violent variation of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\\"Philip Oakes. Review. The Sunday Telegraph. 16 August 1964. Quoted by Heimann, p. 98. The New York Times reviewer Bosley Crowther wrote on 19 April 1967: \\"Another torturing recollection of the horrors of the camps... is rendered a bit less torturing by a fresh and hopeful theme in Naked Among Wolves.\\"Bosley Crowther. The Screen: Death Camp; 'Naked Among Wolves' at 34th Street East. New York Times. 19 April 1967. =Analysis= Martina Thiele remarked that \\"Naked Among Wolves is not a holocaust film in the strict sense, but rather a 'testimony of anti- Fascism'.\\" The picture emphasized the international solidarity of the communists, and the racial classifications in the concentration camp were largely overlooked.Thiele. p. 264. Daniela Berghahn wrote that, as official East German discourse about the wartime persecution of Jews was subject to a Marxist interpretation of history, the topic was marginalized; in addition, the politics of the Cold War and the Arab-Israeli Conflict made the theme highly sensitive. Berghahn commented that the child was not in the center of the plot, but served as an \\"infantile victim\\" who had to be protected by the \\"communist heroes... Beyer's film reaffirms the official GDR conception of the Holocaust.\\"Berghahn. p. 88. Thiele also noted that the word 'Jew' is barely mentioned in the film or in the novel, mostly as part of antisemitic slurs used by the antagonists.Thiele. pp. 264-5. Bill Niven concluded: \\"It is not Jews who are seen to suffer, but Germans - for a Jew. Resistance and victimhood reside with Pippig, Höfel and Krämer.\\"Niven. p. 142. Naked Among Wolves was centered on the inner conflicts of individual persons, unlike earlier films from the 1950s about the history of the wartime resistance. Thomas Heimann remarked that \\"Beginning from 1960... A new generation of directors, Beyer among them, sought to redress the past in a manner somewhat less conforming to the official view of history... The emphasis was laid on the individual stories... Of the anti-Fascists.\\"Heimann. p. 74. Paul Cooke and Marc Silberman wrote that Naked Among Wolves, like all DEFA's works, \\"was closely aligned to the state's official historiography and reflected changes in the Party's agenda... A canonical text.\\";Cooke, Silberman. p. 166. Anke Pinkert commented that \\"with a younger postwar audience in mind... The films of the early 1960s... Including Naked Among Wolves... Aimed at a more realist approach to history\\".Pinkert. p. 147. Thiele pointed out that the one of the important aspects of the plot was that André Höfel's decision to save the child was done in contradiction to party resolutions: \\"Marcel Reich-Ranicki's explanation to the success of the novel can be also used in regards to the film - in a country in which one of the most popular songs was called The Party is Always Right, people were thankful for a story hinged upon the disobedience of a comrade.\\"Thiele. p. 261. However, the picture still conveyed conservative messages: the film's hero, Krämer, leader of the communists in Buchenwald, is contrasted with the character of August Rose, who betrays his friends. While Rose is portrayed sympathetically, he is a coward nonetheless. Rose is not identified as a communist; according to Thiele, \\"he is obviously implied to be a Social-Democrat.\\"Thiele. p. 246. Another figure was that of Leonid Bogorski, granted a more prominent role than in the novel: Bogorski saves the child completely on his own, a feat which he performs with others in Apitz's original; he also heads the uprising.Heimann. p. 80. Klaus Wischnewski, DEFA's chief dramatist, told that he was disturbed by the \\"stereotypical leadership role which the Soviet Bogorski occupies.\\"Schenk. p. 178 Thomas Heimann remarked that Bogorski, who acts as the plot's deus ex machina, represents the \\"higher authority and wisdom of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.\\"Heimann. p. 81. Another motif was the flight of the SS officers, who are all seen leaving the camp unharmed, most of them in civilian clothing which they have prepared beforehand. Many reviews of the film in East Germany stressed that the former war criminals had little to fear in the Federal Republic.Thiele. p. 252. Bill Niven wrote that the suggestion that the SS fled to West Germany was accentuated in the film more than in the novel, although Beyer was careful not to make explicit parallels between the camp and the FRG.Niven. p. 133. Daniela Berghahn remarked that \\"the film's production history illustrates how the 'Jewish question' was utilized for political ends\\": in the early 1960s, during and after the Eichmann Trial, the SED sought to \\"maximize the propaganda value in a campaign to remind the world that many former Nazis were living in West Germany.\\" =Historical accuracy= The Buchenwald Group, a bronze statue by 280px Apitz had presented his novel as a fictional story based on true events: in the foreword, he dedicated Naked Among Wolves to \\"our fallen comrades in arms from all nations... In their honor, I have named many of the characters after some of them.\\"Thiele. p. 235 In 1964, the East Berlin-based Berliner Zeitung am Abend located the child upon whose story the novel was based: Stefan Jerzy Zweig, who survived Buchenwald at the age of four with his father Zacharias, with the help of two prisoner functionaries: Robert Siewert and Willi Bleicher. Bleicher, a former member of the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) and the kapo of the storage building, was the one who convinced the SS to turn a blind eye to the child. When Zweig was to be sent to Auschwitz, prisoners who were tasked with compiling the deportees' list erased his name and replaced him with Willy Blum, a sixteen-year-old Sinto boy. Zweig moved to Israel after liberation, and later studied in France. After he was discovered to be the 'Buchenwald child', he settled in East Germany, where he remained until 1972. Zweig received much media and the public attention in the country. Blum's fate was only disclosed after the German reunification.Niven. pp. 151-178, etc. The self-liberation of Buchenwald, celebrated in East Germany on 11 April, held an important status in national consciousness since the late 1950s, even before the publication of the novel. As shown in the film, the communist prisoners, who had organized a secret resistance network, were purported to have risen up against the SS and liberated themselves before the arrival of the American forces. While the Buchenwald Resistance did exist, it was not dominated solely by communists and its role in the camp's liberation, as well as its conduct in the years before, was greatly embellished for propaganda purposes.Niven. p. 2, etc. References Bibliography *Bill Niven.

He painted in a flat, stately style, and was influenced by French Symbolism. He also worked in stained glass, most probably learning from his father, Edward Frampton, who was a stained-glass artist. His work usually depicted symbolic subjects and landscapes; early in his career he made sculpture.  About  Early in his career he devoted himself to landscape painting; after a lengthy stay in France and Italy, and after seeing an exhibition of the collected works of Sir Edward Burne-Jones he chose to concentrate on illustrating the human form. All his larger and more important compositions have been figure subjects. Mr. Frampton considered himself to have been influenced both by primitive Italian painting and the English Pre- Raphaelite design, and also by the compositions of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.

It was declared a national monument on 16 February 1983. 16th–20th centuries The charterhouse was founded in 1563 by Hernando de Aragón, Archbishop of Zaragoza and grandson of the Catholic Monarchs. The architecture of the enclosed monastery was designed by Martín de Miteza to house thirty-six monks, a complement three times larger than the usual Carthusian community. This monastery, like most in Spain, was closed in 1836, and the monks expelled. The monastery was re-purchased in 1901 by the Carthusians for the exiled French communities of Valbonne and Vauclaire Charterhouses, who arrived in that year in Spain and occupied Aula Dei in 1902. View of the Charterhouse. Frescoes The major interior decoration consists of a cycle of 11 large frescoes round the monastic church on the Life of the Virgin painted between 1772 and 1774 by Francisco Goya. Only 7 of the original 11 frescoes now remain. The interior of the church, as would be expected for an enclosed community, was open until August 2012 to selected visitors only for a few hours each month. Because of the building's history of limited access, the frescoes remain largely unstudied, despite being perhaps Goya's most impressive early work.\\"Goya\\", 2003, by Robert Hughes - pages 40-41 21st century The Carthusian monks left the monastery in August 2012, but asked the Chemin Neuf Community to come and continue their mission of praying and welcoming the visitors.

He was born in Lebanon, New Hampshire on October 25, 1817. He graduated from Rensselaer in 1842. He taught mathematics at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland from 1843-46. He married in 1848 but his wife died two years later. In 1846, he was appointed senior professor at Rensselaer, replacing George Hammell Cook, who served as senior professor since the death of Amos Eaton in 1842. He conducted an extensive study of the technical schools of Europe, such as the École Polytechnique of Paris and the Polytechnisches Institut in Vienna. He wrote an extensive report describing the European schools and the changes he felt were appropriate. He envisioned changing the school from a one-year graduate program to a comprehensive undergraduate program. The plan also including relocation of the school from downtown to a thirty-acre site on a hill. However, the plan was not entirely successful. It was estimated later that his plans would have required between one and two million dollars, which was an enormous amount at the time. For instance, it proposed a school of architecture at a time when there was no such school anywhere in the U.S. However, the school of architecture was not established until 1929. When its new home was completed in 1931, it was named the Greene Building in his honor. In 1850, he formally became director of Rensselaer. (He used the title as early as 1847 but it was not formal until the state legislature created the title in 1850.) In 1851, he changed the name of the school from Rensselaer Institute to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The name was officially changed by state legislation in 1861. Greene resigned from Rensselaer in 1859 after disagreements with the board of trustees. He then started a competing engineering school, but it failed after three years. He was chief clerk of the U.S. Navy Bureau of Navigation from 1863–73 and then a professor of mathematics in the U.S. Navy. He died in West Lebanon, New Hampshire on November 22, 1895.

He was Professor Emeritus of Astronomy at Swarthmore College. He specialised in the characterisation of binary stars using astrometry. Life Wulff-Dieter Heintz was born in Würzburg, Germany on 3 June 1930. He earned his doctorate in astronomy from the University of Munich in 1953. He did research at the University Observatory Munich's Southern Station on Mount Stromlo in Australia. Peter van de Kamp invited him to the Sproul Observatory to be a visiting professor in 1969. He subsequently joined the staff and became observatory director upon the retirement of van de Kamp in 1972. He remained a German citizen. He was an avid and expert chess player and authored a book on the game in German. The Barnard's Star affair Peter van de Kamp, Wulff's predecessor at Swarthmore, made claims since the 1960s of a planetary system around Barnard's Star. After van de Kamp's retirement in 1972, the photographic plates made using the Sproul refractor telescope were shown to be flawed, affecting Van de Kamp's Barnard's Star claim as well as claims of planetary systems around other near-by stars made at the same time by staff astronomer Sarah Lippincott. Upon his assumption of directorship in 1973, Wulff began questioning the findings of his former colleague and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards; Van de Kamp never admitted any error and the two friends are reported to have become estranged over this affair. Later life and death Heintz retired from active teaching in 1998 but remained a frequent and popular guest at the college. He died on 10 June 2006, in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania after a two-year battle with cancer. He was 76.

McCain to claim a bigger legacy than the one he has now.\\"http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/05/11/20100511mccain- immigration-advocates-politico.html =Homosexuality= Bishop Carcaño has long been a supporter of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender (GLBT) community, including support of the Reconciling Ministries Network and other organizations seeking GLBT recognition within United Methodism. She has assured those working to change the official policy of the denomination that \\"We are working hard to create an inclusive church, confronting resistance to even conversation. Some of our colleagues are in the place of fear. But all I expect is integrity and respect in the conversation.\\"http://www.rmnetwork.org/storage/RMNETWORK//files/UMOC.pdf During the 2008 General Conference of the United Methodist Church, Bishop Carcaño joined other Bishops and delegates in a witness in favor of full inclusion of gays and lesbians within the denomination. In an article introducing newly elected Bishop Carcaño to the Phoenix Area, The Arizona Republic noted that she ‘supports full inclusion of gay and lesbian church members, including gay marriage.’The Arizona Republic, July 31, 2004 She was one of many clergy who publicly opposed and helped defeat Arizona Proposition 107 (2006) (which sought to ban gay marriage). In May 2011, Bishop Carcaño participated in the Human Rights Campaign's Clergy Call for Justice and Equality in Washington, DC. At a rally for the event, the Bishop's comments included: :\\"Hate and violence against persons, whether it is bullying in our schools, the taunting and violating of a person's privacy to the point of humiliating that person and destroying his or her sense of self worth and belonging, to beatings and even murder on our streets or on the outskirts of our towns, all because of a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, cannot be left unchallenged or unconquered. Such violence against our lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sisters and brothers is a violation of all that is good within us, and destroys the inherent human dignity of all of us.\\" Interfaith Advocacy In 2012, Carcaño was recognized by the Arizona Interfaith Movement (AZIFM) as a person who has \\"demonstrated 'living out' the Golden Rule objectives in their daily interaction with people and institutions in the community.\\" She was honored at the 7th Annual Golden Rule Banquet in March 2012.http://firstumcphoenix.org/clientimages/46826/minutes/church%20council%20minutes%202-28-12.pdf Among the Bishop's Interfaith Advocacy acknowledged by AZIFM is her commitment to Immigration Reform and her work across religious and denominational boundaries to work with both local and national leaders, calling \\"upon Congress to take the moral and right first step to much needed humane immigration reform.\\" Her initiative in organizing interfaith cooperation also includes her 2011 coordination of a variety of local Tucson religious leaders in joining together for an interfaith prayer service after the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Bishop Carcaño also serves on the Board of the Claremont School of Theology, the \\"convening partner\\" school of Claremont Lincoln University. Claremont Lincoln is a multireligious university that seeks to find \\"the common threads among religious and ethical traditions -– while honoring the distinctiveness of each.\\" References External links * Bishop Carcaño comments on SB 1070, May 21, 2010 * A message by Bishop Carcaño on SB 1070, July 29, 2010 * Bishop Minerva Carcaño: \\"Hope Beyond Ourselves\\" General Conference, April 27, 2008 * Interfaith Immigration Coalition, February 12, 2009 (UnitedMethodistTV) * Bishop Carcaño sermon transcripts * Immigration Concerns Build Bridges (Elliott Wright article in the Global Ministries News Archives) Posted December 5, 2006 * Transcript of Lou Dobbs interview with Bishop Carcaño CNN (Aired August 16, 2006) * Additional pictures of Bishop Carcaño See also * List of bishops of the United Methodist Church Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American United Methodist bishops Category:Female Methodist bishops Category:People from Edinburg, Texas Category:Perkins School of Theology alumni Category:University of Texas–Pan American alumni Category:21st-century Methodist ministers Category:20th-century Methodist ministers ","title":"Minerva G.

JACK Intelligent Agents was built by Agent Oriented Software Pty. Ltd. (AOS) and is a third generation agent platform building on the experiences of the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) and Distributed Multi- Agent Reasoning System (dMARS). JACK is one of the few multi-agent systems that uses the BDI software model and provides its own Java-based plan language and graphical planning tools.  History  JACK Intelligent Agents was initially developed in 1997 by ex-members of the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII or A2I2) who were involved in the design, implementation, and application of PRS at SRI International and/or dMARS at the AAII. The JACK platform was written for commercial application of the multi-agent paradigm (a COTS product) to complex problem solving and was the basis for starting the company Agent Oriented Software (AOS) where it remains the flagship product.  Features  JACK Intelligent Agents is a mature commercial multi-agent platform that has been under active research, development, and domain-specific application for more than 10 years. The following provides a listing of the platform's key differentiating features. * Agent Run-time: The core of the platform is an extensible multi-agent run- time. Once domain specific agents, plans, events, capabilities, etc. are specified the JACK kernel manages the execution the system including message passing, reasoning, and meta-reasoning. * JACK Plan Language (JPL): JACK provides an agent-specific plan language for writing JACK plans (the discrete reasoning executed by agents). The plan language is an extension to the Java and offers commands such as @send and @post for inter-agent messaging, as well as the management of actions, sub-tasks and maintenance of conditions. Plans are compiled into Java classes for execution in the JACK run-time offering speed and correctness of execution. * Belief-Desire-Intention Model: In addition to a classical (non-BDI) agent model, the platform realizes the BDI software model, where beliefs are managed by beliefsets encapsulated within agents, desires are the goal states an agent is aspiring to achieve, and intentions are the meta-reasoning and plan-based reasoning the JACK agents use to achieve the current goal. * Capabilities: The platform provides capabilities which are abstractions of common behaviors manifest as a complex of plans and events. Capabilities provide a way of conceptually bundling common behaviors and actions and re-using them between agents. * JACK Development Environment (JDE): Multi-agent systems can be written in Java code and the JACK plan language in a standard IDE, although the platform provides an agent-centric IDE called the JACK Development Environment or JDE. The JDE provides graphical tools for writing plans, connecting plans to agents, managing inter-agent communication, as well as compiling and running. The JDE also provides graphical tools for debugging and tracing the execution of plans and inter-agent message passing. * Graphical plans: A key feature of the JDE is the facility to write and manage graphical plans. These are the discrete reasoning performed by an agent represented graphically as a flow chart, allowing a programmer to manage the code performed in each step of the reasoning graph, and the subject matter expert to manage the logical flow of the reasoning based on the human-readable documentation on each node. * JACK Object Modeller (JACOB): An object serialization technology used by the JACK run-time for object initialization and inter-process communication. Java objects are serialized to human-readable ASCII text, not too dissimilar to YAML and XML. * Platform Independence: The JACK platform is written in Java, allowing the deployment of JACK multi-agent systems onto the wide array of platforms that support the Java Virtual Machine. Currently JACK can be installed on Microsoft Windows operating systems only using a 32-bit Java Virtual Machine but works also on a 64-bit Java Virtual Machine. On the most recent versions of Mac OS X operating systems (starting from Mac OS X Lion) JACK can be installed only using a console installer.  Extensions  The JACK platform has been extended a number of times since its inception. Most of the extensions, such as JACK Teams and CoJACK were developed by or in collaboration with AOS. * JACK Teams: An extension to the BDI software model that facilitates agents collaborating in teams toward achieving a goal. Like JACK, JACK Teams supports its own plan language in what AOS refers to as Team- oriented programming. JACK Teams is integrated into and available as a part of the JACK Intelligent Agents platform. * CoJACK: An extension to the JACK platform that adds a cognitive architecture to the agents for eliciting more realistic (human-like) behaviors in virtual environments. * FIPA JACK: An extension to the JACK platform to support the FIPA Agent Communications Language. * Prometheus: An agent-centric software engineering methodology for managing the SDLC of a multi-agent-based system. JACK was used as the basis for investigation, comparison, and testing the methodology. The Prometheus involved the development of the Prometheus Design Tool (PDT) which was a GUI- based tool for managing design concerns in the process. * JACK Eclipse Plug- in: A plug-in that facilitates the development of JACK-based systems in the Eclipse IDE. Specifically, the plug-in adds capabilities to Eclipse to support the JACK file types (such as .plan, .agent, etc.) as well support for JACK plan language. * JACK WebBot: An extension that embeds the JACK kernel in the Apache Tomcat web server allowing intelligent agents to be interacted with and formulate responses HTTP requests (via the Java Servlet API).

The plan was submitted to the Government of Australia for funding approval. It was prepared in response to and largely centred on solutions to urban transport problems in Victoria's capital Melbourne, particularly alleviating growing traffic congestion and passenger congestion on public transport (trains) as a result of a 100% increase in public transport patronage during the 2000s (decade). The plan followed several previous transportation strategies including Linking Victoria, Linking Melbourne: Metropolitan Transport Plan and Meeting our Transport Challenges as well as major studies including the Eddington Transport Report. The plan was shelved in January 2011 by the incoming Baillieu government, with the projects contained in it to be reviewed by the soon-to-be-established Victorian Public Transport Development Authority. $6 million of taxpayer funds were spent promoting the plan during the two years it was in place, including television, radio, newspaper, online and outdoor billboard promotions. These advertisements were described by one newspaper columnist as \\"Stalinist-style propaganda\\". Overview The Victorian Transport Plan had six main goals which it aimed to achieve through extensive expansion of the public transport network and road system, and improvements made to existing roads and rail services, as well as dealing with changes in the way people travel around Melbourne and Victoria. These 6 main goals were: # Shaping Victoria by integrating current services with new and existing land developments. This involves de-centralising Melbourne from the current CBD and investing in 6 'Central Activities Districts'. It also involves supporting growth in regional and rural Victoria as well as expanding the use of the current transport network. # Linking rural, regional and metropolitan Victoria involves creating better links between rural and regional centres through investment in rail and road services. # Creating a Metro system by investing heavily in expanding the existing rail network in Melbourne, as well as upgrading and improving punctuality, cleanliness and capacity. The centrepiece of this involves the construction of a metro rail tunnel as well as new trains, trams and stations all across Melbourne. # Moving around Melbourne involves better integration of current and future services of rail, bus and road services and significant improvements and expansion of the existing freeway and road network. This also involves the construction and improvement of bike trails around Melbourne # A sustainable future is planned by investing in alternative modes of transport to work such as cycling, scooters and walking as well as setting mandatory emissions targets for new cars. # Strengthening Australia's and Victoria's economy by investing and supporting the movement of good across Victoria more efficiently and supporting the creation of jobs through the construction of new roads and rail projects. The delivery of these goals was to occur via the implementation of projects across Victoria, in particular, Melbourne, by setting short, medium and long term time frames for project delivery. Many of these projects were not fully costed and most were subject to further negotiations with the Federal government about funding, and the capacity of future state budgets to provide additional funds into the future. Diagram showing Melbourne's rail network, including former and planned lines Projects The Victorian Transport Plan involved more than $38 billion in projects. Major initiatives included: * New trains and new tracks – an investment of more than $2.6 billion * More trams and buses – $1.5 billion for 50 new low-floor trams and up to 270 new low-floor buses * Regional Rail Link – more than $4 billion for a new track from West Werribee to Southern Cross station * Melbourne Metro Rail Project – a new rail tunnel between the city’s west and east, costing more than $4.5 billion * Better regional roads * An alternative to the West Gate Bridge – more than $2.5 billion to build the East-West road connection as a new tunnel under the Maribyrnong River * Shaping Victoria – $60 million to bring jobs and housing together * Truck Action Plan - $380 million to remove trucks from residential streets in the inner west * Completing the missing link in Melbourne's ring road - more than $6 billion for the North East Link between the Metropolitan Ring Road to the Eastern Freeway * Peninsula Link - $750 million to link EastLink and the Mornington Peninsula Freeway * Regional Rail – $600 million to return trains to Maryborough and for up to 74 new V/Line carriages * Extension of the Metro Electrified Rail Network to South Morang, Sunbury, Melton and Cranbourne East to provide more transport choice in growth areas * Removal of one level crossing at Springvale Road, Nunawading.  Transport Integration Act 2010  The Victorian Transport Plan is alluded to in the Transport Integration Act, Victoria's prime transport statute. The Act requires the Department of Transport – at the time of the Plan, in its 2008 iteration – to \\"...prepare and periodically revise...\\" the plan.Section 63, Transport Integration Act 2010. This is the first legislation in Victoria to mandate the preparation of a transport plan for the state. The Transport Integration Act requires that the plan be revised having regard to the vision statement, transport system objectives and decision making principles set out in the Act. The Act also requires that the plan include medium to long term strategic directions, priorities and actions and demonstrate an integrated approach to transport and land use planning.

Bartini was assigned to the ZOK NII GVF (Zavod Opytno Konstrooktorskoye Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Grazhdanskovo Vozdooshnovo Flota — Factory for Special Construction at the Scientific Test Institute for the Civil Air Fleet), to lead the design of the DAR. Built entirely of Enerzh-6 stainless steel, the DAR closely resembled the Dornier Wal, with a high length to beam ratio hull, sponsons either side of the hull, strut supported parasol wing and twin engines in a single nacelle in the centre of the wing. Initially Bartini intended the two engines to drive separate propellers running in a tubular shroud, much like a modern ducted fan; Tests at TsAGI (Tsentrahl'nyy Aerodinamicheskiy i Ghidrodinamicheskiy Institoot - central aerodynamics and hydrodynamics institute) confirmed Bartini's theories but the prototype was completed with a conventional tandem tractor/pusher engine nacelle. Apart from the 'Enerzh-6' construction material, the DAR had several other innovations, including; full span slotted flaps, and pivoting wing-tip ailerons which were in two sections, fore and aft. During later testing steel faced skis were attached to the fuselage sides by rubber bag springs. Flight testing was carried out at the small boat port at Leningrad in the spring of 1936, with no major problems, and five more were ordered but production was not carried out.

The deal was announced at the end of July, 2012 and finalized on September 12, 2012. Several companies providers, including Microsoft and Oracle, have mentioned Xsigo Systems. Products and services Xsigo Systems' product, the I/O Director, is a hardware and software device that consolidates data center infrastructure and streamlines server I/O management. Using the Xsigo I/O Director, users provision I/O resources on live servers, without disrupting network and storage configurations, and without physically entering the data center. Xsigo’s I/O virtualization solution replaces a server’s multiple Ethernet and Fibre Channel interfaces with a single high-speed Ethernet or InfiniBand link. Multiple virtual Ethernet interfaces (vNICs) and virtual Fibre Channel interfaces (vHBAs) communicate over this link. Virtual interfaces are established using Xsigo’s virtualization hardware and Xsigo’s host drivers. These virtual I/O resources appear to the server’s applications like their traditional I/O card-based counterparts but unlike traditional I/O resources, vNICs and vHBAs can be created as needed and do not require the server to be opened or rebooted. Xsigo awards and achievements include The Wall Street Journal Technology Innovation Award in the Network / Internet Technologies category, being named Storage Magazine's Product of the Year in the networking equipment category; also being identified by Byte and Switch as a Top 10 Storage Startup to Watch; also being named by Virtualization Review Magazine as Take Five: Innovative Vendor; and being identified by eWeek as a Top 10 Disruptive New Storage Technology.

Sallekhana  In 2006 human rights activist Nikhil Soni and his lawyer Madhav Mishra, filed a Public Interest Litigation with the Rajasthan High Court. The PIL claimed that Sallekhana should be considered to be suicide under the Indian legal statute. They argued that Article 21 of the Indian constitution only guarantees the right to life, but not to death.[34] The petition extends to those who facilitate individuals taking the vow of with aiding and abetting an act of suicide. In response, the Jain community argued that it is a violation of the Indian Constitution’s guarantee of religious freedom.[35] It was argued that Sallekhana serves as a means of coercing widows and elderly relatives into taking their own lives.[36] After being in India for the initial legal battle over Sallekhana in 2006 Braun presented the first academic paper on Sallekhana before the UNESCO Chair in Bioethics Conference in Eilat, Israel in 2007.

In August 2015, the Rajasthan High Court stated that the practice is not an essential tenet of Jainism and banned the practice making it punishable under section 306 and 309 (Abetment of Suicide) of the Indian Penal Code.\\"Rajasthan HC bans starvation ritual 'Santhara', says fasting unto death not essential tenet of Jainism\\".

The appeal featured excerpts from Braun's dissertation arguing the philosophical and legal nature of the act of Sallekhana. The Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the High Court of Rajasthan temporarily, allowing Jains to continue practicing Sallekhana, until the Supreme Court can fully engage the issue with regard to the constitutionality of the act.

In its domestic counter-terrorism role it provides the Tactical Assault Group (East) to respond to high-risk incidents on the eastern coast of Australia beyond the capability of state/territory and federal Police Tactical Groups to respond to. The regiment maintains a high readiness element which encompasses the parachute company group role that the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) had maintained prior to being re-roled as a light infantry battalion. In 2010, the then-Chief of Army stated that as part of the future amphibious ready group based on the Navy's new Canberra-class it will be necessary to rotate a Commando Company to support the infantry battalion. History =Formation= In 1995, as part of an expansion of the number of Australian Army infantry battalions, the 2nd/4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment—then operating as a standard light infantry battalion—was delinked into separate battalions which resumed their original identities as the 2nd and 4th Battalions. The decision was then taken that the 4th Battalion would become a Regular Army commando unit and on 1 February 1997 the unit was renamed to 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (Commando) (4 RAR Cdo). The unit would be structured for both conventional operations and domestic counter-terrorism, with an initial establishment of a battalion headquarters, Tactical Assault Group, two commando companies, logistic support company, logistic support company, operational support company and a signal squadron. Initially, both Regular and Reserve members were given the opportunity to undertake special forces training provided by the Commando Training Wing of the Reserve 1st Commando Regiment, or elect to be posted to a conventional forces unit. In 1998, General Reserve positions ceased to exist in the new structure, and reserve members discharged or posted to other reserve units. It was planned that 4 RAR (Cdo) would eventually take over the SASR counter terrorist role. The initial years were busy with the unit creating a structure and recruiting members suitable for commando training, while conducting sub- unit and unit training activities. B Company was raised in 1997, followed by C Company in 1999, both of which took 24 months to reach full maturity. A small team from 4 RAR (Cdo) deployed to East Timor as part of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) in September 1999 providing close personal protection for the media and also as interpreters in the initial months. In 2000, elements were involved in the evacuation of Australian nationals from the Solomon Islands in June. While later that year, 4 RAR (Cdo) assisted with counter-terrorism at the Sydney Olympic Games as part of Joint Task Force 114, with C Company on standby as a response force such as providing a cordon around an incident site in support of the SASR. In 2000, it was decided that the counter terrorist role should remain with the SASR. A period of rapid capability development, equipment acquisition and training subsequently followed. The unit that was developed as a result is highly regarded by coalition special operation forces abroad, and has conducted operations in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. It has also been awarded a number of citations for bravery and meritorious service. On 19 June 2009, the battalion was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment. Regardless, the name 4 RAR remains on the Army's order of battle and its history, colours and traditions have been preserved, ready to be re-raised as a regular infantry battalion in the future if required. All awards and battle honours received during the time as 4 RAR (Cdo) were passed onto the 2nd Commando Regiment, while those awarded before the transformation to a commando battalion were retained by 4 RAR. =East Timor= The 2nd Commando Regiment, then known as 4 RAR (Cdo), was deployed as a part of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 2001. When notified to replace 1 RAR in East Timor, 4 RAR had not long previously been raised as a commando battalion, developing special forces capabilities to supplement those of the SASR. With the commitment to East Timor continuing, however, 4 RAR was re-roled as a light infantry battalion for deployment to East Timor as AUSBATT IV. This involved reorganising from the existing two commando-companies structure to a light infantry battalion with four companies and a growth in the unit from 220 to 670 personnel. This saw B and C Company remain commando-qualified. A Company was formed in June 2000 followed by D Company in November both filled with Regular infantry soldiers posted in to the unit. The battalion took official control over Area of Operations (AO) Matilda in the northern border region on 25 April under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Sengelman. During its time deployed as a part of UNTAET, the battalion established a security partnership with the East Timorese, focusing strongly on languages and maintaining the relationships previous Australian battalions had established, as well as transferring new technologies to the local security forces. This \\"intelligence-led\\" but \\"people-focused\\" approach saw the battalion group conduct the majority of its operations in close proximity to the Tactical Coordination Line (TCL) on the border with Indonesian West Timor. The battalion saw few contacts while in East Timor. These included a TCL violation on 5 May 2001 which was intercepted by a section from D Company, an outbreak of violence involving a grenade attack by militia members at the Maubasa markets on 29 May which resulted in several people killed and about 50 wounded, and shallow cross-border militia raids in June, including an attack on a section patrol from A Company. The battalion was withdrawn and replaced in October 2001. =Expansion and domestic security= 171st Aviation Squadron Blackhawk helicopter during Exercise Talisman Sabre in 2015 Following the battalion's return from East Timor it was again restructured to resume its role as a two-company commando battalion. However, in 2001 the Australian Government directed the permanent establishment of a second TAG to be based on the east coast of Australia. The TAG is supplemented by clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch who form the Water troop. A Company was subsequently raised as a commando company in 2002. Following the creation of SOCOMD in 2002 and the Bali bombings in October that year, further resources became available. The battalion was subsequently involved in security operations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Queensland in 2002. Elements of the battalion were also involved in the boarding of a North Korean freighter, the MV Pong Su—which was suspected of drug smuggling—off Newcastle on 20 April 2003. In 2005, a fourth commando company was subsequently raised, with D Company being formed. Later, the battalion was tasked with supporting the security arrangements for the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. In 2014, elements of the regiment were deployed to Brisbane to protect the G20 Leaders Summit held in the city on 15 and 16 November. =Iraq= The battalion provided a commando force element as part of the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, known as Operation Falconer. A reinforced commando platoon formed an element of the Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG), which also included 1 Squadron, SASR, a troop from the Incident Response Regiment, and three CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment. The commandos formed the \\"quick reaction\\" element for the task group. The SFTG operated in western Iraq where it was successful in securing its area of operations, including the huge Al Asad Air Base. After the invasion was complete, the 40-man commando element provided security to humanitarian assistance missions and other security operations, later providing close protection for Australian officials in Baghdad as part of Operation Catalyst. In 2004, claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter-insurgency operations inside Iraq, although this was denied by the government. The last commando element was withdrawn in 2006. =Timor Leste= Later, in May 2006 a commando company group was deployed to Timor Leste as part of Operation Astute, after relations between the East Timorese government and military forces broke down. The commandos operated alongside the SASR as part of the Special Forces Component and were tasked with advanced force operations in preparation for the arrival of follow-on forces, focusing on Dili Airport. In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. After the battle, the commandos and SASR elements were withdrawn at the request of the East Timorese government in order to start negotiations with the rebels. =Afghanistan= Commandos walking with Afghan National Army to a waiting U.S. Army Chinook helicopter in 2012 Meanwhile, in August 2005 an Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG) was deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper, operating in the southern province of Uruzgan. The SFTG, based on similar structure deployed during Operation Falconer, was made up of elements from the SASR, a commando company and a troop from the Incident Response Regiment. Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment were deployed to Afghanistan in March 2006 to support the SFTG. A forward operating base was subsequently established at Tarin Kowt. During this deployment the Commandos were involved in Operation Perth which resulted in the death of over 150 Taliban and al- Qaeda fighters in nine days of fierce fighting in the Chora district of Uruzgan Province. The SFTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in September 2006 and replaced by a Reconstruction Taskforce made up of engineers and conventional infantry. During this period the task group was on patrol for 306 days and involved in 139 contacts and sustained 11 soldiers wounded. A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was subsequently deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando company group, elements of the SASR, and an integral combat service support team. In the latter part of 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, without suffering any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise. The regiment served in 20 SOTG rotations in Afghanistan, with deployments ranging from about four to six, seven, and eight months. For its actions, the regiment was collectively awarded the Unit Citation for Gallantry and the Meritorious Unit Citation. On 26 March 2013, it was announced that Special Operations Command would receive the first battle honour awarded to an Australian Army unit for actions since the end of the Vietnam War for its performance during the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in Afghanistan from May to June 2010. The battle honour, titled \\"Eastern Shah Wali Kot\\", was awarded in recognition of the operational actions of the SASR and 2nd Commando Regiment from Australian Special Operations Task Group Rotation XII. A number of the regiment's personnel have also received individual decorations for their actions in Afghanistan. A posthumous Victoria Cross for Australia was awarded to Cameron Baird for actions in Uruzgan Province in June 2013. In addition, as of October 2010 six Distinguished Service Crosses, eleven Distinguished Service Medals, seven Medals for Gallantry and three Stars of Gallantry had been awarded to 2nd Commando Regiment personnel for service in Afghanistan. =Military intervention against ISIL= In September 2014, as part of Operation Okra the Australian Army deployed a Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) of approximately 200 personnel to the United Arab Emirates in preparation for operations to assist and advise Iraqi Security Forces following an offensive by Islamic State forces. The soldiers were expected to be deployed to Iraq when a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. The majority of the SOTG was reported to be made up of C Company, 2nd Commando Regiment. It began moving into Iraq in early November. The 2nd Commando Regiment was tasked with training the Iraq government's Counter Terrorism Service. Personnel from SOTG have also been involved in co-ordinating airstrikes remotely to assist Iraqi forces engaged in clearance operations. From September 2015, the strength of SOTG rotations were reduced to approximately 80 personnel. Current organisation The regiment consists of a headquarters, four commando companies, a logistics support company, an operational support company and a signals squadron. It is believed to currently be organised as follows: * Regimental Headquarters ** A Company ** B Company ** C Company ** D Company ** 126 Signal Squadron ** Operations Support Company ** Logistics Support Company Incorporates the role of Tactical Assault Group (East) (on rotation). Uniform and equipment A commando in close quarters battle training during Exercise Balikatan 2017 in the Philippines Following the renaming of the unit, a new badge was chosen to reflect the history and traditions of the Independent Companies that served during the Second World War, by including the distinctive \\"double diamond\\" unit colour patch shape in the regimental badge, along with the traditional commando knife. The unit's motto is Foras Admonitio, which is Latin for \\"Without Warning\\". Qualified commandos are awarded the Sherwood green commando beret. Distinctive commando parachute wings are worn, depicting a parachute backed by a pair of black drooping wings on a green background. The Australian Army stiletto dagger is also worn on ceremonial occasions. A garter blue lanyard is worn. A variety of weapons systems are used, including the M4 carbine, Heckler & Koch (HK) HK417 and KAC SR-25. Sidearms include the Browning Hi-Power and HK USP Tactical. The HK MP5 submachine gun is used in the counter-terrorist role. Sniper rifles include the Blaser Tactical 2, Accuracy International AW50F and Barrett M82A1. Support weapons include both the FN Minimi Para and Minimi 7.62, as well as the FN MAG. Direct and indirect fire support weapons used include 66 mm M72 LAWs, 84 mm M3 MAAWS, FGM-148 Javelins, M2-QCB Browning .50 BMG machine guns, Mk 47 Striker grenade launchers, and 81 mm mortars. The Long Range Patrol Vehicle will soon be replaced by the Special Operations Vehicle – Commando (SOV-Cdo), based on Supacat's HMT Extenda MK2, 89 of which are currently being acquired (including several of the SOV-Logistics variant). The Australian designed Bale Defence Industries lightweight Rough Terrain Vehicle (RTV) is being trialled. Watercraft operated include the Zodiac F470 inflatable boat and United States Marine, Inc. 11m Air Drop Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (ADRHIB). Selection and training U.S. Air Force MC-130 transport during Exercise Talisman Saber 2011 Any member of the Australian Defence Force may apply for entry into the 2nd Commando Regiment. Applicants may also be accepted via the Special Forces Direct Recruitment Scheme (DRS), where selected and screened civilians undertake an accelerated 80-day infantry training program prior to commencing the Special Forces selection process. If a candidate fails any part of the selection course they will be returned to their unit, or transferred to one of the infantry battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment if they are a DRS candidate. Candidates must complete the Special Forces Screen Test and if successful move onto the six-week Commando Selection and Training Course (CSTC) conducted at the Special Forces Training Centre (SFTC), in Singleton, New South Wales. Further training then is undertaken during Commando Initial Employment Training, also known as the \\"Reinforcement Cycle\\". Upon successful completion of all courses soldiers are posted into one of the Commando Companies where further specialist training occurs. Counter terrorist training is conducted at the Special Forces Training Facility (SFTF) based at Holsworthy Barracks with an indoor range complex, aircraft mock-up, method of entry facility, urban training facility and sniper range. In 2013, a four-hour documentary Commando was produced on the selection course and reinforcement training.

Alderson played international rugby for England and was an original member of invitational team, the Barbarians. Personal life Alderson was born in Hartford in 1867 and educated in Durham, graduating to Clare College, Cambridge in 1886. He received his BA in 1889 and that year took up the post of Assistant Master of Henry Smith School in Hartlepool. He became headmaster of the school in 1892, a position he would hold until his death in 1925. Rugby career Alderson first came to note as a rugby player when he represented the Cambridge University team, winning a sporting Blue when he represented the team in the Varsity matches of 1887 and 1888. His Cambridge links served him well when William Percy Carpmael, a fellow Cambridge Blue, invited Alderson to join his newly formed invitational touring team, the Barbarians.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 217 In 1890 he became one of the original members of the Barbarians, and was part of the team that in 1891/92 toured the South West of England and Wales. When Alderson moved to Hartlepool he joined local team Hartlepool Rovers, and it was while representing Rovers, that he was selected for his first international game for England; an encounter with Wales in the opening match of the 1891 Home Nations Championship. Alderson was given the captaincy on his debut game, an honour he would hold for all but the last of the six matches of his international career. He served his team well, leading them to a solid 7–3 victory over the Welsh away at Rodney Parade, and picked up his first international points when he converted two of the three tries scored by England. For the remainder of the Championship Alderson led England to a victory over Ireland, but a home loss to Scotland, the eventual Triple Crown winners of 1891. The 1892 Championship saw England win all three matches making Alderson a Triple Crown captain, as he led the team for the opening game against Wales and the Championship decider away to Scotland. Alderson missed the Irish leg, the captaincy switching to Sammy Woods, but scored a try and a conversion against Wales and a conversion in the Scotland game. This was the third Triple Crown for England, and the first time a team had finished the season without conceding a single point. Alderson played one more international game, the opener of the 1893 Home Nations Championship, a narrow loss at the Cardiff Arms Park to Wales.

The original tool which was launched in 2007 and was later reviewed and simplified being relaunched in 2011 as SRI 2. SRI 2 is a framework and a process. The framework consists of a set of reflective statements centred on ten recovery indicators. These recovery indicators are based on research about what works in recovery e.g. ‘service is strengths based’ and ‘goals are identified and addressed’. The service reflects on its practice by considering data from six sources. Assessments, care plans and service information provide documentary evidence of recovery orientation from three data sources. The three other data sets are the result of reflective conversations with the people who provide the service, the people who use the service and, where possible, their carers. The SRI 2 website and associated guidance supports the service through the preparatory and information gathering stages. Guidance on what sort of evidence to look for is also made available. Data collections sheets are printed from the SRI 2 website which also records the scores and comments that have been gathered. The practitioners meet and discuss the scores and comments and devise an action plan. This might involve for example ‘being more explicit about strengths based practice in the assessment paperwork’. The service then implements the actions identified and records these in their SRI 2 website account. That then is one cycle of SRI 2 complete. The service can follow this up with another SRI 2 and build on the improvements. SRI2 is no longer supported and the website has closed down.

There are several dams that make up Emmarentia Dam, despite its allusion to the singular, with two small dams found upstream in the Johannesburg Botanical Gardens. History The Emmarentia Dam lies on land that once made up the Braamfontein Farm, one of many large farms that make what is Johannesburg and its suburbs. The land was bought in 1886 by Lourens Geldenhuys for its mining rights as it was hoped that the Confidence Reef would extend into his farm but it did not. The land remained as a farm and by 1891 it was divided between his son's Frans and Louw where the brothers had already built two farm houses, still in existence, close to where the dam is today. After the Second Boer War, in which Louw Geldenhuys and his brother had taken part of as members of the Krugersdorp Commando, he decided to help some landless and unemployed Boers war veterans. He used them to construct a stone and earth dam from blocks of stone from hills behind the farm and cost £12,000. The dam was built over the Westdene spruit which is a tributary of the larger Braamfontein Spruit. The dam was then named after his wife Emmarentia Botha. A hundred of these workers were then settled in 14 irrigated smallholdings on 145 morgens of the farm in what are now the suburbs of Emmarentia, Linden and Greenside where they grew fruits and vegetables with rent based on a third of the profits of the sale of the produce. Louw died in 1929 and his wife Emmarentia began to sell parts of the farm that became the suburbs Greenside in 1931, Emmarentia in 1937 named after her, and in 1941, Emmarentia Extension. In 1933, 13 hectares of the farm were donated to the City of Johannesburg for parks and recreation, and after further pieces of land were acquired, became the Jan van Riebeeck Park (1952) and the Johannesburg Botanical Garden (1964), Emmarentia Dam (1939), the Marks Park Sports Club (1951) and West Park Cemetery (1942). Dam and its surrounds The length of the dam is about with a maximum height of and a water surface of . The Johannesburg Botanical Garden is on the western shore of the dam. The western shore consists of woodlands, natural grass areas used for picnics, braais (barbecues) and dog walking, and a tea room. The whole area allows for extensive walking, with distant views of Sandton and Rosebank, and the (nearby) Melville Koppies. There is a well- tended rose garden, and Johannesburg City Parks maintains a tree-planting programme. An extensive variety of trees can be seen, and there is also a wide variety of bird life and small mammals such as mongoose and tree squirrels.. The main dam, to the east of the gardens, hosts the 1st Victory View Sea Scout Group boathouse, whilst on the eastern shore, south of the dam wall, the Emmarentia aquatic sport clubs reside, comprising the Emmarentia Sailing Club, the Normalair Underwater Club, and the Dabulamanzi Canoe Club, flanked by a narrow shoreline to the head of the dam, easily accessible to fisherman and picnickers. The dam spillway outfall discharges back into the Westdene Spruit, with beautiful park lawns, open wooded area, and a small lower dam, flanked by the 1st Greenside Scout Group on John McKenzie Drive. =Dam restoration project= In April 2015, the Johannesburg Road Agency initiated a project to rehabilitate the dam wall and its infrastructure. The project was completed in May 2016 at a cost of R25 million. The last time the dam had been improved upon was in 1988. After an investigation, there was now a need to conduct preventative maintenance and upgrade of the flood retention protection to safeguard the dam and the residential properties below. The residents in the surrounding area suggested a clean up while the dam was drained.

It is part of the Hermann Eckstein Park and is opposite the Johannesburg Zoo. The Zoo Lake consists of two dams, an upper feeder dam, and a larger lower dam, both constructed in natural marshland watered by the Parktown Spruit. History The land was originally part of the Braamfontein farm, and was bought by banker and mining magnate Hermann Eckstein for potential exploitation of minerals. When this objective failed, Eckstein laid it out as a timber plantation and named it Sachsenwald, after Otto von Bismarck’s estate in Germany. The plantation was started in 1891, and about three million trees were planted in the area. The forest became a favourite recreational spot for the wealthy Randlords and their families. About 10 years after Eckstein died, in August 1903, the Mayor of Johannesburg, W. St. John Carr, received a letter from his business partners (the firm Messrs. Wernher Beit & Co and Max Michaelis) with an offer of 200 acres of freehold ground for the Johannesburg Town Council to build the Johannesburg Zoo and the Herman Eckstein Park. The gift of land included a small Zoological Collection. 20 acres of the gifted land was to be used by the Imperial Light Horse Regiment, and is now the site of the War Museum and the Rand Regiments Memorial. The rest of the Sachsenwald land was developed into the present-day Johannesburg suburbs of Saxonwold and Forest Town. An artificial lake was added to the Park in 1908. It also boasts the Coronation Fountain, a \\"musical fountain\\" and a Johannesburg heritage symbol, which was built in 1937 to commemorate the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.Zoo Lake Users Committee footprint.co.za When Johannesburg celebrated its 70 birthday in 1956, as part of the city's celebration Margot Fonteyn danced Swan Lake with the Lake as a backdrop.

Zoo Lake has ducks and other waterfowl, which roost in an island at the centre of the lake, and feeding these birds (although officially discouraged) is a common family activity.

As an act of revenge, Kalabhujanga tries everything to kill Kaveri and her family, but, the divine intervention of Angala Amman rescues them every time. In a last attempt, on the last day of the nine-day Hindu festival Navratri, Kalabhujanga binds Angala Amman in an army of tormented ghosts and possesses Kaveri. As Shankar vainly attempts to stop the possessed Kaveri from killing Kishan, Angala Parameswari frees herself and after a heated fight with Kalabhujanga, slays him by crushing him under her foot. The film ends with Angala Parameswari giving vision to the whole family.

Few modifications have been made to the house since it was erected. Prominent among the few exceptions was the addition of extra rooms: a rear wing, one and a half stories tall, was attached to the original two-story house long after the original building was completed. In 1979, the house's well-preserved historic architecture led to its addition to the National Register of Historic Places; it was part of a large multiple property submission by which many buildings in Washington Township, Dublin, and nearby parts of Columbus were listed on the Register together.

Instead of using a metal cage inside the concrete, this technique uses a fabric cage inside the same. Overview Glass-fiber structure for use in textile-reinforced concrete Materials with high tensile strengths with negligible elongation properties are reinforced with woven or nonwoven fabrics. The fibres used for making the fabric are of high tenacity like Jute, Glass Fibre, Kevlar, Polypropylene, Polyamides (Nylon) etc. The weaving of the fabric is done either in a coil fashion or in a layer fashion. Molten materials, ceramic clays, plastics or cement concrete are deposited on the base fabric in such a way that the inner fabric is completely wrapped with the concrete or plastic. As a result of this sort of structure the resultant concrete becomes flexible from the inner side along with high strength provided by the outer materials. Various nonwoven structures also get priority to form the base structure. Special types of weaving machines are used to form spiral fabrics and layer fabrics are generally nonwoven.  History  = First patents = The initial creation of textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) began in the 1980s. Concepts for TRC originated from the Sächsisches Textiforschungs-institut e.V. STFI, a German institute focusing on Textile technology. The first patent for textile- reinforced concrete design, granted in 1982, was for transportation related safety items. These items were specifically meant to be reinforced with materials other than steel. In 1988, a patent was awarded for a safety barrier that used a rope-like reinforcement as its design. This reinforcement was made from concrete waste and textiles, and the innovative arrangement and size of the reinforcing fibers inside was notable. The reinforcements were set in place so that the concrete could be poured in, and the size of the reinforcement was described using diameter and mesh size. = Concrete canoe and textile reinforced concrete = In 1996, German university students created two concrete canoes using textile reinforcement. One boat utilized alkali-resistant glass as its textile reinforcement. To manufacture the glass in a fabric, a process called Malimo-technique was used to keep the glass in one continuous yarn, such that it could be used to make the fabric. The other boat was constructed using carbon fiber fabric as its method of reinforcement. The boats competed in the 1996 Concrete Canoe Regatta in Dresden, Germany, and this was the first time that textile-reinforced concrete was brought to public attention; the boats received an award for their design.  Construction  Four factors are important when constructing TRC, which include the quality of the concrete, the interaction between the textile and the concrete, the amount of fibers used, and the arrangement of the textile reinforcement inside of the concrete. The particle size of the concrete must be carefully selected. If the concrete is too coarse, it will not be able to permeate through the textile reinforcement. For the best results, fresh concrete should be used. To aid in adhesion, chemical admixtures can be added to help the fibers stick to the concrete. The characteristic features of TRC are its thin structure and malleable nature, as well as its ability to retain a high tensile strength; this is due to reinforcement in the concrete that uses long continuous fibers that are woven in a specific direction in order to add strength. As the result of the varying strength and properties needed to support correct loading, there are many different types of yarns, textiles weaves, and shapes that can be used in TRC. The textile begins with a yarn that is made of a continuous strand of either filaments or staples. The yarn is woven, knit, glued, braided or is left non-woven, depending on the needs of the project. Carbon, AR glass, and basalt are especially good materials for this process. Carbon has good tensile strength and low heat expansion, but is costly and has bad adhesion to concrete. Basalt is formed by melting basalt rock; it is more cost effective than carbon, and has a good tensile strength. The drawback of basalt is when it is placed in an alkali solution, such as concrete, it loses some of its volume of fibers, thus reducing its strength. This means a nano composite polymer coating must be applied to increase the longevity of the construction. AR glass has this problem, as well, but the positives of using AR glass in TRC structure, including its adhesion to concrete and low cost, outweigh these issues. Textile-reinforced concrete is described as a strain-hardening composite. Strain-hardening composites use short fiber reinforcements, such as yarn made from carbon fiber, to strengthen a material. Strain-hardening requires the reinforcements and concrete matrix surrounding the reinforcement to be carefully designed in order to achieve the desired strength. The textile must be oriented in the correct direction during design to handle the main loading and stresses it is expected to hold. Types of weaves that can be used to make fabrics for TRC include plain weave, Leno weave, warp-knitted, and 3D spacer. Another important aspect of textile-reinforced concrete is the permeability of the textile. Special attention must be paid to its structure, such that the textile is open enough for the concrete to flow through, while remaining stable enough to hold its own shape, since the placement of the reinforcement is vital to the final strength of the piece. The textile material must also have a high tensile strength, a high elongation before breaking, and a higher Young's Modulus than the concrete surrounding it. The textile can be hand laid into the concrete or the process could be mechanized to increase efficiency. Different ways of creating textile-reinforced concrete vary from traditional form-work casts, all the way to Pultrusion. When making TRC using casting, the form work must be constructed, and the textile reinforcement must be pre-installed and ready for concrete to be poured in. After the concrete is poured and has had time to harden, the form-work is removed to reveal the structure. Another way of creating a TRC structure is lamination by hand. Similar to casting, a form-work must be created to house the concrete and textile; concrete is then spread evenly in the form work, and then the textile is laid on top. More concrete is poured on top, and a roller is used to push the concrete into the spaces in the textile; this is completed layer after layer, until the structure reaches its required size. TRC can also be created by Pultrusion. In this process, a textile is pushed through a slurry infiltration chamber, where the textile is covered and embedded with concrete. Rollers squeeze the concrete into the textile, and it can take several sized rollers to get the desired shape and size. Uses A building made of textile-reinforced concrete Uses of textile reinforced materials, concretes are extensively increasing in modern days in combination with materials science and textile technology. Bridges, Pillars and Road Guards are prepared by kevlar or jute reinforced concretes to withstand vibrations, sudden jerks and torsion (mechanics). The use of reinforced concrete construction in the modern world stems from the extensive availability of its ingredients – reinforcing steel as well as concrete. Reinforced concrete fits nearly into every form, is extremely versatile and is therefore widely used in the construction of buildings, bridges, etc. The major disadvantage of RC is that its steel reinforcement is prone to corrosion. Concrete is highly alkaline and forms a passive layer on steel, protecting it against corrosion. Substances penetrating the concrete from outside (carbonisation) lowers the alkalinity over time (depassivation), making the steel reinforcement lose its protection thus resulting in corrosion. This leads to spalling of the concrete, reducing the permanency of the structure as a whole and leading to structural failure in extreme cases. Due to the thin, cost effective, and lightweight nature of textile-reinforced concrete, it can be used to create many different types of structural components. The crack control of TRC is much better than that tradition steel-reinforced concrete; when TRC cracks, it creates multiple small fisures, between 50 and 100 nanometers wide. In some cases, the cracks can self-heal, since a 50 nanometer crack is almost as impermeable as a non-cracked concrete. Due to these properties, TRC would be a great material for all different types of architectural and civil engineering applications. Textile-reinforced concrete can be used to create full structures, like bridges and buildings, as well as large structures in environments with much water, such as in mines and boat piers. As of 2018, the testing procedures and approval for these structures is not available, although it can currently be used to create small components, such as panels. Façade panels would be a convenient use of TRC, due to the material being thinner and lighter than typical concrete walls, and a cheaper alternative to other options. For bridges and building profiles, TRC could add to the strength and overall design of the structure. TRC could also be used to create irregular shapes with hard edges, and could be a novel way to enhance style and architectural design of modern buildings. Textile-reinforced concrete could also be used to reinforce, repair, or add on to existing buildings, in either a structural or cosmetic basis. Furthermore, TRC could be used to provide a protective layer for old structures or retrofit new elements to an old structure, due to the lack of corrosion associated with this mechanism. Unlike steel, which will rust if a crack forms, TRC does not corrode and will retain its strength, even with small cracks. If carbon fiber fabric is used as the textile, TRC could be used to heat buildings; carbon fiber is conductive, and could be used to support the building, as well as heat it. = Current examples = Large scale textile-reinforced concrete can be seen in Germany, at RWTH Aachen University, where a pavilion was constructed using a textile- reinforced concrete roof. The roof was engineered using four TRC pieces; each piece was thin and double curved in the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid. Traditional concrete design would not allow this structure, due to the complex form-work needed to create the piece. RWTH Aachen University also utilized textile-reinforced concrete to create façade panels on a new extension added to their Institute of Structural Concrete building. This façade was made using AR glass and was made much lighter weight and in a more cost effective manner than a traditional façade of steel-reinforced concrete or stone. In 2010, RWTH Aachen University also helped to design a textile-reinforced concrete bridge in Albstadt, Germany, using AR glass as the reinforcement; the bridge is approximately 100 meters long, and is expected to have a much longer service life than the steel reinforced concrete bridge it replaced.  Sustainability  Textile-reinforced concrete is generally thinner than traditional steel- reinforced concrete. Typical steel-reinforced construction is 100 to 300 mm thick, while a TRC structure is generally 50 mm thick. TRC is much thinner due to an extra protective layer of concrete that is not needed for its design. Due to this thinner structure, less material is used, which helps to reduce the price of using concrete, since the amount of concrete needed is also reduced. Since TRC can be used to extend the life of existing structures, it cuts down on the cost of materials and man power needed to tear down these existing structures, in order to create new ones. Instead of replacing old structures, they can now be repaired to add years of service to the lives of their construction.

History The club was established as (Blackpool) South Shore in 1879.Dave Twydell (2001) Denied F.C.: The Football League election struggles Yore Publications, pp144–145 They entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1882–83, losing 5–2 at Darwen Ramblers. In 1885–86 they reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, eventually losing 2–1 to Slough-based Swifts. By the late 1880s South Shore were the biggest club in Blackpool. In 1888 they joined the Combination, a league set up after the Football League. However, the Combination was run chaotically and was disbanded in April 1889. During the 1888–89 FA Cup the club was drawn away to Chatham Town in the first round, but arrived to discover that the match was played on an open field where no admission was taken to cover their transport costs; after a complaint was filed with the Lancashire County Football Association, the Football Association changed FA Cup entry rules to require clubs to play matches in an enclosed ground. At the end of the first season of the Football League, a re- election process was held, with the bottom four of the league challenged by applicants for membership in a vote held on 3 May 1889. South Shore applied for election, but received no votes, as all four League clubs were re- elected.Twydell, p11 While most other unsuccessful applicants joined the Football Alliance, South Shore opted not to join a league, instead playing friendlies and cup matches. This allowed local rivals Blackpool, who had been playing in the Lancashire League since 1889, to become the dominant club in the town. South Shore also joined the Lancashire League in 1891. In 1896 Blackpool applied for Football League membership, and prior to the vote, an agreement was made by the two clubs to amalgamate if Blackpool were successful. However, after Blackpool were voted into the League, South Shore pulled out of the deal. The club finished bottom of the Lancashire League in 1898–99, a season which also saw Blackpool voted out of the league. Both clubs began the 1899–1900 season in the Lancashire League, but in the evening after a local derby between the two clubs on 9 December, an agreement was made for South Shore to merge into Blackpool, with their league record expunged. Ground The club initially played on a ground off Lytham Avenue, before later moving to Cow Gap Lane. A 300-seat stand was erected, although the remainder of the ground was largely undeveloped. In October 1899 they moved to Bloomfield Road. When the club merged into Blackpool in December, Blackpool relocated to Bloomfield Road from their Raikes Hall ground.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888–2005, Yore Publications, p23 Records *Best FA Cup performance: Quarter-finals, 1885–86 References Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:The Combination Category:Lancashire League (football) Category:Blackpool F.C.

Ziegler's career consists of 33 years as exploration geologist with the petroleum industry, 30 of which with Shell, and 20 years of university teaching and research. Life and work Born in Winterthur, Ziegler took a PhD degree at the University of Zurich in spring 1955 and immediately joined the petroleum industry. Following three years of fieldwork and well sitting in Israel, Madagascar and the Algerian Sahara with American and French oil companies, he joined Shell Canada in Calgary. For six years he was engaged in the exploration of the Cordilleran foothills of British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon, as well as of the Pacific shelf. This involved extensive helicopter-supported fieldwork. In view of a growing family, he converted from a structurally oriented field-geologist to a more sedentary, stratigraphic trap hunting subsurface-geologist and chalked-up his first natural gas discoveries in the Alberta down-dip reef belt. After guiding an airborne excursion through the Cordillera during the 1967 Devonian Symposium of Calgary, his guidebook, summarizing “The Development of Sedimentary Basins in Western and Arctic Canada”, was published by the Alberta Society of Petroleum Geologists in 1969. Ziegler was transferred to Shell International in the Netherlands on January 1, 1970, where he supervised Shell's exploration activities in the North Sea area. As the North Sea success story unfolded, Shell and its partners were rewarded with numerous important oil and gas discoveries, including the giant Brent, Statfjord, and Troll fields. Ziegler's responsibilities as exploration adviser expanded stepwise to all Shell companies in Europe, then South America, and ultimately worldwide. Parallel to his operational responsibilities, Ziegler compiled regional geological data to gain a better understanding of the hydrocarbon potential of hitherto little explored basins on the Atlantic seaboard and of basins behind the Iron Curtain. Presentations at various conferences and symposia prompted academia to propose to Shell to publish his set of palaeogeographic/palaeotectonic maps. In 1982 Ziegler's Geological Atlas of Western and Central Europe was published. In this volume he retraced the geological history, depositional environments and tectonics of Europe north of the Alps in greater detail than had ever been done before. In the same line, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists invited Ziegler to tour the United States and Canada in 1986-1987 as distinguished lecturer, speaking on the Evolution of the Arctic-North Atlantic and Western Tethys. Scientific career In autumn 1988 Ziegler retired from Shell and returned with his wife to Switzerland where he joined the University of Basel as lecturer. In short succession he published with Shell's support in late 1988 the AAPG Memoir 43, entitled “Evolution of the Arctic-North Atlantic and Western Tethys”, in 1989 a volume published by the Royal Geological and Mining Society of the Netherlands on “Evolution of Laurussia - A Study in Late Palaeozoic Plate Tectonics” and in 1990 for Shell's 100 years of Exploration Jubilee the 2nd edition of his “Geological Atlas of Western and Central Europe”. In addition he carried out consulting work, lectured regularly on Shell's behalf at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, and participated in international research endeavors, such as the International Lithosphere Program (leader of working group 3: Intra-Plate Tectonics 1985-90: Bureau member 1991-94), EUROPROBE (1990–2002), the IGCP-369 Comparative evolution of Peri-Tethyan Rift Basins Project (1994–99) and the TRANSMED Atlas Project (2000–04). He initiated and coordinated the transnational EUCOR-URGENT Project (1999–2008) that dealt with the evolution and neotectonics of the Upper Rhine Graben. He contributed materially to the development of the follow-up TOPO-EUROPE Project, which addresses the neotectonic and topographic evolution of Europe. Ziegler published widely in international journals and in thematic volumes on processes controlling extensional and compressional intraplate tectonics and on the evolution of the lithosphere. His publications found wide recognition and contributed enormously to narrowing the gap between academia and the industry. His work changed the way geologists look at depositional systems and tectonic processes controlling the evolution of sedimentary basins. Awards In 1992 Ziegler was appointed as Honorary Lecturer at University of Basel and in 1996 as Titular Professor for Global Geology. He was awarded Honorary Doctor Degrees by the Moscow State University (1997) and the Technical University Delft (2001). He was a recipient of the Foumarier medal of the Belgian Geological Society, the van Waterschot van der Gracht medal of the Royal Geological and Mining Society of the Netherlands, the William Smith medal of the Geological Society of London, the Neville George medal of the Geological Society of Glasgow, the Stephan Müller medal of the European Geosciences Union, the Leopold von Buch medal of the German Geological Society and the Leonidovici Kaptsa medal of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. From the American Association of Petroleum Geologists he received the Robert Dott sr. Memorial Award for the publication of his Memoir 43, and later the Special Commendation Award for his regional synthesis of the geological evolution of Europe and for being a lively catalyst of the dialogue among Earth Scientists. Memberships He was a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences and the Academia Europaea. He is a life member of the Bureau of the International Lithosphere Program and an honorary member of the Geological Society of London, the European Geosciences Union, the Geological Society of Poland and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.

Development After joining the OOS (Otdel Opytnogo Samolyetostroeniya - section for experimental aircraft construction), Bartini was appointed leader of his own design group, where he attempted to design the fastest, most advanced machine possible. After submission of his proposal to TsKB (Tsentrahl'noye konstrooktorskoye byuro - central construction bureau), there was an 18-month delay before permission was given to proceed. The major component of the Stal-6 was the V-1570 Curtiss Conqueror steam-cooled V-12 engine, this was closely cowled and defined the maximum sectional area of the fuselage, which transitioned smoothly from nose to tail with a flush cockpit canopy. The manually retractable undercarriage consisted of a single main-wheel and skids at the wing-tips. To eliminate the drag of radiators the wings were double skinned with 'enerzh-6' (stainless steel), from the leading-edge back to the main-spar, to form the surface- evaporation radiators for the steam cooling system of the engine. Flight testing began in the Autumn of 1933 piloted by A.B.Yumashyev and P.M.Stefanovskii, revealing exceptional performance and setting a Soviet speed record, but severe problems with the steam cooling system as well as the bad view from the cockpit were insurmountable. The need for steam cooling was soon to be negated by the widespread availability of ethylene glycol based coolants, which had a better specific heat and a much higher boiling point. Variants =Stal-8= The Stal-8 was a fighter developed from the preceding Stal-6 experimental aircraft. The Curtiss Conqueror steam-cooled V-12 engine was replaced by an M-100A (licence-built Hispano-Suiza 12YBR), this also was closely cowled and defined the maximum sectional area of the fuselage, which transitioned smoothly from nose to tail except for the cockpit which was enlarged to improve the view of the pilot. Two 7.62mm ShKAS machine- guns were to be fitted in the top decking over the engine, synchronised to fire through the propeller. Construction of the prototype, with steel tube fuselage covered with plywood skinning and steel tube built up wings, with the 'enerzh' double skinned surface-evaporation radiators forming the leading edge skin, back to the main-spars, was approximately 90% finished when the Soviet Air Force rejected the aircraft on grounds of vulnerability of the cooling system.

A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter. The FA is an extension of the concept of eccentricity of conic sections in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.  Definition  A Diffusion Ellipsoid is completely represented by the Diffusion Tensor, D. FA is calculated from the eigenvalues (\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2, \\\\lambda_3) of the diffusion tensor. The eigenvectors \\\\epsilon give the directions in which the ellipsoid has major axes, and the corresponding eigenvalues \\\\lambda give the magnitude of the peak in that direction. Diffusion Tensor Schematic : \\\\text{FA} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\hat{\\\\lambda})^2 + (\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\hat{\\\\lambda})^2 + (\\\\lambda_3 - \\\\hat{\\\\lambda})^2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_1^2 + \\\\lambda_2^2 + \\\\lambda_3^2}} with \\\\hat{\\\\lambda} = (\\\\lambda_1 + \\\\lambda_2 + \\\\lambda_3)/3 being the mean value of the eigenvalues. An equivalent formula for FA is : \\\\text{FA} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{(\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2)^2 + (\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_3)^2 + (\\\\lambda_3 - \\\\lambda_1)^2}}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda_1^2 + \\\\lambda_2^2 + \\\\lambda_3^2}}, which is further equivalent to: : \\\\text{FA} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(3-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{trace}(\\\\text{R}^2)}\\\\right)} where R is the \\"normalized\\" diffusion tensor: : \\\\text{R} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{D}}{\\\\text{trace}(\\\\text{D})} Note that if all the eigenvalues are equal, which happens for isotropic (spherical) diffusion, as in free water, the FA is . The FA can reach a maximum value of (this rarely happens in real data), in which case D has only one nonzero eigenvalue and the ellipsoid reduces to a line in the direction of that eigenvector. This means that the diffusion is confined to that direction alone.  Details  This can be visualized with an ellipsoid, which is defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of D. The FA of a sphere is 0 since the diffusion is isotropic, and there is equal probability of diffusion in all directions. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Diffusion Tensor give a complete representation of the diffusion process. FA quantifies the pointedness of the ellipsoid, but does not give information about which direction it is pointing to. Note that the FA of most liquids, including water, is unless the diffusion process is being constrained by structures such as network of fibers. The measured FA may depend on the effective length scale of the diffusion measurement. If the diffusion process is not constrained on the scale being measured (the constraints are too far apart) or the constraints switch direction on a smaller scale than the measured one, then the measured FA will be attenuated. For example, the brain can be thought of as a fluid permeated by many fibers (nerve axons). However, in most parts the fibers go in all directions, and thus although they constrain the diffusion the FA is . In some regions, such as the corpus callosum the fibers are aligned over a large enough scale (on the order of a mm) for their directions to mostly agree within the resolution element of a magnetic resonance image, and it is these regions that stand out in an FA image. Liquid crystals can also exhibit anisotropic diffusion because the needle or plate-like shapes of their molecules affect how they slide over one another. When the FA is 0 the tensor nature of D is often ignored, and it is called the diffusion constant. File:Ellipsoid2722.jpg FA value of 0.7698, the DT matrix is diagonal([10 2 2]) File:Ellipsoid888.jpg FA value of 0, the DT matrix is diagonal([4 4 4]) File:Ellipsoid eigenvalues14142.jpgFA value of 0.6030, the DT matrix is diagonal([4 4 2]) A drawback of the Diffusion Tensor model is that it can account only for Gaussian diffusion processes, which has been found to be inadequate in accurately representing the true diffusion process in the human brain. Due to this, higher order models using spherical harmonics and Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF) have been used to define newer and richer estimates of the anisotropy, called Generalized Fractional Anisotropy. GFA computations use samples of the ODF to evaluate the anisotropy in diffusion. They can also be easily calculated by using the Spherical Harmonic coefficients of the ODF model.

Rugby career Dobson was born in the small fishing village of Keiss in Caithness, Scotland, but by 1873 his family is living in the Pontypridd area of Wales. In the 1890s Dobson had moved to the Cardiff Docks area where he had become a coal trimmer.Parry- Jones, David; Prince Gwyn, Gwyn Nicholls and the First Golden Era of Welsh Rugby seren, Bridgend (1999) pg. 47, With the industrialisation of South Wales, heavy labourers began filling the forward positions in many Welsh club teams, and Dobson became part of the pack for Cardiff RFC, one of the Wales' most prominent teams. In 1898, Wales were readmitted into the Home Nations Championship after agreements were made to settle the Gould Affair. Dobson was one of seven new caps introduced into the Welsh team, and one of five in a vastly changed pack. Although the back positions were full of Cardiff players, Dobson was only supported by one teammate in the pack, Fred Cornish, who was only collecting his second cap that match. The game was played away against Ireland, and without Arthur Gould, Wales were now captained by experienced fullback Billy Bancroft. Bancroft was in good form during the match scoring a penalty goal and a conversion. Two tries were scored by Wales in an 11-3 win, one from Viv Huzzey and the other scored by Dobson himself; his first and only international score. After the win, Dobson was reselected in a near unchanged squad that faced and lost to England in the final match of the 1898 Championship. Dobson was back in the Wales squad the next year in the 1899 Championship, joined in the pack only by David Daniel and Willie Alexander from the previous season, the other five players all being new caps. The first game of the Championship was against England, and Dobson was part of the team that secured a record win over the English, with Welsh wing Willie Llewellyn scoring four tries.

It is a method to compute partitions of the set of vertices and detect zones of high concentration of edges, and is analogous to graph toughness which is defined similarly for vertex removal.  Definitions  The strength \\\\sigma(G) of an undirected simple graph G = (V, E) admits the three following definitions: * Let \\\\Pi be the set of all partitions of V, and \\\\partial \\\\pi be the set of edges crossing over the sets of the partition \\\\pi\\\\in\\\\Pi, then \\\\displaystyle\\\\sigma(G)=\\\\min_{\\\\pi\\\\in\\\\Pi}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\pi}{\\\\pi-1}. * Also if \\\\mathcal T is the set of all spanning trees of G, then :: \\\\sigma(G)=\\\\max\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum_{T\\\\in\\\\mathcal T}\\\\lambda_T\\\\ :\\\\ \\\\forall T\\\\in {\\\\mathcal T}\\\\ \\\\lambda_T\\\\geq 0\\\\mbox{ and }\\\\forall e\\\\in E\\\\ \\\\sum_{T i e}\\\\lambda_T\\\\leq1\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. * And by linear programming duality, :: \\\\sigma(G)=\\\\min\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\sum_{e\\\\in E}y_e\\\\ :\\\\ \\\\forall e\\\\in E\\\\ y_e\\\\geq0\\\\mbox{ and }\\\\forall T\\\\in {\\\\mathcal T}\\\\ \\\\sum_{e\\\\in E}y_e\\\\geq1\\\\right\\\\\\\\}.  Complexity  Computing the strength of a graph can be done in polynomial time, and the first such algorithm was discovered by Cunningham (1985).

He typically plays the full 90 min of every game. Sidra was apparently contacted to play in the recent national team matches against Peru and Honduras but was ultimately not a part of the squad.

Biography  He was born on October 6, 1934 in Chicago. He received his musical training at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago (Piano) and at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, Illinois (Bachelor's Degree in organ performance with Lillian Mecherle McCord). Further studies followed at the Union Theological Seminary in New York City (Master's and Doctoral Degrees in Sacred Music, 1957 and 1961) and (through a Fulbright scholarship) 1957–1959 with Helmut Walcha in Frankfurt am Main. In addition, Anderson studied organ with Heinrich Fleischer and Frederick Marriott, composition with Harold Friedell and Seth Bingham and harpsichord with Maria Jager. Beginning in 1960, he served as Professor of Organ and Sacred Music at Southern Methodist University and as organist of the University Chapel and Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, until his retirement in 1997. He wrote numerous compositions for organ solo, including a Triptych (1958), as well as a cantata, \\"Garden of Gethsemane,\\" after a text by Boris Pasternak. Anderson was organ consultant for some of the finest concert hall organs in North America: the C. B.

Most biographical details about his life survive in Johannes' verse autobiography, which was printed in 1811 (although the manuscript no longer survives) and has been partially translated into modern English. He was born in Unna and brought up in the nearby town of Soest. As a boy, he sang at the church of St. Patrokli. At one point a juggler almost succeeded in kidnapping him for his beautiful voice, but the plan did not succeed. The boy eventually left Soest when John I, Duke of Cleves hired him as a singer. At Cleves, Johannes von Soest studied composition with an unknown teacher, quickly distinguishing himself as the best student and becoming, in his own words, a better composer than his master. Johannes' attitude towards music changed completely when he heard two English singers who were travelling through Cleves; he persuaded them to teach him their distinctive English style. They agreed to do so on the condition that he go to Bruges with them; accordingly, Johannes managed to get a permission to leave the Duke. He subsequently worked at Overijssel, Maastricht, and Kassel. In 1472 the 24-year-old composer went to Heidelberg and made such an impression on the Elector that he was immediately offered a contract for life. Although he had a large salary and a high reputation, by 1476 Johannes was apparently no longer satisfied with his musical activities. That year he entered the University of Heidelberg to study medicine; after several years there and a period in Pavia, by 1490 at the latest, he received a degree. He became a municipal doctor in Worms in 1495, then worked in the same capacity in Oppenheim and Frankfurt. He died in 1506 in Frankfurt. No compositions by Johannes von Soest survive, but contemporary sources mention vocal music for 9 to 12 voices and other pieces. His treatises are lost as well; only the title of one survives: De musica subalterna. He was also active as a teacher. His pupils included composer and theorist Sebastian Virdung, author of one of the earliest known German treatises on musical instruments. Organist and composer Arnolt Schlick, author of the earliest German treatise on organs and organ building, also may have studied with Johannes. References Further reading *Keyl, Stephen Mark. 1989.

The 13-year-old schoolboy left his home in Ballyroan to return to school, but has not been seen since. A large-scale investigation was carried out but no trace of the boy has ever been found. His disappearance is now treated as a high- profile child murder case, the only similar incident in Ireland being the murder of Robert Holohan in January 2005. It is one of the most high-profile disappearances in recent Irish history. Philip's family have issued numerous appeals for information. A reconstruction took place in 2007 and was later televised on RTÉ One, while a reward of €10,000 has also been offered. The book, When Heaven Waits, published in 2007, featured an interview with Philip's mother. Nobody has ever been arrested. The case remains open.  Disappearance  Philip Cairns disappeared while returning to school in Rathfarnham. He had departed Coláiste Éanna secondary school at 12:45 to go home for lunch. He left his home at 13:30 to return to Coláiste Éanna. There have been no confirmed sightings of the boy since. His family believe he was abducted by someone who knew him personally. Speculation at his school the day after his disappearance had Philip being kidnapped by a \\"bad man\\" who had offered him sweets then lured him into a van.  Investigation  Several hundred Garda Síochána officers and divers took part in a large-scale search of forests, lakes, mountains and rivers. Psychics and clairvoyants were called in to assist. Posters were distributed by milk companies. Cairns' classmates were interviewed by Gardaí at the school during their mid-term holiday break the following week. Six days after his disappearance, Philip's school bag was located by two girls in an alley close to his house. The lane had already been searched, and the bag was not there at that time. The school bag was thought to hold vital clues, but nothing is known of how it came to be in the lane. It is thought the bag had been left there a short time previously. It was examined forensically but no clues were located. Philip's implements, including pens, pencils, copybook, maths textbook, school journal and his pencil case were within. Some of Philip's books were missing, including a geography book and two religion books. A forensic examination produced no clues as to Philip's whereabouts. Gardaí have sealed the bag and it is now locked in a safe. Over 400 sightings were reported in the aftermath of the boy's disappearance. In one, Philip was reportedly seen in Manchester in the United Kingdom after his disappearance. Each sighting was seriously investigated, but none led to Philip. Philip's parents appeared regularly on the news and clutched what has now become a well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip. Several theories have been reported by the media, most of which have been discounted by investigators. These have ranged from death by accident to Philip having been taken by extremists such as paedophiles and Satanists. One theory had a woman tell gardaí that her partner, an alleged paedophile, had killed Philip after abducting him. This was later declared a false allegation. Detectives based at Rathfarnham Garda Station have been reinvestigating the disappearance of Philip Cairns for several years. Several searches of land have been carried out in the years since the disappearance, often without the media being informed. In October 2006, the Cairns family issued an appeal for information on the twentieth anniversary of the disappearance. They said they had not given up all hope of finding him alive. A special Mass was also held to mark the occasion. A further appeal for information was launched following the twenty-first anniversary of Philip's disappearance in 2007, when it emerged that over 50 people had approached investigators individually and had provided new lines of inquiry. That month saw a reconstruction of Philip's typical school route being broadcast on RTÉ One's Crimecall television series and the Irish Crimestoppers Trust offering a €10,000 reward for information. Within one day, over 80 people had been in contact with Gardaí or Crimestoppers in what was described as a \\"tremendous response\\". In May 2009, a stretch of private, wooded south Dublin land near a golf club on the M50 motorway was searched by investigators. On 6 May, the area was sealed off and vegetation was cleared. Specialist equipment and finger tip examination techniques were used in an attempt to detect evidence of soil movement. A second search was carried out around 50 metres away later that month. An elderly woman from Dublin told Gardaí that Cairns was murdered and later buried at both sites. She said that a man she was in a relationship with some time before had confessed to killing Philip. Despite the involvement of geophysicists, the searches both proved to be a failure. The man is now a pensioner who lives in Rathfarnham but cannot be charged due to lack of evidence. =2016 investigation= In May 2016 a woman contacted Gardaí to tell them that she suspected former DJ and convicted paedophile Eamonn Cooke of having killed Philip Cairns. Gardaí questioned Cooke and he was reported to have confirmed some details, but not to have revealed the location of Philip's body. He died in June 2016. In August 2016 it was announced that DNA samples taken from Philips' schoolbag did not match Cooke, but he had not been ruled out as a suspect. Gardaí also sought to identify two people who may have left Philips' schoolbag in the laneway.  Family  Philip's mother is Alice Cairns and his father was Philip Cairns, Snr. Alice is a grandmother now and lights a candle each evening in memory of her missing son. Philip has four sisters, Mary, Sandra, Helen and Suzanne. Sandra and Suzanne are active in organisations promoting missing children. He has one younger brother, Eoin, who was 11 years of age when Philip disappeared. Eoin has spoken of his memories of Philip which include childhood games of soccer, fishing and hurling. His father, Phil, died on 6 July 2014 at Tallaght Hospital. Impact The disappearance of Philip Cairns affected the entire country. The case was particularly unusual because it happened in the early afternoon and prompted parents to fear for the safety of their children, even in broad daylight.

He was chosen by James I as a delegate from the Church of Scotland to the Synod of Dort. Life He was son of the Rev. Walter Balcanquhall, a strong presbyterian and was born in Edinburgh about 1586. He studied at the University of Edinburgh intending ultimately to take orders in the Church of England. In 1609 he graduated M.A. He then entered at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he passed B.D., and was admitted a Fellow on 8 September 1611. He was appointed one of James I's chaplains, and in 1617 he received the Mastership of the Savoy, London. In 1618 James sent him to the Synod of Dort and the university of Oxford conferred upon him the degree of D.D. His letters from Dort, which were addressed to Sir Dudley Carleton, are preserved in John Hales's Golden Remains. In March 1624 he obtained the deanery of Rochester, when the incumbent Godfrey Goodman was made Bishop of Gloucester. In 1639 he was made Dean of Durham. On the death of the celebrated George Heriot on 12 February 1624, Balcanquhall was one of the three executors of his will and was assigned the major part in founding George Heriot's Hospital, for which he drew up the statutes in 1627. In 1638 he revisited Scotland, as chaplain to the Marquis of Hamilton, the royal commissioner. Balcanquhall was very badly received. He was author of an apologetical narrative of the court proceedings under the title of His Majestie's Large Declaration concerning the Late Tumults in Scotland (1639). On 29 July 1641 he and others of kin with him were denounced by the Scottish parliament as 'incendiaries', and he was harshly treated. He retreated to Oxford and shared the waning fortunes of Charles I. He later took refuge with the royalist Sir Thomas Middleton at Chirk Castle, Denbighshire, and died there on Christmas Day 1645. Sir Thomas Middleton erected a monument to him in the parish church of Chirk, with an epitaph composed for him by John Pearson, then Bishop of Chester. From November 1651 to February 1652, a case was heard at the Committee for Compounding. Isaac Gilpin alleged that valuable plate and vestments from Durham Cathedral had been hidden from the state. The Committee was asked to interrogate Lady Elizabeth Hammond, Walter Balcanquhall's widow: she had allegedly sent the valuables to the late Anthony Maxton, one of the former prebends of the cathedral, who had buried them in his garden.

The church came into existence in 1837 at the time of the Goan schism when some Catholic families withdrew from their Parish Milagres Cathedral and acknowledged the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly. They built a church only a few yards away from the Milagres Cathedral. Since then it has undergone alterations and additions. It is strategically located close to the NH 66. History In 1880, Fr Albert D’Souza (1879-1890) decided to build a new church and the location was shifted to Nejar Hill. The foundation stone of the new church was blessed by the then Bishop of Mangalore Most Rev. Pagani on 26 November 1880. Due to paucity of funds, Fr Albert D’Souza could not complete the church. At this juncture, Mattheus Rebello, hereditary Patel of Kallianpur pledged his property, took a loan and completed the church building. The first mass was in the newly constructed tiled roof church building was offered on 14 May 1882. On 9 January 1883, the statue of Holy Rosary was installed in the church. The church also got some land from the Patel, Ignatius Fernandes. The expansion of the church was done at gradual stages. Fr J.M. Masse (1890-1916) built the presbytery in 1895 and Fr John Salvadore Mathais constructed the portico. Fr Piedade Saldanha (1931-1938) built a shrine to commemorate the centenary of the church in 1937. Fr Rosario Denis Sequeira (1957-1967) built the grotto. The sesqui-centennial (1837-1987) celebrations were held in 1987 during the time of Fr Victor Saldanha. The cost of construction of the new belfry was donated in memory of late Louis and Leticia Rebello by their family members. The newly erected belfry was inaugurated on January 30, 1999. Fr Godfrey Saldanha completed the church hall which was inaugurated on January 4, 2001 by Most Rev Dr Leo Cornelio of Khandwa diocese who is presently the Archbishop of Bhopal. Realizing the need to spread education among the girls a primary school for them was started in 1925 and it was handed over to the Carmelite Sisters in 1933. On June 1, 1958 Lourdes Hospital built by Msgr R Denis Sequeira was inaugurated which was handed over to the Sisters of the Queen of the Apostles in 1962. Realizing the importance of English education following the liberalization and globalization policy of the government, Fr Godfrey Linus Aurelius Saldanha began Mount Rosary English Medium School in 1997. The new school building was inaugurated on June 1, 1999. Mount Rosary Church completed 175 years of existence in 2012. In order to mark the event and provide sufficient space to the ever increasing parishioners, Parish Priest Fr. Philip Neri Aranha who had taken charge of the parish since 2010 in consultation with the Parish Pastoral Council and the parishioners in general decided to rebuild the church. In order to raise the new church, a prominent site where the previous Mount Rosary church existed was selected. The foundation stone was blessed by the Bishop of Mangalore Diocese, Most Rev. Dr. Aloysius Paul D’Souza during the Mass that was held at the Millennium auditorium on March 3, 2012 and the laid at the site in the presence of a large number of parishioners including Jerry Vincent Dias-Vice President of the Parish Pastoral Council, Secretary Richard Dias and former Vice Presidents- Stany Cornelio, Prof Ligory Aranha and Benedict Menezes. The construction work of the church went on for 2 years and 9 months. As a result of meticulous planning and sustained work ably supervised by Fr. Philip Neri Aranha supported by Jerry Vincent Dias, Richard Dias and others the work of the new church is completed to the delight of all the parishioners. Present Structure The new building of the 178-year-old Mount Rosary Church was inaugurated on Tuesday, January 6, 2015. The Church was inaugurated by Jerry Vincent Dais and Molly Dias vice president of parish pastoral council. The inauguration mass was celebrated by Rt.Rev.Dr. Aloysius Paul D'souza (Bishop of Mangalore diocese). Thousands of devotees witnessed the grand inauguration and blessing of the newly built Church. With an imposing structure and elegant exterior, the church is spacious enough to comfortably accommodate 1200 faithful. The church is 115 feet long, 76 feet wide and 60 feet high. The chief attraction of the church is the high altar which has been superbly executed by renowned artists and architects from Korathi, Kerala. They have carved a beautiful altar with great care and dedication. The church has an adoration chapel which is fully air-conditioned. The wooden cross on the high altar, the tinted glass windows depicting different episodes from the Bible, the mosaic style Way of the Cross, the beautiful statues of saints and above all, the statue of Our Lady of Mount Rosary are the chief attractions of the church.

Founded in 1966, the goal of NACHO was to expand coordination among homophile organizations throughout the Americas.Armstrong, p. 54 Homophile activists were motivated in part by an increase in mainstream media attention to gay issues. Some feared that without a centralized organization, the movement would be hijacked, in the words of founding member Foster Gunnison, Jr., by \\"fringe elements, beatniks, and other professional non- conformists\\".Quoted in Eisenbach, p. 48 Origins NACHO was modeled on an earlier organization, the East Coast Homophile Organizations (ECHO), that formed in 1963 to coordinate the activities of homophile groups from New York City, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia.Bianco, p. 174 Planning conference The first meeting of the organizations that would become NACHO was held over the weekend of February 18, 1966 in Kansas City under the title \\"National Planning Conference of Homophile Organizations\\". Fourteen organizations were represented at the conference, which was held in Kansas City as a centralized location. Over the next six months, the attendees set up a legal defense fund and started a newsletter.Bianco, p. 175 First meetings NACHO was officially formed at a meeting held in San Francisco six months after the planning conference. Although Gunnison delivered a keynote speech calling for a strong centrally-controlled structure, others in attendance were wary. Daughters of Bilitis co-founder Del Martin and other women were growing increasingly suspicious that men could understand the needs of lesbians. Mattachine New York leader Dick Leitsch, who had influence within Mayor John Lindsay's administration, did not want to give up his organization's independence.Eisenbach, p. 49 NACHO was hampered by internal conflicts from the beginning. Fault lines formed over membership, credentialing and voting rights, with East coast organizations favoring a more formal membership process and West coast activists wishing for a more casual members policy. Mattachine New York and ONE, Inc. refused to attend the 1967 conference in New York because of these concerns. Lesbians were also concerned that the male- dominated leadership was giving short shrift to women-specific issues. Slogan and the Homosexual Bill of Rights At its 1968 conference in Chicago, held just weeks after the contentious Democratic National Convention, NACHO adopted the slogan \\"Gay is Good\\". Coined by founding member Frank Kameny, the slogan was modeled on the African American slogan \\"Black is Beautiful.\\"Kameny, collected in Blasius and Phelan, p. 374 NACHO also adopted a five-point Homosexual Bill of Rights at its 1968 meeting:Moyer, et al., p. 158 > # Private consensual sex between persons over the age of consent shall not > be an offense. # Solicitation for any sexual acts shall not be an offense > except upon the filing of a complaint by the aggrieved party, not a police > officer or agent. # A person's sexual orientation or practice shall not be a > factor in the granting or renewing of federal security clearances or visas, > or in the granting of citizenship. # Service in and discharge from the Armed > Forces and eligibility for veteran's benefits shall be without reference to > homosexuality. # A person's sexual orientation or practice shall not affect > his eligibility for employment with federal, state, or local governments, or > private employers. Quoted in Andryszewski, p. 12 NACHO resolved to send questionnaires to political candidates to determine their positions on the points of the Bill.Kaiser, p. 148 A number of lesbian organizations, still concerned over the lack of attention being paid to their issues, refused to participate. Daughters of Bilitis president Rita LaPorte compared the relationship between NACHO and DOB to a husband and wife. Heterosexual women, she argued, dissipated their energy through their marriages; similarly, lesbians risked dissipating their energy should DOB become a surrogate \\"wife\\" to what she perceived as the male-centered NACHO.LaPorte, collected in Blasius and Phelan, p. 348 Final conferences NACHO held two additional conferences in 1969 and 1970, but by this time the Stonewall riots had occurred and the momentum and energy of the gay movement had shifted to more radical groups like the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance. Older members and younger, more radicalized activists struggled at the 1970 convention in San Francisco, particularly over the issues of membership and participation, which led to the gay liberationists' taking control of the convention. The younger activists passed a series of resolutions supporting the Black Panthers and Women's Liberation and the immediate withdrawal of troops from Vietnam.Armstrong, p. 79 NACHO never recovered from the conflict and the 1970 convention was the organization's last.Witt, et al., p. 205 Gay Sunshine magazine declared the convention \\"the battle that ended the homophile movement\\".Quoted in Armstrong, p. 79 Legacy Although its existence was brief, NACHO helped start dozens of local gay groups across the country and issued position papers on a variety of LGBT-related issues. It organized national demonstrations, including a May 1966 action against military discrimination that included the country's first gay motorcade.Fletcher, p. 42 Through its legal defense fund, NACHO challenged anti-gay laws and regulations ranging from immigration issues and military service to the legality of serving alcohol to homosexuals.

Playing career Knight was born in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire. He began his football career with Burton Albion, for whom he made one appearance, against Salisbury City in 1994. Ten minutes after coming on as a half-time substitute, he was sent off after bringing down an opponent. Outfield player Darren Stride went in goal and saved the resultant penalty, but Burton lost 2–0. He then joined Derby County in 1997. He spent time on loan at clubs including Carlisle United, for whom he made his Football League debut, on 27 March 1999 in Division Three in a 2–1 defeat at Cardiff City, Birmingham City, for whom he appeared only in one League Cup match, Hull City, and Macclesfield Town. After Derby recalled him from loan at Carlisle, they signed Jimmy Glass on loan to replace him; Glass went on to score the injury-time goal in the last match of the season that saved Carlisle from relegation out of the Football League. He finished off his loan spells with two separate stints with Oxford United, where his impressive form played a significant part in the club avoiding relegation, and joined them on a permanent basis in 2000 without ever having appeared in a competitive match for Derby. He lost his place in December 2000 after Oxford were 2–0 up in the FA Cup at Conference club Chester City but lost 3–2, thus failing to qualify for the potentially lucrative third round, and only regained it in the following March. Nevertheless, at the end of the season, with the club bottom of Division Two, he won Oxford United's supporters' player of the year award. He lost his place again to the newly arrived Ian McCaldon, had a spell on loan at Colchester United, and was released at the end of the 2001–02 season. In January 2004 he signed for Didcot Town as cover, and played in the final of the Hellenic League Cup as Didcot beat Bishops Cleeve 3–1. He moved on to Brackley Town in 2004, and remained at the club until he was released in the summer of 2009. He then joined Oxford City, but left the club in October 2010, due to commuting difficulties from his Derbyshire home. In 2014, Knight turned out for Stamford and spent a few weeks with Cambridge City as goalkeeping cover before joining Kettering Town in November 2014. He played regularly for the remainder of the 2014–15 season as Kettering won the Southern Football League Division One Central title. After a single season with the Poppies, he rejoined Stamford, for whom he played 29 matches and won six man-of-the-match awards, before leaving the club in December 2015 due to work commitments.

Development Aeroflot issued a requirement for two transport aircraft types. Bartini began design work in October 1934 on an aircraft to meet the larger 10/12 passenger specification. Initially Bartini intended the Stal-7 to use a steel tube truss airframe, with fabric covering, but problems with complexity and the flexibility of the truss structure led Bartini to re-design the aircraft with a light-alloy monocoque structure. The hydraulically retractable main undercarriage legs retracted rearwards into the engine nacelles, which were positioned at the junction of the inverted gull wings. The trailing edges had hydraulically operated flaps inboard and ailerons outboard. Both the wings and tail surfaces were sharply tapered and the inboard wing sections sloped sharply upwards to pass through the fuselage cabin. Flight testing began in the Spring of 1937 piloted by N. P. Shebanov, revealing high efficiency in speed, range and load. The Stal-7 crashed on take-off during full load testing, prompting the arrest of Bartini who was sent to a gulag in Siberia. Repair of the Stal-7 was carried out under Vladimir Yermolaev's direction in 1939 and the aircraft continued to demonstrate excellent cruise performance during a , Moscow – Sverdlovsk – Sevastopol – Moscow, non-stop flight averaging . The impressive performance of the Stal-7 prompted the appointment of Yermolaev as the head of OKB-240, to develop the Stal-7 into an effective long-range bomber, resulting in the DB-240 (Dal'niy Bombardirovschik – long-range bomber), Yer-2 and Yer-4 aircraft.

He became an automobile executive who filled a series of high level appointments in the UK. Between 1958 and 1980 he worked for Rolls-Royce Motors (including its predecessor and successor companies). He was Chairman of the company between 1972 and 1980. He subsequently developed a variety of industry directorships and other appointments. Career Plastow was born in Grimsby. He joined Vauxhall Motors Limited in 1950 as an apprentice, and within seven years had worked his way up to the position of sales manager. In 1958 he switched to Rolls-Royce where he worked on the commercial side of the company for the Scotland and North of England region of what was then the automobile division of a company concentrating on aero-engine production. In 1968, now the senior sales director, he joined the board with responsibility for the overall distribution of automobiles. Three years later, in 1971, Rolls-Royce Limited went into liquidation and was for a period nationalised. The financial problems were blamed on the aero-engine division, however, and at the start of 1971 Plastow, from the automobile division, replaced Geoffrey Fawn as managing director of the Rolls-Royce Motor Car Division, while Fawn retained a senior position within the Aero Engine Division. When Rolls-Royce Motors was established as a separate entity in 1972, Plastow became its chairman. He became a director of Vickers plc in 1975, and remained a Vickers director after the Rolls- Royce business was acquired by Vickers in 1980. From 1990 to 1998 he was the chairman of the Medical Research Council. Views Following the 1973 oil price shock political pressure developed in the western world, especially in the US, for cars to become smaller. Detroit was already responding to the economic pressures by developing a wider range of smaller models but also launched a powerful and sustained lobbying campaign directed at Washington. Plastow joined in: in 1978 David Plastow, chief Executive of a company dependent on larger models, in an address to an international audience at Detroit, described as \\"...dangerous nonsense ... [the idea of]... legislators or bureaucrats in either country [deciding] that it is good to level down to a basic type of car....Man continually seeks a better way of life. He is constantly climbing out of one situation upwards into the next, and the symbol of his success during most of this century has often been the type of car he drives\\". Personal life Educated first at Clee Grammar School for Boys in Lincolnshire, and then at Culford School between 1946 and 1950, Plastow married Barbara Ann May in 1954. The marriage produced two recorded children. In addition to his professional life, Plastow found time to be an enthusiastic football supporter. In 1977, he told a journalist that his favourite footballer was Franz Beckenbauer whom he had first seen in action in 1966 at a World Cup tournament in London. Plastow died on 5 June 2019, aged 87.

Unique identity The Holy Cross Church is in Kerala, Kasargod Deanery, and with about a dozen churches, it comes under Catholic Diocese of Mangalore. It falls in Tulu Nadu, a region on the south-western coast of India, where the majority speakers speak the Tulu language. It consists of the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts of Karnataka, and the northern parts of the Kasargod district up to the Chandragiri river in Kerala. The Chandragiri river is traditionally considered to be a boundary between Tulu Nadu and Kerala. Because Tulu speaking kings ruled over the area like Kanniyakumai ruled over by Malayalee kings. Whereas in other the churches in the Diocese of Mangalore the services are conducted in Konkani, English and Malayalam, the main Holy Mass at Pavoor Church at 7:30 am (IST) on Sundays, is in Tulu. The service at 11 am, mainly for children, is in a cocktail of languages. On the first Sunday of the month the service is in Konkani, on the second Sunday in Tulu and on the third and fourth Sundays in Kannada. At the main morning service, the hymns are sung in Tulu, prayers are recited in Tulu and the sermon is preached in Tulu. History There is a book of prayers in Tulu titled Dyanada Book (lit. book of knowledge). There is also a hymn book titled Bhakti Gitolu (lit. Prayer hyms). Tulu in this church is not a modern inculturation transplant. The credit for introducing Tulu at Pavoor Church goes to an Italian Jesuit priest who came to Mangalore in 1897. Fr Alexander Camissa, born in 1868 in Italy, spent one year at Suratkal, Mangalore taluk learning Tulu. He continued his Tulu studies at Jeppu Seminary where he was a teacher. While there, he came across persons belonging to a nomadic tribe who made a miserable living weaving baskets and doing odd jobs for a pittance. When Fr Alexander started the Pavoor Mission in 1913 it was a barren landscape. He obtained of land from the government and settled them there. For the first time they had land of their own to settle down and give up their nomadic life. Thus, the Tulu language services were initiated because the original settlers of Pavoor parish were illiterate, knowing neither Kannada nor Konkani, the dominant church service languages in the region. Even today the original settlers constitute about 95% of the 110 families in the parish, the rest 10 being Konkanis. But, today the settlers are better educated and economically advanced.

Background  D. Duarte de Menezes was the eldest son of the powerful noble D. João de Meneses, 1st Count of Tarouca and Prior of Crato, and his wife D. Joana de Vilhena. He was named after his renowned grandfather, Duarte de Menezes, 3rd Count of Viana, captain of Alcácer-Ceguer.  Tangier  In 1508, Duarte de Menezes succeeded his father as Portuguese captain of Tangier, a function he had already been effectively performing in his father's name since 1507. He carved out a formidable reputation as a military leader in numerous engagements around Tangier.Subrahmanyam, p. 287  India  In 1521, D. Duarte de Menezes was named by King Manuel I of Portugal as the next governor of Portuguese India, succeeding Diogo Lopes de Sequeira. Duarte de Menezes left Lisbon in April, 1521, with an armada of 11 carracks destined for India. He was accompanied by his brother D. Luís de Menezes, who captained one of the ships. On the outgoing leg, Menezes's armada was joined by a squadron of four ships, commanded by Martim Afonso de Mello, destined for China.Quintella, p.361-62 Menezes's armada arrived in Goa at the end of August, 1521. He assumed office in early 1522, upon the departure of his predecessor. D. Duarte de Menezes tenure as governor was considered disastrous. Accused of corruption, he was arrested by his successor, Vasco da Gama, in 1524, and sent back to Portugal.Subrahmanyam, p. 346 He was imprisoned for nearly seven years in the castle of Torres Vedras, before being finally released by the intercession of powerful friendsSubrahmanyam, p. 346 including Dom António de Ataíde, count of Castanheira.  Tangier again  The rehabilitation of Duarte de Menezes was sufficiently complete that in October 1536, he managed to be appointed to his old post as governor of Tangier. He held that post until January, 1539, when he handed over the government to his son, D. João de Meneses. Duarte de Menezes lived out the remainder of his days in Portugal.

The first film to be made as an international coproduction between Australia and Hong Kong, it serves as a satire of the James Bond and Dirty Harry franchises, combined with tropes of the concurrent chopsocky craze. Its plot follows Inspector Fang Sing Leng (Yu) of the RHKPF's Special Branch, who travels to Sydney to perform an extradition, only to find himself locked in battle with Jack Wilton (Lazenby), the city's most powerful crime lord. Having gained experience as an editor of film trailers and director of television documentaries, Trenchard-Smith established a connection with Golden Harvest producers Raymond Chow and Andre Morgan while making two TV specials, The World of Kung Fu (1973) and Kung Fu Killers (1974). Originally conceived as a Bruce Lee vehicle, the film was reconfigured as Yu's English-language debut following Lee's death; much of the remaining cast and crew had previously worked on Trenchard-Smith's documentary films and on Sandy Harbutt's outlaw biker film Stone (1974). Its budget was jointly funded by Golden Harvest, Greater Union and the Australian Film Development Commission. The Man from Hong Kong features multiple large-scale action scenes with elaborate, dangerous stunts. It includes a fight scene between Hung and Ward atop Uluru/Ayers Rock as the film's opening setpiece, several car chases devised by Stone's Peter Armstrong, hang-gliding sequences performed over Hong Kong and Sydney Harbour by Page — who would achieve further recognition as the stunt coordinator of Mad Max (1979) — and a climactic battle between Yu and Lazenby in which the latter is briefly set on fire, which caused injury to the actor's hand. The film's theme song, \\"Sky High\\" by Jigsaw, became a one-hit wonder during the latter half of 1975. Although the film was released in a wide array of markets and turned a profit, The Man from Hong Kong was not the blockbuster Trenchard-Smith and the film's producers had hoped it would be upon its initial release; in Australia, its box office performance was limited as a result of its R rating. Later restored by the Australian National Film and Sound Archive, it has since garnered a cult following as a seminal example of the Ozploitation cycle and one of the key films of Trenchard-Smith's career, and was prominently featured in the documentary Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! (2008). Plot While working undercover at Ayers Rock, Inspector Bob Taylor of the Australian Federal Narcotics Bureau confronts Win Chan, a Chinese drug courier, and his partner; Chan gives chase, leading to a fight on top of the site during which Taylor eventually bests him, while his partner is killed when his car crashes and explodes after being pursued by a police helicopter. Due to Chan's refusal to cooperate and inability to speak English, the Royal Hong Kong Police Force assigns one of its Special Branch's finest officers, Inspector Fang Sing Leng — who is not only a polyglot but also a deadly master of kung fu and sharpshooting — to assist Taylor and his partner, Sergeant Morrie Grosse, in extraditing him. Prior to leaving for Sydney, Fang's exercises at the RHKPF's training school at Wong Chuk Hang are interrupted by the unexpected arrival of journalist Caroline Thorne via a hang-glider, which she flew while conducting research for an article. Although the kite is confiscated, Fang and Caroline flirt and share a tryst, after which Fang agrees to return the glider and rendezvous with her while he is in Sydney. After meeting Taylor and Grosse, Fang — to Taylor's amusement and Grosse's outrage — brutally interrogates Chan and learns that he works for Jack Wilton, an import/export businessman whose varied portfolio — including the operation of a martial arts school — is merely a smokescreen for his criminal activities; his wide array of legitimate and illegitimate interests effectively make him Sydney's most powerful man and near-impossible to arrest. Just before his trial, Chan is shot dead, prompting Fang to chase the sniper, John Grantley, through the streets of Paddington and into a Chinese restaurant, where they fight, leading to Grantley's death; Fang discovers he was a martial arts instructor in Wilton's employ. Despite Taylor and Grosse's warnings, Fang insists on confronting Wilton; a meeting with Mallory, his chief secretary, proves fruitless. During his morning exercise, he recalls his promise to meet with Caroline after seeing a pigeon in-flight, which reminds him of her hang-gliding; she takes him as her guest to a party at Wilton's mansion. After a \\"demonstration\\" between Fang, Wilton and his thugs turns brutal, he is ordered to leave after Wilton trains a crossbow on him. Fang then infiltrates his martial arts school and is near-fatally injured in an extended fight with its staff and students. He hitches a ride with two university students, Angelica and her friend Mei Ling, who take him to the veterinary clinic of the former's father in the countryside of Bathurst. Fang romances Angelica as he is nursed back to health, but insists on returning to Sydney. Angered by Fang's interference, Wilton has Mallory trace his whereabouts from the licence plate of Angelica's van, and sends a squad of assassins after him as he and Angelica drive back to the city. A bomb planted on the van causes it to crash, killing Angelica. Enraged, Fang commandeers a Chrysler Valiant Charger and defeats the gangsters through a series of violent car chases. Learning of Fang's survival, Wilton barricades himself in the penthouse of his skyscraper headquarters. With Caroline's help, Fang flies her glider from Stanwell Park over Sydney Harbour, landing on the roof of the skyscraper. Allowing a line of rope to reach the bottom of the building, he swings into the penthouse, where he battles and overpowers Wilton after his clothes and hand are burnt by his fireplace. Retrieving a bag of heroin from a nearby safe — which is heavily stocked with drugs and weapons — Fang tapes a grenade to Wilton's mouth and threatens to arm it unless he writes and signs a confession describing his crimes. Wilton does so, but Fang accidentally pulls the pin when he is distracted by one of Wilton's guards, prompting him to seal Wilton in the safe. He abseils to the ground, where he is met by Taylor and Grosse, presenting the drugs and confession to them as evidence. The grenade detonates the other bombs in the safe, killing Wilton and destroying the penthouse in a spectacular explosion. Finally won over by Fang's methods, Taylor and Grosse laugh in amazement.

Trenchard-Smith received nine offers of co-production after the film's release.p.237 Reade, Eric History and Heartburn: The Saga of Australian Film 1896-1978 1981 Fairleigh Dickinson University Press The film was originally budgeted at $450,000 but increased when the producers wanted more action sequences and a hit song on the soundtrack. British band Jigsaw recorded \\"Sky High\\" which was used over the opening credits. It went number one in several countries. Production funding came from Greater Union, Golden Harvest and the Australian Film Development Corporation. The film's production company, The Movie Company, was owned 50% by Trenchard-Smith and 50% by Greater Union. Wang Yu was injured in a hang gliding sequence whilst Lazenby had severe burns on his hands during a fight scene. Release At a screening of a restored print in Sydney, Trenchard-Smith said the film didn't do as well as was hoped due to its R adults only rating. However US rights were sold for $200,000 and at Cannes the film sold around the world for a minimum of $500,000 putting it in profit even before it had been released. The film was released in the US as The Dragon Flies. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 6 reviews, and an average rating of 7.2/10. Andrew L. Urban from Urban Cinefile called it \\"one of the few Australian made kung fu action movies and is also notable for its cinematography by Russell Boyd, who went on to win the Oscar for his work on Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.

It recognized three processes for unanimous agreement: \\"acclamation\\", \\"scrutiny\\" (balloting), and \\"compromissum\\" (compromise committee). Acclamation was rare, and often driven more by crowd dynamics than discussion among the electors. Compromise committees were also rare, as they required unanimous agreement to be initiated (although, once formed, only two-thirds of the commission would be required). The requisite majority by balloting was considered a process for determining divine unanimity, that is, sanior et maior pars (Latin: sounder and greater part).

Its title, as is traditional for such documents, is taken from the opening words of the original Latin text, , 'Where greater danger lies'. Its adoption was supported by the hundreds of bishops at that council over the objections of the cardinals. \\"The new pope endeavoured to obviate for the future such scandalous delay by the law of the conclave, which, almost in spite of the cardinals, he promulgated at the fifth session of the Second Council of Lyons in 1764.\\" The regulations were formulated in response to the tactics used against the cardinals by the magistrates of Viterbo during the protracted papal election of 1268–1271, which took almost three years to elect Gregory X. In requiring that the cardinals meet in isolation, Gregory was not innovating but implementing a practice that the cardinals had either adopted on their own initiative or had forced upon them by civil authorities. After later popes suspended the rules of Ubi periculum and several were elected in traditional elections rather than conclaves, Pope Boniface VIII incorporated Ubi periculum into canon law in 1298. Background The goal of Ubi periculum was to limit dilatory tactics and distractions within papal elections, and outside intrusions which might impinge upon the freedom of the electors; it was certainly intended to produce faster outcomes, and, by making the rules more explicit and detailed, to reduce the chances of schism and disputed elections. The imposition of monastic-style modes of living inside the conclave may also have been intended to lift the minds of the electors out of the everyday business of governing the church, and focus their attention on the spiritual importance of their activity. At five of the nine papal elections that were held between 1198 and 1271, inclusive, the participating cardinals had worked in isolation under physical constraints that they chose or had forced on them. In 1198 they sequestered themselves with the rationale that they needed \\"to be free and safe in their deliberations\\". In 1241, Rome was under siege and civic officials isolated the cardinals to force the prompt election of a pope who could negotiate with the city's attackers. For the three elections where the cardinals were sequestered in Rome, they used the same location, the Septizodium, as if the practice were becoming traditional. At the most recent, lengthy election in Viterbo, the local authorities had not held the cardinals incommunicado, but had restricted their movements and controlled their access to food. In other respects the procedures established by Ubi periculum appear to have derived from the election procedures of the Dominican constitution of 1228 as well as the communes of Venice (1229) and Piacenza (1233). Provisions Gregory first required that procedures already established be maintained, citing specifically those of Alexander III, which meant that election requires the votes of two-thirds of the cardinals present. In Ubi periculum Gregory specified further that: English translation. * upon the death of a pope, all magistracies and offices cease their functions, except for the Major Penitentiary and the Minor Penitentiaries, and the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church * the meeting for the election of a pope should be held where the pope and his curia were residing when the pope died, or in the nearest city in the diocese, but not until ten days have elapsed * men of every order and condition are eligible candidates * cardinals may not cast votes in absentia * late arrivals shall be admitted and no cardinal shall be denied entry, not even if he be excommunicated * none may leave until the election is concluded, except on account of illness * the cardinals should be enclosed incommunicado in the palace where the pope died, carefully guarded, each accompanied by one or, if they are ill, two servants * the cardinals should live in common, their shared accommodations should have no interior walls * the cardinals are forbidden to engage in politics or bribery or deal- making, and must restrict themselves to the election at hand * if a pope is not been elected after three days, the cardinals are permitted only one dish at their meals; after eight days only bread, wine and water * enforcement of these rules–and no additional restrictions of their own devising–is delegated to the rulers and officials of the city where the election is held Impact The first election following Ubi periculum observed its rules and took only one day, 20-21 January 1276, to elect Innocent V. The application of Ubi periculum, however, was suspended by his successor Pope Adrian V in consultation with the cardinals in order to make adjustments based on the conclave of January 1276, an effort that ended with Adrian's death just thirty-nine days after his election. His successor John XXI revoked Ubi periculum on 20 September 1276, announced he would issue a substitute set of regulations, but failed to do so before his death in May 1277. The elections–not proper conclaves–of 1277, 1280–1281, 1287–1288, and 1292–1294 were long and drawn out, lasting 7, 6, 11, and 27 months respectively. Pope Celestine V, a Benedictine monk who had not been a cardinal, reinstituted the rules of ubi periculum. Unlike most of his predecessors, he was free to act independently rather than court the support of the cardinals. He was elected in July 1294, reintroduced the rules in September, and abdicated in December. Pope Benedict XI, elected in 1303 at the second conclave to follow Celestine's withdrawal, documented how the conclave that elected him followed Ubi periculum precisely. In 1311 Pope Clement V reaffirmed the rules of Ubi periculum in Ne Romani. He reiterated that the power of the College remained strictly limited during an interregnum and authorized local diocesan authorities in whose jurisdiction a conclave met to force the cardinals to adhere to conclave procedures.

History A proposal was made in 1836 to build a railway line from Zürich to Basel via Laufenburg but it suffered from lack of finance and opposition in Basel. The section between Zürich and Baden opened on 9 August 1847 by the Schweizerische Nordbahn (\\"Swiss North Railway\\"), which became known as the Spanisch-Brötli bahn (\\"Spanish bun railway\\"). The Aargau canton government proposed a continuation of the line via Brugg and the Bözberg Pass to Basel. In 1858 the Schweizerische Centralbahn opened a line from Brugg to Olten, connecting to its Hauenstein line to Basel. At the same time the Zürich–Baden line (which by that time had been merged into the Schweizerische Nordostbahn) was extended to connect with the Centralbahn's line at Brugg. Construction of an alternative route, known as the Bötzbergbahn (BöB) began in 1870 and it was opened on 2 August 1875 through the Bözberg Pass from Pratteln to Brugg via the Frick valley and the 2,526-metre-long Bözberg Tunnel by a joint venture of the Centralbahn and the Nordostbahn. This line is 49 km long, about 8 kilometers shorter than the line via Olten. Trains on it used the Centralbahn between Basel and Pratteln and the Nordostbahn between Brugg and Zürich. The single-track line was built with a maximum grade of 1.4%. In 1895 the section between Pratteln and Stein-Säckingen was duplicated. No further duplications were made until the Bözbergbahn was incorporated in the Swiss Federal Railways on 1 January 1902. In November 190?, the section from Stein-Säckingen to Frick was duplicated. In April 1905 this was followed by the duplication of the Schinznach-Dorf–Brugg section and finally in September 1905 duplication was completed on the section from Schinznach-Dorf through the tunnel to Effingen and Frick. On 18 October 1926 the entire line from Pratteln to Brugg was electrified. Between Basel and Pratteln the Bözberg and Hauenstein lines share the same track. Congestion on this section was relieved by the opening of Adler Tunnel in 2003 between Liestal and Muttenz, which is now used by fast passenger trains.  Operation  = Passenger services = General two inter-regional trains operate each way each hour between Zürich and Basel. One Regio S-Bahn Basel S1 service operates each way each hour between Frick and Basel, stopping at all stations. Intercity trains between Zürich and Basel operate via the faster Olten–Aarau railway (but bypassing Olten) and the Hauenstein line. In 1993, the local rail services between Brugg and Frick closed, and public transport on the route is now only provided by PostBus Aargau line 137 bus service. The stations at Hornussen, Effingen and Schinznach Dorf are no longer served by trains and the Villnachern station is served only two trains a day of Regio S-Bahn Basel. = Freight services = Re 420 (red) and Re 620 (green) locomotives on the northern approach to the Bözberg tunnel Freight trains operate every day over the line to connect with the Gotthard line. They are mostly hauled by two of the most modern freight locomotives of various railway companies or hauled by one Swiss Federal railways Re 420 (formerly Re 4/4 II) paired with a Re 620 (formerly Re 6/6 II)—this combination is known as Re 10/10.  Future developments  The Swiss Federal Office of Transport has granted a permit for the construction of a replacement for the Bözberg railway tunnel. The new tunnel will form part of a scheme to increase the loading gauge on the freight route between Basle and Chiasso via the new Gotthard Base Tunnel.

As of the 1st of November 2014 he is professor of philosophy of the humanities at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. From 2008 until 2018 he was the editor- in-chief of Zygon, Journal of Religion & Science and professor of philosophy of religion at Leiden University, the Netherlands. Biography Drees was born in the Hague on April 20, 1954, as the third child of five and the only son of Willem Drees jr (1922–1998) and Anna Erica Drees-Gescher (1922–1988). His paternal grandfather Willem Drees was the prime minister of the Netherlands from 1948 until 1958. His father was also a Dutch politician being the party leader of the Democratic Socialists '70 from 1971 to 1977. Drees is a past-president of the European Society for the Study of Science and Theology (ESSSAT). He is professor emeritus of philosophy of the humanities at Tilburg University in the Netherlands (2014-2020) and of philosophy of religion at Leiden University (2001-2020). From 2008 until 2018 he also served as the editor-in-chief of Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science. In 2018, he was elected as member of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities (KHMW). Drees has been the editor and publisher of numerous books, journal articles, essays, book reviews and articles for the wider public. His books include Beyond the Big Bang: Quantum Cosmologies and God (1990), Religion, Science and Naturalism (1996), and Creation: From Nothing until Now (2002), Religion and Science in Context: A Guide to the Debates (2010). Religious naturalism and science =Naturalism= Drees addressed in his analysis of cosmology, Beyond the Big Bang the explanatory success of science in addressing big questions and the persistence of limit questions. His second Fulbright grant resulted in the book - Religion, Science and Naturalism (1996). John H. Brooke, historian of science and religion, concluded a review of work of the Oxford theologian Keith Ward and Drees’s book: “Because he is as secure in his epistemology as in his knowledge of theoretical physics, Willem Drees should be read by all who take a scholarly interest in the discourses of ‘science and religion’. His arguments cannot be compressed into sound-bites, and that is their strength.” John H. Brooke - Times Literary Supplement , February 7, 1997 The analysis of naturalism as addressed in his Religious Naturalism and Science has remained a major component in Drees’s research.The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science (2006) He has also paid attention in his analysis of naturalism to the understanding of human nature, with two edited volumes on anthropology and non-reductive physicalism in Dutch and one in English (2000). William A. Rottschaefer argues that Drees’s naturalism is seriously flawed claiming that it is both methodologically and epistemologically naturalistic. Drees maintains while rejecting both of these that ontological naturalism offers the best account of the natural world. It also provides for a supernaturalistic understanding of religion and theology. Although naturalism is often considered to be antithetical to theology and genuine religion, Drees proposes a scientifically informed account of religion, which, he contends, is not only compatible with supernaturalism and theology but provides a better account of both.How to Make Naturalism Safe for Supernaturalism: An Evaluation of Willem Drees's Supernaturalistic Naturalism by William A. Rottschaefer =Religious Naturalism= As the Vice President for Interdisciplinary Affairs of IRAS, Drees has participated in the formulative discussions of Religious Naturalism. He is one of the co-chairs for the IRAS conference in 2021, on Naturalism – as Religion, within Religions, and without Religion. When it comes to his position on this emerging worldview, Drees, says of himself: > Am I a religious naturalist? Others have used that label on me. I am not > sure I like the label, as it seems to constrain, whereas I want to explore. > I also have some sympathy for the naturalistic theism described above. But > certainly, precisely in the attitude of exploring, I fit the naturalism > referenced above. Or I at least, I hope do. Even if I am not sure whether I > am a religious naturalist, I am most interested in understanding what > religious naturalism might mean, may become, and will offer. Jerome A. Stone in his 2008 book Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative cites Drees as one of the leaders of the Religious Naturalism movement along with other member of IRAS – Ursula Goodenough, Karl Peters, Connie Barlow, Michael Cavanaugh and Stone himself.

Tsuchimoto and Shinsuke Ogawa have been called the \\"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\\" Early years Tsuchimoto was born in Gifu Prefecture, but raised in Tokyo. Angered by the emperor system that led Japan into war, he participated in radical student groups like Zengakuren when he entered Waseda University and joined the Japanese Communist Party. For a time he was even involved in the JCP's plan for armed revolt in the mountains and also was arrested for participating in protests. Expelled from Waseda in 1953, he could initially only find work at the Japan-China Friendship Society until he ran into Keiji Yoshino, a filmmaker and executive at Iwanami Productions (Iwanami Eiga), a branch of Iwanami Shoten devoted to making educational and public relations (PR) documentaries. Inspired by Susumu Hani's film Children of the Classroom, he accepted Yoshino's offer to join Iwanami in 1956. He left the JCP in 1957. Iwanami era Tsuchimoto was only an employee at Iwanami Productions for a year (after that, he worked there as a hired freelancer), but he made films alongside other important directors such as Hani, Shinsuke Ogawa, Kazuo Kuroki, and Yōichi Higashi, and cameramen like Jun'ichi Segawa, Tatsuo Suzuki, and Masaki Tamura. The works he made were primarily sponsored by Japanese corporations celebrating their achievements in a period of high economic growth, but the intellectually liberal Iwanami was \\"a hot bed of experimentation,\\" in the words of film scholar Mark Nornes; a place where, according to Tsuchimoto, people wanted to do \\"their own individual shots that could only be done in images not in words.\\" Tsuchimoto's most famous work for Iwanami was An Engineer's Assistant (1963), a film made for the Japanese National Railways about train engineers working hard to keep on time. Conflicts with sponsors and the company inevitably resulted at Iwanami, and it was in particular one controversy over two of Tsuchimoto's contributions to a series of documentaries on Japan's prefectures that led the filmmakers to form the \\"Blue Group\\" (Ao no Kai), an informal organization in which members discussed each other's films and advocated for a new documentary. Many in the Blue Group later left Iwanami to begin producing documentaries independently. One other film Tsuchimoto directed during this period was On the Road: A Document (1963), a film commissioned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police to promote traffic safety just before the Tokyo Olympics. Tsuchimoto, however, worked with a cab driver's union to produce a strong condemnation of urban Japan seen through the eyes of a taxi driver. The film won several awards, but the Police refused to show it and it remained on the shelf for years. Independent filmmaking Tsuchimoto was one of the first Iwanami-related directors to go independent. In 1965, he began a documentary for television on an exchange student who was under threat of being deported back to Malaysia, despite the fact he would likely be punished for his political activities upon his return. The network withdrew when problems arose with the Malaysian government, but Tsuchimoto decided to make the film, Exchange Student Chua Swee Lin, anyway. Gathering donations, he placed his camera firmly on the student's side and eventually prevented the deportation. In Nornes's words, \\"This is a movie that started a movement rather than represented it,\\" and became a model for later committed independent documentary. After making Prehistory of the Partisans, which showed student radicals at Kyoto University from inside the barricades, for Ogawa Productions, Tsuchimoto began his most famous work, a series of documentaries about the mercury poisoning incident in Minamata, Japan. Disturbed that an earlier effort to film Minamata disease for a television documentary had met with resistance from those afflicted, apparently due to suspicions about the media, Tsuchimoto this time dedicated himself to working with the victims. In the first, and most famous film in the series, Minamata: The Victims and Their World (1971), he let the victims speak for themselves, giving their side of the story, which was not being represented in the mass media or recognized by Chisso, the polluter, and the government. He did not just show their plight to others, but worked to show his films in the area to educate other victims. According to the critic Chris Fujiwara, \\"Tsuchimoto’s cinema embodies a search for a point of view capable of representing the point of view of his subjects, and an immersion of the filmmaker’s subjectivity in the contradictions of his material.\\" Some films in the series, such Minamata Disease: A Trilogy, were primarily focused on the medical issues of Minamata disease, not just the politics. And as in Minamata: The Victims and Their World and The Shiranui Sea (1975), he did not look on the victims as objects of pity or agents of protest, but endeavored to understand their world, finding in their struggle to maintain their close relationship with the sea and their traditional ways of living, much of which had been upset by environmental pollution, \\"the original figure of humanity.\\" Tsuchimoto made around a dozen films about Minamata, but he also worked on many other subjects, ranging from the poet Shigeharu Nakano to the plight of Koreans in Japan. A number of his films extended in concerns with pollution, the sea, and the costs of political oppression and modernization by exploring the atomic bomb and nuclear energy. He was also interested in Afghanistan, and made three films about that country before the Taliban, such as Afghan Spring and Another Afghanistan: Kabul Diary 1985. He also published several books and was a featured filmmaker at the 2003 Flaherty Seminar. He died of lung cancer on 24 June 2008.

In Australia, vertical fiscal imbalance is addressed by the transfer of funds as grants from the federal government to the states and territories. Vertical fiscal imbalance Vertical fiscal imbalance in Australia is largely the product of the Commonwealth's takeover of income taxes in 1942, during World War II, and rulings of the High Court of Australia that made various state taxes unconstitutional under the Australian Constitution, in particular section 90 and section 109. The Australian Constitution allows both States and the Commonwealth to raise revenue, but subsequent constitutional interpretation and political developments have limited state taxing powers and led to a vertical fiscal imbalance. Vertical fiscal imbalance means that the revenue-raising abilities of the governments do not coincide with their spending responsibilities. As Section 51 and other provisions of the constitution (such as section 52 and section 90) prescribe only limited legislative powers to the Commonwealth, Australian states have considerable obligations. For example, primarily, Australian states fund schools and hospitals. The result of the limitations on state taxing power is that the Commonwealth collects the money through taxes, and distributes that money to states. The power to distribute funds to states, on conditions, is contained in Section 96 of the Australian Constitution. As a result, the sphere of Commonwealth power has expanded through dictating policy through conditional grants. This limits the autonomy and power of the states in controlling policy. =Loss of State income taxing power= Before 1942, consistent with the concurrent power in section 51(ii), both the states and the Commonwealth levied income taxes. However, in 1942 the Commonwealth attempted to gain a monopoly on income taxes by passing the Income Tax Act 1942 and the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942. The first act purported to impose Commonwealth income tax. The latter act said Commonwealth funding would be provided to the States only if they imposed no income tax. This latter act was premised on Section 96 of the Australian Constitution Act. Section 96 of the Australian Constitution provides: :… the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit The States Grant Act therefore placed the \\"term and condition\\" that states did not tax at all as a pre-requisite to funding. The Income Tax Act 1942, by setting high tax rates (i.e. that would reflect the combined current Commonwealth and State taxes) made imposing current tax rates unattractive or impossible for State governments. This was because the Income Tax Assessment Act 1942 said that individuals had to pay Commonwealth tax before State taxes. In effect, the scheme meant either the States had to accept grants and stop taxing, or decline grants and try to collect tax at rates which were unsustainable. The High Court has interpreted \\"terms and conditions\\" very broadly. In South Australia v Commonwealth (1942) 65 CLR 373 (the First Uniform Tax case) the scheme was upheld. There is an opinion that the scheme, introduced in 1942, was upheld on the basis of the defence power in Section 51(vi). The Commonwealth re-enacted the scheme after the war. There was a second constitutional challenge and the scheme was upheld on the basis of Section 96, in Victoria v Commonwealth (1957) 99 CLR 575 (the Second Uniform Tax case). Since 1942 no state has imposed income taxes; instead the states have largely relied on Section 96 grants. In introducing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Commonwealth agreed to distribute GST revenues to the States according to a formula. Horizontal fiscal imbalance Australia also has a horizontal fiscal imbalance, which arises because state and territory governments have different abilities to raise revenue from their tax bases and because their respective costs of providing public services differ. This imbalance is addressed by a horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) policy overseen by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. When the Commonwealth transfers funds to states and territories, it does not give each State a fixed amount or an amount proportional to the state's population relative to other states. Rather, it uses a formula to disburse funds to states on a needs-basis and its ability to raise its own revenue. Australia has a formal horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) scheme, introduced in 1933, which distribute more funds to States and territories which have a lower capacity to raise revenue or have a greater cost burden, to enable each State and territory to have the capacity to provide services and the associated infrastructure at the same standard, if each made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency. Currently, the funds distributed to achieve HFE are the revenues raised by the Commonwealth from the goods and services tax (GST), currently about AU$50bn a year. The amount collected by the Commonwealth from GST is distributed by the federal Treasurer each year on the basis of advice provided by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Achieving HFE does not mean that the States are directed how to raise revenue or how to spend their funds. GST revenue grants from the Commonwealth are unencumbered and available for any purpose. Accordingly, HFE equalises fiscal capacity, not fiscal policies which remain for the States and territories to decide for themselves. It does not result in the same level of services or taxes in all States, direct that the States must achieve any specified level of service in any area, nor impose actual budget outcomes in accordance with the Commission's calculations.Commonwealth Grants Commission Specific purpose payments Commonwealth grants to the states are of two types: * general purpose payments, which states can use for whatever purpose they choose, and * specific purpose payments (SPPs) (or tied grants), which are grants to states for specific projects decided by the Commonwealth, e.g. schools, hospitals, or roads. The ability of the Commonwealth to make specific purpose payments without legislative authority was called into question in Williams v Commonwealth (2012) (also known as the \\"School chaplains case\\").. The High Court held that section 61 of the Constitution, which had commonly been thought to grant the Commonwealth unfettered powers to enter into specific purpose payments to the States, did not extend to payments where there was no supporting legislation.

This followed the extension of a French railway to Basel in 1844. The original line generally followed the south bank of the Limmat from Zürich to near its confluence with the Aar near Brugg and then it generally followed the south bank of the Aar to Olten. It was absorbed into the Swiss Northeastern Railway (German: Schweizerische Nordostbahn, NOB) in 1853 and extended from Baden to Brugg in 1858. The line was absorbed into the Swiss Federal Railways on its establishment in 1902. It is electrified at 15 kV 16.7 Hz and its eastern 16 km section from Zürich to Killwangen-Spreitenbach is now part of the Zürich–Olten trunkline and has four tracks. History Baden specialty The section between Zürich and Baden was opened on 7 August 1847 by the Swiss Northeastern Railway. It was the first line built in Switzerland, except for the line built from Mulhouse to Basel by the French company Chemin de fer de Strasbourg à Bâle, opened to a temporary station outside Basel's walls on 15 June 1844 and to the permanent station on 11 December 1845. The construction of railways in Switzerland was delayed compared to most of its neighbours, partly as a result of its mountainous geography. In addition the cantons were in a position to influence the routes chosen, particularly because of the need for compulsory purchase to build railways. In 1836 Friedrich Hünerwadel of Lenzburg pointed out to the government of the canton of Aargau—through which the line had to pass—the importance of the route of a railway from Zurich to Basel for Aargau's commerce and industry. In 1837, the Zürich Chamber of Commerce commissioned the engineer Alois Negrelli to investigate the route of such a line. In October of the same year the Zurich-Basel railway company was founded. The chosen route would lead from Zürich to Würenlos via Dietikon along the south bank of the Limmat, then crossing the river to follow the north bank of the Limmat via Wettingen, Ennetbaden and Obersiggenthal. In Untersiggenthal the line would turn to the north and have crossed the Aare at Döttingen. It would have then followed the south bank of the Rhine to Basel. In April 1838 surveying of the route began, but angry residents obstructed their work. The Züriputsch of 1839 and a civil war-like constitutional dispute in the canton of Aargau further delayed the start of construction. In addition the route of the line was controversial. Some called for a line through the Bözberg Pass, which was the route of the Bözberg line opened in 1875. Although the Aargau parliament passed a law permitting compulsory purchase in November 1840, several shareholders lost their financial guarantees, and the company had to be dissolved in December 1841. In May 1843 representatives of the cantons of Aargau, Zurich and Basle met in the Baden City Hall, but they failed to come to any agreement. =Construction= In May 1845 a new committee was formed under the leadership of the Zurich industrialist Martin Escher. The planned line would now keep to the south bank of the Limmat, which it would only cross at Turgi. Finally, it was planned to cross the Rhine between Koblenz and Waldshut (then in the state of Baden) to connect with the planned Baden Mainline between Basel and Konstanz. With an assurance that Alois Negrelli would direct the engineering and that a branch line would be later built from Baden to Lenzburg and Aarau, the Aargau parliament approved the project in July 1845. The first stage of construction would be the section from Zurich to Baden. The gauge of was chosen,Die Internationalität der Eisenbahn 1850 - 1970 - Monika Burri, Kilian T Elsasser, David Gugerli the same gauge as the German Grand Duchy of Baden State Railway, which was also constructed during that time Negrelli relocated the station in Baden to the north side of the town, requiring the construction of the 80-meter-long Schlossberg tunnel. Gustav Albert Wegmann designed the Zürich railway station, while Ferdinand Stadler designed the Baden station. At the end of 1845 the Nordbahn company was founded with a share capital of 20 million francs, in the spring of 1846 construction work started. The route for the most part was easy, although there were small landslides between Neuenhof and Baden. The greatest challenge was the construction of the Schlossberg tunnel, where prisoners were initially used for this work; later unskilled workers were also used there. There were three fatalities in a blasting accident and an additional six workers died of typhoid. The tunnel was broken through on 14 April 1847. =Opening= The line opened on 7 August 1847 and was the first line located entirely on Swiss territory. Shortly after 11:30 am, the arrival of the first official train in Zurich was announced with gun salute. He brought the invited guests and members of the Aargau authorities from Baden to Zurich. The locomotive No. 1 «Limmat» required only 23 minutes, which would correspond to an average speed of 42 km / h. After celebrations and sightseeing of the train station infrastructure the train left Zurich for Baden at 13:00 with 140 invited guests; scheduled operations started two days later. Every day there were four trips in each direction. The 20 km journey took 45 minutes with the trains stopping at Altstetten, Schlieren and Dietikon. Soon after the opening, the line began to be called the \\"Spanisch- Brötli bahn\\" (\\"Spanish bun railway\\") because the Zürich gentry sent their servants by train to Baden to buy these buns in order to impress their clients at Sunday morning teas. Previously their servants had to set out from Baden at midnight on foot with the buns. The buns were apparently derived from buns made in Milan during the 17th century when it was under Spanish control. Under the laws of the canton they could only be made in Baden. The railway had little commercial success. Its passenger numbers were reduced by the Sonderbund war and the Revolutions of 1848 in neighboring countries. The Nordbahn dropped one of the daily services and indefinitely delayed the construction of further stages. Construction of the branch line from Baden to Lenzburg and Aarau was abandoned. Eventually, the company succeeded in coming to an agreement with the postal administration so that the coach service to Bern no longer ran on the Zurich–Baden section, but the coach service between Zurich and Basel continued to run beside the railway. =Extension to Brugg and Olten= Only after the enactment of the Federal Railways Act of 1852—made possible by the new constitution of 1848—and the merger of the company with Alfred Escher's Bodensee und Rheinfallbahnen (\\"Lake Constance and Rhine Falls Railway\\") to form the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (\\"Swiss Northeast Railway\\") in 1853 were construction plans resumed and the original line was regauged to . The line was opened to Brugg in 1858, where it met the line from Olten built by the Schweizerische Centralbahn.

His sire, Correspondent, was a winner of the 1953 Blue Grass Stakes and the 1954 Hollywood Gold Cup. Grandsire Khaled was also the sire of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Swaps. Sherluck was conditioned for racing by Harold Young. Racing career At age two Sherluck's best result in a major race for his age group was a third-place finish in the Pimlico Futurity. At age three, Sherluck's win in the Blue Grass Stakes under future Hall of Fame jockey Braulio Baeza made him a legitimate contender for the Kentucky Derby. Under superstar jockey Eddie Arcaro, he finished fifth to Carry Back in the Derby and under Sam Boulmetis, he was fifth again to Carry Back in the Preakness Stakes. Going into the Belmont Stakes, Sherluck had won only once in his ten starts that year but, reunited with Braulio Baeza, the colt gave him the first of his three wins in the Belmont, with Carry Back finishing seventh in the nine-horse field. With Braulio Baeza again on board, Sherluck won October's Lawrence Realization Stakes at Belmont Park, beating Carry Back again. The following month, jockey Bill Shoemaker rode him to victory in the Roamer Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack Stud record Retired to stud duty in the United States, Sherluck was not successful, and in 1970 was sent to breeders in France and then to Denmark in 1975.

Situated at one end of the quad, it was Texas State's first building, built in 1903, and remained the only building on campus until 1908. Old Main was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983. It currently houses the offices for the School of Journalism and Mass Communication as well as the College of Fine Arts. Design and construction Edward Northcraft designed the building for Southwest Texas State Normal College (now Texas State University) in 1902. The building was dubbed \\"Main\\" as it was the only building on the campus when it was opened for classes in the Fall of 1903. The original design included an auditorium and chapel on the second floor with an ornate cathedral ceiling, stage and balcony. When construction began, multiple loads of concrete were poured for the foundation which disappeared into the ground. A cave under the site of the building was discovered and had to be plugged before the foundation could really be set. Contractors for the Old Main Building were Francis Fischer & R.C. Lambie of Austin, Texas. Once other buildings began opening on campus to hold classes, the building was used as the university's administration building. 1972 - Present A view of Old Main, shot from the 7th floor of the Albert B. Alkek Library at Texas State University In 1972, the interior of the building was renovated and the chapel ceiling was restored. Following completion of this work the building was rededicated and officially became \\"Old Main.\\" During this renovation, the auditorium on the second floor was partitioned into smaller rooms. In 1988, a renovation added a floor at the balcony level. This renovation maintained the ornate ceiling which was visible on the new third floor. The most recent renovations in 1993 and 1994 restored the original color and style of the building's roof. Today, Old Main at Texas State holds the College of Fine Arts and Communication along with the School of Journalism and Mass Communication. A $3.5 million restoration and repair on Old Main's roof was completed in January 2014 with most of the work being done in 2013. Scaffolding was removed on January 17, 2014. The project included replacement of the roof and minor structural repairs to roof substrate and damaged/deteriorated wood framing members.

Bloomsbury Publishing, UK) Desertion is a 2005 novel by Abdulrazak Gurnah.  Plot  The novel is narrated by Rashid in all but one of the ten chapters, which exception is drawn from the notebooks of his brother Amin. Rashid is the youngest child of teaching parents: he is two years younger than Amin, who is in turn two years younger than Farida, their sister. The children are brought up in Zanzibar late in 1950s, during a time of heady transition from colonialism to independence. Rashid spins two tales: one is in part his own, and largely contingent on the other, set some fifty years thence on the outskirts of a small town in colonial Kenya, along the east African coast north of Mombasa, when early one morning in 1899 an Englishman stumbles out of the desert and collapses before a local shopkeeper outside his mosque. The latter, Hassanali, takes him back home and, amidst the considerable kerfuffle, and with some help from family and local professionals, begins nursing the man back to health. Hassanali is a nervous, superstitious, cowardly man. On first being approached by the almost lifeless Pearce, he mistakes him for a ghoulish genie come to spirit his soul away. Before long, an English district officer, one Frederick Turner, arrives on the scene. He accuses Hassanali of having stolen whatever goods the Englishman brought with him, and promptly conveys him back to the residency. The traveller's name, as it turns out, is Martin Pearce, a man of liberal thought and broad linguistic knowledge, and something of an \\"Orientalist\\". During his convalescence with Turner, he begins quickly to feel guilty about the harsh treatment and false accusations levelled at his original saviours, for he genuinely arrived with almost nothing but the clothes on his back: the only item he seems to have lost is his notebook. On visiting the shopkeeper to apologise, he sees Rehana, Hassanali's sister, and falls for her immediately. Rehana's father was an Indian trader who settled in Mombasa and married a local woman, but the family is now part of the \\"Arabised minority\\"Phillips 2005. in a town still fresh with the memory of its years of slavery under the sultan. The subsequent relationship between Rehana and Pearce is, of course, a scandal. Rashid in his narrative admits that it is difficult to say how it came about, if less so to figure out how it was discovered. The upshot is that Rehana is forced to vacate the town and take up lodgings elsewhere with Pearce. Half a century later, Amin, Rashid and Farida are growing up and receiving a typical colonial education in pre-independent Zanzibar. Amin, like his parents, is to train to become a schoolteacher; Rashid is studying for Oxbridge; and Farida, an academic failure, becomes the family housekeep and small-business dressmaker to the young women of the town. One of her clients is a beautiful woman named Jamila, granddaughter of Rehana and Pearce. Despite her lowly repute \\"as a divorced woman whose grandmother slept with mzungus \\",Phillips 2005. Amin falls in love with her, and she with him. His parents are outraged on discovering the secret and refuse to brook it: > Do you know who she is? Do you know what kind of people they are? Her > grandmother was a chotara, a child of sin by an Indian man, a bastard. When > she grew into a woman, she was the mistress of an Englishman for many years, > and before that another mzungu gave her a child of sin too, her own bastard. > That was her life, living dirty with European men [.... T]hey are a rich > family so they don't care what anybody thinks. They've always done as they > wished. This woman that you say you love, she is like her grandmother, > living a life of secrets and sin. She has been married and divorced already. > No one knows where she comes and where she goes, or who she goes to see. > They are not our kind of people.Gurnah 2005. Amin is made to promise never to see her again, and he never really does. He fears for the rest of his life that she thinks he has deserted her. In the case of Rashid, meanwhile, it is his passionate book-learning that results in his desertion first of his home and eventually \\"of the entire culture\\":Phillips 2005. \\"The place was stifling him, he said: the social obsequiousness, the medieval religiosity, the historical mendacities.\\"Gurnah 2006. After independence and the subsequent revolution, life for all the characters is altered completely. Rashid misses the socio-political turmoil back home in his isolation as a university student in England; in fact, he never sees his ailing, tragic family again. Although he keeps up a steady stream of correspondence, this becomes increasingly strained with the preterition of time and the need for caution engendered of a brutal and dictatorial government. His only knowledge of the situation is gleaned from the letters and a few allusive snippets of news. Both Ma and Amin lose their sight, and the former's death is celebrated as having put her out of her mounting misery. Years later, Rashid is able to piece the story together using Amin's notebooks, his own memory and a chance encounter with another of Pearce's descendants.  Critical reception  Desertion is one of Gurnah's most acclaimed novels. Mike Phillips, reviewing it for The Guardian, wrote, > Most of Desertion is as beautifully written and pleasurable as anything I've > read recently, a sweetly nostalgic recall of a colonial childhood and a > vanished Muslim culture, defined by its thoughtful and customary manners, > layered by its calendar of festivals and religious observances. At the same > time each of its virtues are parallelled and offset by the petty cruelties > of a small, incestuous community. Gurnah's portrait of the society's > complexities is the work of a maestro.Phillips 2005. The 2006 edition of the > novel took disingenuous liberties with this quotation, plastering thus it on > the cover: \\"As beautifully written and pleasurable as anything I've read ... > Gurnah's portrait is the work of a maestro\\" (Gurnah 2006). Phillips was unhappy only with the novel's account of Rashid's desertion of his roots, describing it as > the least satisfactory, least insightful element of the book [... W]e are > told little which illuminates the relationship between the culture of the > minority to which he belongs and the chaos which replaces it.Phillips 2005.  Themes  \\"Desertion and abandonment,\\" according to Phillips, \\"are the themes that run through this novel, and which link its stories of tragic love with the history and politics of the east African coast.\\"Phillips 2005. Where many have seen Desertion as primarily a political, postcolonial commentary on the imperial relationship with Britain, Phillips discarded this as > more or less tangential in the progress of the narrative. Instead, it is the > Kiswahili and Muslim culture, along with its Arabic roots, which forms the > backdrop of the novel and dominates the lives of the characters.Phillips > 2005. There is also throughout the novel a faintly Gothic strain, beginning with Hassanali's mistaken early citing of Pearce. On Pearce's apologetic return to the shop, an elderly villager remarks, > [... Y]ou have amazed us, o sheikh mzungu [....] If you had spoken when we > found you a few days ago, looking like a corpse, and had spoken to us in > Arabic, and had spoken thus in that dangerous hour, I think we would have > taken you for a servant of the infernal one.Gurnah 2006. Doomed love features time and again. All the relationships in the novel (except for the established one of Ma and Ba, and Farida's with her Mombasa lover Abbas, which is nevertheless \\"long delayed and littered with obstacles\\"Phillips 2005.) \\"are doomed, victims of their time and place.\\"Phillips 2005.  Readings  = Autobiographical = Among the most tempting readings of Desertion is of an echo of the life of Gurnah himself, although no critic appears yet to have noticed this. Rashid, certainly, has a great deal in common with his literary progenitor: both born at about the same time in pre-independent Zanzibar, both uprooted from those roots for their adult lives in England, both passionate scholars of literature, both winning PhDs (Gurnah from the University of Kent, Rashid from the University of London), and both going on to careers as university lecturers (Gurnah remaining at Kent, Rashid repairing to one in country surrounds).Gurnah 2006, p. 263  Narrative style  Rashid, according to Phillips, frequently challenges his own reluctance to repeat the \\"cliché of the miraculous\\",Gurnah 2006. spinning his yarns in prose intentionally reminiscent of the Arabian Nights, \\"echoing with djinns, visions, sudden journeys, disappearances, and the domineering rhythms of the surrounding ocean.\\"Phillips 2005.

A plasmodium is a living structure of cytoplasm that contains many nuclei, rather than being divided into individual cells each with a single nucleus. Plasmodia are best known from slime molds, but are also found in parasitic Myxosporea, and some algae such as the Chlorarachniophyta. Structure A plasmodium is an amoeboid, multinucleate, and naked mass of cytoplasm that contains many diploid nuclei. The resulting structure, a coenocyte, is created by many nuclear divisions without the process of cytokinesis, which in other organisms pulls newlydivided cells apart. In some cases, the resulting structure is a syncytium, created by the fusion of cells after division. Under suitable conditions, plasmodia differentiates and forms fruiting bodies bearing spores at their tips. Taxonomic distribution The term plasmodium, introduced by Leon Cienkowski,Kuznicki, L. & Dryl, S. (1987). Leon Cienkowski. Acta Protozoologica 26 (1): 1-2, . usually refers to the feeding stage of slime molds; these are macroscopic mycetozoans. The multinucleate developmental stages of some intracellular parasites, namely Microsporidia (now in Fungi) and Myxosporidia (now in Cnidaria), former cnidosporans, are also sometimes called plasmodia.Hoek, C. van den, Mann, D.G. and Jahns, H.M.

It is currently hosted by Kiri Pritchard-McLean and previously by Miles Jupp (2009-Mar 2011), Justin Edwards (Sep 2011-2013), Romesh Ranganathan (2014), Nish Kumar (2015-2016) and Angela Barnes (2017-2018). It was first broadcast on BBC Radio 7 on 4 June 2009. The series is notable for having an \\"Open door\\" policy on writing, advertising itself as \\"the scrapbook sketch show written entirely by the Great British public\\" meaning that unsolicited writers without contract to the BBC can send in material. The show is designed to give new writers an opportunity to get material broadcast. It is hoped by the people behind the show that it may become a modern version of Week Ending, an earlier sketch show which also accepted material the same way. It is recorded in front of a live audience at the BBC Radio Theatre in Broadcasting House. Format Each episode of Newsjack begins with an introduction from the presenter before the main sketches. The host is joined by a different cast each week - a mixture of experienced sketch performers and new upcoming talent. Previous regular cast members include: Margaret Cabourn-Smith (who also stood in as host for Series 9 Episode 6 when regular host Justin Edwards was unable to attend the recording), Lewis MacLeod, Pippa Evans, Andi Osho and Jess Robinson. Philip Fox has appeared in several episodes, whilst Cariad Lloyd and Mike Wozniak have also appeared in the supporting cast. As well as standalone sketches, the show also features recurring segments. The current segments are Breaking News and Number Crunchers. *Breaking News: A one-liner linked to a current news story. *Number Crunchers: A joke with a statistical set-up and punchline. This segment was introduced in series 16 and has also been referred to as \\"Number Breakdown\\" and \\"Number Crunching\\". Writers wishing to submit material for Newsjack are invited to write material for these segments as well as their own sketches not related to them. In the past recurring segments have included: *The Newsjack App: Mock answerphone messages. These are designed so that writers can create one-liners and other kinds of quick jokes. *From the Archive: The show looks at a (fictional) programme from the past to see how news stories similar to those of today were covered in the past. *Julia: a woman called Julia has been locked in a room, which symbolises the dark world of petty journalism, e.g.: reporting on the wedding of Zara Philips. As a result, she has become psychotic, longing to see sunlight; upon which the presenter shuts the door on her desperate pleas. *Newsjack Films: Spoof movie trailers. *Celebrity Diary: The cast impersonate a celebrity and see recent events from their viewpoint. *Corrections: At the end of the programme, the cast read out made-up corrections relating to things from the previous episode. *Viewsjack: One-liners in the style of a vox-pop interview answer. *And Finally: A post-credits sequence where the show pretends the current episode is an old show and make jokes about how the world might have changed since the programme went out. *Newsjackpedia: Introduced in series 19. Spoof entries for an online encyclopedia. Production Nish Kumar in January 2016 Newsjack, was always intended to be an \\"Open door\\" show in terms of writing. However, it first became known in early 2009 when it launched a competition to find new comedy writers for the show. The winners of this competition went on to a masterclass on comedy writing with David Mitchell on 9 March 2009. Although originally Gareth Edwards was intended to be producer for the show, the job of producer eventually went to Tilusha Ghelani and Sam Michell. The current producers are Hayley Sterling and Leila Navabi. The show was first broadcast as a pilot on 4 June 2009. This pilot was broadcast first so as to give a guide to new writers about the sort of material that the programme was looking for. The first deadline for new material was 15 June 2009 at noon. While the first series was originally intended to run for ten weeks, this was reduced to the pilot and six episodes, one per week. In total there have been twenty-two series of six episodes, and two compilation episodes: a review of the year episode, broadcast on New Year's Eve 2011, and shortly before series eight, a programme 'Newsjack Revisited' broadcast on Radio 4, featuring the best sketches from previous series seven. The episodes are also available to download as a podcast. Transmission dates are as follows.

They are used in the financial sector, the chemical process industry, and other areas. In financial terms, quantitative risk assessments include a calculation of the single loss expectancy of monetary value of an asset. In the chemical process and petrochemical industries a QRA is primarily concerned with determining the potential loss of life (PLL) caused by undesired events. Specialist software can be used to model the effects of such an event, and to help calculate the potential loss of life. Some organisations use the risk outputs to assess the implied cost to avert a fatality (ICAF) which can be used to set quantified criteria for what is an unacceptable risk and what is tolerable. For the explosives industry, QRA can be used for many explosive risk applications. It is especially useful for site risk analysis when reliance on quantity distance (QD) tables is not feasible. Limitations Some of the QRA software models described above must be used in isolation: for example the results from a consequence model cannot be used directly in a risk model. Other QRA software programs link different calculation modules together automatically to facilitate the process. Some of the software is proprietary and can only be used within certain organisations. Due to the large amount of data processing required by QRA calculations, the usual approach has been to use two- dimensional ellipses to represent hazard zones such as the area around an explosion which poses a 10% chance of fatality. Similarly, a pragmatic approach is used in the simplification of dispersion results. Typically a flat terrain, unobstructed world is used to determine the behaviour of a dispersing cloud and/or a vaporizing pool. This presents problems when the effects of non-flat terrain or the complex geometry of process plants would no doubt affect the behaviour of a dispersing cloud. Though they have limitations, the 2D hazard zone and simplified approach to 3D dispersion modelling allow the handling of large volumes of risk results with known assumptions to assist in decision-making. The trade-off shifts as computer processing power increases. The modeling of the consequences of hazardous events in a true 3D manner may require a different approach, for example using a computational fluid dynamics method to study cloud dispersion over hilly terrain. The creation of CFD models requires significantly more investment of time on the part of the modeling analyst (because of the increased complexity of the modeling), which may not be justified in all cases. One major limitation of QRA in the safety field is that it is focussed primarily on the loss of containment of hazardous fluids and what happens when they are released. This renders QRA somewhat unworkable in hazardous industries that do not focus on fluid containment yet are still subject to catastrophic events (e.g. aviation, pharmaceuticals, mining, water treatment, etc.) This has led to the development of a risk process that draws on the experience of organisations and their employees to produce risk assessments that produce potential loss of life (PLL) outputs without fault and event tree modelling. This process is probably most commonly known by the name SQRA which was the first methodology to enter the marketplace in the late 1990s but is perhaps more accurately described by the term Experience-based Quantification (EBQ). Today there is a choice of software with which to undertake this methodology and it has been used extensively in the mining industry on a global basis. In an effort to be more fair and to avoid adding to already high imprisonment rates in the US, courts across America have started using quantitative risk assessment software when trying to make decisions about releasing people on bail and sentencing, which are based on their history and other attributes. It analyzed recidivism risk scores calculated by one of the most commonly used tools, the Northpointe COMPAS system, and looked at outcomes over two years, and found that only 61% of those deemed high risk actually committed additional crimes during that period and that African-American defendants were far more likely to be given high scores that white defendants. These results are part of larger questions being raised in the field of machine ethics with regard to the risks of perpetuating patterns of discrimination via the use of big data and machine learning across many fields.

History =Origins to 2000= The origins of Fieldfisher can be traced back to the founding of the law firm Field Roscoe & Co. by Edwin Wilkins Field in 1835. In 1865 Theodore Waterhouse founded Waterhouse & Co. In 1897, Charles Fisher started his articles with Thomas Peacock, which later became TF Peacock Fisher. In 1930, Field Roscoe merged with Treherne Higgins. In 1969, Field Roscoe and TF Peacock Fisher merged to form Field Fisher & Co. In 1972, Field Fisher & Co. merged with Martineau and Reid to become Field Fisher Martineau. Field Fisher Waterhouse was created in 1989 by the merger of Field Fisher Martineau and Waterhouse & Co. In 1998 Field Fisher Waterhouse merged with Allison & Humphreys (A&H;). A&H; was a media and communications specialist and complemented Field Fisher Waterhouse’s IT and internet expertise. The BBC was one of the key clients that A&H; lawyers brought to the firm. =2000 to present= In June, 2006 Field Fisher Waterhouse converted to LLP status. In 2007, the firm took its first steps into Europe; in April offices were established in Brussels and Hamburg, and in November an office in Paris was opened. The firm subsequently opened additional German offices in Munich and Düsseldorf. In September 2012, the firm opened an office in Palo Alto, California. On 1 April 2014, Field Fisher Waterhouse merged with the Manchester-based law firm Heatons. In May 2014 the firm was renamed Fieldfisher In July 2016 Fieldfisher merged with the Italian law firm Studio Associato Servizi Professionali Integrati (SASPI), which had offices in Milan, Rome, Venice and Turin. SASPI changed its name to Fieldfisher upon completion of the merger. In November 2016 Fieldfisher merged with the Birmingham-based commercial law firm Hill Hofstetter. In the same month Fieldfisher merged with the Beijing-based law firm JS Partners. In May 2017, Fieldfisher launched an Amsterdam office and in 2018 it opened in Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Belfast. Fieldfisher merged with Spanish firm JAUSAS in September 2018, to add Madrid and Barcelona to its network of offices. In May 2019 it was announced the firm had merged with Irish law firm McDowell Purcell, effective 1 May 2019 References External links * Category:Law firms based in London Category:Law_firms_of_the_United_Kingdom Category:Law firms with offices in foreign countries Category:Foreign law firms with offices in the Netherlands Category:Intellectual_property_law_firms Category:Patent_law_firms ","title":"Fieldfisher"},{"id":"23094482","text":"The People's Khural of the Republic of Buryatia (Buryat: Buryaad Ulasai Aradai Khural) is the unicameral legislature of the Republic of Buryatia.

The Ta-3 was envisioned to serve primarily as an escort fighter. Competing contemporaneous designs in the USSR included the Grushin Gr-1, Mikoyan-Gurevich DIS and Polikarpov TIS.  Development  Tairov designed and built the OKO-6 to a Soviet Air Force requirement for a twin-engined escort fighter to escort and protect bombers on long range missions. Competing proposals included the Grushin Gr-1, MiG DIS and Polikarpov TIS. The aircraft was a single-seat monoplane of mixed construction; with wing spars of 30KhGSA (30ХГСА) steel, D1 aluminium alloy ribs, flush riveted skin, and elektron magnesium alloy leading edges; the fuselage was largely of flush-riveted D1 aluminium alloy built as a semi-monocoque shell with a wooden tail section. Armour was provided fore and aft of the compact cockpit, and the heavy armament was grouped around the nose of the aircraft, with two 12.7mm BS machine guns in the upper nose and four ShVAK20 cannon in the lower forward fuselage. The engines were housed in large underwing nacelles and drove counter rotating propellers to eliminate torque effect with throttle movement. First flown by Yu. K. Stankevich on 31 December 1939, the first aircraft was also tested by LII until the summer of 1940 when one of the engines threw a connecting-rod. The directional stability was found to be unsatisfactory so the second prototype (OKO-6bis) was built with a much longer rear fuselage, twin fins on the tips of a longer span tailplane as well as more powerful engines with LH rotation. The third prototype was initially called OKO-6bis, changed to Ta-3, was flown by Stankevich in May 1941 with M-89 engines, one AM-37 37mm cannon and two ShVAK20 20mm cannon The fourth airframe which was to be the Ta-3bis with M-82 engines was abandoned due to the German invasion, and further work on the Ta-3 was halted when Tairov was killed in an airline crash, traveling between Moscow and Kuybyshev, in December 1941. Variants * OKO-6 – initial prototype with 950/1000 hp M-88 engines, short fuselage and single fin and rudder. Armament:-2 x 12.7mm BS machine-guns and 4 x 20mm ShVAK-20 cannon in the forward fuselage. * OKO-6bis – second prototype with lengthened fuselage, twin fins and M-88R engines.

It is the replacement for the older spanning tree protocols: IEEE 802.1D, IEEE 802.1w, IEEE 802.1s. These blocked any redundant paths that could result in a layer 2 loop, whereas SPB allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths, provides much larger layer 2 topologies, supports faster convergence times, and improves the efficiency by allowing traffic to load share across all paths of a mesh network. It is designed to virtually eliminate human error during configuration and preserves the plug-and-play nature that established Ethernet as the de facto protocol at layer 2\\\\. The technology provides logical Ethernet networks on native Ethernet infrastructures using a link state protocol to advertise both topology and logical network membership. Packets are encapsulated at the edge either in media access control-in-media access control (MAC-in-MAC) 802.1ah or tagged 802.1Q/802.1ad frames and transported only to other members of the logical network. Unicast, multicast, and broadcast are supported and all routing is on symmetric shortest paths. The control plane is based on the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS- IS) routing protocol, leveraging a small number of extensions defined in RFC 6329. History On 4 March 2006 the working group posted 802.1aq draft 0.1. In December 2011, Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) was evaluated by the JITC and approved for deployment within the US Department of Defense (DoD) because of the ease in integrated OA&M; and interoperability with current protocols. In March 2012 the IEEE approved the 802.1aq standard. In 2012, it was stated by David Allan and Nigel Bragg, in 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Design and Evolution: The Architect's Perspective that shortest path bridging is one of the most significant enhancements in Ethernet's history. In May 2013, the first public multi-vendor interoperability was demonstrated as SPB served as the backbone for Interop 2013 in Las Vegas.Interop: Networking Leaders Demo Shortest Path Bridging The 2014 Winter Olympics were the first \\"fabric- enabled\\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) \\"IEEE 802.1aq\\" technology. During the games this fabric network was capable of handling up to 54,000 Gbit/s (54 Tbit/s) of traffic. In 2013 and 2014 SPB was used to build the InteropNet backbone with only 1/10 the resources of prior years. During Interop 2014 SPB was used as the backbone protocol which can enable Software- defined networking (SDN) functionalities. Associated protocols * IEEE 802.1Q-2014 - Bridges and Bridged Networks - This standard incorporates Shortest Path Bridging (IEEE 802.1aq) with the following: IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011, IEEE Std 802.1Qbe-2011, IEEE Std 802.1Qbc-2011, IEEE Std 802.1Qbb-2011, IEEE Std 802.1Qaz-2011, IEEE Std 802.1Qbf-2011, IEEE Std 802.1Qbg-2012, IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011/Cor 2–2012, and IEEE Std 802.1Qbp-2014, and much functionality previously specified in 802.1D.802.1Q-2014 - Bridges and Bridged Networks * IEEE 802.1ag - Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) * IEEE 802.1Qbp - Equal Cost Multiple Paths in Shortest Path Bridging802.1Qbp - Equal Cost Multiple Paths * IEEE P802.1Qcj - Automatic Attachment to Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) servicesP802.1Qcj – Automatic Attachment to Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) services * RFC 6329 - IS-IS Extensions Supporting IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Benefits Shortest Path Bridging - VID (SPBV) and Shortest Path Bridging - MAC (SPBM) are two operating modes of 802.1aq, and are described in more detail below. Both inherit key benefits of link state routing: * the ability to use all available physical connectivity, because loop avoidance uses a Control Plane with a global view of network topology * fast restoration of connectivity after failure, again because of Link State routing's global view of network topology * under failure, the property that only directly affected traffic is impacted during restoration; all unaffected traffic just continues * rapid restoration of broadcast and multicast connectivity, because IS-IS floods all of the required information in the SPB extensions to IS-IS, thereby allowing unicast and multicast connectivity to be installed in parallel, with no need for a second phase signaling process to run over the converged unicast topology to compute and install multicast trees Virtualisation is becoming an increasingly important aspect of a number of key applications, in both carrier and enterprise space, and SPBM, with its MAC-in-MAC datapath providing complete separation between client and server layers, is uniquely suitable for these. \\"Data Centre virtualisation\\" articulates the desire to flexibly and efficiently harness available compute resources in a way that may rapidly be modified to respond to varying application demands, without the need to dedicate physical resources to a specific application. One aspect of this is server virtualisation. The other is connectivity virtualisation, because a physically distributed set of server resources must be attached to a single IP subnet, and modifiable in an operationally simple and robust way. SPBM delivers this; because of its client-server model, it offers a perfect emulation of a transparent Ethernet LAN segment, which is the IP subnet seen at layer 3\\\\. A key component of how it does this is implementing VLANs with scoped multicast trees, which means no egress discard of broadcast/unknown traffic, a feature common to approaches that use a small number of shared trees, hence the network does not simply degrade with size as the percentage of frames discarded goes up. It also supports \\"single touch\\" provisioning, so that configuration is simple and robust; the port of a virtual server must simply be bound locally to the SPBM I-SID identifying the LAN segment, after which IS-IS for SPB floods this binding, and all nodes that need to install forwarding state to implement the LAN segment do so automatically. The carrier-space equivalent of this application is the delivery of Ethernet VPN services to Enterprises over common carrier infrastructure. The required attributes are fundamentally the same; complete transparency for customer Ethernet services (both point-to-point and LAN), and complete isolation between one customer's traffic and that of all other customers. The multiple virtual LAN segment model provides this, and the single-touch provisioning model eases carrier operations. Furthermore, the MAC-in-MAC datapath allows the carrier to deploy the \\"best in class\\" Ethernet OAM suit (IEEE 802.1ag, etc.), entirely transparently and independently from any OAM which a customer may choose to run. A further consequence of SPBM's transparency in both dataplane and control plane is that it provides a perfect, \\"no compromise\\" delivery of the complete MEF 6.1 service set. This includes not only E-LINE and E-LAN constructs, by also E-TREE (hub-and-spoke) connectivity. This latter is clearly very relevant to enterprise customers of carrier VPN/MPLS services which have this network structure internally. It also provides the carrier with the toolkit to support geo-redundant broadband backhaul; in this applications, many DSLAMs or other access equipments must be backhauled to multiple Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) sites, with application- determined binding of sessions to a BRAS. However, DSLAMs must not be allowed to communicate with each other, because carriers then lose the ability to control peer-to-peer connectivity. MEF E-TREE does just this, and further provides an efficient multicast fabric for the distribution of IP TV. SPBM offers both the ideal multicast replication model, where packets are replicated only at fork points in the shortest path tree that connects members, and also the less state intensive head end replication model where in essence serial unicast packets are sent to all other members along the same shortest path first tree. These two models are selected by specifying properties of the service at the edge which affect the transit node decisions on multicast state installation. This allows for a trade-off to be made between optimum transit replication points (with their larger state costs) v.s. reduced core state (but much more traffic) of the head end replication model. These selections can be different for different members of the same Individual Service ID (I-SID) allowing different trade-offs to be made for different members. Figure 5 below is a quick way to understand what SPBM is doing on the scale of the entire network. Figure 5 shows how a 7-member E-LAN is created from the edge membership information and the deterministic distributed calculation of per source, per service trees with transit replication. Head end replication is not shown as it is trivial and simply uses the existing unicast FIBs to forward copies serially to the known other receivers. Operations and management 802.1aq builds on all existing Ethernet operations, administration and management (OA&M;). Since 802.1aq ensures that its unicast and multicast packets for a given virtual LAN (VLAN) follow the same forward and reverse path and use completely standard 802 encapsulations, all of the methods of 802.1ag and Y.1731 operate unchanged on an 802.1aq network. See IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-recommendation Y.1731.  High level  802.1aq is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) sanctioned link state Ethernet control plane for all IEEE VLANs covered in IEEE 802.1Q. Shortest Path Bridging virtual local area network identifier (VLAN ID) or Shortest Path Bridging VID (SPBV) provides capability that is backwards compatible with spanning tree technologies. Shortest Path Bridging Media Access Control (MAC) or (SPBM), (previously known as Provider Backbone Bridge PBB) provides additional values which capitalize on Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) capabilities. SPB (the generic term for both) combines an Ethernet data path (either IEEE 802.1Q in the case of SPBV, or Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) IEEE 802.1ah in the case of SPBM) with an IS-IS link state control protocol running between Shortest Path bridges (network-to- network interface (NNI) links). The link state protocol is used to discover and advertise the network topology and compute shortest path trees (SPT) from all bridges in the SPT Region. In SPBM, the Backbone MAC (B-MAC) addresses of the participating nodes and also the service membership information for interfaces to non-participating devices (user network interface (UNI) ports) is distributed. Topology data is then input to a calculation engine which computes symmetric shortest path trees based on minimum cost from each participating node to all other participating nodes. In SPBV these trees provide a shortest path tree where individual MAC address can be learned and Group Address membership can be distributed. In SPBM the shortest path trees are then used to populate forwarding tables for each participating node's individual B-MAC addresses and for Group addresses; Group multicast trees are sub trees of the default shortest path tree formed by (Source, Group) pairing. Depending on the topology several different equal cost multi path trees are possible and SPB supports multiple algorithms per IS-IS instance. In SPB as with other link state based protocols, the computations are done in a distributed fashion. Each node computes the Ethernet compliant forwarding behavior independently based on a normally synchronized common view of the network (at scales of about 1000 nodes or less) and the service attachment points (user network interface (UNI) ports). Ethernet filtering Database (or forwarding) tables are populated locally to independently and deterministically implement its portion of the network forwarding behavior. The two different flavors of data path give rise to two slightly different versions of this protocol. One (SPBM) is intended where complete isolation of many separate instances of client LANs and their associated device MAC addresses is desired, and it therefore uses a full encapsulation (MAC-in-MAC a.k.a. IEEE 802.1ah). The other (SPBV) is intended where such isolation of client device MAC addresses is not necessary, and it reuses only the existing VLAN tag a.k.a. IEEE 802.1Q on participating network-to-network interface (NNI) links. Chronologically SPBV came first, with the project originally being conceived to address scalability and convergence of MSTP. At the time the specification of Provider Backbone bridging was progressing and it became apparent that leveraging both the PBB data plane and a link state control plane would significantly extend Ethernet's capabilities and applications. Provider Link State Bridging (PLSB) was a strawman proposal brought to the IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging Working Group, in order to provide a concrete example of such a system. As IEEE 802.1aq standardization has progressed, some of the detailed mechanisms proposed by PLSB have been replaced by functional equivalents, but all of the key concepts embodied in PLSB are being carried forward into the standard. The two flavors (SPBV and SPBM) will be described separately although the differences are almost entirely in the data plane. =Shortest Path Bridging-VID= Shortest Path bridging enables shortest path trees for VLAN Bridges all IEEE 802.1 data planes and SPB is the term used in general. Recently there has been a lot of focus on SPBM as explained due to its ability to control the new PBB data plane and leverage certain capabilities such as removing the need to do B-MAC learning and automatically creating individual (unicast) and group (multicast) Trees. SPBV was actually the original project that endeavored to enable Ethernet VLANs to better utilize mesh networks. A primary feature of Shortest Path bridging is the ability to use Link State IS-IS to learn network topology. In SPBV the mechanism used to identify the tree is to use a different Shortest Path VLAN ID (VID) for each source bridge. The IS-IS topology is leveraged both to allocate unique SPVIDs and to enable shortest path forwarding for individual and group addresses. Originally targeted for small low configuration networks SPB grew into a larger project encompassing the latest provider control plane for SPBV and harmonizing the concepts of Ethernet data plane. Proponents of SPB believe that Ethernet can leverage link state and maintain the attributes that have made Ethernet one of the most encompassing data plane transport technologies. When we refer to Ethernet it is the layer 2 frame format defined by IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.1. Ethernet VLAN bridging IEEE 802.1Q is the frame forwarding paradigm that fully supports higher level protocols such as IP. SPB defines a shortest path Region which is the boundary of the shortest path topology and the rest of the VLAN topology (which may be any number of legacy bridges.) SPB operates by learning the SPB capable bridges and growing the Region to include the SPB capable bridges that have the same Base VID and MSTID configuration digest (Allocation of VIDs for SPB purposes). SPBV builds shortest path trees that support Loop Prevention and optionally support loop mitigation on the SPVID. SPBV still allows learning of Ethernet MAC addresses but it can distribute multicast address that can be used to prune the shortest path trees according to the multicast membership either through Multiple MAC Registration Protocol (MMRP) or directly using IS-IS distribution of multicast membership. SPBV builds shortest path trees but also interworks with legacy bridges running Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol and Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol. SPBV uses techniques from MSTP Regions to interwork with non-SPT regions behaving logically as a large distributed bridge as viewed from outside the region. SPBV supports shortest path trees but SPBV also builds a spanning tree which is computed from the link state database and uses the Base VID. This means that SPBV can use this traditional spanning tree for computation of the Common and Internal Spanning Tree (CIST). The CIST is the default tree used to interwork with other legacy bridges. It also serves as a fall back spanning tree if there are configuration problems with SPBV. SPBV has been designed to manage a moderate number of bridges. SPBV differs from SPBM in that MAC addresses are learned on all bridges that lie on the shortest path and a shared VLAN learning is used since destination MACs may be associated with multiple SPVIDs. SPBV learns all MACs it forwards even outside the SPBV region. =Shortest Path Bridging-MAC= SPBM reuses the PBB data plane which does not require that the Backbone Core Bridges (BCB) learn encapsulated client addresses. At the edge of the network the C-MAC (client) addresses are learned. SPBM is very similar to PLSB (Provider Link State Bridging) using the same data and control planes but the format and contents of the control messages in PLSB are not compatible. Individual MAC frames (unicast traffic) from an Ethernet attached device that are received at the SPBM edge are encapsulated in a PBB (mac-in-mac) IEEE 802.1ah header and then traverse the IEEE 802.1aq network unchanged until they are stripped of the encapsulation as they egress back to the non participating attached network at the far side of the participating network. Ethernet destination addresses (from UNI port attached devices) perform learning over the logical LAN and are forwarded to the appropriate participating B-MAC address to reach the far end Ethernet destination. In this manner Ethernet MAC addresses are never looked up in the core of an IEEE 802.1aq network. When comparing SPBM to PBB, the behavior is almost identical to a PBB IEEE 802.1ah network. PBB does not specify how B-MAC addresses are learned and PBB may use a spanning tree to control the B-VLAN. In SPBM the main difference is that B-MAC address are distributed or computed in the control plane, eliminating the B-MAC learning in PBB. Also SPBM ensures that the route followed is shortest path tree. The forward and reverse paths used for unicast and multicast traffic in an IEEE 802.1aq network are symmetric. This symmetry permits the normal Ethernet Continuity Fault Messages (CFM) IEEE 802.1ag to operate unchanged for SPBV and SPBM and has desirable properties with respect to time distribution protocols such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP Version 2). Also existing Ethernet loop prevention is augmented by loop mitigation to provide fast data plane convergence. Group address and unknown destination individual frames are optimally transmitted to only members of the same Ethernet service. IEEE 802.1aq supports the creation of thousands of logical Ethernet services in the form of E-LINE, E-LAN or E-TREE constructs which are formed between non participating logical ports of the IEEE 802.1aq network. These group address packets are encapsulated with a PBB header which indicates the source participating address in the SA while the DA indicates the locally significant group address this frame should be forwarded on and which source bridge originated the frame. The IEEE 802.1aq multicast forwarding tables are created based on computations such that every bridge which is on the shortest path between a pair of bridges which are members of the same service group will create proper forwarding database (FDB) state to forward or replicate frames it receives to that members of that service group. Since the group address computation produce shortest path trees, there is only ever one copy of a multicast packet on any given link. Since only bridges on a shortest path between participating logical ports create forwarding database (FDB) state the multicast makes the efficient use of network resources. The actual group address forwarding operation operates more or less identically to classical Ethernet, the backbone destination address (B-DA)+ backbone VLAN identifier (B-VID) combination are looked up to find the egress set of next hops. The only difference compared with classical Ethernet is that reverse learning is disabled for participating bridge backbone media access control (B-MAC) addresses and is replaced with an ingress check and discard (when the frame arrives on an incoming interface from an unexpected source). Learning is however implemented at the edges of the SPBM multicast tree to learn the B-MAC to MAC address relationship for correct individual frame encapsulation in the reverse direction (as packets arrive over the Interface). Properly implemented an IEEE 802.1aq network can support up to 1000 participating bridges and provide tens of thousands of layer 2 E-LAN services to Ethernet devices. This can be done by simply configuring the ports facing the Ethernet devices to indicate they are members of a given service. As new members come and go, the IS-IS protocol will advertise the I-SID membership changes and the computations will grow or shrink the trees in the participating node network as necessary to maintain the efficient multicast property for that service. IEEE 802.1aq has the property that only the point of attachment of a service needs configuration when a new attachment point comes or goes. The trees produced by the computations will automatically be extended or pruned as necessary to maintain connectivity. In some existing implementations this property is used to automatically (as opposed to through configuration) add or remove attachment points for dual-homed technologies such as rings to maintain optimum packet flow between a nonparticipating ring protocol and the IEEE 802.1aq network by activating a secondary attachment point and deactivating a primary attachment point. =Failure recovery= Failure recovery is as per normal IS-IS with the link failure being advertised and new computations being performed, resulting in new FDB tables. Since no Ethernet addresses are advertised or known by this protocol, there is no re-learning required by the SPBM core and its learned encapsulations are unaffected by a transit node or link failure. Fast link failure detection may be performed using IEEE 802.1ag Continuity Check Messages (CCMs) which test link status and report a failure to the IS-IS protocol. This allows much faster failure detection than is possible using the IS-IS hello message loss mechanisms. Both SPBV and SPBM inherit the rapid convergence of a link state control plane. A special attribute of SPBM is its ability to rebuild multicast trees in a similar time to unicast convergence, because it substitutes computation for signaling. When an SPBM bridge has performed the computations on a topology database, it knows whether it is on the shortest path between a root and one or more leaves of the SPT and can install state accordingly. Convergence is not gated by incremental discovery of a bridge's place on a multicast tree by the use of separate signaling transactions. However, SPBM on a node does not operate completely independently of its peers, and enforces agreement on the current network topology with its peers. This very efficient mechanism uses exchange of a single digest of link state covering the entire network view, and does not need agreement on each path to each root individually. The result is that the volume of messaging exchanged to converge the network is in proportion to the incremental change in topology and not the number of multicast trees in the network. A simple link event that may change many trees is communicated by signaling the link event only; the consequent tree construction is performed by local computation at each node. The addition of a single service access point to a service instance involves only the announcement of the I-SID, regardless of the number of trees. Similarly the removal of a bridge, which might involve the rebuilding of hundreds to thousands of trees, is signaled only with a few link state updates. Commercial offerings will likely offer SPB over multi-chassis lag. In this environment multiple switch chassis appear as a single switch to the SPB control plane, and multiple links between pairs of chassis appear as an aggregate link. In this context a single link or node failure is not seen by the control plane and is handled locally resulting in sub 50ms recovery times. =Animations= Following are three animated GIFs which help to show the behavior of 802.1aq. The first of these gifs, shown in Figure 5, demonstrates the routing in a 66 node network where we have created a 7-member E-LAN using ISID 100. In this example we show the ECT tree created from each member to reach all of the other members. We cycle through each member to show the full set of trees created for this service. We pause at one point to show the symmetry of routing between two of the nodes and emphasize it with a red line. In each case the source of the tree is highlighted with a small purple V. The second of these animated gifs, shown in Figure 6, demonstrates 8 ECT paths in the same 66 node network as Figure 4. In each subsequent animated frame the same source is used (in purple) but a different destination is shown (in yellow). For each frame, all of the shortest paths are shown superimposed between the source and destination. When two shortest paths traverse the same hop, the thickness of the lines being drawn is increased. In addition to the 66 node network, a small multi level Data Center style network is also shown with sources and destinations both within the servers (at the bottom) and from servers to the router layer at the top. This animation helps to show the diversity of the ECT being produced. The last of these animated gifs, shown in Figure 7, demonstrates source destination ECT paths using all 16 of the standard algorithms currently defined.

ECMT in an IEEE 802.1aq network is more predictable than with internet protocol (IP) or multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) because of symmetry between the forward and reverse paths. The choice as to which ECMT path will be used is therefore an operator assigned head end decision while it is a local / hashing decision with IP/MPLS. IEEE 802.1aq, when faced with a choice between two equal link cost paths, uses the following logic for its first ECMT tie breaking algorithm: first, if one path is shorter than the other in terms of hops, the shorter path is chosen, otherwise, the path with the minimum Bridge Identifier { BridgePriority concatenated with (IS-IS SysID) } is chosen. Other ECMT algorithms are created by simply using known permutations of the BridgePrioritySysIds. For example, the second defined ECMT algorithm uses the path with the minimum of the inverse of the BridgeIdentifier and can be thought of as taking the path with the maximum node identifier. For SPBM, each permutation is instantiated as a distinct B-VID. The upper limit of multipath permutations is gated by the number of B-VIDs delegated to 802.1aq operation, a maximum of 4094, although the number of useful path permutations would only require a fraction of the available B-VID space. Fourteen additional ECMT algorithms are defined with different bit masks applied to the BridgeIdentifiers. Since the BridgeIdentfier includes a priority field, it is possible to adjust the ECMT behavior by changing the BridgePriority up or down. A service is assigned to a given ECMT B-VID at the edge of the network by configuration. As a result, non participating packets associated with that service are encapsulated with the VID associated with the desired ECMT end to end path. All individual and group address traffic associated with this service will therefore use the proper ECMT B-VID and be carried symmetrically end to end on the proper equal cost multi path. Essentially the operator decides which services go in which ECMT paths, unlike a hashing solution used in other systems such as IP/MPLS. Trees can support link aggregation (LAG) groups within a tree \\"branch\\" segment where some form of hashing occurs. This symmetric and end to end ECMT behavior gives IEEE 802.1aq a highly predictable behavior and off line engineering tools can accurately model exact data flows. The behavior is also advantageous to networks where one way delay measurements are important. This is because the one way delay can be accurately computed as 1/2 the round trip delay. Such computations are used by time distribution protocols such as IEEE 1588 for frequency and time of day synchronization as required between precision clock sources and wireless base stations. Shown above are three figures [5,6,7] which show 8 and 16 equal cost tree (ECT) behavior in different network topologies. These are composites of screen captures of an 802.1aq network emulator and show the source in purple, the destination in yellow, and then all the computed and available shortest paths in pink. The thicker the line, the more shortest paths use that link. The animations shows three different networks and a variety of source and destination pairs which continually change to help visualize what is happening. The equal cost tree (ECT) algorithms can be almost extended through the use of OPAQUE data which allows extensions beyond the base 16 algorithms more or less infinitely. It is expected that other standards groups or vendors will produce variations on the currently defined algorithms with behaviors suited for different networks styles. It is expected that numerous shared tree models will also be defined, as will hop by hop hash based equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) style behaviors .. all defined by a VID and an algorithm that every node agrees to run. =Traffic placement/engineering= 802.1aq does not spread traffic on a hop by hop basis. Instead, 802.1aq allows assignment of a Service ID (ISID) to a Vlan ID (VID) at the edge of the network. A VID will correspond to exactly one of the possible sets of shortest path nodes in the network and will never stray from that routing. If there are 10 or so shortest paths between different nodes, it is possible to assign different services to different paths and to know that the traffic for a given service will follow exactly the given path. In this manner traffic can easily be assigned to the desired shortest path. In the event that one of the paths becomes overloaded it is possible to move some services off that shortest path by reassigning those service's ISID to a different, less loaded, VID at the edges of the network. The deterministic nature of the routing makes offline prediction/computation/experimentation of the network loading much simpler since actual routes are not dependent on the contents of the packet headers with the exception of the VLAN identifier. Figure 4 - Equal Cost Shortest Path: assignment to services Figure 4 shows four different equal cost paths between nodes 7 and 5. An operator can achieve relatively good balance of traffic across the cut between nodes [0 and 2] and [1 and 3] by assigning the services at nodes 7 and 5 to one of the four desired VIDs. Using more than 4 equal cost tree (ECT) paths in the network will likely allow all 4 of these paths to be used. Balance can also be achieved between nodes 6 and 4 in a similar manner. In the event that an operator does not wish to manually assign services to shortest paths it is a simple matter for a switch vendor to allow a simple hash of the ISID to one of the available VIDS to give a degree of non-engineered spreading. For example, the ISID modulo the number of ECT-VIDs could be used to decide on the actual relative VID to use. In the event that the ECT paths are not sufficiently diverse the operator has the option of adjusting the inputs to the distributed ECT algorithms to apply attraction or repulsion from a given node by adjusting that node's Bridge Priority. This can be experimented with via offline tools until the desired routes are achieved at which point the bias can be applied to the real network and then ISIDs can be moved to the resulting routes. Looking at the animations in Figure 6 shows the diversity available for traffic engineering in a 66 node network. In this animation there are 8 ECT paths available from each highlighted source to destination and therefore services could be assigned to 8 different pools based on the VID. One such initial assignment in Figure 6 could therefore be (ISID modulo 8) with subsequent fine tuning as required. =Example= Figure 1 - example nodes, links and interface indexes We will work through SPBM behavior on a small example, with emphasis on the shortest path trees for unicast and multicast. The network shown in Figure 1 consists of 8 participating nodes numbered 0 through 7. These would be switches or routers running the IEEE 802.1aq protocol. Each of the 8 participating nodes has a number of adjacencies numbered 1..5. These would likely correspond to interface indexes, or possibly port numbers. Since 802.1aq does not support parallel interfaces each interface corresponds to an adjacency. The port / interface index numbers are of course local and are shown because the output of the computations produce an interface index (in the case of unicast) or a set of interface indexes (in the case of multicast) which are part of the forwarding information base (FIB) together with a destination MAC address and backbone VID. The network has a fully meshed inner core of four nodes (0..3) and then four outer nodes (4,5,6 and 7), each dual-homed onto a pair of inner core nodes. Normally when nodes come from the factory they have a MAC address assigned which becomes a node identifier but for the purpose of this example we will assume that the nodes have MAC addresses of the form 00:00:00:00:N:00 where N is the node id (0..7) from Figure 1. Therefore, node 2 has a MAC address of 00:00:00:00:02:00. Node 2 is connected to node 7 (00:00:00:00:07:00) via node 2's interface/5. The IS-IS protocol runs on all the links shown since they are between participating nodes. The IS-IS hello protocol has a few additions for 802.1aq including information about backbone VIDs to be used by the protocol. We will assume that the operator has chosen to use backbone VIDs 101 and 102 for this instance of 802.1aq on this network. The node will use their MAC addresses as the IS-IS SysId and join a single IS- IS level and exchange link state packets (LSPs in IS-IS terminology). The LSPs will contain node information and link information such that every node will learn the full topology of the network. Since we have not specified any link weights in this example, the IS-IS protocol will pick a default link metric for all links, therefore all routing will be minimum hop count. After topology discovery the next step is distributed calculation of the unicast routes for both ECMP VIDs and population of the unicast forwarding tables (FIBs). Figure 2 - two ECMP paths between nodes 7 and 5 Consider the route from Node 7 to Node 5: there are a number of equal cost paths. 802.1aq specifies how to choose two of them: the first is referred to as the Low PATH ID path. This is the path which has the minimum node id on it. In this case the Low PATH ID path is the 7->0->1->5 path (as shown in red in Figure 2). Therefore, each node on that path will create a forwarding entry toward the MAC address of node five using the first ECMP VID 101. Conversely, 802.1aq specifies a second ECMP tie breaking algorithm called High PATH ID. This is the path with the maximum node identifier on it and in the example is the 7->2->3->5 path (shown in blue in Figure 2). Node 7 will therefore have a FIB that among other things indicates: * MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/1. * MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/2. Node 5 will have exactly the inverse in its FIB: * MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/1. * MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/2. The intermediate nodes will also produce consistent results so for example node 1 will have the following entries. * MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/5. * MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/4. * MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/2. * MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/2. And Node 2 will have entries as follows: * MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/2. * MAC 00:00:00:05:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/3. * MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 101 the next hop is interface/5. * MAC 00:00:00:07:00 / vid 102 the next hop is interface/5. If we had an attached non participating device at Node 7 talking to a non participating device at Node 5 (for example Device A talks to Device C in Figure 3), they would communicate over one of these shortest paths with a MAC-in-MAC encapsulated frame. The MAC header on any of the NNI links would show an outer source address of 00:00:00:70:00, an outer destination address of 00:00:00:50:00 and a BVID of either 101 or 102 depending on which has been chosen for this set of non participating ports/vids. The header once inserted at node 7 when received from node A, would not change on any of the links until it egressed back to non participating Device C at Node 5. All participating devices would do a simple DA+VID lookup to determine the outgoing interface, and would also check that incoming interface is the proper next hop for the packet's SA+VID. The addresses of the participating nodes 00:00:00:00:00:00 ... 00:00:00:07:00 are never learned but are advertised by IS-IS as the node's SysId. Unicast forwarding to a non-participating client (e.g. A, B, C, D from Figure 3) address is of course only possible when the first hop participating node (e.g. 7) is able to know which last hop participating node (e.g. 5) is attached to the desired non participating node (e.g. C). Since this information is not advertised by IEEE 802.1aq it has to be learned. The mechanism for learning is identical to IEEE 802.1ah, in short, the corresponding outer MAC unicast DA, if not known is replaced by a multicast DA and when a response is received, the SA of that response now tells us the DA to use to reach the non participating node that sourced the response. e.g. node 7 learns that C is reached by node 5. Figure 3 - per source, per service multicast for E-LAN Since we wish to group/scope sets of non participating ports into services and prevent them from multicasting to each other, IEEE 802.1aq provides mechanism for per source, per service multicast forwarding and defines a special multicast destination address format to provide this. Since the multicast address must uniquely identify the tree, and because there is a tree per source per unique service, the multicast address contains two components, a service component in the low order 24 bits and a network wide unique identifier in the upper 22 bits. Since this is a multicast address the multicast bit is set, and since we are not using the standard OUI space for these manufactured addresses, the Local 'L' bit is set to disambiguate these addresses. In Figure 3 above, this is represented with the DA=[7,O] where the 7 represents packets originating from node 7 and the colored O represents the E-LAN service we are scoped within. Prior to creating multicast forwarding for a service, nodes with ports that face that service must be told they are members. For example, nodes 7,4,5 and 6 are told they are members of the given service, for example service 200, and further that they should be using BVID 101. This is advertised by ISIS and all nodes then do the SPBM computation to determine if they are participating either as a head end or tail end, or a tandem point between other head and tail ends in the service. Since node 0 is a tandem between nodes 7 and 5 it creates a forwarding entry for packets from node 7 on this service, to node 5. Likewise, since it is a tandem between nodes 7 and 4 it creates forwarding state from node 7 for packets in this service to node 4 this results in a true multicast entry where the DA/VID have outputs on two interfaces 1 and 2. Node 2 on the other hand is only on one shortest path in this service and only creates a single forwarding entry from node 7 to node 6 for packets in this service. Figure 3 only shows a single E-LAN service and only the tree from one of the members, however very large numbers of E-LAN services with membership from 2 to every node in the network can be supported by advertising the membership, computing the tandem behaviors, manufacturing the known multicast addresses and populating the FIBs. The only real limiting factors are the FIB table sizes and computational power of the individual devices both of which are growing yearly in leaps and bounds. Implementation notes 802.1aq takes IS- IS topology information augmented with service attachment (I-SID) information, does a series of computations and produces a forwarding table (filtering table) for unicast and multicast entries. The IS-IS extensions that carry the information required by 802.1aq are given in the isis-layer2 IETF document listed below. An implementation of 802.1aq will first modify the IS-IS hellos to include an NLPID (network layer protocol identifier) of 0xC01 in their Protocols-Supported Type-length-value (TLV) (type 129) which has been reserved for 802.1aq. The hellos also must include an MSTID (which gives the purpose of each VID) and finally each ECMT behavior must be assigned to a VID and exchanged in the hellos. The hellos would normally run untagged. Note that NLPID of IP is not required to form an adjacency for 802.1aq but also will not prevent an adjacency when present. The links are assigned 802.1aq specific metrics which travel in their own TLV (Type Length Value) which is more or less identical to the IP link metrics. The calculations will always use the maximum of the two unidirectional link metrics to enforce symmetric route weights. The node is assigned a mac address to identify it globally and this is used to form the IS-IS SYSID. A box mac would normally serve this purpose. The Area-Id is not directly used by 802.1aq but should, of course, be the same for nodes in the same 802.1aq network. Multiple areas/levels are not yet supported. The node is further assigned an SPSourceID which is a 20 bit network wide unique identifier. This can often be the low 20 bits of the SYSID (if unique) or can be dynamically negotiated or manually configured. The SPSourceID and the ECMT assignments to B-VIDs are then advertised into the IS- IS network in their own 802.1aq TLV. The 802.1aq computations are restricted to links between nodes that have an 802.1aq link weight and which support the NLPID 0xC01. As previously discussed the link weights are forced to be symmetric for the purpose of computation by taking the min of two dissimilar values. When a service is configured in the form of an I-SID assignment to an ECMT behavior that I-SID is then advertised along with the desired ECMT behavior and an indication of its transmit, receive properties (a new Type- length-value is used for this purpose of course). When an 802.1aq node receives an IS-IS update it will compute the unique shortest path to all other IS-IS nodes that support 802.1aq. There will be one unique (symmetric) shortest path per ECMT behavior. The tie breaking used to enforce this uniqueness and ECMT is described below. The unicast FDB/FIB will be populated based on this first shortest path computation. There will be one entry per ECMT behavior/B-VID produced. The transit multicast computation (which only applies when transit replication is desired and not applicable to services that have chosen head end replication) can be implemented in many ways, care must be taken to keep this efficient, but in general a series of shortest path computations must be done. The basic requirement is to decide 'am I on the shortest path between two nodes one of which transmits an I-SID and the other receives that I-SID.' Rather poor performing pseudo-code for this computation looks something like this: for each NODE in network which originates at least one transmit ISID do { SPF = compute the shortest path trees from NODE for all ECMT B-VIDs. for each ECMT behavior { for each NEIGHBOR of NODE { if NEIGHBOR is on the SPF towards NODE for this ECMT { T = NODE's transmit ISIDs unioned with all receive ISIDs below us on SPF for each ISID in T { create/modify multicast entry where [ MAC-DA = NODE.SpsourceID:20ISID:24LocalBit:1MulticastBit:1 B-VID = VID associated with this ECMT out port = interface to NEIGHBOR in port = port towards NODE on the SPF for this ECMT ] } } } } } The above pseudo code computes many more SPF's than strictly necessary in most cases and better algorithms are known to decide if a node is on a shortest path between two other nodes. A reference to a paper presented at the IEEE which gives a much faster algorithm that drastically reduces the number of outer iterations required is given below. In general though even the exhaustive algorithm above is more than able to handle several hundred node networks in a few 10's of milliseconds on the 1 GHz or greater common CPUs when carefully crafted. For ISIDs that have chosen head end replication the computation is trivial and involves simply finding the other attachment points that receive that ISID and creating a serial unicast table to replicate to them one by one. =Tie-breaking= 802.1aq must produce deterministic symmetric downstream congruent shortest paths. This means that not only must a given node compute the same path forward and reverse but all the other nodes downstream (and upstream) on that path must also produce the same result. This downstream congruence is a consequence of the hop by hop forwarding nature of Ethernet since only the destination address and VID are used to decide the next hop. It is important to keep this in mind when trying to design other ECMT algorithms for 802.1aq as this is an easy trap to fall into. It begins by taking the unidirectional link metrics that are advertised by ISIS for 802.1aq and ensuring that they are symmetric. This is done by simply taking the MIN of the two values at both ends prior to doing any computations. This alone does not guarantee symmetry however. Figure 7 - Tie Breaking and path identifiers The 802.1aq standard describes a mechanism called a PATHID which is a network-wide unique identifier for a path. This is a useful logical way to understand how to deterministically break ties but is not how one would implement such a tie-breaker in practice. The PATHID is defined as just the sequence of SYSIDs that make up the path (not including the end points).. sorted. Every path in the network therefore has a unique PATHID independent of where in the network the path is discovered. 802.1aq simply always picks the lowest PATHID path when a choice presents itself in the shortest path computations. This ensures that every node will make the same decision. For example, in Figure 7 above, there are four equal-cost paths between node 7 and node 5 as shown by the colors blue, green, pink and brown. The PATHID for these paths are as follows: * \`PATHID['] = {0,1}\` * \`PATHID['] = {0,3}\` * \`PATHID['] = {1,2}\` * \`PATHID['] = {2,3}\` The lowest PATHID is therefore the brown path {0,1}. This low PATHID algorithm has very desirable properties. The first is that it can be done progressively by simply looking for the lowest SYSID along a path and secondly because an efficient implementation that operates stepwise is possible by simply back-tracking two competing paths and looking for the minimum of the two paths minimum SYSIDs. The low PATHID algorithm is the basis of all 802.1aq tie breaking. ECMT is also based on the low PATHID algorithm by simply feeding it different SYSID permutations – one per ECMT algorithm. The most obvious permutation to pass is a complete inversion of the SYSID by XOR-ing it with 0xfff... prior to looking for the min of two minimums. This algorithm is referred to as high PATHID because it logically chooses the largest PATHID path when presented with two equal-cost choices. In the example in figure 7, the path with the highest PATHID is therefore the blue path whose PATHID is {2,3}. Simply inverting all the SYSIDs and running the low PATHID algorithm will yield same result. The other 14 defined ECMT algorithms use different permutations of the SYSID by XOR-ing it with different bit masks which are designed to create relatively good distribution of bits. It should be clear that different permutations will result in the purple and green paths being lowest in turn. The 17 individual 64-bit masks used by the ECT algorithm are made up of the same byte value repeated eight times to fill each 64-bit mask. These 17 byte values are as follows: ECT-MASK[17] = { 0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x88, 0x77, 0x44, 0x33, 0xCC, 0xBB, 0x22, 0x11, 0x66, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x99, 0xDD, 0xEE }; ECT-MASK[0] is reserved for a common spanning tree algorithm, while ECT-MASK[1] creates the Low PATHID set of shortest path first trees, ECT-MASK[2] creates the High PATHID set of shortest path trees and the other indexes create other relatively diverse permutations of shortest path first trees. In addition the ECMT tie-breaking algorithms also permit some degree of human override or tweaking. This is accomplished by including a BridgePriority field together with the SYSID such that the combination, called a BridgeIdentfier, becomes the input to the ECT algorithm. By adjusting the BridgePriority up or down a path's PATHID can be raised or lowered relative to others and a substantial degree of tunability is afforded. The above description gives an easy to understand way to view the tie breaking; an actual implementation simply backtracks from the fork point to the join point in two competing equal-cost paths (usually during the Dijkstra shortest path computation) and picks the path traversing the lowest (after masking) BridgePrioritySysId. Interoperability The first public interoperability tests of IEEE 802.1aq were held in Ottawa in October 2010. Two vendors provided SPBM implementations and a total of 5 physical switches and 32 emulated switches were tested for control/data and OA&M.; Further events were held in Ottawa in January 2011 with 5 vendors and 6 implementations, at 2013's Interop event at Las Vegas where an SPBM network was used as a backbone.

History The Genzan Air Group was founded on 15 November 1940 at Genzan, Korea, then a part of the Empire of Japan. It was initially a mixed- unit equipped with 33 Type 96 Mitsubishi G3M1 bombers and 25 Type 96 Mitsubishi A5M4 fighters under the command of the Second Air Fleet. On January 15, 1941, it was reassigned to the 22nd Kōkū Sentai and deployed to Hankou in central China. =Operations in China= While based at Hankou, the bombers of the Genzan Air Group was primarily assigned to strategic bombing missions in Sichuan Province, while the fighters were assigned to combat air patrol and ground support missions in support of Imperial Japanese Army operations. The Genzan Air Group was withdrawn from China in September, 1941, returning to its home base at Genzan for training, and at the end of October, 1941 was forward deployed to Takao in Taiwan. Operations in Southeast Asia With the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Genzan Air Group was deployed to Saigon, French Indochina. The group was a key participant in the sinking of the British capital ships and off the coast of Malaya on 10 December 1941, losing one aircraft and its crew during the battle. On January 22, 1942, bombers from the Genzan Air Group attacked Kallang Airport in Singapore, and subsequently provided air support for Japanese offensives in Malaya including the landings at Endau. At the end of February, the unit was transferred to Bangkok and assigned to patrols over the Indian Ocean; however, facilities at Bangkok were not satisfactory and the unit was soon reassigned to Palembang in Sumatra in the Netherlands East Indies, with some aircraft dispersed to Kuching in Sarawak. On May 1, 1942, Genzan's flying unit was redeployed to Rabaul, New Britain to support the Japanese campaign in New Guinea. The group participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, without success, and made numerous bombing attacks against Port Moresby. In July, after the cancellation of Operation Mo, the unit was withdrawn to Japan and was based at Misawa, Aomori for training. Its fighter unit was detached and redesignated as the 252 Kōkūtai in September. The Genzan's flying unit was disbanded by being redesignated as the 755 Kōkūtai on 1 November 1942.

Horse racing Many wealthy aristocrats have been devoted to racing, but few have ever had so little success as Lord Glasgow, whose lifelong love affair with the turf left him with little to show by way of either prize money or prized studs. Part of the problem was Glasgow's boneheaded reluctance to give any of his horses names until they had proved themselves by winning races, a habit that naturally caused great confusion in the stables. On the evening before one event, according to anecdote, \\"he was induced to Christen three, and the following were the names under which they ran: 'Give-Him-a-Name', 'He- Hasn't-Got-a-Name', 'He-Isn't-Worth-a-Name'.\\"New Orleans Bee, 6 January 1912. Glasgow also proved obstinately devoted to several bloodlines \\"of proved uselessness\\", and his notoriously vile temper hindered plans for the long-term development of the few promising animals he did possess. It was not unknown for him to order that horses that had failed to live up to expectations on the daily gallops be shot on the spot. His record, one despairing trainer noted, was six summary executions in a single morning. A keen huntsman, the eccentric Earl proved equally dangerous over timber. When unable to flush out any foxes, he was quite likely to arbitrarily designate one of his own huntsmen as the quarry and relentlessly pursue the unfortunate man across the countryside for miles.Donaldson, William, Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics, p. 284.

Although in the Talmudic part of the Torah and especially in Kabalah G-d is referred to under the name 'Sh'chinah' - which is feminine, this is only to accentuate the fact that all the creation and nature are actually in the receiving end in reference to the creator and as no part of the creation can perceive the Creator outside of nature, it is adequate to refer to the divine presence in feminine form. We refer to G-d using masculine terms simply for convenience's sake, because Hebrew has no neutral gender; G-d is no more male than a table is.\\" Judaism 101. \\"The fact that we always refer to God as 'He' is also not meant to imply that the concept of sex or gender applies to God.\\" Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, The Aryeh Kaplan Reader, Mesorah Publications (1983), p. 144 At times, Jewish aggadic literature and Jewish mysticism do treat God as gendered. The ways in which God is gendered have also changed across time, with some modern Jewish thinkers viewing God as outside of the gender binary.  Biblical perspectives  The first words of the Tanakh are B'reshit bara Elohim — \\"In the beginning God created.\\"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1990), p. 1. The verb bara (he created) suggests a masculine subject. Elohim is also masculine in form. The most common phrases in the Tanakh are vayomer Elohim and vayomer YHWH — \\"and God said\\" (hundreds of occurrences). Genesis 1:26-27 says that the elohim were male and female, and humans were made in their image.Coogan (2010:176) Again, the verb vayomer (he said) is masculine; it is never vatomer, the feminine of the same verb form. The personal name of God, YHWH, is presented in Exodus 3 as if the Y (Hebrew yod) is the masculine subjective prefix to the verb to be. In Psalms 89:26 God is referred to as Father. \\"He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, My God, and the rock of my salvation.\\"ASV 1901, Public Domain In Isaiah 62:5, God is compared to the bridegroom, and his people to the bride. *\\"For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.\\" In Isaiah 63:16, God is directly addressed and called \\"our Father\\". * \\"Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father; our Redeemer from everlasting is thy name.\\" (ASV) To God, according to Judaism, is attributed the fatherly role of protector. He is called the Father of the poor, of the orphan and the widow, their guarantor of justice. He is also called the Father of the king, as the teacher and helper over the judge of Israel.Marianne Meye Thompson The promise of the Father: Jesus and God in the New Testament ch.2 God as Father in the Old Testament and Second Temple Judaism p35 2000 \\"Christian theologians have often accentuated the distinctiveness of the portrait of God as Father in the New Testament on the basis of an alleged discontinuity\\" Some literary approaches to the Tanakh have argued that parallels between Biblical stories and earlier Sumerian, Akkadian and Canaanite creation myths show a matriarchal substratum that has been overlaid by a patriarchal approach.Neumann, The Origins and History of Consciousness pages 177-178 \\"In the Bible, the earth is the feminine complement of God: the two combined to form man, who articulates their relationship, for example, in sacrifice.\\"Francis Landy, The Song of Songs chapter of The Literary Guide to the Bible, page 314.  Rabbinical views  Kabbalistic Judaism often relates to various \\"aspects\\" of God (cf. Sephirot). As Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan puts it, \\"[E]very name and every description that we may give to God can only apply to His relationship to His creation\\" Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Understanding God Although God is not generally regarded as gendered in Judaism, Benjamin Blech writes that God has both masculine and feminine aspects.Yet … Judaism long ago acknowledged the validity of [the] feminine dimenstion of the Deity. The two names of God differ grammatically with regard to sexual connotation… The Tetragrammaton (YHVH)…is…feminine; it refers to God as if “He” were in fact “She.” Yet, as we have frequently noted, the Lord is also called ELoHiYM. That name ends with…masculine plural… If human beings are created in God’s image, and the single most important thing we know about God is that He is One – why did God create two kinds of people, male and female, after His likeness? …God chose to create two different kinds of people on this earth, not in spite of the fact that He is One, but precisely because God in the deepest sense of the word is really two. Of course we do not suggest any kind of dualism implying separate identities. Rather, as the very names of God imply, there are two distinct aspects to the Deity. God is both masculine and feminine. This gender difference is not one of physical attributes but one of emotion and typology. Benjamin Blech, Understanding Judaism, page 273 In addition, God's \\"presence\\" (Shekinah) is a grammatically feminine word, and is often employed as a feminine aspect of God. Many traditional rabbinic commentators, however, such as Maimonides, view any such beliefs as verging on avodah zarah (idolatry). Secondary male sexual characteristics are attributed to God in some piyuttim (religious poems). These include a description of the beard of God in Shir Hakavod (The Hymn of Glory), and similar poetic imagery in the midrash Song of the Seas Rabbah. Traditional meforshim (rabbinic commentators) hold that these descriptions, like all physical descriptions of God, are metaphorical or symbolic.  Philo  Philo refers to God as Father in several passages: \\"...discovering the nature of the one God, who is alone everlasting, and the father of everything else...\\"Yonge, Public Domain Philo - A Treatise Concerning the World (1) \\"...by whose intervention they might obtain a reconciliation with the Father. First of all, the merciful, and gentle, and compassionate nature of him who is invoked, who would always rather have mercy than punishment. In the second place, the holiness of all the founders of the nation, because they, with souls emancipated from the body, exhibiting a genuine and sincere obedience to the Ruler of all things, are not accustomed to offer up ineffectual prayers on behalf of their sons and daughters, since the Father has given to them, as a reward, that they shall be heard in their prayers.\\" Philo - On Rewards And Punishments (166)  God as transcending gender  Many Jewish thinkers have rejected the notion that God can be anthropomorphized. Under this assumption, one cannot qualify God in terms of gender. Although egalitarian practices didn't emerge until much later, genderless concepts of God began to develop as early on as the mid 17th century. In his time, Baruch Spinoza was a highly controversial figure in the Jewish community of Amsterdam due to the perception of his views as heretical. Instead of the classic literal vision of God as depicted by Jewish Religious text, Spinoza envisioned God as a presence that encompassed the entire universe and beyond, a view commonly known as panentheism. In his Theological- Political Treatise Spinoza states, \\"Some imagine God in the likeness of man, consisting of mind and body, and subject to passions. But it is clear from what has already been proved how far they stray from the true knowledge of God. These I dismiss, for all who have given any consideration to the divine nature deny that God is Corporeal\\". Spinoza's seemingly heretical views for his time period opened the door for differing thoughts about the nature of God in relation to gender, even though Spinoza was excommunicated from his community for these views in 1656. Other thinkers who also thought of God as transcending gender include: * Hermann Cohen, who viewed God as the \\"ultimate archetype of morality.\\" * Martin Buber, who viewed God in an \\"I:Thou\\" relationship with human beings. * Mordecai Kaplan, who viewed God as part of a natural process. ** Similarly, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi viewed God in this same way, yet also viewed God as an experience.  Jewish feminism  Feminist views in Judaism often retain the traditional view that God does not have any sex but does have a gender which is male, but experiment with the use of feminine language and symbolism for God.  God/dess in Judaism  Some Jewish thinkers address issues of gendered language and imagery directly. Jill Hammer challenges the features of traditional Jewish conceptions of God by creating a relatable deity, a Goddess, for those who cannot relate to “God.” The Goddess is nondual, panentheist, and earthbound. Hammer describes the Goddess as both a person and in an impersonal form of nature.Jill Hammer, “To Her We Shall Return: Jews Turning to the Goddess, the Goddess Turning to Jews,” in New Jewish Feminism: Probing the Past, Forging the Future, ed. Elyse Goldstein (Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights, 2009), 25, 26. While she privileges the imagelessness that allows for a God beyond gender, she honors all framings and diverse experiences and visualizations of the Goddess. Julia Watts-Belser also discusses God/dess’ gender. Like Hammer, Watts-Belser celebrates diversity of experiences and conceptions of God, stating that “She was none of that and all of it,” demonstrating also panentheist notions.Julia Watts-Belser, “Transing God/dess: Notes from the Borderlands,” in Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community, ed. Noach Dzmura (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2010), 235. Watts-Belser visualizes a “trans God/dess…characterized by fluidity, a shifting nature that refuses to resolve itself into a single manifestation or gender expression.”Julia Watts-Belser, “Transing God/dess: Notes from the Borderlands,” in Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community, ed. Noach Dzmura (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2010), 239. This God/dess would allow the Jewish tradition to reclaim the female divinity it was denied rather than replace God with Goddess.Julia Watts-Belser, “Transing God/dess: Notes from the Borderlands,” in Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community, ed. Noach Dzmura (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2010), 238. In order to do so, she wants to utilize the Shekhinah, God’s feminine side. She concludes that God is ultimately beyond gender since gender is a social construction and therefore insignificant. However, because gender does matter so much in our society, God’s gender does and should matter to us.Julia Watts-Belser, “Transing God/dess: Notes from the Borderlands,” in Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community, ed. Noach Dzmura (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2010), 239.

From his hiring, he worked actively to build pride of ownership for the organization while exploring ways to strengthen and stabilize the club commercially. On July 2, 2008, the Oilers were purchased by Edmonton billionaire Daryl Katz. With one of the smallest markets in the league, the Oilers have become one of the most financially successful clubs in the NHL and rated as a top 10 sports club in the world by Money Magazine. One of LaForge’s most broadly known achievements was his role in producing the inaugural regular season NHL game played outdoors, called the Heritage Classic. The game highlighted the Edmonton Oilers and Montreal Canadiens playing in front of 57,167 Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton in winter of 2003. The Heritage Classic paved the way for an annual outdoor hockey game in the NHL, attracting fans worldwide.Edmonton Oilers Website (June 4, 2009) LaForge also coordinated the development of Katz Group's Edmonton arena and district project, a development paid in part with public dollars. LaForge had another major achievement with the return of the Edmonton Oil Kings of the Western Hockey League in 2007. The once legendary major junior team won two Memorial Cups before leaving town in 1976, but were reborn under Oilers ownership. LaForge served as both an alternate governor for the Oilers in the NHL, and governor of the Oil Kings in the Western Hockey League.

Currently, the league consists of thirteen high schools, divided into two divisions. Twelve of the schools are from Chester County, with one from Delaware County. The schools all compete in varsity high school sports in the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association, or the PIAA. Ches-Mont League teams compete in District One, at the AAAA, AAA and AA levels.  Schools  = National Division = *Avon Grove High School (West Grove) *Bishop Shanahan High School (Downingtown) *Coatesville Area High School (Coatesville) *Downingtown East High School (Lionville) *Downingtown West High School (Downingtown) *B. Reed Henderson High School (West Chester) *West Chester East High School (West Chester) = American Division = *Great Valley High School (Malvern) *Kennett High School (Kennett Square) *Oxford Area High School (Oxford) *Bayard Rustin High School (West Chester) *Sun Valley High School (Aston) *Unionville High School (Kennett Square)  History  The Ches-Mont League started in 1950 as a spin-off from the huge Suburban League, which had been home for the larger schools in Chester County for some time. All of the new league's charter members either were in Chester County or in Montgomery County municipalities bordering the Schuylkill River, thus the \\"Ches-Mont\\" name. Eight schools originally comprised the league, only one of which, Coatesville, is still part of the league today, though two other original members have split into smaller high schools (Downingtown and West Chester). The other five charter members were Bridgeport, which closed in 1966; Phoenixville; Pottstown; Spring City, which later merged with Royersford High School and became Spring-Ford; and Tredyffrin-Easttown, which later became Conestoga. By 1960, the Ches-Mont had grown to 10 members by dropping smaller schools and adding newly consolidated high schools that had become too large for the small-school Inter-County League. In 1968, Conestoga joined nine former Suburban League schools in the new Central League. During the 1970s, West Chester opened a second high school; also, the league accepted its first non-public school member, St. Pius X of Pottstown, so that by the end of the decade, the Ches-Mont League had an unwieldy 12 schools playing in only one division. By the middle of the 1980s, the great disparity in size between the largest and smallest schools became much more pronounced with the growth of classification-based postseason play. The Ches-Mont League could not agree on how to create relief for the situation, so the smaller, more rural, schools took matters into their own hands. In the fall of 1985, five Ches-Mont schools, including charter members Phoenixville and Pottstown, announced that they were joining with two smaller Bux-Mont League schools and Lansdale Catholic of the Bicentennial Athletic League to form the new Pioneer Athletic Conference, which started league play in 1986. http://pac-10sports.com/league- info/content/pac-10-takes-shape-1985 For two years, the Ches-Mont was a seven- team league. But at the end of the 1988 scholastic year, two more schools left for the Pioneer Conference and a third, Boyertown, decided to make one of its periodic moves to District 3. This reduced the Ches-Mont League, which from 1978 through 1982 was the largest primarily public-school sports league in the southeastern Pennsylvania suburbs of Philadelphia, to only four schools - Coatesville, Downingtown, West Chester East, and West Chester Henderson. Fearing that it could not operate as a four-team league, the remaining Ches- Mont schools applied for membership in the Central League, but they were rebuffed. The PIAA tried to force the Central League to add the teams, but the Central League sued and won. Thanks to the ruling in this suit, the PIAA has no power to re-align sports leagues. Only the leagues themselves can do so. (High school federations in many other states can re-shape sports leagues at will.) For 15 years, the Ches-Mont League remained an association of four schools. It managed to find ways of coping with its small size through creative scheduling - for example, in football, each school played the others twice in the regular season. In other sports, the schools traveled far and wide, often scheduling opponents in other parts of Pennsylvania and even from other states, which at the time was highly unusual for schools not on the state border. Population growth in formerly rural parts of Chester County soon helped the remaining Ches-Mont schools. The splitting of Downingtown into two high schools and the opening of a new, larger Bishop Shanahan High School, which now was much larger than the rural schools that still dominated the Southern Chester County League, allowed the Ches-Mont to grow to six schools in 2003. In 2007, just after the creation of Bayard Rustin, the third West Chester high school, Avon Grove was offered admission to the league. However, the league voted against a measure to offer admittance to other Southern Chester County League teams. West Chester Area School District superintendent Alan Elko sent a letter to the league stating that if the league did not \\"reconsider\\" its decision, the three West Chester schools would leave the league for the SCCL.http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16620848&BRD;=1678&PAG;=461&dept;_id=39386&rfi;=6 After a few meetings, the league decided to offer admittance to Great Valley, Kennett, Octorara, Oxford, and Unionville from the SCCL.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-15843578_ITM When those schools accepted, the SCCL disbanded. Sun Valley, of the Del-Val League, was also offered admittance, forming the fourteen team league. Octorara High School left the Ches-Mont League to move to Lancaster-Lebanon League in 2018. The Ches-Mont League is currently a thirteen school league.

A static core MPU may be halted by stopping the system clock oscillator that is driving it, maintaining its state and resume processing at the point where it was stopped when the clock signal is restarted, as long as power continues to be applied. Static core MPUs are fabricated in the CMOS process and hence consume very little power when the clock is stopped, making them useful in designs in which the MPU remains in standby mode until needed and minimal loading of the power source (often a battery) is desirable during standby. In comparison, typical microprocessor designs, those without a static core, only refresh and present valid outputs on their pins during specific periods of the clock cycle. If the clock is slowed, or stopped, the charge on the pin leaks out of the capacitors over time, quickly moving to the default state and no longer being valid. These designs have to run within a set range of clock frequencies to avoid this problem. Static core microprocessors include the RCA 1802, Intel 80386EX, WDC W65C02S, WDC W65C816S and Freescale 683XX family. Many low-power electronics systems are designed as fully static systems—such as, for example, the Psion Organiser, the TRS-80 Model 100, and the Galileo spacecraft. In such a fully static system, the processor has a static core and data is stored in static RAM, rather than dynamic RAM. Such design features allow the entire system to be \\"paused\\" indefinitely in a low power state, and then instantly resumed when needed.

J. Heinz Company, and sold in the United Kingdom and other countries. They have been sold as Heinz Beanz since 2008. History Heinz 57 trade card from the 19th century, promoting various products; including Beans and the Heinz pickle. In 1886, Heinz Baked Beans were first sold at the Fortnum & Mason department store in London. After opening its first overseas office in London in 1896, the company opened its first UK factory in Peckham, south London, in 1905. This was followed by a second factory at Harlesden, north-west London in 1919. Production was started at a former munitions factory at Standish near Wigan in 1946. A new factory opened in Kitt Green, also near Wigan, in 1958.http://www.heinz.co.uk/our-company/about-heinz/heinz-uk-and-ireland Between 1941 and 1948, The Ministry of Food classified Heinz Baked Beans as an \\"essential food\\" as part of its wartime rationing system. The Heinz factory in Kitt Green is one of the largest food factories in Europe, and produces more than 1 billion cans of food every year. In the United States, Heinz Baked Beans had for many years only been available as grey imports in \\"British Goods\\" specialty stores. As of October 2016 they are now available as official imports in many US supermarkets and specialty stores, with a label similar to the older British label, but customised for the US market (US spelling and US Nutrition Facts). Advertising slogan In 1967, Heinz launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \\"Beanz Meanz Heinz\\". The phrase was created by advertising executive Maurice Drake and went on to become one of the best-known advertising slogans in the United Kingdom. Drake later said the slogan was \\"written over two pints of beer in The Victoria pub in Mornington Crescent\\". In 1998, Heinz Baked Beans was voted one of 12 brands that citizens of the United Kingdom think best represents the final 10 years of the millennium. In 2008, \\"Heinz Baked Beans\\" were renamed \\"Heinz Beanz\\", as the original title was \\"a bit of a mouthful to pronounce\\", according to the company. In 2016 Heinz's advertising campaign featuring people using empty beans cans as musical instruments was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority on safety grounds. BPA allegations In 2001, the UK's Food Standards Agency found Heinz canned baked beans was one of a number of well- known canned products to be contaminated with the hormone disruptor bisphenol A (BPA). This chemical forms part of the membrane that lines the cans. The Heinz company put out a statement – \\"Although UK and European food authorities have stated that minute levels of BPA in can coatings are safe, Heinz remains committed to moving to alternatives.\\" Production method Heinz Baked Beans are produced by sealing raw beans and sauce in the cans, which are then placed in large pressure cookers. This gives the sauce its thick consistency and ensures a long shelf life for the product. A standard 415g can will contain an average of 465 beans. The Beanz Museum In 2019, Heinz opened the “Beanz Museum” as a pop-up exhibit in Covent Garden London between 30 August - 1 September 2019. The museum contained an interactive and immersive exhibition about the history of Heinz’s Baked Beans to mark the products 150th anniversary .

BISF was an association of steel producers, formed in 1934 in order to provide central planning for the industry. It was prominent in coordinating output through World War II. Post- war, BISF became key in the new Ministry of Works Emergency Factory Made housing programme. It sponsored a solution for a permanent steel framed housing to a MoW conforming design by architect Sir Frederick Gibberd, who also designed the Howard house. The BISF is of a conventional design, with simple architectural devices of projecting window surrounds encasing Crittall Hope windows, and differing cladding to the upper and lower stories deal with the junction between components in an understated fashion. The main structure is of steel columns spaced to take standard metal windows between them. The central spine of the building which supports the first floor beams is carried on tubular steel columns. The framework is clad on the lower storey with rendering on metal lath. The outer cladding of the upper floor is of steel trussed sheeting fixed by angles to the steel columns. Traditional materials could be incorporated or simulated, for example a brick cladding to the lower storey, or steel sheet profiled to match timber weatherboarding to the upper. The inner cladding and the partitions are constructed of timber framing faced with plasterboard or hardboard. The upper floors are of tongue & grooved timber and the ceilings are finished with plasterboard or fibreboard. The outer walls and ceilings are insulated with glass quilting.BISF Houses, Greenfield, The Glasgow Story Produced by the British Steel Homes company, the BISF was a successful design in numerical terms, thanks to the backing of its trade sponsors, who could ensure a supply of steel. The BISF also benefited from a guaranteed order of 30,000 units given directly by the Government in 1941. BISF houses are often confused with other prefabricated houses built in the same post-war era. This can cause problems because many of the other types of prefabricated housing are listed as Defective Housing and potential buyers can not obtain mortgages. BISF houses however have never been listed as defective and continue to be mortgageable. As previously stated, BISF Houses were built as permanent homes with a similar expected lifespan to that of a traditional brick built house. They are often wrongly referred to as temporary dwellings and incorrectly classified as such due to their visual similarity to the Aluminium B8 and Arcon temporary bungalows which did have an expected lifespan of just 10 years.

Likewise, this department is responsible for the telecommunications policy and the digital transformation. This has been a ministry that for most of its history has been linked to the Ministry of the Treasury, including a large part of the democratic stage, although they are now separated. The MINECO is headed by the Economy Minister, a Cabinet member who is appointed by the Monarch at request of the Prime Minister, after hearing the Council of Ministers. The Minister of Economy and Business is assisted by five high-ranking officials, the Secretary of State for Economy and Business Support, the Secretary of State for Telecommunications and Digital Infraestructures, the Secretary of State for Digitization and Artificial Intelligence the Secretary General for the Treasury and International Financing and the Under Secretary of Economic Affairs. The current minister is Deputy PM Nadia Calviño, a former EU Civil Servant in charge of the EU Budget.  History  = Origin and protectionism = The responsibilities over the economy had been integrated in the Ministry of the Treasury since its creation in the 18th century. However, because of the weakness and the deficiencies of the Spanish industry and trade sectors, during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera was needed an autarchic policy. In addition, after the World War I the complexity of international markets had plunged Spain into a strong industrial crisis. As a result, the sectors affected demanded a protectionist tariff policy in defense of national production against foreign one and, in turn, make it easy the exports. Thus began an autarchic policy based on economic nationalism and tariff protectionism whose best example is the Cambó tariff of 1922. This policy was assumed by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. Thus a certain economic bonanza was achieved that was truncated by the Great Depression of 1929. The Cambo tariff was the technical and fiscal response to the critical deficit situation of the Spanish trade balance since 1920. It was a tariff policy that served two competing needs: one was to protect the different sectors of the Spanish economy against the international, heavily taxing imports of products produced by foreign counterparts; another responded to the need to defend export agriculture, a sector with a large foreign market and which was damaged by the rise in tariffs, victim of the consequent increases in the countries affected by the Spanish measures. This was solved with the signing of international treaties of Commerce and Navigation agreeing a particular and significant reduction of the tariff with each one of the foreign nations with which commercial exchanges took place. Flores de Lemus defined the situation that was lucidly created: there was a complementarity between export agriculture and agriculture and industry in need of protection, although the instruments used by the Government were opposed and a continuous tension was created between them. = Dictatorship, Republic and Civil War = Although remote antecedents of the Economy portfolio can be found in the creation of the Ministry of Supply as an immediate consequence of the crisis of 1917; The first step towards the creation of a specific department occurred during the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera when the National Economy Council established by Royal Decree of 8 March 1924. The Council was born with the purpose of studying the problems of the national production and consumption, for the purpose of setting the customs tariffs and determining the way to establish international commercial relations adapted to the Spanish economic reality. For this reason, its main functions were to collect statistics on foreign trade and cabotage; obtain economic and commercial information in Spain and abroad; establish the official valuation of the goods, taking into account the cost of the same; propose new customs tariffs, as well as the revision of nomenclatures and tariffs. It was also responsible for proposing the conclusion of Trade Agreements. Finally, this body served to control all pressure groups in the country and thus channel their antagonistic interests: Boards and chambers of Commerce, Industry and Navigation, associations of producers, employers' organizations and trade unions of all kinds. The end of the Military Directorate in 1925, the restoration of the ministerial regime and the economic circumstances led to the creation of the Ministry of National Economy by Royal Decree-Law of 3 November 1928, in response to public opinion that this affairs required to be placed under one direction only, both in terms of production, trade and consumption; and that to date they were dispersed among the rest of the government departments. The National Economy Council depended on the new Economy Ministry, although slightly modified, continuing with its work of collecting and contrasting the realities of the country around each and every one of the sectors of his economic life. The Ministry was also integrated by the following organisms: * The Ministry of Development transferred to it the Directorate-General for Agriculture, with the agricultural chambers, agronomic council and association of Cattle Ranchers and the services of Hygiene and Animal Health. * The Office of the Prime Minister transferred to it the National Economy Council and Directorate- General for Tariffs and Valuations, whose holder was the Vice President of the Council. * From the Ministries of Labor and Interior, it were transferred respectively the responsibilities on Commerce and Supply, which met in the same Directorate-General for Trade and Supply. * The Ministry of Labour also transferred to it the Directorate-General for Industry, with the School of Industrial Engineers, as well as provincial inspectorates. During this period, its headquarters were in the same building as the Ministry of Development, with the exception of the National Economy Council, which was located on Magdalena Street, 12 in Madrid. The Ministry disappeared by Decree of 16 December 1931. Its services were distributed among the Ministries of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce; Development and Labour. The National Economy Council was transformed into the National Economy Planning Council, dependent on the portfolio of Industry and Commerce. In the middle of the Civil War, the government of the Republic created a Ministry of Finance and Economy, first based in Barcelona and then in Valencia. The head of the new institution was Juan Negrín, who at the same time was Prime Minister. Its creation was ordered by Decree of 17 May 1937 and its functions and structure were dictated by Decree 27 of that same month. = From the economic autarky to the developmentalism of the 1960s = The catastrophic situation in which the country was plunged after the Civil War and the collapse of international markets caused by the World War II, will led to the creation of a new National Economy Council. The new body monitored that all ministries follow the economic guidelines of the Government in a harmonious and coordinated manner. His legal regime constituted him as an autonomous body of work, consultant, adviser and technician in all the matters that affected the national economy. It depended directly on the Office of the Prime Minister. The importance of the Council will be increased, so much that institutionally its president will be compared to those of the Cortes, the Supreme Court , the Court of Auditors and the Council of State. Its power and influence in economic matters, always oriented towards autarky, will be equal to that of the General Secretariat of the Movement. Finally, the President of the Council had the rank of Minister without portfolio. Its connection to the most immobile sector of the regime in terms of economy will mean the beginning of its decline. Confronted openly with the Ministries of the Treasury and Commerce for the turn that the Stabilization Plan had made towards a capitalist economy, the National Economy Council gradually began to lose importance in the 1960s. It disappeared in 1977, absorbed by the Ministry of Economy. During the premiership of Arias Navarro, a specific Deputy Prime Minister was created for economic affairs, a position that was assumed by the head of the Treasury portfolio. The new position implied the disappearance of the Ministry of Development Planning, leaving its Undersecretariat ascribed to the Delegate Commission of the Government for Economic Affairs. = Democracy = Nadia Calviño, Economy Minister since June 7, 2018.The recovery of the Ministry of Economy in 1977 takes place in conjunctural circumstances and of great importance for the economic history of Spain. Once the political transition to democracy began, the second government presided over by Suarez was aware that the constitutional process would be seriously hampered if there was no economic growth. The circumstances were totally contrary due to the serious situation that the country was going through due to the oil crisis of 1973, the ineffectiveness of the measures adopted by the last governments of the dictatorship; as well as the accentuation of the latent problems: inflation, unemployment, external deficit, deficit of the public sector and the low level of investments. The institutional solutions involved remodeling the General State Administration, creating a Second Deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs and the position of Minister of Economy through several royal decrees signed on 4 July 1977, appointments that fall in Fuentes Quintana. With the Ministry of Economy recovered, the necessary body is created to group in a single department the different competences in the matter of organization and economic planning and to be able to single out the decisions on economic policy extracting them in part from the Ministry of the Treasury. Its main task was to establish the guidelines of the general economic policy, the short and medium term programming and the study of the proposal of advisable measures to ensure the smooth running of the economy of the country. During the last government of Suarez were merged into one, the Economy and Commerce portfolios. The administrative reforms carried out by the first government headed by Felipe González led in 1982 to the merger in one of the departments of Treasury and Economy and Commerce, giving birth to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This body has continued to operate continuously with the exception of the 7th Cortes Generales (2000-2004), under the premiership of José María Aznar, in which the Treasury and Economy portfolios were split in two. The same happens since the 10th Cortes Generales (2011–present). Between 2016 and 2018, the Ministry of Economy merged with the Ministry of Industry.

The abolition of a monarchy and aristocracy viewed widely as sympathetic to Western interests, particularly since the ousting of Khedive Isma'il Pasha, over seven decades earlier, helped strengthen the authentically Egyptian character of the republic in the eyes of its supporters. Following the formal abolition of the monarchy in 1953, Egypt was known officially as the Republic of Egypt until 1958, the United Arab Republic from 1958 to 1971 (including a period of union with Syria from 1958 to 1961), and has been known as the Arab Republic of Egypt since 1971. Egypt's first four presidents were all drawn from professional military backgrounds, due in large part to the central role of the armed forces of Egypt in the Revolution of 1952, and oversaw authoritarian governments, with varying limits on political participation and freedom of speech. Under Gamal Abdel Nasser, the republic had an Arab socialist government, which changed to a more free market-oriented economy and less-pan-Arab orientation with his successors Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak. In 2011 a revolution calling for more freedom overthrew Mubarak. Nasser era =Revolution of 1952= On 22–26 July 1952, the Free Officers, a group of disaffected officers in the Egyptian army founded by Gamal Abdel Nasser, and headed by General Muhammad Naguib, initiated the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 with the overthrowing King Farouk, whom the military blamed for Egypt's poor performance in the 1948 war with Israel and lack of progress in fighting poverty, disease, and illiteracy in Egypt.Egypt during the Sadat years, By Kirk J. Beattie, p.2 In the following two years, the Free Officers consolidated power, and, following a brief experiment with civilian rule, abrogated the 1953 constitution, and declared Egypt a republic on 18 June 1953, Muhammad Naguib as Egypt's first President. Within six months, all civilian political parties were banned, getting replaced by the \\"Liberation Rally\\" government party, the elites seeing a need for a \\"transitional authoritarianism\\" in light of Egypt's poverty, illiteracy and lack of a large middle class.Egypt during the Sadat years, By Kirk J. Beattie, p.4 In October and November 1954 the large Islamist Muslim Brotherhood organization was suppressed and President Naguib was ousted and arrested. He was replaced by Nasser. Nasser remained president until his death in 1970. The revolutionaries wanted an end to British occupation but did not have a unified ideology or plan for Egypt.Egypt during the Sadat years, By Kirk J. Beattie, p.2 One issue that many agreed on was the need for land reform. Less than six percent of Egypt's population owned more than 65% of the land in Egypt, while at the top and less than 0.5% of Egyptians owned more than one-third of all fertile land.Dr. Assem Al-Desoky's Major Landowners in Egypt: 1914-1952 (in Arabic, Dar Al-Shorouk, Cairo, 2007. quoted in Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.45 the process of land reform began on 11 September 1952, when (among many provisions) a law prohibited ownership of more than 200 feddans of land; limited the rental rate for land; established cooperatives for farmers; minimum wages, etc. Nasser evolved into a charismatic leader, not only of Egypt but of the Arab world, promoting and implementing \\"Arab socialism\\". =Suez Crisis and War= When the United States held up military sales in reaction to Egyptian neutrality regarding the Soviet Union, Nasser concluded an arms deal with Czechoslovakia in September 1955. When the US and the World Bank withdrew their offer to help finance the Aswan High Dam in mid-1956, Nasser nationalized the privately owned Suez Canal Company. The crisis that followed, exacerbated by growing tensions with Israel over guerrilla attacks from Gaza and Israeli reprisals, support for the National Liberation Front's war of liberation against the French in Algeria and against Britain's presence in the Arab world, resulted in the invasion of Egypt in October by France, Britain, and Israel. In 1958 Egypt joined with the Republic of Syria to form a state called the United Arab Republic. It existed until Syria's secession in 1961, although Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971. Nasser helped establish with India and Yugoslavia the Non-Aligned Movement of developing countries in September 1961, and continued to be a leading force in the movement until his death. Nasser ruled as an autocrat but remained extremely popular within Egypt and throughout the Arab world due to his socialist policies at home and anti- imperialist internationalism in the region. His willingness to stand up to the Western powers and to Israel won him support throughout the region. It was partially to smash Nasser's independence that the United States armed Israel to the teeth in preparation for the Six Day War in 1967. =Six-Day War= In May 1967, Nasser closed the Straits of Tiran to passage of Israeli ships. On 26 May Nasser declared, \\"The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel\\". Israel considered the Straits of Tiran closure a casus belli. In the 1967 Six Day War, Israel attacked Egypt after observing Egyptian forces mobilized on Israel's border with Egypt. The Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian armed forces were routed by the Israelis, after Nasser convinced the Syrians and Jordanians to attack Israel. Israel occupied the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank from Jordan. This defeat was a severe blow to Nasser's prestige at home and abroad. Following the defeat, Nasser made a dramatic offer to resign, which was only retracted in the face of mass demonstrations urging him to stay. The last three years of his control over Egypt were far more subdued. =Education= Educational opportunities were \\"dramatically expanded\\" after the revolution. The Free Officers pledged to provide free education for all citizens and abolished all fees for public schools. They doubled the Ministry of Education's budget in one decade; government spending on education grew from less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1952–53 to more than 5 percent by 1978. Expenditures on school construction increased 1,000 percent between 1952 and 1976, and the total number of primary schools doubled to 10,000. By the mid-1970s, the educational budget represented more than 25 percent of the government's total current budget expenses.EDUCATION from Country Study of Egypt Sadat era After Nasser's death, another of the \\"free officers\\", then Vice President Anwar el-Sadat, acceded to the office of the Presidency. He was not elected democratically. In 1971, Sadat concluded a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union, but a year later he ordered Soviet advisers to leave. Nevertheless, up to 4,000 military Soviet advisers were being shared with Syria, and Soviet engineers continued to maintain Egyptian military radar and equipment during the October War. =1973 War= In 1973, Sadat launched the 6 October 1973 war with Israel.Porter, BD. The USSR in Third World Conflicts, p. 134 Egypt's armed forces achieved initial successes in the Crossing of the Suez Canal and advanced 15 km, reaching the depth of the range of safe coverage of its own air force. Having defeated the Israeli forces to this extent, Egyptian forces, rather than advancing under air cover, decided to immediately penetrate further into the Sinai desert. In spite of huge losses they kept advancing, creating the chance to open a gap between army forces. That gap was exploited by a tank division led by Ariel Sharon, and he and his tanks managed to penetrate onto Egyptian soil, reaching Suez City. Israel was stunned by the attack but recuperated by infusion of weaponry from the U.S. Arab oil producers announced a boycott of Western backers of Israel: a 5% cut in output, to be followed by reductions every month until Israel had withdrawn from all the occupied territories and the rights of the Palestinians had been restored. A UN resolution supported by the United States and the Soviet Union called for an end to hostilities and for peace talks to begin. For President Anwar Sadat, however, the war was much more a victory than a draw, as the Egyptian successes restored Egyptian pride and led to peace talks with the Israelis and to Egypt regaining the entire Sinai peninsula. =International relations and the Camp David Accords= Celebrating the signing of the Camp David Accords: Menachem Begin, Jimmy Carter, Anwar Al Sadat. In foreign relations Sadat also launched momentous change from the Nasser era. President Sadat shifted Egypt from a policy of confrontation with Israel to one of peaceful accommodation through negotiations. Following the Sinai Disengagement Agreements of 1974 and 1975, Sadat created a fresh opening for progress by his dramatic visit to Jerusalem in November 1977. This led to the invitation from President Jimmy Carter of the United States to President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to enter trilateral negotiations at Camp David. The outcome was the historic Camp David accords, signed by Egypt and Israel and witnessed by the US on 17 September 1978. The accords led to 26 March 1979, signing of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, by which Egypt regained control of the Sinai in May 1982. Throughout this period, US–Egyptian relations steadily improved, and Egypt became one of America's largest recipients of foreign aid. Sadat's willingness to break ranks by making peace with Israel earned him the enmity of most other Arab states, however. In 1977, Egypt fought a short border war with Libya. =Domestic policy and the Infitah= Sadat used his immense popularity with the Egyptian people to try to push through vast economic reforms that ended the socialist controls of Nasserism. Sadat introduced greater political freedom and a new economic policy, the most important aspect of which was the infitah or \\"open door\\" that relaxed government controls over the economy and encouraged private investment. While the reforms created a wealthy and successful upper class and a small middle class, these reforms had little effect upon the average Egyptian who began to grow dissatisfied with Sadat's rule. In 1977, Infitah policies led to massive spontaneous riots ('Bread Riots') involving hundreds of thousands of Egyptians when the state announced that it was retiring subsidies on basic foodstuffs. Liberalization also included the reinstitution of due process and the legal banning of torture. Sadat dismantled much of the existing political machine and brought to trial a number of former government officials accused of criminal excesses during the Nasser era. Sadat tried to expand participation in the political process in the mid-1970s but later abandoned this effort. In the last years of his life, Egypt was wracked by violence arising from discontent with Sadat's rule and sectarian tensions, and it experienced a renewed measure of repression including extra judicial arrests.  Mubarak era On 6 October 1981, President Sadat was assassinated by Islamic extremists. Hosni Mubarak, Vice President since 1975 and air force commander during the October 1973 war, was elected president later that month. He was subsequently \\"re-elected\\" by referendum for three more 6-year terms, most recently in September 2005, all but the 2005 vote lacking any competing candidate. Mubarak maintained Egypt's commitment to the Camp David peace process, but was able to coax Arab countries into resuming diplomatic relations with Egypt and re-establishing Egypt's position as an Arab leader. Egypt was readmitted to the Arab League in 1989. Egypt also has played a moderating role in such international forums as the UN and the Nonaligned Movement. A section of present-day Cairo, as seen from the Cairo Tower. From 1991, Mubarak undertook an ambitious domestic economic reform program to reduce the size of the public sector and expand the role of the private sector. During the 1990s, a series of International Monetary Fund arrangements, coupled with massive external debt relief resulting from Egypt's participation in the Gulf War coalition, helped Egypt improve its macroeconomic performance. During the 1990s and 2000s, inflation was lowered from double-digit to single digit rate. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) increased fourfold between 1981 and 2006, from US$1355 in 1981, to $2525 in 1991, to $3686 in 2001 and to an estimated $4535 in 2006. Despite this, most Egyptians suffered a drop in their standard of living.Egypt on the Brink by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.130-1 There was much less progress in political reform. The November 2000 People's Assembly elections saw 34 members of the opposition win seats in the 454-seat assembly, facing a clear majority of 388 affiliated with the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP). A constitutional amendment in May 2005 changed the presidential election to a multicandidate popular vote rather than a popular validation of a candidate nominated by the People's Assembly and on 7 September Mubarak was elected for another six-year term with 87 percent of the popular vote, followed by a distant but strong showing by Ayman Nour, leader of the opposition Ghad Party and a well-known rights activist. Shortly after mounting an unprecedented presidential campaign, Nour was jailed on forgery charges critics called phony; he was released on 18 February 2009. Brotherhood members were allowed to run for parliament in 2005 as independents, garnering 88 seats, or 20 percent of the People's Assembly. The opposition parties have been weak and divided and are not yet credible alternatives to the NDP. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, remains an illegal organization and may not be recognized as a political party (current Egyptian law prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion). Members are known publicly and openly speak their views. Members of the Brotherhood have been elected to the People's Assembly and local councils as independents. The Egyptian political opposition also includes groups and popular movements such as Kefaya and the April 6 Youth Movement, although they are somewhat less organized than officially registered political parties. Bloggers, or cyberactivists as Courtney C. Radsch termed them, have also played an important political opposition role, writing, organizing, and mobilizing public opposition.Arab Media & Society.

A dramatic drop in support for Mubarak, or a dramatic increase in people dissatisfied with his practices and his domestic economic reform program increased with surfacing news about his son Alaa being extremely corrupt and favored in government tenders and privatization. As Alaa started getting out of the picture by 2000, Mubarak's second son Gamal started rising in the National Democratic Party and succeeded in getting a newer generation of neo-liberals into the party and eventually the government. Gamal Mubarak branched out with a few colleagues to set up Medinvest Associates Ltd., which manages a private equity fund, and to do some corporate finance consultancy work.Interview with MR. GAMAL MUBARAK Chairman Of Medinvest Associates Ltd. Winne.com (14 January 1999). Retrieved on 2011-02-02.  Civil unrest since 2011  =2011 revolution= Beginning on 25 January 2011, a series of street demonstrations, protests, and civil disobedience acts took place in Egypt, with organizers counting on the Tunisian uprising to inspire the crowds to mobilize. The demonstrations and riots were reported to have started over police brutality, state of emergency laws, unemployment, desire to raise the minimum wage, lack of housing, food inflation, corruption, lack of freedom of speech, and poor living conditions. The protests' main goal at the beginning was mainly to protest against the above-mentioned problems, but due to the reactions of the system which was considered late, inadequate and inconvenient the demonstrations started to develop and evolve so that the goal was to oust President Mubarak's regime. Most observers and analysts noticed a unique feature about the revolution that it did not have any leader and it is a clear example of \\"The wisdom of the crowd\\". On 11 February 2011, President Mubarak resigned, relinquishing power to an interim military authority. The democratically elected president, Mohammed Morsi, followed Mubarak's resignation. = First transition = The military provisional government, under Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, initiated reforms. Constitutional referendum was held; a provisional constitution came to force. Parliamentary free elections were held. A constituent assembly, founded on 26 March 2012, started to work for implementing a new constitution. The first free presidential elections were held in March–June 2012, with a runoff between former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik and Muslim Brotherhood parliamentarian Mohamed Morsi. On 24 June 2012, Egypt's election commission announced that Morsi had won the run-off. = Morsi's presidency = On 8 July 2012, Egypt's new president Mohamed Morsi announced he was overriding the military edict that dissolved the country's elected parliament and he called lawmakers back into session. On 10 July 2012, the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt negated the decision by President Mohamed Morsi to call the nation's parliament back into session. On 2 August 2012, Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Qandil announced his 35-member cabinet comprising 28 newcomers including four from the influential Muslim Brotherhood, six others and the former military ruler Mohamed Hussein Tantawi as the Defence Minister from the previous Government. On 22 November 2012, President Morsi issued a declaration immunizing his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly drafting the new constitution. The declaration also requires a retrial of those accused in the Mubarak-era killings of protesters, who had been acquitted, and extends the mandate of the constituent assembly by two months. Additionally, the declaration authorizes Morsi to take any measures necessary to protect the revolution. Liberal and secular groups previously walked out of the constitutional constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices, while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi. The move was criticized by Mohamed ElBaradei, the leader of Egypt's Constitution Party, who stated \\"Morsi today usurped all state powers & appointed himself Egypt's new pharaoh\\" on his Twitter feed. The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt. On 5 December 2012, Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution. Six senior advisors and three other officials resigned from the government and the country's leading Islamic institution called on Morsi to stem his powers. Protesters also clamored from coastal cities to desert towns. Morsi offered a \\"national dialogue\\" with opposition leaders but refused to cancel a 15 December vote on a draft constitution written by an Islamist-dominated assembly that has ignited two weeks of political unrest. A constitutional referendum was held in two rounds on 15 and 22 December 2012, with 64% support, and 33% against. It was signed into law by a presidential decree issued by Morsi on 26 December 2012. On 30 June 2013, on the first anniversary of the election of Morsi, millions of protesters across Egypt took to the streets and demanded the immediate resignation of the president. On 1 July, the Egyptian Armed Forces issued a 48-hour ultimatum that gave the country's political parties until 3 July to meet the demands of the Egyptian people. The presidency rejected the Egyptian Army's 48-hour ultimatum, vowing that the president would pursue his own plans for national reconciliation to resolve the political crisis. On 3 July, General Abdul Fatah al-Sisi, head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, announced that he had removed President Morsi from power, suspended the constitution and would be calling new presidential and Shura Council elections and appointed Supreme Constitutional Court's leader, Adly Mansour as acting president. Mansour was sworn in on 4 July 2013. = Second transition = During the months after the coup d'état, a new constitution was prepared, which took effect on 18 January 2014. After that, presidential and parliamentary elections have to be held within 6 months. On 24 March 2014, 529 of Morsi's supporters were sentenced to death. On 28 April, the verdict against all except 37 of them was changed to life sentence, but another nearly 700 Islamists including the Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Badie were sentenced to death. As of 28 April, the trial of Morsi is still ongoing. El-Sisi confirmed on 26 March 2014 that he would run for president in the presidential election. The presidential election, which took place between 26 and 28 May 2014, saw el-Sisi win 96 percent of votes counted.

Designed by Sir Edwin Airey to the Ministry of Works Emergency Factory Made housing programme, it features a frame of prefabricated concrete columns reinforced with tubing recycled from the canvas tilt frames of military trucks. A series of shiplap style concrete panels, tied back to the columns, form the external envelope. In 1947, the Central Office of Information commissioned a propaganda film, Country Homes. The directoral debut of the later acclaimed documentary maker Paul Dickson, the film promotes the building of Airey houses in rural areas as a solution to the poor condition (due to the 1930s depression followed by wartime neglect) of much of the housing stock outside Britain's conurbations, due to the ease with which the prefabricated sections could be transported to remote locations.BFI.org Today the Airey houses are life expired and many are in disrepair. The houses are one of a number of precast concrete systems listed in the Housing Defects Act. This meant that Government help for private owners was available in certain cases. Generally they are not accepted for mortgages unless repaired in accordance with certain prescribed methods. In the mid-2000s, one company began testing a refurbishment programme. Their programme involves replacing the concrete slabs with blocks, covered the blocks with insulation, and then facing the structure with brick.

It offered services in fractional jet ownership, jet card membership, corporate solutions and whole aircraft management. CitationAir was one of the four major players in the private aviation market during its time in operation.https://www.forbes.com/forbes-life- magazine/2005/0407/098sidebar.html Fractional Jets and 4 Big Players. It was a seven-time winner of Best of the Best awards from the Robb Report, most recently in 2009. In 2009, the company rebranded itself as CitationAir, changed its business model, and streamlined the product names it offered. In 2012 the company announced that it would stop selling fractional shares. In August 2014 the company announced that it would cease all flight operations on 31 October 2014 and would close down. Following the shutdown, it's FAR Part 135 Operating Certificate was surrendered to the Federal Aviation Administration on 6 November 2014. CitationAir was known for pioneering an efficient flight schedule based on in-house-developed software and it was responsible for introducing many non-owners to the Citations.  Services  CitationAir offered four different programs for its customers Citation Air Jet Shares, formerly Citelines, referred to the fractional jet ownership program that CitationAir offered. This program incorporated all operating expenses into one annual or twelve monthly payments, regardless of where one flew. This program differentiated between peak and non-peak days, allowing share owners to pick one of four packages: 365 days, 350 days, 335 days or 320 days a year. Another CitationAir program was the CitationAir Jet Card, formerly the Vector Fleet JetCard. The CitationAir Jet Card gave members access to two different options. The Jet Card option allowed customers to purchase prepaid flight hours in a specific aircraft. The Fleet Jet Card allowed customers to purchase prepaid flight hours which gave them access to the entire CitationAir fleet. With the Jet Card, customers purchased prepaid flight hours instead of shares. With CitationAir's Jet Access, customers could get the benefits of fractional ownership, without actually purchasing a share. The CitationAir Corporate Solutions program contained CitationAir's Supplemental Lift which supported corporate flight departments with private aviation needs. Corporations had access to CitationAir's entire Cessna Citation fleet without the financial commitment that is associated with owning and maintaining a whole aircraft, reducing the corporation's capital expenditures and operating costs. CitationAir Jet Management, formerly JetForth, was designed for people who own planes but did not want the hassle of managing them. Under this program, CitationAir would use a Jet Management customer's aircraft in order to support and backup the CitationAir fleet, making the aircraft available to fractional and jet card members when not in use by owner. This generated revenue for Jet Management customers, which offset the cost of ownership. On February 6, 2012, CitationAir's president and chief operating officer, William Schultz, announced that though the company intended to honor existing Jet Share and Jet Access contracts until their expirations, the firm had ceased writing new Jet Share and Jet Access contracts. In an announcement electronically delivered to the firm's employees, Mr. Schultz said the company would direct its focus toward the Jet Card, Charter and Jet Management lines of business.  Fleet  At its peak, CitationAir had a fleet of approximately 100 Cessna Citation Jets. The fleet consisted of 5 different types of Citations: * Cessna Citation Bravo (retired from the fleet prior to ceasing operations) * Cessna Citation CJ3 * Cessna Citation Excel * Cessna Citation Sovereign * Cessna Citation X (added to the fleet in December 2009) Awards CitationAir won Best of the Best awards from the Robb Report from 2003–2009. In 2009, it won awards for fractional programs and fractional card programs. It was named the sole Best of the Best in flight services in 2008. It was one of four winners of Best of the Best in fractional flight card programs in 2007. In 2009, Bill Hall, CitationShares' CIO, won a CIO100 Award from CIO Magazine for creating new business value by innovating with technology.

Early life Alcubierre was born and studied in Zaragoza, Spain. When he reached the requisite age, he decided to volunteer in the army as an engineer, after receiving help from the influential Count of Bureta. His work led him to various Spanish cities including Girona (where he helped build military fortifications), Barcelona and Madrid. In 1738 he was promoted to the rank of Captain and was sent to Italy. By 1750 he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and in 1777 he reached the summit of his military career with the post of Field Marshal.  Herculaneum and Pompeii In the course of his works prospecting the estate of the future Charles III of Spain he stumbled across some remains of the Roman city of Herculaneum. He then sought permission and funding from the king to continue the excavations on a larger scale, which was granted in 1738 although with little manpower and resources. With many difficulties, he finally discovered the city's theatre and following this, various murals. After these two key discoveries, he managed to excavate the rest of the city without large obstructions. In 1748, he began prospecting the nearby ancient city of Pompeii, (which had previously been believed to be Stabiae), noted for the fact that it remained virtually unchanged, with expressions of surprise still on the inhabitants who remained there intact, buried by the sudden eruption of Vesuvius. This discovery radically changed the concept of archaeology which until then was only interested in finding interesting artefacts to decorate the cabinets of private collectors and estates.  Later life  He went on to excavate the towns of Asinio Pollio (Sorrento), Capri, Pozzuoli and Cumae. However, from 1750 onwards, arguments arose between him and his subordinates, until he abandoned his responsibilities as head of the excavations and left his duties to people such as Winckelmann, Karl Jakob Weber and Francisco la Vega. They accused him with mishandling of the ancient artifacts. Alcubierre died on 14 March 1780 in Naples. References *Roque Joaquín Alcubierre. Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza.

Nonetheless, the Guru Granth consistently refers to God as He, even in English. He is also predominantly referred to as Father. Gurū Granth The scripture of Sikhism is the Gurū Granth (GG). Printed as a heading for the Guru Granth, and for each of its major divisions, is the Mul Mantra, a short summary description of God, in Punjabi. Sikh tradition has it that this was originally composed by Nanak Dev (1469–1539), the founder of Sikhism. : :ISO 15919: '''' :English: One Universal Creator God, The Name Is Truth, Creative Being Personified, No Fear, No Hatred, Image Of The Timeless One, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, By Guru's Grace. Purakhu The sixth word of the mantra, purakhu, is the Punjabi form of Sanskrit ' (पुरुष), meaning man (personal and male). Verse 5 of a 16-verse hymn in the 10th mandala (or cycle) of the Sanskrit Rgveda (RV) called puruṣa sūkta, speaks of a primal man, Puruṣa, from whom Viraj (woman) was born, being himself then reborn of her. *From him Viraj was born; again Purusa from Viraj was born.RV 10:90:5 The masculine gender sense of purakhu in the Mantra is found in a verse like the following. *That house, in which the soulbride has married her Husband Lord—in that house, O my companions, sing the songs of rejoicing.GG 4:3:10, p. 97. *You are the Husband Lord, and I am the soul-bride.GG ::, p. 484. In Sikhism, a person has two genders - one the physical gender i.e. sex (male or female), and the other the spiritual gender (which is always female - regardless of a person's physical sex). Waheguru is alluded culturally as the spiritual husband, reunion with Which is the desire of every spiritual bride - all of us. *In attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.GG 4:9:42 *You are our Self-sufficient Father.  2  O Father, I do not know—how can I know Your Way? GG 4:26:96, p. 51 *You are the Universal Father of all, O my Lord and Master.GG Some references are inclusive, where God is both Mother and Father. *The One is my Brother, the One is my Friend. The One is my Mother and Father. The One is the Support of the mind; He has given us body and soul. May I never forget God from my mind; He holds all in the Power of His Hands.GG 4:8:78 *Relying on Your Mercy, Dear Lord, I have indulged in sensual pleasures. Like a foolish child, I have made mistakes. O Lord, You are my Father and Mother.GG 4:26:96 There is at least one reference to God as Mother, without reference to a Father. *\\"O my wandering mind, you are like a camel - how will you meet the Lord, your Mother?\\" page 234 This overly literal interpretation of the cultural references in the Guru Granth Sahib run counter to the basic premise of the Mool Mantar - that God has no form. Hence, an anthropomorphic religious (as opposed to cultural) interpretation is a contradiction in terms. The inherent anti-anthropomorhism of Sikhism scuttles any idea of religious gender of Waheguru. The God in sikhism is considered as jot saroop(luminescence of light) so no question of gender but depending upon the feeling of the devotee God can turn itself to any shape a child(girl or boy), a young man or woman, old man or woman or whatever he desire to be i.e. he is not governed by any law or rule and he free to do anything. So in Sikhism, God is considered to be without form or gender and can't be described. =References= Category:Sikh beliefs ","title":"Gender of God in Sikhism"},{"id":"23095197","text":"Heavy Load is a 2008 British documentary film directed by Jerry Rothwell.

Since 1994 it has formed part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\". Though known as the “House of Palladio”, in reality this building has no connection with the residence of the Vicentine master. Rather it is its dimensions—quite contained in comparison to the monumental emphasis of other Palladian palazzi—which has led astray those seeking a trace of the architect’s residence in the city. In fact, the Maggior Consiglio (town council) forced the notary Pietro Cogollo to remodel the façade of his 15th century (Quattrocento) house as a contribution to the “decorum of the city”, making this provision (and a monetary investment in the work of not less than 250 ducats) a condition of their positive response to his request for Vicentine citizenship. In the absence of documents and autograph designs, the attribution to Palladio of this most elegant façade still divides scholars. Yet, because of the intelligence of the architectural solution proposed, as well as the design of all the details, it is difficult to refer the project to any other designer. The constraints posed by a narrow space and the impossibility of opening windows at the centre of the piano nobile (because of an existing fireplace and its flue) induced Palladio to emphasise the façade’s central axis, by realising a structure with a ground floor arch flanked by engaged columns, and on the upper storey a tabernacle frame for a fresco by Giovanni Antonio Fasolo. The ground level arch is flanked by two rectangular spaces which illuminate and provide access to the portico. Altogether they form a type of serliana, as already done at the Basilica Palladiana. The result is a composition of great monumental and expressive force, despite the simplicity of the means available.

Young Slovenes () were a Slovene national liberal political movement in the 1860s and 1870s, inspired and named after the Young Czechs in Bohemia and Moravia. They were opposed to the national conservative Old Slovenes. They entered in a crisis in the 1880s, and disappeared from political life by the 1890s. They are considered the precursors of Liberalism in Slovenia.  Historical background  The movement was founded in the early 1860s, when a group of young Slovene radicals, led by author and activist Fran Levstik, challenged the influence of the conservative leadership of the Slovene National Movement, led by the so-called triumvirate of Janez Bleiweis, Lovro Toman and Etbin Henrik Costa.http://arsq.gov.si/Query/detail.aspx?ID=24909 Levstik and his peers rejected the pragmatic tactic of the conservative mainstream within Slovene nationalism, and demanded a more decisive political actions, which would include a direct confrontation with the Austrian authorities with a mass mobilization of the Slovene pesantry. Levstik's demands were backed mostly by the Slovenes from Styria and the Austrian Littoral, while the Slovenes from Carniola and Carinthia remained mostly on the side of their conservative leadership. By the mid-1860s, two distinct factions within the Slovene National Movement emerged: the liberal and radical Young Slovenes and the national conservative Old Slovenes. The two groups collaborated closely until 1872, when they broke away. In 1876, they forged a fragile tactical alliance against Austrian centralism and German nationalism, and united in support of the coalition government of Eduard Taaffe.  Rise and decline  The importance of the Young Slovenes rose after 1867, when they criticized sharply the inconsistent policy of the Slovene conservative leadership, especially of theis support for the Austro-Hungarian compromise in the Austrian Parliament. As a response to what they considered inefficient \\"cabinet politics\\", the Young Slovenes organized mass popular rallies in support of the United Slovenia program, modelled after of Daniel O'Connell's monster meetings. These rallies, held between 1868 and 1871, proved to be very successful for the mass mobilization of the peasantry for the Slovene national cause, although they did not have any consequence in the Austrian policy toward the Slovene national question. The Young Slovenes sought to get rid of the Roman Catholic Church's influence. Although they supported a laicist and secularist view, they tried to avoid direct confrontation with Roman Catholisim; several liberal Catholic priests, such as the poet Simon Gregorčič, were also sympathetic to the Young Slovene movement. After a period of sharp political struggle between the Young and Old Slovenes in the early 1870s, a compromise between them was reached in 1876. However, both factions maintained their own political infrastructure, including their own media. The Young Slovenes issued the newspaper Slovenski narod, founded in Maribor in 1868, and controlled the editorial policy of the cultural magazine Ljubljanski zvon. After the 1880s, with the death of Fran Levstik and Josip Jurčič, the Young Slovene movement slowly declined. Its legacy was however taken over by younger generations of Slovene liberals who founded, after the final break in the Slovene National Movement in the late 1880s, the Slovene National Progressive Party.  Radicals vs. Elastics  In the Carniolan regional elections of 1883, the Slovene nationalists gained a landslide victory over the mostly German speaking Austrian centralists. Following that victory, the differentiation within the Slovene national movement rose again. It started as a differentiation between the moderate Young Slovene faction, represented by Fran Šuklje and Janko Kersnik, and their radical liberal nationalist opponents, led by Ivan Hribar and Ivan Tavčar. The moderates became known by the derogative name \\"elastics\\". The strife between the two faction reached its height between 1886-1887, when the Young Slovene newspaper Slovenski narod, controlled by the radicals, started publishing a series of articles with a pronounced Pan-Slavic and Anti-Catholic content, written by the controversial pro-Russian nationalist publicist Davorin Hostnik. The radical turn in the editorial policies of the liberal press provoked a fierce reaction in some Catholic circles, and was one of the elements that contributed to the rise of the Kulturkampf in the Slovene Lands in the mid-1880s.  The \\"Division of Minds\\" and the rise of mass politics  In the mid-1880s, several influential Roman Catholic groups, rallied around the Bishop of Ljubljana Jakob Missia (later Archbishop of Gorizia) and the theologian Anton Mahnič, launched an attack on modernism in the Slovene Lands. Mahnič's circle called for a \\"division of minds\\" or \\"division of souls\\" (), that is a clear-cut political and ideological differentiation between the Catholics and the secularists. As a consequence, the Slovene political scene was largely re-configured along the divide between clericalism and anti-clericalism. The New Slovenes, with their mixture of agnosticism and liberal Catholicism, did not fit this new differentiation, and were replaced by the more radical Progressive nationalists (also known as Liberals). Besides, the old model of politics, based on small elites, was gradually being replaced by an emerging mass politics, characterized by the Christian Socialism of Janez Evangelist Krek on one side, and on the radicalised liberal nationalism of Ivan Hribar and Ivan Tavčar on the other side. By the mid-1890s, the Marxists, gathered in the Yugoslav Social Democratic Party also appeared on the scene. In this changed configuration, the Young Slovenes vanished from the political scene by the 1890s. The radical Young Slovene faction formed the core of the new National Progressive Party, while some moderates chose the Slovene People's Party instead.

It has nine members, including a representative of local or state heritage organizations, six members of the public who are interested and experienced in issues of preservation or archaeology, a representative from the Washington archaeological community, and a representative of the Native American community. Terms are four years. =Archaeology Regulation= Through Section 106 reviews (pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act), and Washington's SEPA, DAHP reviews construction projects using federal or state monies for impacts to archaeological resources. Washington's archaeological resources are rich as evidence of human activity stretches almost 13,000 years. Archaeology reviews are carried out by professional staff archaeologists. The current Washington State Archaeologist is Dr. Rob Whitlam. DAHP assigns site number (Smithsonian trinomials) for archaeological sites, and maintains a database of over 18,000 archaeological sites in the state.Archaeology and DAHP https://www.dahp.wa.gov/pages/Archaeology/Survey.htm DAHP also regulates archaeological excavation in the state, and issues permits to applicants.RCW 27.53: Permit Regulation Authority http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=27.53.060 As archaeological records are confidential and exempt from public disclosure laws, DAHP also regulates research by archaeological consultants.

The SPARC T4 processor, introduced in 2011, has user-level instructions implementing AES rounds. These instructions are in addition to higher level encryption commands. The ARMv8-A processor architecture, announced in 2011, including the ARM Cortex-A53 and A57 (but not previous v7 processors like the Cortex A5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15 ) also have user-level instructions which implement AES rounds. In August 2012, IBM announced that the then-forthcoming Power7+ architecture would have AES support. The commands in these architectures are not directly equivalent to the AES-NI commands, but implement similar functionality. IBM z9 or later mainframe processors support AES as single- opcode (KM, KMC) AES ECB/CBC instructions via IBM's CryptoExpress hardware. These single-instruction AES versions are therefore easier to use than Intel NI ones, but may not be extended to implement other algorithms based on AES round functions (such as the Whirlpool and Grøstl hash functions). =Supporting x86 CPUs= VIA x86 CPUs, AMD Geode, and Marvell Kirkwood (ARM, mv_cesa in Linux) use driver-based accelerated AES handling instead.

Its wetlands contain endangered species of birds and animals including the sitatunga (\\"enjobe\\" in Luganda). The lake is of traditional and cultural significance to the people of Buganda in Central Uganda. Location The lake is shared by the districts of Mubende, Mityana, and Gomba in the Buganda Region of Uganda. The road distance between downtown Mityana and Kalyankoko, Kimuli, Mityana District, on the eastern shores of Lake Wamala is approximately . The coordinates of Lake Wamala are 0°20'44.0\\"N, 31°53'16.0\\"E (Latitude:0.345545; Longitude:31.887778). Overview Lake Wamala covers an area of approximately . It is dotted by many islands, including Lwanju Island, Mabo Island, and Bagwe Island, Kiraza, Kazinga, among others. Several rivers flow into the lake, including the River Nyanzi, the River Kitenga, the River Kaabasuma, the River Mpamujugu, and the River Bbimbye. The lake is drained by the Kibimba River into the Katonga River, which in turn drains into Lake Victoria. The Kibimba River, however, is highly seasonal and for much of the time its course remains essentially dry. Lake Wamala is of significant economic and cultural interest locally and is jointly administered by the districts of Mubende, Mityana, and Mpigi, each of which share a part of the lake along common borders. History More than 4,000 years ago Lake Wamala was part of Lake Victoria, but has since receded into its current state. One apocryphal myth supposes that Lake Wamala derives its name from a King Wamala, the last monarch of the Bachwezi dynasty and that King Wamala disappeared into the lake at a site near Lubajja fishing village called Nakyegalika and his spirit resides in the lake. Flora and fauna The vegetation surrounding Lake Wamala is dominated by papyrus, other floaters, and water-based vegetation. There are also trees such as Raphia and other palms. A variety of animal species such as sitatunga, wild pigs, hippopotamus, bushbuck, waterbuck, vervet monkey, baboon, guinea fowl, and turaco live near the lake. Existing fish species include tilapia, catfish, and lungfish. Fishing patterns During the 1960s and the early 1970s, Lake Wamala was an important source of both fresh and smoked fish sold locally and in the big towns in Buganda. Due to mismanagement and uncontrolled, unregulated commercial fishing on the lake, the fish were depleted in the mid-1970s. Climate change has also worsened the lake conditions, to the detriment of the local fishermen and their families.

It was written and directed by James Dearden. It stars Ben Kingsley, Charles Dance, Helen Mirren and Kevork Malikyan . It was entered into the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. The action takes place in 1908 on the fictional Ottoman- ruled Greek island of Nisi. The film was largely shot on the Greek island of Symi and in Rhodes in the late summer of 1987. Plot In 1908 at Nisi, a small Greek Island under Ottoman rule, Turkish officials, Greek rebels, German emissaries and other foreign mercenaries mingle as they all try to keep the upper hand in that remote part of the crumbling Ottoman Empire. Basil Pascali, a half-British half-Maltese man, considers himself a local feature on the island. Since his arrival twenty years before, he has spied for the Sultan, sending detailed reports about suspicious activities. He has no idea if anybody reads his observations, as he never receives a reply but his payment still arrives regularly, so he continues his work as an informant with unfailing eagerness. Pascali's suspicions are aroused by the arrival of Anthony Bowles, a British archeologist, whose purpose in visiting the island is unclear. Basil quickly befriends Bowles at the hotel’s lounge bar and offers the archeologist his services as translator. Pascali introduces Bowles to his close friend, Lydia Neuman, a bohemian Austrian painter resident in the island. While Lydia and Anthony become smitten with each other, Pascali slips into Bowles' hotel room to investigate. In Bowles' suitcase, Pascali finds a fake antique, the head of a small statuette, and this makes him suspect that the archaeologist may be a fraud. Needing help arranging a deal to lease some land from the local Pasha, Bowles hires Pascali as a translator. At Bowles' insistence, the agreement is sealed officially with a contract. Suspecting Bowles' intentions, Pascali warns him that the Pasha is not a man to be crossed. For their part, the Turkish authorities tell Pascali that he will be held responsible if Bowles fails to make the full payment. Spying on Bowles, Pascali finds the archeologist romancing Lydia; swimming naked with her in a remote cove. Pascali has been secretly in love with Lydia and envies the handsome British archeologist. Aroused by the experience, Pascali relieves his sexual frustration at a Turkish bath. Unexpectedly, Bowles wants to change the terms of his contract: he has, he claims, found some small archeological object of great significance, so he wants the right to excavate to be included in a new lease. Once again Pascali serves as translator and intermediary with the Pasha, who seeing the objects, a gold collar and the antique statue's head, refuses to grant the excavation rights. The Pasha wants to buy the lease back; Bowles asks for a much larger sum than he originally paid. Pascali tells Bowles that he does not need to keep up the pretence with him: he knows that the statuette's head is a forgery and that Bowles' intention from the start was to swindle the Turkish authorities, enticing them to buy the lease back at a higher amount. Pascali asks for part of Bowles' earnings in exchange for his silence, forcing Bowles to concede. The ploy becomes more complicated when, by chance, Bowles makes a genuinely important archeological discovery: a large bronze statue of a boy from Greek times that is in pristine condition. Deciding to secretly retrieve the statue, Bowles asks Pascali for help in delaying the closing of the lease deal for two more days. Pascali helps him not only with the Turkish authorities but also on the excavation. He intends to use the money Bowles offers him to travel to Constantinople and find out what has happened to his reports, the only thing that has given meaning to his life. Both Lydia and Bowles try to persuade Pascali to leave the island, as the fall of the Ottoman Empire is imminent. Believing, however, that Bowles is going to swindle him over the money, Pascali denounces him to the Turkish authorities. He guides them that night to the excavation site, but as Bowles and Lydia are planning to leave the island, with the help of the Americans, taking the statue with them, they are all shot and killed by the Turks. Pascali, already regretting having betrayed his friends, returns home to find the money and a letter from Bowles trying to help him leave the island. Pascali is devastated over his useless mistakes. He concludes his reports were neither read nor kept. He loved both Lydia and Bowles, but caused their deaths. As the Ottoman Empire crumbles, the only thing left for Pascali is to wait for the Greeks to come for him. Cast Reception Caryn James, writing for The New York Times called it \\"Slow and stately, [the film] never gets beneath its own superficial gentility\\" and criticized the performances, dialogue and cinematography. Conversely, Roger Ebert praised the cast's performances, writing \\"Everything in a film like this depends on performance, and it is hard to imagine how it could have been better cast.\\"Roger Ebert review: Pascali's Island.

Cuba has been, since the 1960s, a reference point to left wing politicians in Chile. History Chile, together with Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Bolivia and Ecuador, was opposed to sanctions imposed on Cuba by the United States during the 1962 OAS meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay. In 1971 Chile re-established diplomatic relations with Cuba, joining Mexico and Canada in rejecting a previously-established Organization of American States convention prohibiting governments in the Western Hemisphere from establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Shortly afterward, Cuban president Fidel Castro made a month-long visit to Chile. With Salvador Allende he visited the recently nationalized El Teniente copper mine. During Pinochet's military dictatorship in Chile (1973–1990) Cuba provided training and arms for Chilean leftists to set up an armed resistance. Chilean Revolutionary Left Movement drew inspiration from the Cuban Revolution and the Sierra Maestra in trying to set up a guerrilla in Neltume, which was obliterated in 1981. After that the Cuban-inspired rural warfare proved to be a failure, Cuba continued to support urban guerrillas such as FPMR. One of the largest smuggling of Cuban arms occurred in Carrizal Bajo, these arms where later used by FPMR to perform an assassination attempt against Pinochet in 1986. In 2009 Bachelet visited Cuba, making her the first Chilean leader to visit the island nation since Salvador Allende's 1972 trip.

Attempts were made to reconcile with some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches at the Council of Florence (1438-1445), but none of these provided a lasting solution. Relations began to improve dramatically, however, after the Catholic Church's Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). There were several important exchanges of visits between Popes and heads of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and semi- official theological conversations sponsored by the Pro Oriente Foundation in Vienna. This process of reconciliation led to the establishment of an official dialogue between the Catholic and Oriental Orthodox Churches in 2003.  Setting up the Dialogue  In 2003 a joint committee to prepare for the establishment of an international dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches was set up and met in Rome. At this meeting it was announced that the Co-Chairmen of the new International Joint Commission for Theological Dialogue between the Catholic Church and the Oriental Orthodox Churches would be Metropolitan Bishoy of Damiette, General Secretary of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church, and Cardinal Walter Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. The Preparatory Committee also established rules of membership in the dialogue, a work plan and procedures, as well as a timetable for the Joint Commission’s work. Altogether seven Oriental Orthodox Churches are participating in the dialogue. These are the Coptic Orthodox Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Armenian Catholicossate of Etchmiadzin, the Armenian Catholicossate of Cilicia, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. In 2010 Cardinal Kurt Koch succeeded Cardinal Walter Kasper as Catholic Co-Chairman of the dialogue.  Progress of the Dialogue  The first plenary meeting of the Joint Commission took place in Cairo in January 2004, and it has been meeting annually since that time. In January 2009, at its sixth meeting, the Commission finalized its first agreed statement, entitled “Nature, Constitution, and Mission of the Church.” It treats some fundamental themes in ecclesiology such as the relationship between the Trinity and the Church, attributes of the Church, Bishops in Apostolic Succession, synodality and primacies in the Church, and the Church’s mission. The text also outlines a number of areas that need further study, and will be considered at a future stage of the dialogue. At its seventh meeting in January 2010, the commission focused on the ways in which the full communion that existed between the Catholic and Oriental Orthodox churches up to the mid-fifth century was expressed. This study continued at the eighth meeting of the commission, which took place in Rome in January 2011, and at the ninth meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in January 2012. At the Addis Ababa meeting a subcommittee was established with the task of preparing a draft common text on this topic. The subcommittee met in Rome in September 2012 and produced a preliminary draft text for consideration at the tenth meeting, held in Rome in January 2013. At the 2013 meeting the draft was examined, and new papers were presented on the common veneration of saints as a sign of full communion among the churches. The eleventh meeting took place from January 28 to February 1, 2014, in Pampakuda, Kerala State, India, hosted by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. Papers were presented on the development of eucharistic prayers and pilgrimages as signs of full communion in the early centuries, and more work was done on the proposed agreed statement. The results of those studies were incorporated into the draft text which was considered again at the twelfth meeting, which took place in Rome from January 25 to 30, 2015. After a number of further amendments were made, the document was approved for publication. Its full title is \\"The Exercise of Communion in the Life of the Early Church and its Implications for our Search for Communion Today.\\" At the January 2015 Rome meeting and again in Cairo in February 2016 papers were presented on the Sacraments of Initiation. The Commission met in Rome for its Fourteenth Meeting from January 23 to 27, 2017. The main theme of that meeting was the Eucharist. The Fifteenth Meeting took place in Etchmiadzin, Armenia, from January 29 to February 4, 2018, and was hosted by the Catholiosate of All Armenians. Papers were presented on the sacraments of Holy Orders, Penance (reconciliation) and Anointing of the Sick. The sixteenth meeting took place in Rome January 27 to February 2, 2019, and was devoted to a study of the sacrament of marriage. Due to the death of Metropolitan Bishoy the previous October, the Oriental Orthodox members chose Bishop Kyrillos of the Coptic Orthodox Church as the new Oriental Orthodox Co- Chairman. The seventeenth meeting took place in late January 2020 in Atchaneh, Lebanon, hosted by the Syrian Orthodox Church. It focused on the nature and number of the sacraments, and set in motion the drafting of an eventual agreed statement on the sacraments. The eighteenth meeting is to take place in Rome in late January 2021.

The cars were produced and sold by a succession of businesses between 1952 and 1958. At the outset the cars were impressively simple and inexpensive, but as they became slightly less simple they also lost much of their price advantage. As larger manufacturers moved centre stage in the German auto-market, the producers of the Champion failed to achieve the volumes necessary to justify the investment needed to develop and produce the cars: the brief story of the marque is one of a succession of financial crises and failures. History The car originally developed by ZF of Friedrichshafen was a two-seater with a single-cylinder 200 cc rear-mounted two-stroke lawnmower engine supported by a supercharger. Power was delivered to the wheels via a three-speed gear box: despite the low weight of the car, there was also a reverse gear. The first prototype was actually built further to the south at Herrlingen near Ulm in 1948. The car was based around a central steel frame and employed a rear-mounted engine, being clearly inspired by the Volkswagen lay-out, but smaller and simpler having regard to the availability of production facilities and materials in the late 1940s. In 1949 a former BMW engineer then known for his work on early post-war racing cars and named Hermann Holbein acquired the production rights for the car. One year later, Holbein introduced the Champion, which would be assembled at the newly created Champion Automobilwerke plant in Paderborn until 1952. In 1952 production was taken over by the Ludwigshafen based \\"Rheinische Automobilfabrik Hennhöfer & Co\\" company. When this business went into liquidation a Dane named Henning Thorndahl took charge of assembling the vehicles until October 1954 when the last car was produced. In 1955 production was taken over by Maico, a firm then as subsequently better known for its motorcycles.  Champion 250  The Champion 250 built under Holbein’s direction featured a rear-mounted Triumph (Germany) single-cylinder engine of 250 cc producing a claimed 6 PS or a two-cylinder engine providing a stated 10 PS of output. Weights given for the car vary between 220 kg and 250 kg. It was just 285 cm (724 in) long and 136 cm (345 in) wide. The single-cylinder version was said to be capable of 60 km/h (37 mph) and the two-cylinder version of 70 km/h (44 mph). The specification of the car was basic. The steel dish wheels were of a thinness commonly associated with basic motorcycles and needed therefore to be pumped to a relatively high pressure. The hardness of the tires and the minimalist approach taken to shock absorption made the cars strikingly uncomfortable. Except for users of cabriolet versions with the roof open, above average agility was vital for anyone wishing to get in or out of a Champion. Driver fitness was also encouraged by the need to start the engine with a starting handle, there being no electric starter-motor. The selling price was initially, DM 2,400 rising to DM 2,650 for the twin-cylinder version: this compares with DM 5,300 then being asked for a Volkswagen Beetle. 225 or just under 400 of the cars were produced. Sources differ.  Champion 400 / 500  In 1951 the twin seater cabriolet-saloon Champion 400 was presented with a full width canvas roof reminiscent of the open-topped Fiat Topolino though in other respects the overall architecture of the design remained closer to Wolfsburg than to Turin. The steel bodied car was reported to be notably more solidly constructed and the suspension had gained both in sophistication and in terms of ride comfort. The weight of the car was now virtually doubled as against the original 250 model, to 520 kg, and road- holding on the corners became more challenging. Power came from a two-cylinder 398 cc ILO engine. Output was now given as 14 PS, and the maximum speed increased to 80/85 km/h (50/53 mph). Between 1951 and 1952 around 2,000 were produced. However, the car no longer occupied the price niche of its predecessor, the price having increased by the start of 1951 to DM 4,300, which almost matched the price of the Volkswagen Beetle, which had itself recently undergone a substantial price reduction supported by increasing production and sales volumes. After Champion production moved south from Paderborn to the Hennhöfer plant at Ludwigshafen the original Champion business collapsed. The Ludwigshafen Hennhöfer company which was by now assembling the cars on behalf of Champion nevertheless committed to persist in producing the cars. The engine was switched to a 16 PS Heinkel unit, and the model name was changed from 400 to 400 H. Roughly a further 1,941 of the cars were built in Ludwigshafen on this basis before Hennhöfer, in its turn, collapsed in 1953. The Danish entrepreneur Thorndahl struggled to revive the business in 1953/54. Under his watch 1953 saw the introduction of the Champion 500G, an estate version of the car with a steel-timber body and a 452 cc Heinkel 18 PS engine. However, only 20 of the 500G models were produced, and in total output under Thorndahl amounted only to 300 vehicles.  Maico MC 400  Maico was also based in the south-west of Germany, at Ammerbruch-Pfäffingen near Tübingen: their purchase of the Champion assets was triggered by the low \\"liquidation\\" price at which they were available following the collapse of earlier producers of the car. Following the Maico takeover the two-seater car was rebranded as the Maico MC 400. A four-seater version, the Maico MC 403, was also developed by Maico's Technical Chief, Ulrich Pohl, who till then had never had any involvement in auto-design. In order to accommodate the back seats the car was lengthened from 320 cm to 340 cm and the weight increased to 585 kg. The two-cylinder 400 cc engines were motor-cooled and gave a stated 15 PS of output. 1955 saw the appearance of the Maico 500 with the 452 cc Heinkel 18 PS engine. The car retailed for just DM 3,665, but it is not clear whether the reduced price resulted from reductions in production costs or from ever more heroic assumptions as to the volume sales over which fixed costs could be amortized. Bodies were by now being built by Bauer of Stuttgart. 1957 saw further reworking of the chassis, but driving characteristics remained fussy: the competition had also moved on and the now aging design fell short of market expectations in terms of detailed finish and the high level of interior noise. Neither the two-seater nor Pohl's extended four-seater were strikingly beautiful. By 1956 Maico had produced approximately a further 800 of the Champion-designed cars, including a further 21 of the 500G models, sold at a loss-leader price of just DM 4,050. Shortly before automobile production came to an end, another sports coupe, the Maico 500 Sport Cabriolet, was shown to the public. Ten pre-production prototypes were built by Thun-based coach- builder Beutler Brothers. There were hopes of finding financial salvation by selling the little cars in the US. The hopes proved illusory, however, as the money ran out. Early in 1958 Maeco hastily pulled out of automobile production, narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, returning the focus of their business to motorcycles. By March 1958, Maico had produced about 5,000 or 7,100 of the Champion-based Maico cars. Again, sources differ. Sources and further reading * Hansjörg Dach: Champion - eine Legende.

The highway runs northeast through sparsely populated areas of the Ozark Highlands and crossing Fourche River. Entering Maynard has a junction with Highway 115/Highway 166\\\\. Highway 166 and Highway 328 briefly concur eastward through Maynard before the former turns northward. Highway 328 continues easterly, crossing into the flatter terrain of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain before turning due south as a section line road, crossing the Current River, and running to Reyno. In Reyno, the route intersects US 62/US 67 (Future I-57), where it terminates. The ArDOT maintains Highway 328 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. For 2016, the highest traffic levels were estimated in Reyno, with 620 vehicles per day (VPD). The remainder of the highway averaged under 600 VPD, with the exception of the concurrency with Highway 166, which averaged 1,300 VPD. =Clay County= Highway 328 begins at an intersection with Highway 211 (Stephens Street) in Success in western Clay County three miles (4.8 km) east of the Current River, and three miles (4.8 km) south of the Missouri border.

The elections had been delayed from 7 May, to coincide with elections to the European Parliament. 62 councillors were elected from various electoral divisions, which returned either one or two county councillors each by first-past-the-post voting for a four-year term of office. The electoral divisions were the same as those used at the previous election in 2009. No elections were held in Plymouth and Torbay, which are unitary authorities outside the area covered by the County Council. All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term- time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election. Summary The election saw the Liberal Democrats lose control of the council to the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats were reduced to the second largest party and hence the official opposition. Devon was one of 2 county councils controlled by the Liberal Democrats, the other being Somerset County Council, both were lost to the Conservative Party.

The BYU Mars Rover for May 2009. The BYU Mars Rover is a student designed, built and run project overseen and funded primarily by the Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Physics departments at Brigham Young University. The rover competes annually in the University Rover Challenge (URC) near Hanksville, Utah at the Mars Desert Research Station, and is currently being evaluated for research use. History The BYU Mars Rover project is currently in its twelfth year, after being started by BYU Physics Professor Dr. David Allred when he announced the upcoming URC in his second semester physics class.BYU land rover explores planet Earth – in 3-D, Salt Lake Tribune, June 3, 2007, 6049690 =2007= After deciding to compete in the first URC, and being funded primarily by the BYU Physics Department and Dr. Allred, the team began construction on a simple rover design, using 3/4\\" square aluminum tubing for the chassis, and a four-wheel drive, skid steer type drivetrain using brushless motors. The rover also had stereo video transmitted over 900 MHz analog video links. The first year the BYU rover took second place at the competition, coming in behind the University of Nevada, Reno rover, and ahead of Penn State and UCLA.http://www.marssociety.org/portal/c/urc/2007-urc- archive/announcements/UNR%20Wins%20Inaugural%20University%20Rover%20Challenge.pdf/?searchterm=2007%20URCRace to Mars Miniseries, Daily Planet, Discovery Channel Canada =2008= For the 2008 season, the BYU rover was completely redesigned and rebuilt from scratch, with a completely new drivetrain, a suspension, and a custom designed and built robotic arm. Unfortunately, the redesign left no time for testing, and the rover did not complete its first drive until the team was actually at the event. After solving computer issues the first day of events, the BYU rover competed in the Soil Science task on the morning of the second day, but broke their drivetrain within minutes of leaving the start gate. This failure led the BYU team to finish in fifth place.http://www.marssociety.org/portal/Members/schnarff/URC2008Results/?searchterm=2008%20URC =2009= The BYU Mars Rover Team in 2009 After the past year's mechanical failures and software issues, the rover was modified, as the team felt that the basic design of the rover was sound, it just needed revision. As such, the chassis was kept mostly the same, but a completely new suspension was designed and built, and a new drivetrain was selected, as well as switched the operating system on the rover from Windows XP to Debian GNU/Linux. Another goal of the team was to test the rover a month before the URC, a task that was accomplished with the drivetrain and other basic controls, but not with video or the arm. At the event, the rover was able to actually compete in all of the tasks for the first time, with no major failures. The primary limitations were radio range, and limited testing with the robotic arm. As such, the rover did well at competition, finishing in second place. =2017= In 2017, the science team scored a perfect 100, which helped propel the team into what was thought to be third place. Several weeks later it was announced that there was a calculation error in the point tallies for each team. This miscalculation caused the team to move to fourth place, by a small margin. =2018= The BYU Mars Rover Capstone Team in 2018 In 2018, BYU faced some controversy in the Extreme Delivery and Retrieval task. Seeking to drop off a payload, they went up a ravine where they tipped over, forcing an intervention and subsequent loss of 20% of their points. This kept them from earning the 40 points needed to pass to the second round of the task, where more points could be earned. However, after deliberation, the judges decided that a bad GPS point had led them off course and caused the intervention. BYU was then allowed to attempt the second round, earning 10 more points before losing the rover over a cliff. Luckily, a quick-thinking student dove to catch the rover, falling with it and preventing it from rolling and damaging itself irreparably. The judges increased the difficulty of the other tasks significantly, especially Autonomous Traversal. However, the BYU Mars Rover successfully traversed five of the eight possible legs earning a competition high 55. Most teams didn't earn any points in the task, leading to a competition average of 5.6. For comparison, the average Autonomous Traversal score in 2017 was 19.6, and seven teams scored 55 or higher, including one 100. This, along with a nearly perfect Science Cache score, pulled BYU up to 5th place. Technical overview =Mechanical systems= As of 2018, the BYU Mars Rover has a rocker-bogie design with six wheels, each of which can be independently controlled. The rover arm has 6 DOF. In 2009, the BYU Mars Rover was a four- wheel drive, skid steer type vehicle, approximately 36\\" long, 40\\" wide, and 20\\" tall (excluding antenna and camera mast). Each wheel is approximately 12\\" in diameter, and is powered by a brushless electric motor and planetary gearbox. The suspension is a fully independent A-arm design, with CNC milled A-arms, and is well integrated into the rover chassis in order to reduce weight and complexity. The rover arm is a student designed and built 5 degree of freedom robotic arm using high resolution optical encoders and high torque planetary gear motors as well as timing belt gearing. =Control systems= The rover is controlled using a variety of off the shelf computing platforms. The primary computer is a 1 GHz Intel single-board computer (SBC) running Ubuntu Linux and connected to the communications radios over Ethernet. In addition, the arm and servo control is handled by an ARM SBC running at 500 MHz and a Lynxmotion 32 output servo controller. The rover uses a 900 MHz radio with a theoretical throughput of 54 Mbit/s and an output power of up to 700 mW. Both the base station and rover side radios are connected to omnidirectional antennas. =Sensing systems= Computer Vision The rover uses a ZED stereo camera for image recognition, while a RPLidar A2 senses nearby obstacles. GPS/IMU An InertialSense µINS Development Kit provides position, heading, velocity, and acceleration data using GPS and IMU data.

Early life and education Matthews was born in Killiney, near Dublin, Ireland in 1843 to Nicolas Blayney Matthews and Anna Burke Matthews. His mother having died a few years after his birth, his father took him and his brother to the United States. He grew up in Wisconsin and Iowa, and his father, a medical doctor, began training his son in medicine. He would go on to graduate from the University of Iowa in 1864 with a degree in medicine. The American Civil War was raging at the time, and Matthews immediately volunteered for the Union Army upon graduating. His first post was as surgeon at Rock Island Barracks, Illinois, where he tended to Confederate prisoners. In the West Matthews was posted at Fort Union in what is now Montana in 1865. It was there that an enduring interest in Native American peoples and languages took root. He would go on to serve at a series of forts in Dakota Territory until 1872: Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, Fort Rice, and Fort Buford. He was a part of General Alfred H. Terry's expedition in Dakota Territory in 1867. While stationed at the Fort Berthold in the Dakota Territory, he learned to speak the Hidatsa language fluently, and wrote a series of works describing their culture and language: a description of Hidatsa-Mandan culture, including a grammar and vocabulary of the Hidatsa language and an ethnographic monograph of the Hidatsa. He also described, though less extensively, the related Mandan and Arikara peoples and languages. (Some of Matthews' work on the Mandan was lost in a fire before being published.) There is some evidence that Matthews married a Hidatsa woman during this time. Her name is not known. There is also speculation and circumstantial evidence that Matthews had a son with the woman. In April, 1876, Matthews was sent to Camp Independence to serve as Post Surgeon. In ensuing months he serviced soldiers and local civilians; he vaccinated hundreds of Native Americans of the Owens Valley against smallpox. During his stay in the Owens Valley he pursued other interests, such as collecting native plants. He sent his collection to Asa Gray, who named two of those new to science after him: Loeseliastrum matthewsii and Galium matthewsii. Camp Independence was closed in July, 1877. In 1877 he participated in an expedition against the Nez Perce, and again in 1878 against the Bannock. While serving at a prison on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, Matthews made a study of the Modoc language. Army Medical Museum From 1884 to 1890, Matthews was posted to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, DC. During this time he conducted research and wrote several papers on physical anthropology, specifically craniometry and anthropometry. With the Navajo John Wesley Powell of the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology suggested that Matthews be assigned to Fort Wingate, near what is now Gallup, New Mexico. It was there that Matthews came to know the people who would become the subject of his best known work, the Navajo. His work on the Navajo served to dispel then-current erroneous thinking about the complexity of Navajo culture: :Dr Matthews referred to Dr Leatherman's account of the Navahoes as the one long accepted as authoritative. In it that writer has declared that they have no traditions nor poetry, and that their songs \\"were but a succession of grunts.\\" Dr. Matthews discovered that they had a multitude of legends, so numerous that he never hoped to collect them all: an elaborate religion, with symbolism and allegory, which might vie with that of the Greeks; numerous and formulated prayers and songs, not only multitudinous, but relating to all subjects, and composed for every circumstance of life. The songs are as full of poetic images and figures of speech as occur in English, and are handed down from father to son, from generation to generation. Matthews is said to have been initiated into various secret Navajo rituals. In his work he reported that the Navajo were ichthyphobic, having a taboo on eating fish. He theorized that \\"Living in a desert land where water is so scarce and so obviously important to life, [coming to regard] water as sacred, it is an easy step for them to regard as sacred everything that belongs to the water….

It is called \\"gollum\\" with reference of the eponymous character of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. Description Three adult males in the type series measure in snout–vent length; females are unknown. The head is relatively large whereas the body and the limbs are slender. The tympanum is distinct. The parotoid gland is elongated, low in profile. Fingers are long with blunt tips. The toes are partially webbed. Skin of the flanks and the dorsum is covered with numerous warts. The ground color of the dorsum and the flanks is orange. The mid-dorsal stripe is white and prominent. The inter- orbital region is black. The dorsum has large, black warts. The ventrum is orange with dark blotches. The iris is gold. Males have median subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call is a low, diphasic, raspy, coughing sound. Habitat and conservation The type series was collected in closed-canopy lowland forest ( above sea level) in the early evening following brief periods of afternoon precipitation. Males were heard calling from a swampy area centered on a slow-moving, shallow stream. They were seated ≤0.5 m above the ground on dead vegetation along the streambed. It is well protected within the national park. Outside the park, if it occurs there, its habitat is threatened by logging and agricultural expansion (especially oil palm plantations).

Background Falmouth was the son of George Boscawen, 3rd Viscount Falmouth and Elizabeth Anne, the only daughter of John Crewe, of Cheshire. He was educated at Eton College and served briefly as an Ensign in the Coldstream Guards. Career In the General Election of 1807, Falmouth was elected Member of Parliament for Truro, standing as a Tory on the day before his 20th birthday. On the death of his father the following year, he resigned both his seat and his commission and took up his place in the House of Lords. In 1821, on the coronation of George IV, he was created Earl of Falmouth. As a member of the Ultra-Tory faction, he was vehemently opposed to parliamentary reform and Catholic emancipation. In 1829 he acted as second to Lord Winchilsea in his famous duel with the Duke of Wellington over the latter issue. He always insisted that he persuaded Winchelsea to fire into the air, and he had certainly prepared an apology, which Wellington accepted. He was the last Recorder of Truro and the author of a pamphlet on the subject of stannary courts. Family Lord Falmouth was married to Anne Frances, elder daughter of Henry Bankes, of Kingston Lacy, Dorset on 27 August 1810. He died at Tregothnan in December 1841, aged 54, and was succeeded by his only son, George. Lady Falmouth lived at 3 Whitehall Gardens, Westminster, until her death in 1864. A philanthropist, she endowed almshouses at Brimpton and a village school at Woolhampton , both in Berkshire.

Listed are some agencies that do not authorize their peace officers to carry a firearm: Roosevelt Island Public Safety Department, New York City Department of Health and Hospitals Police, New York City Department of Homeless Services Police, City University of New York Public Safety Department, and New York City Parks Enforcement Patrol. Some private-sector public safety agencies allow their peace officers to carry a firearm only while working for said agencies and must be granted permission and licensed by the New York City Police Department (Pistol Licensing Section) in compliance with penal law 400.00: listed are a few agencies: Co-op City Department of Public Safety, Hunts Point Department of Public Safety, Spring Creek Towers Public Safety. Designation as a special patrolman is unique to New York City, it is granted by the New York City Police Commissioner under New York City Administrative Code §14-106 and Criminal Procedure Law §2.10(27), and are governed by protocols of Chapter 11 Title 38 of the Rules of the City of New York. Some special patrolman are issued a firearm license for on duly use only and must be in compliance with penal law 400.00 and the New York City Police Department ( pistol license section ) rules and regulations. Other Equipment The equipment carried by peace officers depends on their duties and their agency's discretion. Most uniformed peace officers carry a baton, can of pepper spray, pair of handcuffs, a whistle, a flashlight, and a portable radio. In addition, certain peace officer agencies allow their officers to carry other equipment, such as tasers. Peace officer agencies can allow/ban certain equipment carried by officers, for example, NYPD Auxiliary Police officers are only equipped with a baton, handcuffs, flashlight, and whistle, while NYPD School Safety Agents only carry handcuffs, a flashlight, and a whistle. Uniform Uniforms worn by peace officers differ from agency to agency. Most peace officers wear a uniform that has a dark blue shirt and dark blue pants with black boots or shoes. Another popular uniform worn by officers has a light blue shirt with dark blue pants with black boots or shoes. However, there are other colors and types of uniforms worn by officers, including grey, green, and black shirts and grey, green, and black pants. Also, most officers wear a hat when on duty. The hats worn by officers differ in shape, size, type, brand, and color, ranging from a traditional eight-point cap to stetsons to a baseball style cap. In addition, officers in certain specialized units in departments may wear a different style uniform compared to the uniform worn by patrol officers. A major piece of the peace officer uniform is the badge, which is usually worn on the left or right chest of the shirt or jacket. The shape and color of badges differ between rank and department. Training The amount and type of training given to peace officers differs between agencies. The Municipal Police Training Council (MPTC) prescribes a minimum of 700 hours of training for police officers in New York.https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/ops/training/bcpo/bcpo01.htm Peace officers, which are considered specialists in a particular type of crime or geographical area, require less training (180 hours) but are usually provided with agency-specific or mission-specific training by their employer. MPTC's Basic Course for Peace Officers is identical to the Basic Course for Police Officers minus the modules not relevant to the unique nature of the peace officer's employment.https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/ops/docs/training/pubs/basicpeace/peaceofctrainguide.pdf For example, MPTC does not require peace officers to receive training in responding to domestic violence, while police officers are required to receive such training.https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/ops/docs/training/pubs/basicpeace/peaceofctrainguide.pdf However, agencies are encouraged by MPTC to offer training that exceeds MPTC's minimum requirements, and many agencies do. All training courses for peace officers include training in criminal law, police science, authorities of peace officers, some physical training, laws of arrest, and defensive tactics. Peace officers authorized by their employer to carry firearms must complete the 47 hour firearms course required for all peace officers before they can carry their firearm, and must re-qualify yearly.

The type species, S. maortuensis, was originally named Chilantaisaurus maortuensis, but was re-described and reclassified in 2009. History The material referred to Shaochilong, IVPP V.2885.1-7, consisted of skull fragments (a braincase, partial skull roof, quadrates, and a right maxilla), axis and six caudal vertebrae. A fragmentary left maxilla was also referred to the species, although it has apparently gone missing as of 2009. Although these are believed to belong to a single individual, a lectotype was established in 2010 to accommodate for the possibility that the specimens came from multiple individuals. The lectotype consists of the braincase (IVPP V.2885.1) and partial skull roof (IVPP V.2885.2). All of these specimens were discovered in Inner Mongolia and described by Hu in 1964 as a species of Chilantaisaurus.Hu, S.-Y. (1964). \\"Carnosaurian remains from Alashan, Inner Mongolia.\\" Vertebrata PalAsiatica, 8: 42–63. [In Chinese, with English summary] The genus was informally named \\"Alashansaurus\\" by Chure in 2000. Chure (2002) and Rauhut (2001) suggested that it did not belong to that genus, and was probably a primitive coelurosaur.Glut, D. (2003). Dinosaurs - The Encyclopedia - Supplement 3. McFarland Press: Jefferson, NC. However, a re-description by Brusatte and colleagues in 2009 found that it was a carcharodontosaurid, the first recognized from Asia. This re-description also provided a new genus name. A more comprehensive description and discussion was published the following year.  Description  Size of Shaochilong compared to a human The individual which IVPP V2885.1 belonged to was probably adult or nearly adult individual, due to the fusion of many elements of the braincase. Shaochilong length – based on the length of the maxillary tooth row – is estimated at . Estimated length of the femur is 61.5 cm which suggests the whole animal weighted approximately . This made Shaochilong an uncharacteristically small carcharodontosaurid, in contrast with other members of the family, which were among the largest carnivorous animals on earth. Nevertheless, as an unambiguous example of a fairly large carnosaur in middle Cretaceous Asia, it provides information on the ecosystem of this setting and is evidence that carcharodontosaurids persisted through the middle cretaceous and that large tyrannosaurids (such as Tyrannosaurus) did not dominate Laurasia until the very end of the Cretaceous. According to the proportions of its maxilla, Shaochilong was a relatively short-faced carcharodontosaur. In combination with its comparatively small size, it could have had a unique ecological role in comparison to other members of the family. Shaochilong can be distinguished from other carcharodontosaurids due to having the following autapomorphies: * A reduced and nearly absent maxillary antorbital fossa. * No paradental groove on the medial surface of the maxilla. * Deep vertical grooves located dorsally on the maxillary interdental plates. * A pneumatic recess which penetrates to the posterior end of the nasal. * A deep sagittal crest on the frontal. * A large pneumatic foramen in the anterodorsal corner of the prootic's dorsal tympanic recess. Classification Phylogenetic analysis performed by Brusatte and coworkers indicate that Shaochilong is deeply nested within the carchorodontosaurids, the most derived group among the allosauroids. Shaochilong appears to be more closely related to the Gondwanan carcharodontosaurids (Tyrannotitan, Carcharodontosaurus, Mapusaurus, Giganotosaurus) than the Laurasian ones (such as Neovenator and Acrocanthosaurus). Shaochilong is the youngest known Laurasian allosauroid suggesting that basal tetanurans not tyrannosaurids, were still the dominant group of large-bodied theropods in Laurasian during the Mid-Cretaceous and that the rise of tyrannosaurids as the dominant group of large terrestrial predators was sudden and confined to the very end of the Cretaceous. The following cladogram after Novas et al., 2013, shows the position of Shaochilong within Carcharodontosauridae.

Pakistan Rugby Union then became an associate member of the IRB (International Rugby Board) in November 2003. Rugby has now been introduced at the Provincial and District level by the Pakistan Rugby Union. Schools have also been targeted for rugby to be introduced at the grass root level. History Rugby team in Karachi, 1934 Pakistani rugby goes as far back as 1926 when the Karachi Rugby Football Union was formed. retrieved 5 July 2009 The game though remained mainly an expatriate sport, with KRFU being active on the All-India circuit up till the late fifties. Records of teams containing Pakistani players exist going back to the 1950s, with an East Pakistan Rifles team beating Chittagong Rugby Club on 2 July 1955 at Niaz Stadium. Chittagong was made up from European players, while the Rifles were all Pakistani apart from their coach J.M. Reay. The sixties saw a decrease in the expatriate population and travel to India becoming more regulated, therefore the club became more reliant on playing fixtures with visiting British Navy Ships, at a time when Karachi had become a regular port of call for R&R; and supplies. In 1968–1969 a handful of local players were introduced into the club: this would prove to be the saving grace for the game in the country. By the mid seventies the British Navy reduced its presence in the Indian Ocean and port visits became infrequent, and by the early eighties Rugby had become almost non-existent. The Karachi Rugby Football Union continued to play, yet due to limited funds it was unable to travel abroad for matches and suffered from lack of opposing teams to play within the country. The interest in rugby was rejuvenated in the nineties by a combination of passion and commitment of the locals who had been introduced to the game in the seventies and resurgence in the expatriate presence. Whilst some experienced local players established clubs in Lahore and Karachi, staff from foreign embassies, commissions and banks, consisting of Frenchmen, British, and some Americans, established a club in Islamabad. 1992 onwards has seen regular fixtures between teams from these cities. By the mid-nineties an Islamabad club called the Islamabad Rugby Football Club, consisting mainly of local players had also been established in addition to the side made up of expatriates; the latter passes through phases of dormancy subject to postings and availability of players. Lahore Rugby Football Club which was formed around the same time became their main competitors. The three major clubs in Pakistan. Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi initiated an annual Pakistan 7s Championship on a rotating basis. National team The national team is called Pakistan Rugby. It was first fielded in 2003, participating in the Provincial Tournament in Sri Lanka and there played the Indian National side as well. Pakistan currently takes part in the regional divisions of the Asian Five Nations.

Life Berkeley was the son of George Berkeley, 8th Baron Berkeley (d. 1658), and his wife, Elizabeth Stanhope, daughter of Sir Michael Stanhope. Berkeley was a canon-commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, but did not take any degree. In 1654 he was elected Member of Parliament for Gloucestershire in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Gloucestershire in 1656 for the Second Protectorate Parliament. Berkeley succeeded to the barony in 1658, and was nominated in May 1660 as one of the commissioners to proceed to the Hague and invite Charles II to return to the kingdom. In the following November he was made keeper of the house gardens and parks of Nonsuch Palace, where the Duchess of Cleveland later lived. In 1661 Berkeley was placed on the council for foreign plantations. In 1663 he became a member of the Royal African Company on its formation (10 January), acquiring a share in the territory lying between the port of Salee in South Barbary and the Cape of Good Hope. In the same year he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He was made a privy councillor in 1677. In April 1678, he was made a member of the Board of Trade and plantations which had been established in 1668. On 11 September 1679 he was created Viscount Dursley and Earl of Berkeley. He was elected to the governorship of the Levant Company on 9 February 1680 and held the position for most, if not the whole, of his subsequent life. In May 1681 he was elected one of the masters of Trinity House. At this time he was a member of the East India Company. In February 1685 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Gloucestershire, and 21 July 1685 was sworn of the privy council. After the flight of James II, 11 December 1688, Berkeley was among the lords who assembled at Guildhall and declared themselves a provisional government. He was nominated as ambassador to Constantinople on 16 July 1698, but not wishing to go, petitioned parliament in May 1699 to be excused the office. Berkeley died after 1699, and was buried in the parish church of Cranford, Middlesex, where he had an estate. Works He published in 1668 a religious work entitled Historical Applications and Occasional Meditations upon several Subjects.

His jazz-based classical music has been performed both throughout the United States and abroad. Stires was born in Alexandria, Virginia, to a family of musicians. His maternal grandparents were the mezzo- soprano Louise Homer and the American art song composer Sidney Homer, while his cousin was the composer Samuel Barber. His paternal grandparents were Bishop Ernest Milmore Stires and Sarah Stires. He was educated first at the Episcopal High School in Alexandria and then at Harvard and Dartmouth, finally graduating from Trinity College in Connecticut. After service as a U.S. Navy pilot in World War II, Stires worked as a television advertising executive, first for NBC in California and then later for CBS in Boston. Although he had begun improvising jazz on the piano while still a small child, he did not devote himself to music as a career until 1962 when he studied composition with Nicolas Slonimsky and Francis Judd Cooke. Ernie has three children, Sarah Stires, Ernie Stires and Elizabeth Stires, all of whom share his love of music. He moved to Vermont in 1967 where he was an administrator for the Vermont Symphony Orchestra and the Bennington Composers Conference and one of the founding members of the Consortium of Vermont Composers. He also worked as a volunteer teaching basic music theory and composition to young musicians in his community. Amongst his students were Trey Anastasio, a member of the band Phish, film composer/guitarist John Kasiewicz, composer/sound-artist Rama Gottfried, and Jamie Masefield of the Jazz Mandolin Project. Stires' electric guitar concerto, Chat Rooms, was written expressly for Anastasio who premiered it in 2001 with the Vermont Youth Orchestra under Troy Peters, an event covered on national television.Paul Robicheau, Youth Orchestra Plays Phish, Rolling Stone, February 5, 2001 In 2004, his violin concerto was premiered at Carnegie Hall in New York in a performance by the Vermont Youth Orchestra with Ruotao Mao, first violinist of the Amabile Quartet, as the soloist.

Because the use of helicopters reduces the level of infrastructure required to log in a specific location, the method also helps to reduce the environmental impact of logging. It also can increase the productivity in these remote areas.  History  Standing Stem Harvesting, a selective harvesting method within Heli-Logging, was invented by Philip Jarman of Port Alberni, British Columbia between May and October 1997. The initial harvesting equipment used wire rope or chokers to rig the stem and a modified external hook to engage the choker and lift the stem clear of the stump. In this way, the process of harvesting, which includes climbing, measuring, cutting, rigging, and lifting was pioneered by a single pilot flying a light utility helicopter. In 1998, the inventor supervised the building of an experimental grapple which was to be operated by a K-Max Lift Truck helicopter. However, because the K-Max had no hydraulics, it was necessary to design and install an externally mounted, jettisonable sled carrying a hydraulic power pack, to operate the grapple. Initial flight trials were carried out using the external hook and wire rope configuration on the 25th of April 1998. In late October 1998, a successful full-scale harvesting trial using a grapple designed by the inventor and funded by the timber licensee was carried out at Lunchtime Lake on Vancouver Island. Press releases and logging industry recognition followed. Patent applications in the United States and Canada were submitted and granted in 2001 and 2002 respectively. In general, Heli-logging operations rarely use the light-weight, single-engine Kaman, and most operators will select one of three tested heavier twin-engine helicopter types: the 9000hp Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, the 3900hp MIL 8, and the 4400hp Kamov Ka-32.http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac805e/ac805e06.htm These three types are most suited to Heli-logging because of structural and systems designs, for example, their twin-engine layout, and dual hydraulic systems. Although the S-64 is an excellent and powerful machine, relatively few have been made, certainly less than 50 total. On the other hand, hundreds of Ka-32s have been built, and the MIL-8s number in the thousands. The Kamov Ka-32A11BC is used for Heli-logging in mountainous areas of western Canada because of its availability and the fact that it is certified in Canada and Europe for commercial operations.http://www.vih.com/Services/vihhelicopters.html  Process  Heli-Logging is also known as standing stem harvesting which is based on individual tree selection (ITS).Cleaver, D. 2001. Standing Stem Harvesting. The International Mountain Logging and 11th Pacific Northwest Skyline Symposium 2001, 280-284. The selection process is done by engineers and surveyors. The trees are selected based on demand for specific types and grades. Before the selection process is complete the selected trees are bored to check their reliability. The selected trees are then marked and their diameters are recorded. The diameter of the tree is measured at 1.3 meters above the ground. The sizes of the trees that are selected are controlled by two things. The minimum size is controlled by the economy while the maximum size is controlled by the capacity of the helicopter. Once the trees are selected they are climbed, the limbs are removed and the trees are topped. The length of the tree and the diameter at its top are then recorded. All the recorded data is then entered into a database which calculates volumes, weights, etc. The selected trees are then partially cut at the stem and supported by wooden wedges. The stem is then grappled by the helicopter and pulled until the wood breaks at the partial cut. The logged trees are then brought by helicopter to a predetermined roadside location or dropped into open water where they are collected.  Advantages  Heli-logging is efficient: a single S-64 Skycrane can extract 20 000 m3 (about 15,000 tonnes) of clean, undamaged timber per month.http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac805e/ac805e06.htm Conventional logging allows the stems to fall. On rocky terrains this often results in damage to the stems that makes them unusable. On steep terrains falling trees can slide downhill and become irretrievable. Heli-logging allows logging to take place in more remote places. It also allows certain trees to be logged that previously could not be due to their proximity to a structure or pipeline. Logging using helicopters is safer than conventional logging. Falling trees are dangerous for the loggers as well as for surrounding structures or utilities. Heli-logging also extends the logging season. This is due to the lack of snow load on a standing stem. Helicopter logging ground crews will cut, clean, and mark the trees before the helicopter starts to work. Ground crews may be able to prepare fewer than 6 trees per day, and the helicopter will only be needed every few days. Since fewer roads need to be built to the site where the logging is taking place, and trees are extracted vertically, there is reduced damage to the surrounding trees and ground surface.http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac805e/ac805e06.htm Research by Roberts, Ward and Rollerson done in 2004 shows that post-logging landslides are more common after conventional cable-based logging than heli-logging. Landslide rates following conventional logging are one and a half times more common than landslide rates following heli-logging.Roberts, B., Ward, B., & Rollerson, T. 2004. A comparison of landslide rates following helicopter and conventional cable-based clear-cut logging operations in the Southwest Coast Mountains of British Columbia. Geomorphology, 61, 337-346. Retrieved from Science Direct.  Disadvantages  Although there is no direct cost from road construction or expansion, heli-logging incurs high costs. Operation of a helicopter as well as the selection processes and methods increase the cost. The use of a helicopter to transport the stems limits the size and weight of the selected trees more than equipment would using conventional logging.

One is named Skaklia and the other one Borov Kamak. Skaklia () is the name of two different waterfalls in Bulgaria. The one near Vratsa is 130 metres high ( 141 metres according to other sources ) and is located 1.5 kilometres south of the town behind the Kaleto hill top . It is considered one of the highest waterfalls in Bulgaria and on the Balkan peninsula. Nevertheless, this remains a debatable question in Bulgaria until today, as this is a semi-active waterfall, not a constant one (not having constant flow of water) unlike the 124.5 metres high Raysko Praskalo (Heavenly Spray) also situated in Bulgaria. Water falls from the vertical Skaklia cliff when there is heavy raining or after the massive melting of snow at the end of winter or early spring, otherwise little water can be seen from farther distances. When active, however, the waterfall is easy to recognize from tourists standing many kilometres away from it, especially if they approach it from the north-west parts of Bulgaria. In the waterfall area a lot of remains from the ancient Bulgarian village Patleina have been found. Beautiful throughout the entire year it overlooks the town of Vratsa and the Vratsa lowlands. The waterfall is a summit spot of different goat routes. The Skaklia cliff itself is situated in a difficult to reach area and regardless of its clear visibility from the city, remains a difficult spot to reach by the majority of the tourists visiting Vratsa. Borov Kamak () or literally translated in English “Pine stone” is another beautiful waterfall that graces the mountainous outskirts of Vratsa . The waterfall is in Vratsa mountain, which is part of the famous Balkan mountain range. Borov Kamak is 63 metres high and is an affluent to the river Leva, running through the central parts of Vratsa. It is also part of the Vratsa Balkan Park, being one of the main tourist attractions and a much easier place to reach than Skaklia. The waterfall has been famous among tourists in the past couple of years due to the activities of the Vratsa Balkan Park officials and different tourist associations. Co-operating on making the waterfall more popular and easy to reach they create a tourist route that easily leads to its location. When people take the road leading up to the peaks of Vratsa mountain and after reaching a relatively high point of their travel, a turning to the left depicts one of the most beautiful sceneries of the Borov Kamak waterfall.

He is most well known for his significant contributions to the capture of John Wesley Hardin.Metz, Leon C. 1998. John Wesley Hardin: Dark Angel of Texas. University of Oklahoma Press. 337 p.Cox, Mike. 2008. The Texas Rangers: Wearing the Cinco Peso, 1821-1900. Tor/Forge. 496 p. Biography =Early life= Duncan was born and raised in a small farming community in Hardin County in north-central Kentucky. John 'Jack' Riley Duncan was born on September 25, 1850, his father, James, was 23 and his mother, Katherine, was 21. He and his brothers tended to the family's farm while his father served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. After the war, the family engaged in several business ventures in addition to farming that failed to prosper; young Duncan tried his hand at running a small saddler's shop. The family decided to move to Texas, ultimately settling in the vicinity of Dallas. By 1875 the Duncan family was well established in the bustling, frontier community, and Duncan and his father were employed as butchers while one of his brothers was in the land business. At that time Dallas was a rowdy city of 10 thousand people with a police force of about 10 or 11 officers. Duncan joined the police force in October 1876 and rapidly acquired the reputation as being an effective lawman. However, most of his duties were rather mundane, ranging from arresting drunks and minor criminals to controlling the city's large population of feral dogs. =\\"Got Wes Hardin\\"= The effort to bring the state's most infamous criminal—Wes Hardin—to justice intensified during this time. Because Hardin had considerable support from family and friends, the Texas Rangers' strategy involved collecting information through undercover detectives. Duncan was recruited into the Texas Rangers in July 1877 specifically to help track down Hardin by working undercover, gathering information in Gonzales County, TX, where both Hardin and his wife had considerable family. Duncan obtained information tracking Hardin to a rural community in southeastern Alabama, near the Florida border. Continuing his undercover work there, Duncan obtained more detailed information about Hardin's whereabouts; he was on a gambling spree in nearby Pensacola, FL. With the cooperation of local law officers, a railroad official, and a local judge, an ambush was set up in the smoking car of a train that Hardin and several of his friends had recently purchased tickets for. Although some of the local officers knew Hardin through his alias, only the Texas Rangers knew of his true identity. The ambush included Escambia County, FL, Sheriff William Henry Hutchinson, Deputy A. J. Perdue, some recently deputized citizens, and Texas Rangers Duncan and Lieutenant John Barclay Armstrong, who was in charge of the overall operation. All were located in strategic positions in and around the train, which was awaiting departure from the Pensacola station. Hardin was subdued after a melee, which most likely involved Hutchinson, Perdue, and perhaps another deputy initially, but was ended when Armstrong knocked Hardin unconscious with his revolver.Parsons, Chuck, Tobin Armstrong, and Elmer Kelton. 2007. John B. Armstrong: Texas Ranger and Pioneer Ranchman. Texas A&M; University Press. 150 p. Duncan was probably a late comer to the location of Hardin's capture because his post was outside the railroad car. One of Hardin's companions, Jim Mann, was killed while attempting to flee. It is uncertain who killed Mann as many shots were fired; some accounts stated that Armstrong fired the fatal shot. Guarded by Duncan and Armstrong, Hardin was transported by train back to Texas to stand trial; he served 17 years in prison for his crimes. =After the limelight= Duncan ended his service with the Texas Rangers after only four months. The most likely reason for this short tenure was the lucrative rewards that could be collected for capture of wanted criminals—being a bounty hunter.Miller, Rick. 1988. Bounty Hunter. College Station, TX: Creative Publishing Company. 255 p. Duncan's reasoning was no doubt supported by his share of the $4,000 reward paid for Hardin's capture. Duncan's activities as a bounty hunter brought him into contact with the rougher side of Dallas society—the saloons, brothels, and gambling establishments. It was a dangerous life, which resulted in Duncan being shot by a prostitute on February 9, 1878 under rather mysterious circumstances in a Dallas brothel. Duncan's recovery was slow as the doctor was unable to locate and remove the bullet. Later complications resulting from this gunshot lead to a tracheotomy being performed to save his life. He required an inserted silver breathing tube for the remainder of his life. The difficulty the tracheotomy caused to his breathing and voice was a millstone to his life, but he was still able to effectively function as a detective and bounty hunter. Duncan was successful as a bounty hunter. When Hardin's death in 1895 created a resurgence in interest in Duncan's career, he supplied a listing of all the \\"bad men\\" he had either captured or assisted in the capture of. The list included 21 names with a total in collected rewards of over $12,000; naturally, Hardin headed the list. However, changing times on the Texas frontier ultimately forced Duncan to seek more mundane forms of employment; later in life he worked as: Dallas Sanitation Inspector, general laborer, carpenter, hotel clerk, and as watchman for the Corps of Engineers. He married Emma Jane Bowles on October 20, 1884, in Dallas, Texas. They had four children in 13 years. On November 16, 1911 at the age of 61, Duncan lost control of his automobile (a Brush Runabout) on a rough road south of Dallas, and died from sustained injuries or perhaps the loss of his breathing tube. Duncan is buried in the historic Greenwood Cemetery in Dallas, TX.Find A Grave: John Riley Duncan. The epitaph on his tombstone reads: \\"Dallas Policeman, Texas Ranger, and Dallas Detective, Got Wes Hardin, August 23, 1877\\". His colorful life as a western lawman was documented in a book by Rick Miller. A manuscript of the book was provided to the Duncan family who still resides in Texas. However, no pictures of Duncan appear in Miller's book. There are no known pictures of Duncan, who refused to pose because he felt photographs might compromise his undercover activities. In the 1920s a silent black and white film was created of the accounts of the Hardin arrest, titled A Man and His Horse.

The upper storey of the store was usually accessed via a flight of steps on the outside of the building, usually at one of the gable ends, thus giving the building its name.  Description  Treppenspeicher are only relatively small buildings. They are witness to the craftsmanship of carpenters in the farming community. Their solid, wooden construction ensured that the interior stayed dry and they were so tightly planked that the stored produce was protected from mice. These stores used to be built within sight, but at a distance from the main farmhouse. This ensured that, if the farmhouse caught fire, the fire would not spread to the stores. Treppenspeicher were typical of the Lüneburg Heath. Here they remained in use until well into the 19th century. They increasingly disappeared however because they are no longer practical today. Nowadays the store rooms are normally part of the farmhouse itself. In former times there was at least one, but usually several, stores on each heath farm, serving all sorts of purposes. They were used to store grain, buckwheat, flax, cotton, linen, wool, honey, meat, bacon and clothes. They were often used as sleeping accommodation for the farmhands.

It was published by VOICE, an imprint of Hyperion (publisher). It debuted at number two on the New York Times Hardcover Fiction Bestseller list on June 20, 2009.  Setting  The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane takes place in Cambridge, Salem, and Marblehead, Massachusetts, flashing back and forth between two time periods: during the Salem witch trials in 1692, and the summer of 1991. The latter was one year before events in Danvers and Salem to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the trials and honor the innocent victims. Plot summary Harvard graduate student Connie Goodwin needs to spend her summer doing research for her doctoral dissertation. But when her mother asks her to handle the sale of Connie’s grandmother’s abandoned home near Salem, she can’t refuse. As Connie is drawn deeper into the mysteries of the family house, she discovers an ancient key within a seventeenth-century Bible. The key contains a yellowing fragment of parchment with a name written upon it: Deliverance (Hazeltine) Dane. This discovery launches Connie on a quest— to find out who this woman was and to unearth a rare artifact of singular power: a physick book, its pages a secret repository for lost knowledge. As she begins to discover the pieces of Deliverance’s harrowing story, Connie is haunted by visions of the long-ago witch trials. She begins to fear that she is more tied to Salem’s dark past than she could have ever imagined. Reception The book entered the New York Times Bestseller list at #2. Carolyn See in the Washington Post wrote, \\"This charming novel is both a tale of New England grad-student life in 1991 and the Salem witch hunts in 1692.

History The idea of recruiting more local Hong Kong Chinese for the defence of the colony began as early as 1936, with the number of Chinese sappers employed by the British increasing to 250. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in the following war, the British recruited 250 Hong Kong Chinese gunners to support British artillery units based in Hong Kong. By 1941, Chinese gunners and sappers were dispersed throughout the various units in Hong Kong. In November 1941, a month prior to the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong, the War Office agreed to form the Hong Kong Chinese Regiment, a battalion-sized military unit. Believing it was necessary to recruit a solid core of potential NCOs, and train them up using experienced officers and non- commissioned officers (NCOs) to the point where the regiment's first battalion could be built. The battalion was originally intended as a machine gun battalion similar to the 1st Middlesex Regiment, whose officers were providing the training cadre for the regiment. However, by the time the Battle of Hong Kong broke out, only a platoon-sized group had completed training. The majority of the initial high-quality recruits (mainly from the New Territories) were passed medically by Dr Scriven, and training was progressing well until interrupted by the Japanese attack. During the fighting, the HKCR was primarily used to guard military stores in Deep Water Bay, and also saw action at the ridge that resulted in a number of casualties. After the surrender, a number of HKCR recruits escaped to China and joined up with the British Army Aid Group or the Hong Kong Volunteer Company shortly after. Others became POWs, but, like all POWs considered to be 'local Chinese' by the Japanese, were released early, resulting in many of these highly motivated young men also crossing the border. As a percentage, it is probable that more HKCR men escaped, or evaded capture, and continued fighting than any other Hong Kong-based unit, thus proving the quality of the initial recruitment and selection.

Born an affranchi in Verrettes, Haiti, she married Brigade commander and later General Charles Bélair in 1796. She was an active participant in the Haitian Revolution, became a sergeant and later a lieutenant during the conflict with French troops of the Saint-Domingue expedition. Capture and execution Chased by Faustin Répussard's column of the French army, the Belairs took refuge in the Artibonite department. Répussard launched a surprise attack on Corail-Mirrault, and captured Sanité Bélair. Her husband turned himself over as well to avoid being separated from her. Both were sentenced to death, her spouse was to be executed by firing squad and she by decapitation because of her sex. She watched Bélair's execution, where he calmly asked her to die bravely, and went to her own execution as calm as he, refusing to wear a blindfold. It is said that at her capture, when threatened with beheading, she successfully asserted the right to an honorable soldier’s death by musketry, and standing before their muzzles cried “Viv libète! A ba esclavaj!” (“Long live freedom! Down with slavery!”) Legacy 2008 Haitian banknote featuring Sanité Bélair Sanité Bélair is considered as one of the heroes of the Haitian Revolution. In 2004, she was featured on the ten-gourd banknote of the Haitian gourde for the \\"Bicentennial of Haiti\\" Commemorative series. She was the only woman depicted in the series, and the second woman ever (after Catherine Flon) to be depicted on a Haitian banknote. References Further reading * Jomini, Antoine-Henri. (1842).
