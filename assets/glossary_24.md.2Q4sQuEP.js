This was a first in Switzerland, and skiers had to fasten themselves on with a large leather belt in order to go back up the mountain. In 1938, Villars was classified as one of the prime skiing resorts of Europe. On 13 December 1936, the Orient Express made a special stop in Aigle for a slalom race that took place at Bretaye.

It was published by WildStorm, an imprint of DC Comics. The Monarchy lasted 12 issues and had an intro-issue in The Authority #21. The series focused on ex-Stormwatch members Jackson King and Christine Trelane (formerly known as Battalion and Synergy) gathering a team of superheroes for the extra-dimensional Weavers. Synopsis During a party with the Authority, where King is increasingly annoyed with his former teammates and their methods, the Weavers contact King and inform him that the universe as they know it is threatened by Chimaera. To combat Chimaera, King and Trelane have to gather a group of unique individuals. King and Trelane accept, leave their jobs with the U.N. as liaisons to the Authority, get married and disappear. The U.N. orders FBI agent Morro to investigate their disappearance. Over the next few months King and Trelane gather resources; they resurrect the superhero Union, free the chaos-artist Condition Red from his imprisonment and enlist Professor Q. King and Trelane then enlist Jon Farmer, who had been a member of a previous, alternate version of the Monarchy called the Throne. Farmer had been living as a priest for years, but King and Trelane convince him to join them. King and Trelane then obtain essential weapons: a Kheran Dream Engine and an unrevealed weapon in exchange for the spirit of Hitler, who had possessed a politician. Their next recruit is Addie Vochs, a Century Baby whose powers had been repressed by the Fever Men, evil creatures of pure thought. Vochs is rejuvenated and receives her powers. King then investigates the former home of Henry Bendix, a genius and his former superior. He finds information on creating a powerful being by binding an ancient Native American god to the soul of a human. King follows the instructions, tying the spirit of Los Angeles to the failed superhero Bram Dusk, but the resulting creature turns on King and kills him. In the end, Dusk takes control and becomes the Metropolitan. Chimaera notices the threat of the Monarchy while the Monarchy find out what exactly Chimaera is: due to the Authority's frequent travels through the Bleed, their characteristics and aggression were imprinted on many worlds. Several alternate versions of the Authority band together and conquer other worlds, forming Chimaera, an ever-expanding empire of evil Authorities led by the Higher Power, a reptilian version of the Authority. Chimaera attacks the Throne, the base of the Monarchy. The Monarchy manages to escape thanks to Jon Farmer’s sacrifice. Trelane leads her people towards a sanatorium where Malcolm King, Jackson's younger brother, is staying. Agent Morro is questioning Malcolm, but finds Malcolm has the Kheran Dream Engine and is a member of the Monarchy. Morro suddenly starts to remember a hidden program Jackson King put in his mind: he's King's backup and has King's plans telepathically planted inside his mind. Christine arrives and greets Malcolm, while Addie Vochs calms Morro. The Monarchy regroups and opens their attack on Chimaera following the plans Jackson left in Morro's head. Elsewhere Bendix, now allied with the Weavers, finds the spirit of Jackson King and resurrects him as a being of pure willpower. King contacts the essence of Farmer and shapes it into a sword. Bendix also reveals the secret weapon they received in return for the spirit of Hitler: Fenris, the mythological wolf of Norse myth. King, Bendix and Fenris attack Chimaera as well. Together they defeat the troops of Chimaera and Trelane leads Malcolm and Addie Vochs to combine their powers, curing Chimaera's corrupted center. Trelane recruits a young boy named Matt who has the power to create superhumans and takes the Monarchy to the Throne, a mobile world and their new headquarters. Jackson King appears in the Authority: Human on the Inside graphic novel, which takes place after the events of The Monarchy series, and appears to be alive in human form and not the being of pure willpower that he was at the end of The Monarchy series. In Stormwatch: P.H.D. #5, it is hinted that the events of The Monarchy were a drug-induced hallucination experienced by King that was caused by the Doctor. In the issue King says, \\"At that party on the Carrier, he dosed my drink with LSD or something. I felt like I was tripping for a year.\\" Reception A reviewer of Bullets Over Babylon, a trade paperback of the book's first five issues, noted: > \\"I was never a fan of the Authority.

Former leader of Stormwatch as Battalion, Jackson became the U.N. liaison to the Authority after Stormwatch disbanded. He grew more and more displeased with the Authority and accepted the Weaver's assignment. He now leads the Monarchy. * Christine Trelane: formerly the Stormwatch member Synergy, Christine possesses the rare and valuable power of \\"Activation\\", allowing her to turn ordinary humans into superhumans. She is married to Jackson King and her intelligence and organisation skills make her as much the leader of the Monarchy as Jackson is. * Jon Farmer: formerly the youngest member of the Throne, a previous version of the Monarchy until it was destroyed by an alternate version of Abraham Dusk. The Throne's version of Jackson King threw Farmer into the Bleed before detonating their base, leaving Farmer as the sole survivor. Farmer arrived on Earth in 1967 and had a brief career as a superhero before becoming a priest. Farmer had the ability to manipulate light and superluminal projection for flight and other effects, but his being jettisoned into the bleed changed his powers into a rainbow-colored energy dealing in the electromagnetic spectrum. Enabling its use for various effects, capable of superhuman physicality, dimensional porting, aviation under his own power and later; vast reality warping. * Union: Ohmen, an alien from the planet Agea, became Union, a veteran superhero in the Wildstorm Universe. He served with Stormwatch as a reserve member and had a long career as a solo hero. During the party on the Authority's Carrier, Union committed suicide. Jackson then took his Justice Stone and resurrected Union, now as a dark and brooding man who was focused more on punishing the guilty than saving the innocent. Union's powers are the result of the Justice Stone implanted in his chest. It allows him to generate objects made from energy, like his fighting staff, gives him superhuman strength, durability and flight. * Condition Red: Caleb was a trickster, imprisoned and tortured by his enemy Doctor Osiris for sleeping with his daughters. King and Trelane freed him and in return he joined the Monarchy. Condition Red reveals little about himself, acting glibly towards everyone. He has special weaponry that is capable of removing spirits from a person's body as well as more conventional weaponry. He also possesses a special device, looking like a vial of smoke that allows him to teleport. * Professor Q: nicknamed the \\"Calculator Goddess\\", she has superhuman intelligence and seems to enjoy herself the most when she is fighting. She can generate machinery as quickly as she can invent it and was able to invent and generate a singularity generator in picoseconds. She develops a romantic interest in Malcolm King. * Vox Populi: Addie Vochs is a Century Baby born one year later than the others. Addie's powers were locked away for most of her life and when Trelane and Professor Q visit her she is an old woman. Trelane rejuvenates her and awakens her powers Addie Vochs becomes Vox Populi, capable of using her voice for various effects ranging from destructive songs to calming tunes. * The Metropolitan: Abraham Dusk received superpowers when he was hit by lightning. As “the Last Angel”, he was a superhero with superhuman speed and agility, but was a failure both as a hero and in his private life. King decides to give him a chance at more power and bonds his soul to Chichinika, the snake god of Los Angeles. The resulting creature kills King, but with Farmer and Condition Red’s help, Bram manages to take control and becomes the Metropolitan. As the Metropolitan, Bram can adapt to whatever is thrown at him, constantly changing his abilities to remain unpredictable. * Malcolm King: brother to Jackson King and the former Stormwatch member Strafe, Malcolm was put into a sanatorium when his brother's telepathy put him into a coma. When Agent Morro tries to find out more about Jackson King, Malcolm reveals that he has merged with the Kheran Dream Engine and is a member of the Monarchy. Christine Trelane dubs Malcolm Bellerophon. * Fenris: the secret weapon of the Monarchy is the mythological wolf from Norse myth that will swallow the sun at Ragnarok. Traded for the spirit of Hitler with some mysterious entities, the Monarchy receives Fenris as a little wolf, but after a few months it has grown to the size of a large building. Fenris doesn't seem to be more intelligent than a regular wolf and obeys King's commands. He seems to be little more than a living weapon of mass destruction. * Matt: gifted with the ability to give superhuman powers to regular humans as well as possessing enormous destructive powers himself, Matt is saved by Jon Farmer when his powers make him release an enormous explosion. He is the first recruit of the Monarchy after they defeat Chimaera. Allies *The Weavers: Souls of dead humans who have the task of safeguarding the multiverse. They often appear as spiders or human-spider hybrids. They give information to the humans they work with, but don't act themselves in any way. *Henry Bendix: An alternate universe version of the former Stormwatch Weatherman, he secretly replaced his Wildstorm Universe counterpart shortly after the reorganization of Stormwatch. His actions eventually lead his teammates to assume that he is insane, which in turn leads him to eventually be killed by Jenny Sparks. Bendix reveals that this was just a plot to turn into an imaginary being made out of pure willpower. As an imaginary being, he has nicknamed himself Happy Hank Bendix and acts like a completely different man than before. Bendix is a genius and uses weapons of his own design to help the Weavers in their task. *Agent Morro: An FBI agent tasked with finding King and Trelane, Morro turns out to be a vital part of King's plan.

Mateo finished his first year with the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles with him playing in 19 matches, scoring 2 tries and kicking 5 goals in the 2015 NRL season. 2016 On 1 February 2016, Mateo was named in the Sea Eagles 2016 Auckland Nines squad. On 7 May 2016, Mateo returned to International football, playing for Tonga against Samoa in the 2016 Polynesian Cup where he played at five-eighth in the 18–6 loss at Parramatta Stadium. On 22 July 2016, Mateo signed with the Salford Red Devils with immediate effect and was released from his contract with Manly. Mateo played in 3 matches for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the 2016 NRL season. 2017 Mateo was granted a release by Salford prior to the start of the 2017 season, with the team incorrectly spelling his name as 'Feliti' in the press release announcing his departure. In an attempt to revive his playing career, Mateo signed on with the Hills District Bulls in the Ron Massey Cup at the start of 2017, named as their starting in Round 1. On 28 August, Mateo was named in The 2017 Ron Massey Cup team of the year. On 30 September 2017, Mateo was one of the retired players listed to be honored before the start of the 2017 nrl grand final. Personal life Mateo is eligible to represent England through his English mother, while also playing for London Broncos he obtained a British passport.

Job production consists of an operator or group of operators to work on a single job and complete it before proceeding to the next similar or different job.Production Process, Mechanical Engineering Community & Discussion, retrieved 2018-04-13. Together with batch production and mass production (flow production) it is one of the three main production methods.Production Methods, BBC GCSE Bitesize, retrieved 2012-10-26.One-off production, National Grid for Learning Cymru, retrieved: 2012-10-26. Job production can be classical craft production by small firms (making railings for a specific house, building/repairing a computer for a specific customer, making flower arrangements for a specific wedding etc.), but large firms use job production, too, and the products of job production are often interchangeable, such as machined parts made by a job shop. Examples include: * Designing and implementing an advertising campaign * Auditing the accounts of a large public limited company * Building a new factory * Installing machinery in a factory * Machining a batch of parts per a CAD drawing supplied by a customer * Building the Golden Gate bridge Fabrication shops and machine shops whose work is primarily of the job production type are often called job shops. The associated people or corporations are sometimes called jobbers. Job production is, in essence, manufacturing on a contract basis, and thus it forms a subset of the larger field of contract manufacturing. But the latter field also includes, in addition to jobbing, a higher level of outsourcing in which a product-line-owning company entrusts its entire production to a contractor, rather than just outsourcing parts of it. Benefits and Disadvantages Key benefits of job production include: * can provide emergency parts or services, such as quickly making a machine part that would take a long time to acquire otherwise * can provide parts or services for machinery or systems that are otherwise not available, as when the original supplier no longer supports the product or goes out of business (orphaned) * work is generally of a high quality * a high level of customization is possible to meet the customer's exact requirements * significant flexibility is possible, especially when compared to mass production * workers can be easily motivated due to the skilled nature of the work they are performing Disadvantages include: * higher cost of production * re-engineering: sometimes engineering drawings or an engineering assessment, including calculations or specifications, needs to be made before the work can be done * requires the use of specialist labor (compared with the repetitive, low-skilled jobs in mass production) * slow compared to other methods (batch production and mass production) Essential features There are a number of features that should be implemented in a job production environment, they include: * Clear definitions of objectives should be set. * Clearly outlined decision making process. * Clear list of specifications should be set.

He studied physics in Vienna and received his doctorate in 1925, under Hans Thirring. He worked in Leipzig in 1928 as an assistant to Werner Heisenberg. A combination of the troubled political climate of Europe in the 1930s, his own restlessness, and the Nazi persecutions in Germany, made the Jewish-born Beck a traveler in those years. Until 1935 he worked in Cambridge with Ernest Rutherford, Copenhagen, Prague, United States and Japan. In 1935, Beck was invited to work in the Soviet Union by Head of the Institute of Physics, Odessa University Yelpidifor Anempodistovich Kirillov. At the Odessa University Beck was head of the Department of Theoretical Physics and gave a course of theoretical physics in German; his lectures were simultaneously translated into Ukrainian by his assistant Yu.G. Vekshtein. In 1936–1937 Beck was head of the department of theoretical mechanics at the Institute of Water Transport Engineers in Odessa. Four of his Odessa students — VV Malyarov, MM Alperin, GV Skrotskii and PE Nemirovsky — became professors in Odessa and Moscow. In 1937, Guido Beck moved to France, where he was imprisoned when World War II broke out. In 1941, he fled to Portugal. From 1942 to 1943 he was a guest professor at the University of Coimbra and the University of Oporto. In 1943 he emigrated to Argentina. In Argentina, he was instrumental in training several Argentinian physicists, including José Antonio Balseiro, and had a profound impact in developing physics in Argentina. He moved once more, this time to Brazil, in 1951, where his influence in developing physics was also great. He was called back to Argentina in 1962, after the death of Balseiro, and continued his work at the Instituto Balseiro. In 1975, he returned to Brazil, and worked in the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas (CBPF). Apart from his influence as a teacher in South America he contributed to a theory of beta-decay, abstract which was later superseded by a more complete theory by Fermi. He was a friend of the famous writer Ernesto Sabato. He died in a car accident in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. Honours *In 1977, he was given the doctoral degree of honour by the Darmstadt University of Technology, Germany for his exemplary activity as an academic teacher and his relentless efforts in establishing research institutions in physics.

Invented by Extreme Networks and submitted to IETF as RFC3619. The idea is to provide highly available Ethernet switched rings (commonly used in Metro Ethernet) to replace legacy TDM based transport protection fiber rings. Other implementations include Ethernet Protection Switching Ring (EPSR) by Allied Telesis which enhanced EAPS to provide full protected transport of IP Triple Play services (voice, video and internet traffic) for xDSL/FTTx deployments. EAPS/EPSR is the most widely deployed Ethernet protection switching solution deployed with major multi-vendor inter-operability support. The EAPS/EPSR are the basis of the ITU G.8032 Ethernet Protection recommendation.  Operation  A ring is formed by configuring a Domain. Each domain has a single \\"master node\\" and many \\"transit nodes\\". Each node will have a primary port and a secondary port, both known to be able to send control traffic to the master node. Under normal operation, the secondary port on the master is blocked for all protected vlans. When there is a link down situation, the devices that detect the failure send a control message to the master, and the master will then unblock the secondary port and instruct the transits to flush their forwarding databases. The next packets sent by the network can then be flooded and learned out of the (now enabled) secondary port without any network disruption. Fail-over times are demonstrably in the region of 50ms. The same switch can belong to multiple domains and thus multiple rings. However, these act as independent entities and can be controlled individually.  EAPS v2  EAPSv2 is configured and enabled to avoid the potential of super-loops in environments where multiple EAPS domains share a common link. EAPSv2 works using the concept of a controller and partner mechanism. Shared port status is verified using health PDUs exchanged by controller and partner. When a shared link goes down, the configured Controller will open only one segment port for each of the protected VLANs, keeping all other segment ports in a blocking state. This state is maintained as long as the Controller fails to receive the health PDUs over the (broken) shared link. Although not supported by Extreme Networks, it is possible to complete this shared link with non-EAPS (but tag- aware) switches between the Controller and Partner. When the shared link is restored, the Controller can then unblock its ports, the masters will see their hello packets, and the rings will be protected by their respective masters.

Early life  Vasilis Papakonstantinou was born in Vastas, outside of Megalopolis, Arcadia. In 1957 he moved to Athens along with his family. He has fifteen siblings. His adolescence was marked by the musical and social trends of the 1960s: Mikis Theodorakis, protest rock, international peace and liberation movements, while Greece was trying to quickly heal the wounds of the Greek Civil War. According to some interpretations, the Left sought to shelter itself and give a perspective to the shattered disappointment following the civil war by providing a sensitive and claiming culture. Vasilis Papakonstantinou became a follower of the left without ever becoming a member of a leftist party. In 1973, after having served in the Hellenic Army, fulfilling his national service obligations, he moved to West Germany and settled in Munich. There he participated in anti- dictatorship organisations, campaigning against the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 and singing in places with a considerable Greek student and immigrant population.  Career  His first musical encounter was with Mikis Theodorakis in the summer of 1974, in Paris—their collaboration commenced two years later. In 1974, Vasilis returned to Greece following the fall of the dictatorship and embarked on a professional singing career, singing in clubs, and also recorded a 45 rpm gramophone record. That same year he collaborated on the recording of \\"Ta Tragoudia tou Dromou\\" (Road Songs) by Manos Loïzos. In 1975, he recorded \\"Ta Agrotika\\" (Rural Songs) by Thomas Bakalako and met with two composers with whom he was going to work closely for many years: Manos Loïzos and Thanos Mikroutsikos, two composers that were bearing a fresh new sound to Greek music. Both of them promoted in new manners the songs of the big city without following faithfully the traces of popular or artistic music of earlier famous composers. Papakonstantinou's interpretation was ideal in expressing their dynamism and expressiveness. In 1976 his much anticipated collaboration with Mikis Theodorakis took place in the recording of \\"Tis Exorias\\" (Songs of Exile), and in 1978 the composer included Vassilis in the singers who took part in his international tour of Europe, the Americas and Australia. At home Papakonstantinou actively took part in youth and worker movement rallies, singing at strikes, meetings, anti-racist and anti-fascist concerts. From that time on, just before the 1980s, Papakonstantinou began demonstrating influences from the international rock movement. He performed songs which had an obviously more thick sound and more acute and intervening lyrics. This trend appeared gradually in the two records that he recorded in the early 1980s; the first one was titled after his name and included songs written by Antonis Vardis and adaptations of songs written by Dionysis Savvopoulos, Mikis Theodorakis and Luis Lach. The second one \\"Fovame\\" (I fear) with songs composed by Manos Loïzos, Lakis Papadopoulos, Giannis Zouganelis and Giannis Glezos consolidated his profile from that time up to date. He met Nikolas Asimos and took part in his first record \\"Xanapes\\" (Say it again) by singing two songs. Assimos became the second person after Loizos, who influenced him a lot with his peculiar personality. In 1984 with his record \\"Dieresi\\" (Division) his new sound was finally established. In 1987 he reconfirmed it in \\"Heretismata\\" (Greetings) including songs by Nikolas Asimos, Aphrodite Manou, and Christos Tolios and by the mid-1980s Vassilis Papakonstantinou was considered one of Greeces most popular concert performers.Flessas, Yiannis (2007) . \\"Vasilis Papakonstantinou\\" (Seaburn, 2007) . In April 1985, a 16,000 audience attended his first major personal concert at the Peace and Friendship Stadium and again in June 1988 at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium on Alexandras Avenue. Vasilis, never received any support from the media; even though his era was eroting away as many suggested 8 years ago, however in the 19th festival of EDON (new democratic youth of CYPRUS- or as many would suggest the Communist youth) Vasilis managed to attract a 20,000 tickets-sold out audience, many managed to enter the concert by jumping over the walls and fences rasing the sum of those who attended to around 23,000. Making it probably the biggest sold out concert ever made on the island. He united three generations of fans including a strong following of \\"educated\\" adolescent fans. At the end of the 1980s, he interpreted \\"difficult\\" songs with lyrics written by Kostas Tripolitis and music by Thanos Mikroutsikos. In between he sang \\"Chorevo\\" (I am Dancing) and in the new decade he sang for the second time after 1978 in \\"Stavros tou Notou\\" (Southern Cross) songs by Nikos Kavvadias and Thanos Mikroutsikos. Although his songs of the last years follow the sound of \\"popular\\" culture he hasn't hesitated to record LP albums on the verses of two of the most celebrated Greek poets. In 1984 he sang poetry by Kostas Karyotakis in a record named after the poet, and in 1993 \\"Fissai\\" (It is Blowing) had verses by Tassos Livaditis and music by Giorgos Tsegaris. He interpreted Nikolas Asimos again in 1992 in \\"Falimento tou Kosmou\\" (The end of the World) and in the last decade he made \\"Sfedona\\" (Sling). In 1995 he made \\"The Shikoni\\" (Impossible) cooperating with Alkis Alkeos, Christophoros Krokides, Vassilis Giannopoulos, Stamatis Mesimeris, Aphrodite Manou, Odysseas Ioannou and Minos Matsas. The last record that hit the market in April 1997 under the title \\"Pes mou ena Psemma gia na Apokimitho\\" (Tell me a Lie to Sleep), included songs of Nikolas Asimos, Apostolos Boulassikis (making his first appearance), Stamatis Messimeris, Giannis Ioannou, Vassilis Gianopoulos, Christophoros Krokides, as well as the song, \\"Malista Kyrie\\" (Yes Sir) by Giorgos Zampetas and Alekos Kagiantas.

A minor number of Maseed lineages are settled in the Logar Province of Afghanistan, especially in Charkh District, Baraki barak and Muhammad Agha, but also in Wardak, Ghazni and Kunduz Provinces. The Maseeds inhabit the center and north of South Waziristan valley, surrounded on three sides by the Darweshkhel Wazirs, and being shut off by the Bettanis on the east from the Derajat and Bannu districts. Two Pashtun tribes, the Ahmadzai Wazirs and the Maseeds, inhabit and dominate South Waziristan. Within the heart of Maseed territory in South Waziristan lies the influential Ormur (Burki) tribe's stronghold of Kaniguram. The Ormurs are considered by other tribes of South Waziristan to be close brethren of the Maseeds due to marital and other ties and the fact that the Ormurs have lived in and controlled Kaniguram for over a thousand years. There are also some Maseeds living in the UAE, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Maseeds usually pronounce their name Māsīd. They are divided into three great clans or subtribes, namely Alizai, Bahlolzai, and Shamankhel. Maseeds usually call these Drei Māsīd, meaning the \\"Three Maseeds\\"(DREZE). Each tribe has his own Khan. In the words of Sir Olaf Caroe, who acted as the former governor of the British Indian Frontier, \\"The Maseed tribe are a people who can never even think of submitting to a foreign power.\\" From 1860 to 1937, the English forces repeatedly attacked Maseed positions, but never got a foothold in the area. History The Maseeds originally lived in the centre of waziristan area of FATA. In the later 14th century, they migrated eastwards, and fell into dispute with the Bannuchi and Khattak tribes settled in the Shawal area. The Maseeds and the Wazirs succeeded to defeat the Khattaks and pushed them northeastwards towards Bannu and Kohat. Eventually, the Mahsuds settled at the center of Waziristan, in the Makeen, Kaniguram and Lada area. During the British colonial period, the Maseeds were invaded several times by the British Empire, in 1860, 1881, 1894–95, 1900–01, 1919–20 and in 1925's Pink's War. Primary locations South Waziristan, Mahsud inhabited Area. The Maseed tribe inhabits a large portion of the center of Waziristan, which is drained by the Tank Zam and Shahur Rivers. The Maseed territory is a rough triangle between Jandola, the hills north of Razmak, and from Shuidar to Janimela, north of Wana. No portion of their territory touches the \\"settled\\" districts, and the tribe is surrounded on the north and west by the Wazirs, on the east by the Bhittanis, and on the south by the Wazirs and Shranis. With the exception of a few Shabi Khel in the Bannu District, some land near Gumal in the Tank Tehsil, and the colonies at Chark and elsewhere in the Logar Valley in Afghanistan, none of the Maseed own land outside of South Waziristan Agency. To escape the severe cold in the higher hills during the winter, a large number move down to the lower valleys but always keep within the Maseed territorial limits. Many of these people live in caves or tents. \\"South Waziristan is mountainous with several high peaks; Pirghal, for example, being 11,600 feet. The Gomal is the main river, in addition to which there are many hill torrents, which…remain dry for most of the year.\\" The mountains and valleys geographically isolate the Maseed from large scale movements of invaders and provide excellent opportunities to conduct effective ambushes on enemies. The cave villages along the Shahur River near Barwand and along the Split Toi provide excellent hiding places and defensive positions.  Culture  It is a tribal society having its own subculture. Nearly all Mehsud follow Islamic traditions, celebrate the same holidays, dress the same, consume the same food, listen to the same music and are multi-lingual to a certain extent.In the southern and eastern region, the Mehsud live in accordance with the Pashtun culture and are usually bilingual in maseedwola also known as maseedo. Migratory patterns Many Maseed inhabit in the lower valleys during the winter. They return to family compounds at higher elevations during the summer.

Recent history Mahsud Tribal Family hierarchical tree Souvenir presented by British Officers who took part in Waziristan operation of 1937 depicting Tribal Marksman in an ambush against invading British Indian Forces. On many occasions the Afghan throne was saved with the help of the Maseed (like general Ramzan Khan Maseed Shamankhel, Shabaram Khan Machikhel, Bakhan Maseed, Mosa Khan Maseed, Miajee Maseed, Jagar Maseed etc.), Burki/Baraki, and Wazirs from Waziristan, Pakistan. Of those who fought during this time, most came back to their homeland, but those who stayed were given high ranks of office, such as Faiz Muhammad Maseed, who was appointed as an interior minister during the Reign of Daud Khan in the 1970s. Today the majority of Maseeds are still in Logar Province, with the title of Waziri, but by caste, they are Maseeds. The majority of these are with a sub-caste of Malik Denai, Dramankel, Faridi, Shamirai شمیرائی, Shabi khel, etc. When the Soviet–Afghan War started, some of these families came back to Waziristan but could not stay there, so they moved to cities like Peshawar and Karachi. Some of them stayed in waziristan and D.I. Khan. The Maseed helped to defeat the British invading troops and saved Afghanistan, they contributed a lot because Afghanistan was nearly in the hands of British. > John Ayde described the Maseeds: They are poor but brave… and although > turbulent and difficult to deal with, still have a great love of their > country and cherish their independence, possessing qualities that we admire > ourselves, and which deserve consideration and respect.

This attack demoralized the British and made them fearful of the Maseeds. Survivors of this attack reported that the sight of the Maseed tribesmen charging at them (with loud roars and wearing long hair and beards like Lions) affected them mentally. In 1860, three thousand Maseed tribesmen attacked the British regiment base in Tank (present South Waziristan). The British struggled to defeat them. In 1897, Mujahed tribesmen again stood up against the British all the way from Quetta kakar, and the British experienced difficulty when engaging them. It was during this time that the name of Mulla Powinda [Jagar Draman Khil][Miajee] [Laly Malik Denai] [Mulla ShaSaleem kaka] emerged. Powindah comes from the Pashto language, meaning \\"nomad\\". Day after day, Mulla Powinda grew more popular and famous.and his right hand mulla shasaleem kaka machikhel popular of all wazir, Maseed trib. He emerged as a legendary figure among the people of the region and beyond. There was even a time the British considered him to be the sole leader of the Waziristan country. His followers would sporadically kill individual British officers. However, the British were not able to capture the attackers, who would return to their mountain hideouts. All attempts to stop these attacks were unsuccessful. In 1907, the Wazir and Maseed tribesmen were blocked from entry into any government-controlled territory. Economic sanctions were imposed, blocking even basic amenities, such as food and medicine. The British commander of that time blockaded the areas of Makin and Kaniguram. Various areas were searched to arrest Mulla Powinda without success. The British thought that the tribesmen were receiving weapons by sea, from the coast of Balochistan and responded by creating check posts, but no weapons were confiscated. Mulla Powindah died in 1913. It could be said that he was the crownless emperor of one of the most fearsome of the Pashtun Tribes, the Maseeds. Upon his death, his son Shah Fazal Din was given leadership and his son-in-law, Mulla Abdul Hakeem kakar, was appointed his adviser. They have good relations with Amir Abdul Rahman Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan. When World War I started in 1915, the British were concerned that they would be engaged in battle on more than one front. This was a threat to their safety and economy, so they decided to close those fronts of lesser significance. They abandoned their ‘Forward Policy’ for the time being and sent a message of friendship and peace to the tribes. The tribes did not trust the British, and rejected these peace proposals. Instead, the Maseed assembled a militia to attack the British. By this time, the British had established an air force in the subcontinent, which was used to harass the tribesmen, and as a result the tribe's hatred of the British increased. As a result of their suffering they were bent upon taking revenge, and hence their morale increased. A series of attacks were made by the Maseeds, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The attack on the Marhatta Regiment resulted in the deaths of hundreds of sepoys and five British Officers. In the attack on the Punjab Regiment, the Maseed warriors slaughtered everyone. The aerial bombardments had inflicted significant losses on the tribesmen, but they were content that they were also doing well and had killed around 250 of the enemy forces. After the end of World War I, the British returned to Waziristan. This time, they built roads and forts throughout the land. The sophistication and constant patrols of the British Air Force helped create a secure atmosphere for their ground troops. With this sense of security, the British Army constructed a road from Jandola to Ladha. At Razmak, they constructed a cantonment for their army officers and soldiers. By 1922-23, all the British forces had moved from Wana to Razmak. They had constructed an airport there and instead of flying all the way from India, their aircraft would fly from Razmak Airport and bomb the countryside. Because of this, the countryside of Makin was totally devastated. The Maseed deemed it appropriate at this time to agree to a ceasefire because this new British tactic was inflicting widespread losses on their side. The ceasefire, they imagined, would also enable them to devise a strategy for countering the latest British advances. In 1925, the Royal Air Force successfully put down a Maseed rebellion by strafing the tribes' mountain strongholds. The action, which came to be known as Pink's War led to the tribal leaders seeking peace terms. In 1927 Ghazi Ramadan Khan Mahsud attacked Wana camp with a huge lashkar (tribal militia). The result was a big loss for the British army. In 1928 Ghazi Ramadan Khan Mahsud re-assembled his lashkar again for his next attack, on Sararogha Fort. This time he attacked with a powerful force, killed all of the defending soldiers (numbering 300) and took hold of the Fort. Lashkar invasion of Kashmir Immediately after Pakistan came into existence, Maseeds raised a tribal militia under Gaideen Khan Abdullai which entered Kashmir to help the newly created state Pakistan to capture Kashmir. They quickly reached Baramulla town, instead of pressing on to the capital, Srinagar, to seize Kashmir completely. A large number of tribals from Pakistan attacked Kashmir under the code name \\"Operation Gulmarg\\" to seize Kashmir. The invading tribals started moving along Rawalpindi-Murree-Muzaffarabad-Baramulla Road on 22 October 1947 with Muzaffarabad fell on 24 October 1947. They reached and captured Baramulla on 25 October. Culture Pir Roshan is the first person who founded the Pashto alphabet. He was born in Kanygram of Waziristan.

He was a close ally of Robert Mugabe within ZANU-PF and served as Minister for Gender, Youth and Employment from 2000 having previously been a provincial governor. Gezi was brought up in Mvurwi and attended Holy Rosary Secondary School. He first worked as an accounts clerk for the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority before being elected to the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe for Muzarabani in the 1990 elections. In 1993 he was elected as ZANU-PF chairman for Mashonaland Central, and the government appointed him Provincial Governor from 1996. At the 2000 parliamentary election, Gezi was in charge of recruiting and organising groups of young ZANU-PF supporters into a militia. The militia groups he led were implicated in violent attacks on supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change, and in invasions of white-owned farms. At a special ZANU-PF congress later that year, Gezi was appointed Secretary for the Commissariat, with responsibility for organizing Robert Mugabe's re- election as President two years later. Gezi won the Bindura seat at the 2000 election and was appointed as Minister for Gender, Youth and Employment. He was identified as a close ally of Robert Mugabe who had the potential to hold high office in the future. However, he was killed when his Mercedes-Benz E-Class W210 skidded off the Harare-Masvingo road after bursting a tyre and crashed into numerous Eucalyptus trees on 28 April 2001.

It was developed in the 1950s and issued for general service from 1966 to 1986, when it was replaced by the S10. Currently, the S6 is not used by the British military. It's usually worn in conjunction with the NBC No. 1 Mk III CBRN protective suit. History The S6 was developed by the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment (CDEE) from the 1950s and manufactured by Avon Rubber in Melksham, Wiltshire and the Birmingham & Leyland Rubber Company. Although made obsolete by the introduction of the S10, production of the S6 continued in Turkey after the adoption of the new mask by British forces. During the widely documented Iranian Embassy Siege of 1980, the S6 is the mask seen being worn by SAS troops. The Turkish military adopted its own version of the S6 in 1990 with the name SR10 under license by MKEK. SR10 and its newer version the SR10-ST with a D12 drinking tube attached. Design The S6 respirator provided protection to the face, eyes, lung and throat of the wearer against all known chemical agents of that time. The S6 features an innovative air seal around the inside of the face piece to improve the fit and comfort of the mask; a tap inside the nose cup was to allow the equalisation of pressure inside the air seal, in different climatic conditions. The wearer's natural body heat would then warm the trapped air to inflate the air seal, thus getting a better seal around the face.

Its name, meaning \\"Roman Chapel\\", refers to the medieval Greek concept of the Roman oikoumene (inhabited world), which embraced Rome and Western Europe, as well as the Byzantine Empire of Constantinople (\\"New Rome\\") and its Slavic commonwealth centered at Moscow.Cappella Romana It has become especially known for its exploration of Eastern Orthodox vocal music. It has collaborated with notable museum exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of ArtMusic of Greece CD - The Metropolitan Museum of Art - Met Museum Store in New York and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The ensemble's 2002 performance of Ivan Moody's Passion and Resurrection was acclaimed by Los Angeles Times music critic Chris Pasles as \\"sung gorgeously\\" and \\"like jeweled light flooding the space\\". In 2010 it became a participant in the research project 'Icons of Sound: Aesthetics and Acoustics of Hagia Sophia, Istanbul', a collaboration between Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) and Department of Art & Art History. Cappella Romana completed a residency at Stanford again in 2013, which included further experiments with CCRMA, lecture demonstrations, and a live performance in Stanford's new Bing Hall, featuring a medieval Byzantine chant sung in the virtual acoustic of Hagia Sophia before a sold-out audience.\\"Cappella Romana: Time-Travel to Constantinople\\", San Francisco Classical Voice, February 1, 2013. For their 2019 album of music in the medieval Byzantine tradition, Lost Voices of Hagia Sophia, advanced digital sound-sampling techniques were employed to capture the acoustics of the immense Hagia Sophia. The ensemble's singing of Byzantine chants thus recreates the ambiance as the music would have been heard there a millenium ago. The New York Times said the album \\"... brings to life the stately mystery of Byzantine cathedral liturgy, bathed in the glittering acoustics of the space for which it was written — even though it was recorded in a studio in California\\". The ensemble is directed by Alexander Lingas,\\"Dr. Alexander Linges, Professor in Music\\", Staff Directory, City University of London. a musicologist of Byzantine music at City University, London.

This species was first described in 1844 by the American herpetologist Edward Hallowell. The western green mamba is a fairly large and predominantly arboreal species, capable of navigating through trees swiftly and gracefully. It will also descend to ground level to pursue prey such as rodents and other small mammals. The western green mamba is a very alert, nervous, and extremely agile snake that lives mainly in the coastal tropical rainforest, thicket, and woodland regions of western Africa. Like all the other mambas, the western green mamba is a highly venomous elapid species. Its venom is a highly potent mixture of rapid-acting presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins and fasciculins. Some consider this species not to be a particularly aggressive snake, but others have suggested that they are extremely nervous and are prone to attack aggressively when cornered. Conflict with humans is low compared to some other species found in the region. Bites to people by this species are quite uncommon. Their mortality rate, however, is high; many of the recorded bites have been fatal. Rapid progression of severe, life-threatening symptoms are hallmarks of mamba bites. Bites with envenomation can be rapidly fatal. Taxonomy Dendroaspis viridis was first described by the American herpetologist and physician Edward Hallowell in 1844 as Leptophis viridis. The specific name viridis is the Latin adjective \\"green\\". In addition to being called the western green mamba, this species is also commonly known as the West African green mamba or Hallowell's green mamba. Analysis of the components of the venom of all mambas places the western green mamba as sister species to Jameson's mamba. Description thumb The western green mamba is a long and very slender bodied snake with a long tapering tail. The average length of an adult snake of this species is between and . Some specimens of this species can grow to maximum lengths of . The head is narrow and elongate, with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from the neck. On rare occasions the neck may be flattened when the snake is aroused, but there is no hood. Eyes are medium in size with round pupils and a yellow brown iris. Scalation Dorsal surface body colour is vivid yellowish green to green with anterior margins of the scales yellow. In many specimens the posterior body and tail are yellow. In some specimens, dorsal body scales are distinctly bordered with black forming chevron-shaped markings. The black interstitial skin is clearly visible especially highlighting individual head scales and scales on the tail. Head dorsum is similar to dorsal surface anterior body colour or slightly darker green. Laterally, the head scales, particularly the labials, are distinctly black edged and colouration is usually paler than dorsum or slightly yellowish tinted. When viewed from above the black edging of scales and black interstitial skin result in a plaited appearance. Head, throat, ventral and subcaudal surface colour is pale yellowish to yellowish green. The head, body and tail scalation of the western green mamba: * Dorsal at midbody: 11–15 (rarely 13) * Ventral: 210–242 * Subcaudal: 105–125 (paired) * Anal plate: Divided * Upper labials: 7–8 * Upper labials to eye: 4th (4th and 5th) * Preoculars: 2–3 * Postoculars: 3–4 * Lower labials: 11–13 * Temporal: 2+2 (occasionally 2 + 3 or 2 + 4) Distribution and habitat The western green mamba is native to West Africa. Different sources give slightly different ranges but generally agree that it occurs from Gambia and southern Senegal to Benin, including the intervening countries (from west to east) Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Ghana, and Togo. In Togo it has a known northern limit to its distribution in Aledjo, but it might occur in forests of the more northerly Kara region Records from Nigeria may be unreliable, and its presence in the Central African Republic is similarly unclear. Some sources mention it also from the very southern tip of Mali along the border with Côte d'Ivoire, as well as from western Cameroon and Gabon. Western green mambas live mainly in the coastal tropical rainforest, thicket, and woodland regions of western Africa. The majority of records of the western green mamba are from within the continuous forest, but the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau records are from isolated forests. The species persists in areas where the tree cover has been removed, providing that sufficient hedges and thicket remain. Found in some suitably vegetated suburbs and towns and parklands therein. It is largely confined to areas where rainfall exceeds . In Togo, however, its range extends into the drier open forests of the north, the Guinean savannas of the west, and the littoral zone. Conservation status This species is classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (v3.1, 2011). The conservation status of this species was last assessed in July 2012 and published in 2013, and it was classed as such due to a wide distribution, fairly generalist habits, stable population and the lack of major threats. Behaviour and ecology This species is mostly diurnal, but may be active at night as well. It is an arboreal snake, but it does commonly go to the ground. In fact, it is equally at home hunting and feeding on prey on the ground or in trees. When it wants to sleep it seeks out tree branches that offer dense cover. It is a very quick, extremely agile, alert, and nervous snake. When confronted it will quickly attempt to escape (usually up a tree if possible) and avoid any sort of confrontation. If cornered, the western green mamba is highly dangerous and will show a fearsome display of aggression, loudly hissing and striking repeatedly. Diet and predators The western green mamba's natural prey consists mainly of birds and small mammals, including rodents such as mice, rats, and squirrels. Other mammals include bats, tree pangolins, and shrews. They also feed on lizards, frogs, and bird eggs. This snake pursues its prey, striking rapidly and often until the prey succumbs to the venom. The western green mamba, as a large and highly venomous snake, has very few natural predators, but humans and birds of prey are this snake's main threats. Venom thumb The western green mamba's venom is similar to those of other members of the mamba genus (Dendroaspis), but differs from others in toxicity and the composition of the toxins. The venom consists mainly of both pre- synaptic and post-synaptic neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, and fasciculins. The toxicity of the venom can vary tremendously depending on various factors including diet, geographical location, age-dependent change, and other factors. The SC and IV for this species is 0.79 mg/kg and 0.71 mg/kg, respectively (Christensen and Anderson (1967)). One study determined the LD50 of the venom administered to mice via the intraperitoneal (IP) route was 0.33 mg/kg. In another test using mice that were administered the western green mamba's venom via the intraperitoneal (IP) route the LD50 was 0.045 mg/kg. Another experimental IV LD50 toxicity of 0.5 mg/kg has been reported, with an average wet venom yield of 100 mg. Like other mamba species, western green mamba venom is among the most rapid-acting venom of snakes. Human fatalities as a result of bites from this species are rare due to the fact that this species does not often cross paths with humans, but bites have occurred and the majority of the recorded bites have been fatal. The three species of green mambas, including the western green mamba, have venom toxicities that are similar to and comparable to many species of cobras, but green mamba bites often present with more severe and life-threatening symptoms in a shorter period of time. Mortality rates are also higher among green mamba bite victims than with cobra bite victims. Although bites by Dendroaspis viridis are not well documented and the rate of bites, envenoming and fatality is not well known, it appears that bites attributed to this species produce more severe envenomation than bites caused by Dendroaspis angusticeps (eastern green mamba), but far less severe than bites caused by Dendroaspis polylepis (black mamba). When bitten, symptoms rapidly begin to manifest, usually within the first 15 minutes or less. The extraordinary speed with which the venom spreads through tissue and produces rapid manifestations of life-threatening symptoms is unique to mambas. Common symptoms of a bite from a western green mamba include local pain and swelling, although uncommon, local necrosis can be moderate, ataxia, headache, drowsiness, difficulty breathing, vertigo, hypotension (low blood pressure), diarrhea, dizziness, and paralysis. Left untreated, new and more severe symptoms rapidly progress. All symptoms worsen and the victim eventually dies due to suffocation resulting from paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Bites with envenomation can be rapidly fatal, which can be possible in 30 minutes.

It looks nothing like the downtown district of a typical major city, and has no skyscrapers. The Central Business District's main borders are Neva River to the north and west, and the Fontanka River to the south and east, but the downtown includes areas outside. History The Central Saint Petersburg is the oldest part of the city after the Peter and Paul Fortress. When people were starting to populate Saint Petersburg they built their houses around the almost only building outside the fortress; the Admiralty building. The largest industry was ship building. The first residence of Peter the Great was a little hut (the hut hasn't been destroyed and is a museum), but he soon started to build the Summer Palace, which was located just opposite the hut, on the other side of the Neva River, and later he built a Winter Palace for himself. The central part of the city was supposed to be between the Peter and Paul Fortress and his first house. Overview The CBS is an area with many old buildings and has beautiful parks like the Summer Garden, Field of Mars and Mikhailovsky Garden. It is also the wealthiest area in Saint Petersburg, home to luxury hotels like Hotel Astoria and Grand Hotel Europe. It has always been a wealthy district since the rich noble Russians built their mansions here. Administratively, the Saint Petersburg central business district falls under the authority of Tsentralny and the Admiralteysky Districts. The CBS is also a main traffic hub, with tramways, trolleybuses, buses, marshrutkas, and the Moscow Rail Terminal.

The title is derived from the song \\"Let's Get Lost\\" by Jimmy McHugh and Frank Loesser from the 1943 film Happy Go Lucky, which Baker recorded for Pacific Records.Frank Loesser website Plot A group of Baker fans, ranging from ex-associates to ex-wives and children, talk about the man. Weber's film traces the man's career from the 1950s, playing with jazz greats like Charlie Parker, Gerry Mulligan, and Russ Freeman, to the 1980s, when his heroin addiction and domestic indifference kept him in Europe. By juxtaposing these two decades, Weber presents a sharp contrast between the younger, handsome Baker — the statuesque idol who resembled a mix of James Dean and Jack Kerouac — to what he became, “a seamy looking drugstore cowboy-cum-derelict”, as J. Hoberman put it in his Village Voice review. Let's Get Lost begins near the end of Baker's life, on the beaches of Santa Monica, and ends at the Cannes Film Festival. Weber uses these moments in the present as bookends to the historic footage contained in the bulk of the film. The documentation ranges from vintage photographs by William Claxton in 1953 to appearances on The Steve Allen Show and kitschy, low budget Italian films Baker did for quick money. Development Bruce Weber first became interested in Chet Baker when he spotted a photograph of the musician in a Pittsburgh record store on the cover of the 1955 vinyl LP Chet Baker Sings and Plays when he was 16 years old; the film's title comes from a song from the album. Weber first met Baker in the winter of 1986 at a club in New York City and convinced him to do a photo shoot and what was originally only going to be a three-minute film. Weber had wanted to make a short film from an Oscar Levant song called \\"Blame It on My Youth\\". They had such a good time together that Baker started opening up to Weber. Afterwards, Weber convinced Baker to make a longer film and the musician agreed. Filming began in January 1987. Interviewing Baker was a challenge as Weber remembers, \\"Sometimes we'd have to stop for some reason or another and then, because Chet was a junkie and couldn't do things twice, we'd have to start all over again. But we grew to really like him\\". \\"You'd decide that, when Chet finally gets up, you'll grab him and talk to him about the early days\\", Weber expanded to Time Out. \\"But then Chet gets here, and he's had a fight with his girlfriend, and he wants to record a song… So what happens is that your world becomes like a jazz suite. You have to go along with him\\". In May 1987, when Weber's documentary Broken Noses premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, he brought Baker along to shoot footage for Let's Get Lost. Weber spent a million dollars of his own money on the documentary and filmed it when he had the time and the money, describing it as \\"a very ad hoc film\\". Reception Let's Get Lost had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. The documentary was well received by critics and currently has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"A-\\" rating and said that Weber \\"created just about the only documentary that works like a novel, inviting you to read between the lines of Baker's personality until you touch the secret sadness at the heart of his beauty\\". In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano wrote, \\"If there's a driving force to Weber's film, it seems to be delving into the nature and purpose of star quality and personal magnetism, which Baker had in droves but which didn't save him\\". In his review for The Washington Post, Hal Hinson wrote that what Weber \\"provides us is rapturous, deeply involving, and more than a little puzzling\\". Terrence Rafferty, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, \\"The enduring fascination of Let's Get Lost, the reason it remains powerful even now, when every value it represents is gone, is that it's among the few movies that deal with the mysterious, complicated emotional transactions involved in the creation of pop culture — and with the ambiguous process by which performers generate desire\\".

One was recorded when the film was being made, when he was older, and the other with all the stuff he sung when he was young, which I prefer… he's the only singer I've ever been able to identify with. I love the fact he's so expressive, so overemotional. It's classic stuff; it makes me soft in my knees… He was so into it: like, 'Fuck those notes I'm singing, and fuck those songs I'm singing – what I want is the emotion.' That's how I feel about it too.\\" Baker's recording of \\"Chetty's Lullaby\\" with Ennio Morricone as conductor of his orchestra was also featured in the film.Chetty's Lullaby by Chet Baker - Topic on YouTube Baker brought his 1985 recording of \\"So Hard To Know\\" from Brazil to include in the film.  Reception  Lindsay Planer of AllMusic states, \\"Even though time and substances have given Baker the visage of a man twice his age, those inimitable pipes and velvet tone have worn surprisingly well. The track list is quite literally replete with something old, new, borrowed, and blue ... Ironically, the title song \\"Let's Get Lost\\" isn't on this album. While the tune was in the documentary, it is the familiar 1956 version.

He was the founder of Wien Air Alaska, Alaska's first airline. Biography Wien was born in Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin, but the family moved to a homestead in 1905, to a place now called Cook, Minnesota. In May 1921, he learned to fly a JN-4 in 8 hours, from Major Ray S. Miller, commander of the 109th Minnesota Air Squadron and manager of the Curtiss Northwest Airplane Company's flying school. Unable to pay the bond required to solo, Wien took a job with E.W. Morrill 15 June 1921, helping to fly and maintain his Standard J-1 while barnstorming. After a few more flying jobs, on 2 Sept. 1922, Wien had enough money to put a downpayment on a Thomas-Morse S-4, which he owned for two weeks, unable to make the final payment. Wien then started working for Clarence W. Hinck's Federated Flyers Flying Circus, earning $300 a month, before Hinck's sold out his operation in Jan. 1924. Wien was then hired by Jimmy Rodebaugh, in May 1924, to fly 2 Standards for his Alaska Aerial Transportation Company. When Wien first arrived in Alaska he had 538.5 hours of flying time. Wien's first Anchorage flight, from the newly prepared Delaney Park Strip, took place on 4 June 1924. This was soon followed by Anchorage's first passenger flights, and Wien put on Anchorage's first aerobatic show for the 4th of July celebrations. Then on 6 July, Wien and Bill Yunker, made the first flight from Anchorage to Fairbanks, flying from Delaney Park Strip to Weeks Field. They completed the flight in under 4 hours, while the trip via Alaska Railroad took 2 days. Then, on 19 Aug. 1924, Wien made the first bush flight to Livengood, Alaska in support of the mining operations located there, making the trip in under an hour when it took several days via dog sled. That Oct., Wien made the first flight over the Arctic Circle. During the following winter season, the Standards sat idle. In Feb. 1925, Wien purchased a Fokker F. III from Atlantic Aircraft in New Jersey and had it shipped to Rodebaugh's newly formed Fairbanks Airplane Company. Though the pilot still sat in an open cockpit, 5 passengers rode in an enclosed compartment within the fuselage. Wien also brought his brother Ralph to Alaska as a replacement for the mechanic Bill Yunker. Noel and Ralph made the first commercial flight from Fairbanks to Nome in June 1925. Noel flew until Nov. 1925 when he and Ralph quit the Fairbanks Airplane Company. Noel headed south to barnstorm the midwest in 1926, then headed back to Alaska with his brother Fritz in March 1927. In 1926, Noel was issued pilot license No. 39 signed by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Official Orville Wright. Noel and Ralph Wien went into partnership with Gene Miller, and purchased a very used Hisso Standard from the Fairbanks Airplane Co. in 1927. In June they established their business in Nome, servicing Candle, Deering, Kotzebue, and Point Hope. At the end of the summer of 1927, Noel went into business for himself, purchasing a Stinson Detroiter he could fly year round, from Hubert Wilkins. Noel, and his Wien Alaska Airways, started a regular weekly round trip flight between Fairbanks and Nome. Noel also secured special air mail flights during the spring and fall breakup. Ralph and Noel made skis for the plane, from 8 by 1 foot hickory wood, modeled after the skis their father made back in Minnesota. Wien added a second plane, a Waco 9, in the spring of 1928, and taught Ralph and Fritz to fly. On 20 Oct. 1928, Wien Alaska Airways, Inc. was incorporated with Noel as president, Ralph as vice-president, and Miners and Merchants Bank president Granville (Grant) R. Jackson as secretary. The new company built a hangar at Weeks Field and promptly ordered a Hamilton Metalplane. At the end of 1928, Noel had accumulated 1290 hours of flying time in Alaska for a total of 1940 hours. Noel was one of eight pilots in Alaska, while Ralph was one of twelve mechanics. They operated three of the seventeen aircraft in the Territory. In March 1929, Noel and Ralph bought and refurbished a Stearman from Arctic Prospecting and Development Company, which had crashed and was abandoned on Walker Lake. On 7 March 1929, Noel and Calvin (Doc) Cripe made the first flight across the Bering Strait, the first nonstop flight from America to Asia (Nome to North Cape), and return the next day. The flight was at the request of the Swenson Herskovitz Trading Company to fly furs out of an ice bound Elisif. Noel married Ada Bering Arthurs, of Nome, on 19 May 1929. After which, Noel moved his company headquarters to Fairbanks. In 1929, Noel, Ralph and Grant Jackson sold Wien Alaska Airways to Avco. Noel's company plus Anchorage Air Transport and Bennett-Rodebaugh were merged into a new company called Alaskan Airways, Inc. Noel remained as a pilot for the new company and Ralph was retained as a mechanic and back-up pilot. However, Noel and Ada headed south where they purchased a Stinson Junior, and their son Noel Merrill Wien was born on 4 April 1930 in Minnesota. In Sept., the Noel family made plans to head back to Alaska, Ada and baby by train and boat, while Noel would fly the Stinson with his master mechanic brother Sigurd (Sig). Sadly though, news arrived on 12 Oct. of Ralph's death in a Kotzebue crash. Their return was delayed until Dec. 1930, so they could bury Ralph in Cook. Noel flew for Alaskan Airways from Feb. 1931 until Jan. 1932, after selling them his Stinson. In Aug. 1932, once his non-compete clause ended, he restarted Wien Airways of Alaska, Inc., with a Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker. Wien and Vic Ross achieved the \\"biggest scoop of the year\\" in 1935, according to Ira Harkey, when they delivered Alfred Lomen and his film of the Post-Rogers crash to Seattle for International News Service, ahead of a competing flight chartered by the Associated Press. Wien pioneered an inland route from Fairbanks to Whitehorse, Yukon, to Prince George, British Columbia, to Seattle, when all other flyers used floatplanes to fly a coastal route starting with the Lynn Canal to Juneau, and then onwards to Seattle. Wien and Ross departed Fairbanks at 10:45 PM on 17 Aug., and landed in Seattle at 12:30 PM the next day. Wien and Ross used the money earned from that flight to purchase a Ford Trimotor 5-AT. They then made the first Seattle to Fairbanks passenger flight on 28-31 Aug. In 1935, Wien contracted polio, but survived with only a limp in his right leg, and continued to fly. Then, in 1938, he received a piece of metal in his right eye, and a botched operation meant the loss of sight in that eye and the consequent depth perception, yet he continued to fly. The eye was removed in 1946, and replaced with a glass eye. Though still flying, he stopped logging hours after 11,600. His last forced landing was in 1956. He died on July 19, 1977, in Bellevue, Washington. Legacy * The Noel Wien Public Library in Fairbanks, Alaska is named after him. The library sits on the site of Weeks Field, the original airport in Fairbanks and base for many of Wien's early accomplishments.

(Click/tap for a larger photo.) Orange peel is a certain kind of finish that may develop on painted and cast surfaces, even screen protectors.. The texture resembles the surface of the skin of an orange, hence the name \\"Orange peel\\". Gloss paint sprayed on a smooth surface (such as the body of a car) should also dry into a smooth surface. However, various factors can cause it to dry into a bumpy surface resembling the texture of an orange peel. The orange peel phenomenon can then be smoothed out with ultra-fine sandpaper, but it can be prevented altogether by changing the painting technique or the materials used. Orange peel is typically the result of improper painting technique, and is caused by the quick evaporation of thinner, incorrect spray gun setup (e.g., low air pressure or incorrect nozzle), spraying the paint at an angle other than perpendicular, or applying excessive paint. In some situations, such as interior house paint, the orange peel texture is desirable. In this case, a texture paint is generally applied with a spray gun. The texture is then painted over with the appropriate color. When painting walls, orange peel can also develop by using a roller with too little paint or too thick a paint and the surface dries before the texture can level. Measurement The instruments used to measure orange peel simulate visual perception. Like our eyes, the instruments optically scan the wavy light/dark pattern. Two types of instruments are available to quantify the texture or waviness of a surface: Orange peel meter The orange peel meter uses a laser point light source to illuminate the specimen at a 60° angle and uses a detector to measure the reflected light intensity at the equal but opposite angle. The instrument is rolled across the surface and measures point by point the optical profile of the surface across a defined distance. The instruments analyse the structures according to their size. In order to simulate the human eye's resolution at various distances, the measurement signal is divided into several ranges using mathematical filter functions: *Wa 0.1 ..... 0.3 mm wavelength *Wb 0.3 ........ 1 mm wavelength *Wc 1............ 3 mm wavelength *Wd 3 ......... 10 mm wavelength *We 10 ....... 30 mm wavelength *SW 0.3 ..... 1.2 mm wavelength *LW 1.2....... 12 mm wavelength Simplified Measurement Diagram Structures smaller than 0.1 mm also influence visual perception, therefore the instruments use a CCD camera to measure the diffused light caused by these fine structures. This parameter is referred to as \\"dullness\\". The values of dullness and Wa to We form a \\"structure spectrum\\". This allows a detailed analysis of orange peel and its influencing factors, being material or application parameters. Example of a \\"structure spectrum\\" The detailed information of the structure spectrum as well as LW and SW became the basis to correlate to specific scales and to the DOI as described in ASTM E430. Phase stepped deflectometer Phase stepped deflectometry (PSD) is a white light optical technique that uses a fringe pattern projected from a high definition screen to capture the reflected image of the pattern using a high definition camera. The sinusoidal waveform acts like a ruler over the surface allowing the relative ordinates of the light source points to be quantified as they are proportional to the spatial phase of the sinusoidal pattern waveform. By using a standard technique known as “phase stepping” accurate measurement of each point across the surface can be made through quantifying the corresponding point per pixel on the camera. Using the known geometric relationship between the display, the object surface and the camera, light rays reflected from the surface can be spatially modelled to calculate the direction of the normal at each point of the surface thereby allowing the profile at that point to be obtained. By displaying the sinusoidal waveform in both horizontal and vertical directions the surface slopes can be determined in both orthogonal directions. By differentiating the measurement data the curvature field can be calculated allowing accurate characterisation of a surface profile. To simulate the human eye's resolution at various distances the specific band pass filtering is applied to the curvature data separating the structure data according to size: *Ka 0.1 ..... 0.3 mm wavelength *Kb 0.3 ........ 1 mm wavelength *Kc 1............ 3 mm wavelength *Kd 3 ......... 10 mm wavelength *Ke 10 ....... 30 mm wavelength *Ks 0.3 ..... 1.2 mm wavelength *Kl 1.2....... 12 mm wavelength This information is then converted into texture data (waviness) by applying standardised equations. Unlike other slope and curvature measurement methods, PSD is a full-field technique that does not require any mechanical movement of the device nor translation of the sensor or the surface under test; all angular and positioning errors related to this translation are therefore avoided.

The newspaper and its commercial printing facility in Logansport's Industrial Park are owned by Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. History=Early Pharos The forerunner of the newspaper presently serving the six-county area was a four-page publication printed on a crude hand press brought to Logansport on a riverboat from Ohio by Samuel A. Hall in 1844. The journeyman printer christened his paper the Democratic Pharos and the first issue of the six- column paper appeared July 24 of that year. The competition among newspapers in Cass County was exceptionally fierce. Some publications lasted only a few months; some lived for a few years. The list of discontinued newspapers undoubtedly offered 20-year-old Hall little encouragement that his publication would continue through the years, but it has. Hall's staunch Democratic Party beliefs were reflected in the first edition of his paper. The editorial declared the publication to be “uncompromisingly Democratic,” and a biography of the Democratic candidate for president, James K. Polk, was included in the issue. The front page of the first edition contained only two headlines – poetry and miscellany. Daily newspaper When the Democratic Pharos was launched, Logansport was a town of 1,800 people. On August 10, 1874, the weekly Democrat Pharos was changed to the Daily Pharos, and Logansport had grown to a city of nearly 9,000 people. The Daily Pharos was established under the management of Rufus Magee, who purchased the paper in 1869, a year prior to Hall's death. Magee's interest in the Daily Pharos was purchased July 1, 1875, by the Pharos Company composed of S.P. Sheerin, C.P. Knowlton, William Dolan and Mrs. S.A. Hall. The Pharos Company remained in control of the newspaper for two years when the publication was sold on November 18, 1877, to Benjamin F. Louthain and Milton Y. Todisman. Todisman retired a year later and was succeeded by Jerry Collins, who remained with the paper for a year. Louthain, who held an active position in the paper's management, entered into partnership in 1881 with John W. Barnes. Remaining in the newspaper partnership for 32 years, these men mutually agreed to dissolve partnership in 1913, when the Daily Pharos and the Logansport Reporter consolidated on May 13, to form the Pharos-Reporter. The first issue of that paper appeared May 15. The consolidated Pharos-Reporter was owned and operated by the Pharos- Reporter Publishing Company with B.F. Louthain serving as president, treasurer and editor. Merger with Reporter The Logansport Daily Reporter was established by J.E. Sutton October 1, 1889, at 218 Sixth Street. Later the publication was moved to 525-27 East Broadway. Upon her husband's death, Mrs. Inez Sutton managed the Reporter until her son, Lindley R. Sutton, assumed the management when he became of age. They sported the distinction of being the first local paper to use a typesetting machine, perfection printing press and folder to print from a continuous roll of paper. The merger of the Daily Pharos and the Logansport Reporter, both afternoon papers, left Logansport with the two daily papers instead of the four which had existed prior to the consolidation of the Logansport Journal and the Logansport Tribune. The Logansport Daily Tribune made its debut December 1, 1907, published by a stock company with E.F. and Harry Metzger and O.A. Cummins, as principal stockholders. B.F. Louthain, publisher of the Pharos-Reporter, died October 15, 1915, and his widow, Mrs. Matilda Louthain, became president of the Pharos-Reporter Publishing Company. A partial interest in the paper was purchased two years later by Samuel O. Berman. On March 1, 1920, the Pharos- Reporter purchased the Journal-Tribune, a morning newspaper and the publications merged under the name of Pharos-Tribune. Mrs. Louthain continued as president with her son, W.R. Emslie, as secretary and manager and Berman as treasurer and assistant manager. The first edition of the Pharos-Tribune appeared March 15, 1920, published at 517 East Broadway, the present site of the newspaper. In 1923, Berman, who operated a wholesale and retail sporting goods business in Logansport, was named publisher of the Pharos-Tribune. Berman became controlling stockholder in 1926. He was succeeded as general manager and publisher upon his death in 1938 by J.M. Druck, who remained as publisher until 1990. Mr. Druck's 53-year career as a publisher is believed to be the longest by any daily publisher in Indiana. Purchase of Press The Logansport Press, which had started publication June 14, 1921, was purchased by the Pharos-Tribune on March 1, 1949, and moved that fall from 309-11 East Broadway to the Pharos-Tribune Building. The papers were combined only in the mechanical and business aspect, as the editorial, news and circulation departments of both papers remained completely separate. In January 1966, Howard Publications, headed by Robert S. Howard, purchased the majority interest in both local papers, and shortly thereafter 100 percent acquisition of the ownership. The final step in Logansport's consolidation of newspapers took place October 3, 1966, when the Pharos-Tribune and Logansport Press combined to publish the first edition of the Pharos-Tribune and Press. Outside owners The Pharos-Tribune moved into its present building in 1983. In 1995, Howard Publications traded the Pharos-Tribune to Canadian-owned Thomson Corporation in exchange for the Valparaiso Vidette-Messenger. In 1990, William C. Blake replaced J.M. Druck, who retired as publisher of the Pharos- Tribune. He was replaced in 1996 by interim publisher Arden Draeger who filled the position for a short time. In April 1997, Dollie Turpin-Cromwell became publisher of the Pharos-Tribune after a year of having the position vacant. She was replaced in November 1998 by Wayne Lowman. In 2000, Thompson Newspapers sold the Pharos-Tribune, along with 48 other daily U.S. newspapers. Thompson retained the (Toronto) The Globe and Mail, and have put their focus on doing business electronically. On September 1, 2000, Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc (cnhiMedia) acquired 17 daily newspapers from Thompson Newspapers Inc. that included the Pharos-Tribune. The Birmingham-based cnhi was founded in 1997 and is a privately held communications company. The Pharos-Tribune is the third largest property of cnhiMedia's 14 Indiana publications. On January 3, 2001, Robyn McCloskey was named the new publisher of the Pharos-Tribune.

It was among the first social networking sites to appear on the Internet. It offered content that included daily horoscopes, chat rooms, message boards, tagbooks (a knowledge market feature), photo albums, internet radio, browser games, blogs, e-cards, an instant messenger service, a clubs feature (giving people with similar interests a common message board), and badges (a system of awards for user profiles). An email service was hosted, but it was discontinued due to email companies such as Yahoo and Google providing between 1 and nearly 3 gigabytes of email storage for free, rendering Bolt's email service obsolete. This was done without notifying its email subscribers. Bolt was also one of the first sites to give its members their own web page. In 2002, the badges became more sponsor-based, which led to Bolt becoming more commercial with an increase of ads into the users' activities. Company badges included Verizon Wireless, Gillette, and Sony. Bolt was originally marketed towards teenagers to create content, meet people, and play games in a safe and age-appropriate environment. As members aged and stayed with the site, more members were college students and between ages 18–24. In 2005, Bolt.com launched its second iteration, Boltfolio. Touted by itself as the leader of the \\"cult of creativity\\", Boltfolio intended to provide a one-stop shop for creative users to upload their own photos, videos, and music, as well as write blogs or record directly from a webcam. The goal of Boltfolio was to provide a set of tools that would attract users of creative sites such as DeviantArt, YouTube, and Flickr. 2006–2009 In December 2005 Bolt Media finalized a deal to purchase InterMedia Inc., a small company focused on a video-sharing site, Yashi. Yashi and Boltfolio were integrated into one site, and in March 2006 Bolt Media opted to focus the company on this new property. Boltfolio became Bolt.com, moving the existing Bolt.com site to Bolt2.com.

Harlan is the former Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Green Bay Packers, an American professional football team. He is a graduate of Marquette University, where he was the Sports Information Director for many years. He is also the father of sports announcer Kevin Harlan. Early life Bob Harlan was born on September 9, 1936 in Des Moines, Iowa. Green Bay Packers Harlan started his career with the Green Bay Packers in 1971 as an assistant general manager. Over the next 18 years he was promoted three times, first as corporate general manager in 1975, then as assistant to the president in 1981, and finally as executive vice president of administration in 1988. On June 5, 1989, he was elected as the ninth president of the Packers after the resignation of former president Robert J. Parins. Harlan would go on to serve as president for 18 seasons until 2008. His tenure was marked with \\"some of the largest moves in franchise history\\" that made him one of the \\"most influential--and successful--president[s] in franchise history\\". Bob Harlan is credited with keeping the Packers competitive in the era of free agency and the salary cap, and for creating the foundation for the Packers' twelfth World Championship in Super Bowl XXXI. Among Harlan's most notable accomplishments are: *Building the Don Hutson Center, the first indoor practice facility in professional football. *The decision to move all home games to Lambeau Field, creating season ticket packages for the Milwaukee fans who had previously attended three games a season at Milwaukee County Stadium; *Renovating Lambeau Field into a state-of-the-art facility, with increased game day capacity and a year-round Atrium housing restaurants, the Packers Pro Shop and the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame; *Launching the fourth stock sale in the team's history in 1997, a mechanism which raised more than $20 million and brought more than 100,000 new shareholders to the organization; *Hiring Ron Wolf, who traded for Brett Favre, signed free agent Reggie White and began the chain of events that led to a World Championship; On May 26, 2007 the Packers announced that John Jones would be taking an indefinite \\"leave of absence\\" only days before Jones was scheduled to succeed Harlan as new CEO of the organization. Health concerns were the major reason cited for Jones' departure. In late July 2007, the Packers and Jones officially cut ties and a new search for the Packers President and CEO commenced. Harlan retained his position as CEO throughout the search, although the President position remained vacant. On December 3, 2007, the Green Bay Packers announced Mark H. Murphy, the Northwestern University Athletics Director, as its new President and CEO effective January 1, 2008. Harlan remained as Chairman-Emeritus and advisor to the team through the 2008 season, afterwards, he remained as Chairman-Emeritus and serve as a goodwill ambassador for the team. Harlan was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame on July 17, 2004. Harlan was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009. Personal life Harlan and his wife Madeline have lived in Green Bay since the early 1960s and are active in the community. The Harlans created the Madeline and Robert Harlan Humanitarian Fund, which provides assistance to cancer patients who do not have insurance. The inspiration for this fund was Harlan's diagnosis of melanoma and subsequent treatment in 2003.

It brings together religion and environmental activism. Ecospirituality has been defined as \\"a manifestation of the spiritual connection between human beings and the environment.\\" The new millennium and the modern ecological crisis has created a need for environmentally based religion and spirituality.van Schalkwyk, Annalet. \\"Sacredness And Sustainability: Searching For A Practical Eco- Spirituality.\\" Religion & Theology 18.1/2 (2011): 77–92. Academic Search Complete. Web. 26 Oct. 2015. Ecospirituality is understood by some practitioners and scholars as one result of people wanting to free themselves from a consumeristic and materialistic society.Gottlieb, Roger S., ed. The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology. \\"Hindu Religion and Environmental Well-being.\\" O.P. Dwivedi. Oxford University Press, 2006. Ecospirituality has been critiqued for being an umbrella term for concepts such as deep ecology, ecofeminism, and nature religion.Taylor, Bron Raymond. Dark green religion: Nature spirituality and the planetary future. Univ of California Press, 2010. Proponents may come from a range of faiths including: Islam; Jainism; Christianity (Catholicism, Evangelicalism and Orthodox Christianity); Judaism; Hinduism; Buddhism and Indigenous traditions. Although many of their practices and beliefs may differ, a central claim is that there is \\"a spiritual dimension to our present ecological crisis.\\" According to the environmentalist Sister Virginia Jones, \\"Eco-spirituality is about helping people experience 'the holy' in the natural world and to recognize their relationship as human beings to all creation. Ecospirituality has been influenced by the ideas of deep ecology, which is characterized by \\"recognition of the inherent value of all living beings and the use of this view in shaping environmental policies\\"Drengson, Alan. 2012. \\"Some Thought on the Deep Ecology Movement.\\" Foundation for Deep Ecology. http://www.deepecology.org/deepecology.htm Similarly to ecopsychology, it refers to the connections between the science of ecology and the study of psychology. 'Earth-based' spirituality is another term related to ecospirituality; it is associated with pagan religious traditions and the work of prominent ecofeminist, Starhawk. Ecospirituality refers to the intertwining of intuition and bodily awareness pertaining to a relational view between human beings and the planet.  Origins  Ecospirituality finds its history in the relationship between spirituality and the environment. Some scholars say it \\"flows from an understanding of cosmology or the story of the origin of the universe.\\" There are multiple origin stories about how the spiritual relationship with people and the environment began. In Native America philosophy, there are many unique stories of how spirituality came to be. A common theme in a number of them is the discussion of a Great Spirit that lives within the universe and the earth represents its presence. Ecospirituality has also sprung from a reaction to the Western world's materialism and consumerism, characterized by ecotheologian Thomas Berry as a \\"crisis of cosmology.\\" Scholars have argued that \\"the modern perspective is based on science and focused on the human self with everything else being outside, resulting in the demise of the metaphysical world and the disenchantment with the cosmos.\\" Therefore, ecospirituality originates as a rebuttal to the emphasis on the material as well as Western separation from the environment, where the environment is regarded as a set of material resources with primarily instrumental value.  Ecological crisis  Ecospirituality became popularized due to a need for a reconceptualization of the human relationship with the environment. Terms such as environmental crisis, ecological crisis, climate change, global warming all refer to an ongoing global issue that needs to be addressed. Generally the ecological crisis is referring to the destruction of the earth's ecosystem. What this encompasses is a highly controversial debate in scientific and political spheres. Globally we are faced with pollution of our basic needs (air, and water) as well as the depletion of important resources, most notably food resources. Annette Van Schalkwyk refers to the environmental crisis as “man-made”. It is arguably the result of a “mechanistic and capitalistic world view”. Whether it is man-made, or as some argue, a natural occurrence, humans are not helping. Pollution and depletion of resources play a major role in the ecological crisis. Bringing religion into the ecological crisis is controversial due to the divide between religion and science. Ecospirituality is prepared to acknowledge science, and work in tandem with religion to frame the environment as a sacred entity in need of protection. Mary Evelyn Tucker notes the importance of religion and ecology connecting with sustainability. Due to the environmental crisis, perceptions of sustainability are changing. Religion and ecology, and the way people experience ecospirituality, could contribute to this changing definition of sustainability.  Research on ecospirituality  Ecospirituality has been studied by academics in order to understand a clearer definition of what individuals label as ecospirituality and the framework in which they create this definition. One study focused on holistic nurses, who themselves characterize their profession as having a fundamentally spiritual nature and a sense of the importance of the environment.Lincoln, Valerie (September 2000). American Holistic Nurses' Association. p. 227. Researchers performed a phenomenological study where they assessed the nurses' ecospiritual consciousness. For the purpose of their study, they defined ecospiritual consciousness as \\"accessing a deep awareness of one's ecospiritual relationship.\\" They then narrowed down their findings to the five principles of ecospiritual consciousness, which are: tending, dwelling, reverence, connectedness, and sentience. # Tending was defined as \\"being awake and conscious,\\" with \\"deep, inner self-reflection.\\" # Dwelling was defined as \\"a process of being with the seen and the unseen.\\" # Reverence was defined as \\"rediscovering the mystery present present in all creation and is embodied sense of the sacred,\\" focusing on the earth. # Connectedness was defined as an \\"organic relationship with the universe.\\" # Sentience was defined as \\"a sense of knowing.\\" Another study looked at medical effects of ecospirituality by having patients with cardiovascular disease practice \\"environmental meditation\\" and log regular journal entries about their experiences.Delaney, Colleen. \\"Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease\\". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 362. Researchers started out with the research question of, \\"What is the essence of the experience of ecospirituality meditation in patients with CVD?\\" CVD is an acronym for cardiovascular disease. From analyzing journal entries of participants, researchers abstracted four major themes of ecospirituality meditation: entering a new time zone, environmental reawakening, finding a new rhythm, and the creation of a healing environment. # Entering a new time zone was described by researchers as \\"the expansion of time during meditation.\\"Delaney, Colleen. \\"Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease\\". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 366. # Environmental Reawakening was described by researchers as \\"opened participants’ eyes to vistas not previously noticed\\" # Finding a new rhythm was described by the researchers as \\"enhanced relationships with their family, friends, coworkers, and even their pets.\\"Delaney, Colleen. \\"Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease\\". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 367. # The creation of a healing environment was described by the researchers as \\"With raised consciousnesses, they became aware of the choices they had regarding what types of intentions and energy that wanted to put out in their environment\\" This research was driven by the goal of raising awareness among healthcare professionals about ecospirituality and the medical importance of both self and environmental consciousness. Anecdotal evidence showed a decrease in blood pressure.Delaney, Colleen. \\"Ecospirituality: The Experience of Environmental Meditation in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease\\". Holistic Nursing Practice. 23(6): 368. However, the psychological benefits of environmental meditation were the main focus for the researchers. Dark Green Religion Dark Green Religion is one way in which people, both secular and religious, connect with nature on a spiritual level. Bron Taylor defines Dark Green Religion as \\"religion that considers nature to be sacred, imbued by intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care\\" in his book Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future.Taylor, Bron. \\"Dark green religion.\\" Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). xi. Nature religion is an overarching term of which Dark Green Religion is a part of. A key part of Dark Green Religion is the \\"depth of its consideration of nature.\\" Dark Green Religion differs from Green Religion. Green Religion claims that it is a religious obligation for humans to be environmental stewards, while Dark Green Religion is a movement that simply holds nature as valuable and sacred.Taylor, Bron. \\"Dark green religion.\\" Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 10. Spiritual types of Dark Green Religion include Naturalistic and Supernaturalistic forms of Animism and of Gaianism.Taylor, Bron. \\"Dark green religion.\\" Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). 14. The diverse views within Dark Green Religion are not without the idea that the earth is sacred and worthy of care. The perceptions of Dark Green Religion are global and flexible. Taylor's use of the word 'Dark' gestures toward these negative possibilities. According to Taylor, Dark Green Religion has the possibility to \\"inspire the emergence of a global, civic, earth religion.\\"Taylor, Bron. \\"Dark green religion.\\" Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future. UC Berkeley (2009). x. Dark Green, Green and Nature Religions are arguably all a part of ecospirituality. The term ecospirituality is versatile and overarching. Ecofeminism and spirituality The umbrella term \\"ecospirituality\\" covers the feminist theology called Ecofeminism.Elizabeth A Johnson on Ecofeminism (Burke Lecture: An Ecological Inquiry – Jesus and the Cosmos) University of California Television, 2010. The term ecofeminism was first coined by the French writer Françoise D'Eaubonne in her book, Le Féminisme ou la Mort in order to name the connection between the patriarchal subjugation of women and the destruction of nature.Clifford, Anne. Introducing Feminist Theology. Marknoll: Orbis Books: 2001. In it, she argues that women have different ways of seeing and relating to the world than men.Does the Spirit Move You? Environmental Spirituality – Annie L. Booth, Faculty of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies University of Northern British Columbia, Environmental Values Vol. 8, 1999. These differences can give rise alternative insights on interactions between humans and the natural world when women's perspectives are considered. The suppression and control of woman and the natural world are connected. On the ecofeminist view, women are controlled because they are thought to be closer to primitive nature. By understanding the connection between femininity and nature and by exploring feminine ways of seeing and relating, ecofeminism asserts that humans can realize positive ways of interacting with the natural world and with each other.  Ecofeminism and Christianity on the ecological crisis  A significant figure in Christian ecofeminism is Rosemary Radford Ruether. Ruether argues that feminism and ecology share a common vision, even though they use different languages.Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing. San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1992. In her work, Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing Ruether provides three recommendations on ways to move forward with repairing and \\"healing\\" the ecological crisis. The first recommendation is that \\"the ecological crisis needs to be seen not just as a crisis in the health of nonhuman ecosystems, polluted water, contaminated skies, threatened climate change, deforestation, extinction of species, important as all these realities are. Rather one needs to see the interconnections between the impoverishment of the earth and the impoverishment of human groups, even as others are enriching themselves to excess.\\" The second recommendation is that \\"a healed ecosystem – humans, animals, land, air, and water together – needs to be understood as requiring a new way of life, not just a few adjustments here and there.\\" The third and final recommendation is that the need for a new vision is necessary: \\"one needs to nurture the emergence of a new planetary vision and communal ethic that can knit together people across religions and cultures. There is rightly much dismay at the role that religions are playing in right-wing politics and even internecine violence today. But we need also to recognize the emergence of new configurations of inter-religious relations.\\"  Ecofeminism and Christianity in liberation theology  According to Ivone Gebara, in Latin America, particularly in Christian Churches in Brazil, it is difficult to be a feminist, but more difficult to be an ecofeminist.Gebara, Ivone. “Ecofeminism: A Latin American Perspective.” Crosscurrents, Spring 2003. Gebara explains ecology as one of the \\"deepest concerns of feminism and ecology as having a deep resonance or a political and anthropolocial consequence from a feminist perspective.\\" Gebara believes that it is the task of different groups of Latin American women to \\"provide a new order of meaning including marginalized people.\\" This task is both challenging and political. Gebara says: \\"We can choose the life of the planet and the respect of all living beings or we choose to die by our own bad decisions.\\"  World religions and ecospirituality = Ecospirituality and paganism  Paganism is a nature-based religion that exists in a multitude of forms. There is no official doctrine or sacred text that structures its practice. Due to its lack of structure, many Pagans believe that it should be used as a tool to combat the current ecological crisis because it is flexible and can adapt to the environment's needs. Ecospirituality advocates contend that an ecology- based religion that focuses on the nurturing and healing of the earth is necessary in modernity. As paganism is already based in nature worship, many believe it would be a useful starting point for ecospirituality. In fact, neopagan revivals have seen the emergence of pagan communities that are more earth-focused. They may build their rituals around advocacy for a sustainable lifestyle and emphasize complete interconnectedness with the earth. Paganism understands divine figures to exist not as transcendent beings, but as immanent beings in the present realm, meaning that their divine figures exist within each of us, and within nature. Many pagans believe in interconnectedness among all living beings, which allows them to foster moments of self-reflection before acting. These pagan ideals coincide with ecospirituality because pagans understand the environment to be part of the divine realm and part of their inner self. Therefore, in their view, harming the environment directly affects their wellbeing. Pagans have already recognized the importance of incorporating environmental ideologies with their own religious beliefs. The Dragon Environmental Network is a pagan community based in the UK. They are committed to practicing \\"eco-magic\\" with the intention of recognizing the earth as sacred and divine. Their four goals are as follows: # Increase general awareness of the sacredness of the Earth. # Encourage pagans to become involved in conservation work. # Encourage pagans to become involved in environmental campaigns. # Develop the principles and practice of magical and spiritual action for the environment. Paganism combines religion with environmental activism. Pagans organize protests, campaigns, and petitions with the environment in mind while staying true to their religious beliefs. Bron Taylor, argues that their core Pagan beliefs greatly improves their environmental activism. Additionally, the Pagan community has recently released a statement on the ecological crisis. It explains that Pagans lead lives that foster “harmony with the rhythms of our great Earth\\" and that they view the Earth as their equal in stating “we are neither above nor separate from the rest of nature”. It states that we are part of a web of life, and are fully interconnected with the biosphere. This connection to all living beings is seen as spiritual and sacred. And in turn it provides a framework that Pagans can use to combine their religious beliefs with environmental activism. It calls for a return to ancient understandings of the earth by listening to ancient wisdom. It asks Pagans to practice their religion in all aspects of their lives in order to give the Earth room to heal. The statement concludes by stating “building a truly sustainable culture means transforming the systems of domination and exploitation that threaten our future into systems of symbiotic partnership that support our ecosystems”.  Ecospirituality and Christianity  Most Christian theology has centered on the doctrine of creation. According to Elizabeth Johnson, in recent years, this has led to growing ecological awareness among Christians. The logic of this stance is rooted in the theological idea that since God created the world freely, it has an intrinsic value and is worthy of our respect and care. In 1990, Pope John Paul II wrote a letter on ecological issues. He concluded the letter with a discussion of Christian belief and how it should lead to ethical care of the earth. He ended the letter with the principle \\"respect for life and the dignity of human person must extend also to the rest of creation.\\" The doctrines of Christ that Christians follow also have the potential for ecological spirituality for they support interpretations that are consistent with ecospirituality. According to Elizabeth Johnson, Jesus' view of the Kingdom of God included earthly wellbeing. According to Thomas Berry, Christians recognize a need for an Earth Ethic.Berry, Thomas. The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth. Orbis Books: New York, 2009. The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, has organized major religion and science symposia on water issues across Europe, the Amazon River and Greenland. He has issued statements – including a joint statement with John Paul II in 2002 – calling destruction of the environment \\"ecological sin.\\" Bishop Malone, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has said: \\"The Church stands in need of a new symbolic and affective system through which to proclaim the Gospel to the modern world.\\"Thomas Berry, \\"Christian Cosmology.\\" The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth, 1985, page 26. In the ecotheology of the late Thomas Berry, he argues that Christians often fail to realize that both their social and religious wellbeing depend on the wellbeing of Earth. Earth provides sustenance for physical, imaginative and emotions, and religious wellbeing. In Thomas Berry's view, the Christian future will depend on the ability of Christians to assume their responsibility for Earth's fate.Thomas Berry, \\"The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth,\\" The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth, 1989, page 35. An example of such responsibility-taking can be seen in the founding of an association called \\"Sisters of Earth,\\" which is made up of nuns and laywomen.Thomas Berry, \\"Women Religious: Voices of Earth,\\" The Christian Future and the Fate of Earth, 1994, page 78. This network of women from diverse religious communities is significant, both for the movement of general concern for the natural world and for the religious life in Christian contexts.  Ecospirituality and Hinduism  Many teachings in Hinduism are intertwined with the ethics of ecospirituality in their stress on environmental wellbeing. The Hindu text called the Taittariya Upanishad refers to creation as offspring of the Supreme Power, paramatman. Thus, the environment is related to something that is divine and therefore deserves respect. Since the late 1980s when the negative effects of mass industrialization were becoming popularized, India instituted administrative policies to deal with environmental conservation. These policies were rooted in the ways that the Hindu religion is tied to the land. In the Hindu text Yajurveda (32.10), God is described as being present in all living things, further reinforcing the need to show respect for creation. Passages such as this lead some Hindus to become vegetarian and to affirm a broader type of ecospiritual connection to the Earth. Vishnu Purana 3.8.15. states that, \\"God, Kesava, is pleased with a person who does not harm or destroy other non-speaking creatures or animals.\\" This notion is tied in with the Hindu concept of karma. Karma means that the pain caused to other living things will come back to you through the process of reincarnation. Ecospirituality can also be seen in the Prithivi Sukta which is a \\"Hymn to Mother Earth.\\" In this text, the Earth is humanized into a spiritual being to which humans have familial ties. Through ecospirituality, the notion of praising and viewing the Earth in this way brings about its strong connections to Hinduism. Ecospirituality and Jainism Contemporary Jaina faith is \\"inherently ecofriendly\\". In terms of the ecological crisis, Jains are “quite self-conscious of the ecological implications of their core teachings.” Jain teachings center on five vows that lead to reverse the flow of or release karma. One of these vows is ahimsa or non-violence. Ahimsa “is said to contain the key to advancement along the spiritual path (sreni). This requires abstaining from harm to any being that possesses more than one sense” The principles of the Jaina tradition are rooted in environmental practices. The Jaina connection to nature is conducive to ecospirituality.  Ecospirituality and Islam  Some scholars argue that while looking at the scriptural sources of Islam, you can see it is an ecologically orientated religion.Richard Foltz, \\"Islam.\\" in Roger S. Gottlieb, ed., The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Ecology. Oxford University Press, 2006. Looking at textual sources of Islam, the shari'a preach a number of environmentally focused guidelines to push environmentalism, in particular, \\"maintenance of preserves, distribution of water, and the development of virgin lands.\\" Much of Muslim environmentalism is a result of the Qur'anic stress of stewardship which is explained through the Arabic concept khilafa. A quote translated from the hadith states, \\"verily, this world is sweet and appealing, and Allah placed you as vice-regents thereinl he will see what you do.\\" Within the Islamic faith, there is a set importance to following the messages set forth in scripture, therefore the environmentalism spoken through them has led to a spirituality around the environment. This spirituality can also be seen with Qur'anic concept of tawhid, which translates to unity. Many Muslim environmentalists see this meaning spiritually as \\"all-inclusive\\" when in relation to the Earth. A majority of Muslim writers draw attention to the environmental crisis as a direct result of social injustice. Many argue that the problem is not that, \\"humans as a species are destroying the balance of nation, but rather that some humans are taking more than their share.\\" Muslim environmentalists such as Fazlun Khalid, Yasin Dutton, Omar Vadillo, and Hashim Dockrat have drawn a correlation between the capitalist nature of the global economy to being un-Islamic and essentiality leading to ecological crisis. The issues of environmental degradation are especially important to Muslims as majority of Muslims live in developing countries where they see the effects of the ecological crisis on a daily basis. This has led to conferences discussing Islam and the environment to take place in Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as the introduction of environmental nongovernmental organizations.  Ecospirituality and Buddhism  Buddhism was founded in ancient India between the 6th and 4th century BCE. However, with modern concerns on issues such as global warming, many Buddhist scholars have looked back at what Buddhist teaching has to say about the environmental crisis and developed what is called Green Buddhism.Gottlieb, Roger S., ed. The Oxford handbook of religion and ecology. \\"The Greening of Buddhism.\\" Stephanie Kaza. Oxford University Press, 2006. One of the key players in this introduction was Gary Snyder who brought to light where Buddhist practice and ecological thinking intertwine. Green Buddhism made waves in the 1980s when they publicly addressed the ecological crisis to create awareness and in 1989 when the Dalai Lama won a Nobel Peace Prize for the proposed introduction of Tibet as an ecological reserve. Buddhism has been open to working with other world religions to combat the environmental crisis seen at an international conference for Buddhist-Christian studies that addressed the environment. Although Green Buddhism has not commented much on technical issues such as air and water pollution, they use their spirituality to focus heavily on \\"rich resources for immediate application in food ethics, animal rights, and consumerism.\\"  See also  * Religion and environmentalism * Ecopsychology * Environmental ethics * Indigenous American philosophy * Earth Spiritualism References Category:Deep ecology Category:Ecology Category:Spirituality ","title":"Ecospirituality"},{"id":"4457563","text":"is the first full-length album released by Japanese novelty heavy metal band Animetal.

The OR gate electron–photon transfer chain _A* A* = excited state of molecule A _B* _C* _A _B _C The OR gate is based on the activation of molecule A, and thus pass electron / photon to molecule C's excited state orbitals (C*). The electron from molecule A inter system crosses to C* via the excited state orbitals of B, eventually utilised as a signal in the C* emission. The ‘OR’ gate uses two inputs of light (photons) to molecule A in two separate electron transfer chains, both of which are capable of transferring to C* and thus producing the output of an OR gate. Therefore, if either electron transfer chain is activated, molecule C's excitation produces a valid/ output emission. Input Input A D ↘ ↙ B E ↘↙ C output The ‘AND’ gate _C** Second excited state of molecule C _A* _B* _C* _A _B _C Excitation A->A* by photon, whereby the promoted electron is passed down to the C* molecular orbital. A second photon applied to the system () causes the excitation of the electron in the C* molecular orbital to the C** molecular orbital -analogous pump probe spectroscopy. : _** Second excited state of molecule C : ↑ : _* : ↑ : _C Above, the energy level diagram illustrating the principle of pump probe spectroscopy –the excitation of an excited state. The AND gate is produced by the necessity of both A->A* and the C**->C excitations occurring at the same time -input and , are simultaneously required. To prevent erroneous emissions of light from a single input to the AND gate, it would be necessary to have an electron transfer series with ability accept any electrons (energy) from C* energy level. The electron transfer series would terminate with a low (non- radiative decay) of the energy The alternatives for producing an AND gate, using molecular photphysics, are two. (1) The emission produced by the electron drop from C*->C () is not a valid output frequency. The emission from the C** ( + , ) molecular orbital is a valid output signal;. to be used in subsequent logic gates -arranged to respond to the C^{**} \\\\xrightarrow[c2]{} C emission. The second input of photon(s) to trigger the rapid conversion of a molecule used to complete the electron transfer chain. A very complex molecule like a protein can be engineered to possess high strain energies, so that in the absence of the second light frequency molecule B is inactive (B). The second photon input triggers B->B' where the forward rate constant is much smaller than the reverse. If such a molecule is used as molecule B, the transfer chain can be switched on and off. Creating the NOT gate To stop the electron transfer chain completing, producing output signals, the input of a photon, , is used to produce a ‘pump probe spectroscopy’ effect by promoting an electron in an electron transfer chain. The fall of the pump probe promoted electron produces an output that is quenched down an electron transfer chain. An alternative is similar to the AND gate alternative; an input causes a change in molecule structure breaking the electron transfer chain by not allowing the smooth energy transfer of electrons.

Named in honor of Revolutionary War general and university founder William Richardson Davie, the tree is approximately 300 to 375 years old. History and legends As plans were being drawn up for the university in 1792, it was already a large tree, and legend has it that Davie personally chose to locate the school lands around the tree after having a pleasant summer lunch underneath it. The story is not true – the university's location was chosen by a six-man committee in November 1792 – and the tree was named by Cornelia Phillips Spencer in the late 1800s to commemorate the legend. Davie Poplar III, planted in 1993 from the original tree's seeds The most enduring legend associated with the tree is that as long as Davie Poplar remains standing, the university will thrive; if it falls, the university will crumble. As such, many steps have been taken to preserve the tree. In 1918, after the tree was struck by lightning and fear that the tree was dying, UNC grafted a new tree, called Davie Poplar Jr. A second Davie Poplar Jr. was planted near Hinton James Hall. Later, another tree, called Davie Poplar III, was planted nearby with a seed from the original tree. A steel band was added to Davie Poplar in 1953 to attach cables to other trees, and the base has been filled with concrete and pruned to keep it upright. As part of the university's bicentennial celebration in 1993, 100 seedlings from the tree were given to 100 children planted across North Carolina's 100 counties. Where the trees were planted is not known, except for the Burke County seedling, which is in front of Table Rock Middle School. In 1996, Davie Poplar was damaged by Hurricane Fran. A fire was set and a small device was detonated at the base of Davie Poplar on November 2, 2017, producing a small fire ball and scorching the side of the tree. The explosion caused minor injuries to Dr. Daniel Reichart who tried to stomp out the fire.

Though Xlet looks superficially different from other application models in Java such as applet and MIDlet, it is actually meant to be a generalization of such models. The X in Xlet means an unknown, meaning that the Xlet framework may be used in any context rather than specific to Digital TV. Accordingly, Xlet was later re-introduced as a part of the Personal Basis Profile in the package, which is slightly different from the original design in the Java TV specification. The Xlet provision of a pause/resume feature is essential for a set-top box (STB) environment, which has limited memory resources and restrictions on bandwidth from the head-end provider.

Plastic card sleeves are devices used to protect trading cards, game cards, and collectible card game cards from wear and tear. The sleeves are an outer sheath of plastic into which a card is inserted. Varieties Thanks to the trading card industry, there developed a wide variety of protective devices, including the bulky \\"top-loader\\", a rigid plastic case with one open end (essentially a box for a single card) and the less-expensive simple \\"card sleeve,\\" a card-sized envelope of clear plastic, with one end open. Development Once collectible card games became popular after the advent of Magic: The Gathering, new technology was needed for two reasons. First, existing devices were not made with shuffling in mind: rigid top- loaders are effectively impossible to shuffle, and traditional card sleeves break easily during shuffling. Card sleeves also became more important because of Magic tournaments: cards that were worn were considered to be marked, and could not be used in tournament decks. The card sleeves themselves were also a potential a marking device: one drawback of traditional card sleeves was that they were typically slightly nonuniform, and therefore a potential way of marking cards in a deck on their own. Players with yellow sleeved Magic: the Gathering cards. History In 1995, the Ultra Pro company released the first card sleeves designed specifically for collectible card games, which they called deck protectors. Deck protectors were a tougher and more uniform version of traditional card sleeves, made of polypropylene, and specifically designed to snugly fit traditional cards. The first deck protectors were clear, but soon after, deck protectors were offered with opaque black backs, which would obscure the actual back of the card, allowing worn cards to be used without \\"marking\\" the deck. Other colors soon followed, and now a wide variety of deck protectors are available in many colors, and even with images on the back. These early sleeves would have the quality control problem of all the sleeves in the packet not being all evenly cut. Despite other companies like KMC and Player's Choice bringing this issue under control, it is still a common problem with many card sleeve manufacturers. Today, players can get card sleeves specifically designed for other trading card games like Yu-Gi- Oh!. With the popularity of card games in other countries, other companies such as Players' Choice, Dragon Shield, and Armor Shield have started making their own sleeves. With the increasing popularity of board games with game card components such as Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride and Dominion, Mayday Games launched card sleeves specifically for board games in 2008. These card sleeves are now offered in six sizes and two thicknesses for over 500 board games. In 2009 Fantasy Flight Games also entered the board-game card sleeve market with a line of premium thickness sleeves of its own. In tournament Modern tournament rules for most trading card games allows (or even mandate) the use of card sleeves, and consider the card sleeves (if opaque) to be the real \\"back\\" of the card for the purposes of marking. This is also mandated to help differentiate whose cards are whose at larger events.

It was originally built in 1966 on Colfax Ave. in Denver, named The Boardwalk at Coney Island. The first owner, Marcus Shannon had intended to start a chain of eateries around the concept, and obtained a patent for the design, but the eatery closed in 1969. In 1970, under new ownership, the stand was moved to the Rocky Mountain town of Aspen Park, along U.S. 285. Initially called Coney Island Dairy Land, it later dropped the last part of the name. Despite initial opposition, when it was put up for sale in 1999, a local campaign began to designate it a landmark and save it from destruction. The present owner purchased it for about $150,000 and added a state-of-the-art water purification system, a new secondary kitchen area and a complete restoration of the interior kitchen.

The organization is best known for publishing the quarterly NACLA Report on the Americas, and also publishes \\"books, anthologies and pamphlets for classroom and activist use\\". The NACLA Report on the Americas print magazine was briefly discontinued in 2015, but relaunched under the Taylor and Francis imprint Routledge in May 2016. For the last 50 years, NACLA has been a source of English-language news and analysis for journalists, policymakers, activists, students and scholars in North America and throughout the world. History=Founding In 1966, the founders consisted of civil rights, anti-war, and labor activists. The North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA) was established as a group that performed research for the leftist group Students for a Democratic Society. The group's founders were inspired by the Cuban Revolution and had a goal to challenge the elitist conventions expressed as \\"national interests\\" of the American people and to express the interests of those fundamentally opposed to American elitism. The first issue of NACLA Newsletter, the publication that was to become NACLA Report on the Americas, rolled off a mimeograph machine in New York in February 1967. The North American Congress on Latin America, its fledgling publisher, had just come together as a coalition of “New Left” student activists. The founders of NACLA used the term “congress” to draw upon the spirit of “Congress of Unrepresented People,” a contemporary group of civil rights, antiwar and labor activists who came together to challenge elite conceptions of the “national interest” as fundamentally opposed to the real interests of the majority of the American people. The new group, announced its organizers, would be a source of reliable information and analysis on Latin America that could be of use to activists. It would focus on systemic analyses of wealth and power in the Americas rather than on scandals or policy “mistakes.” It would be informed by a belief that what happened in the United States was integrally related to what happened in the rest of the world. In this context, NACLA's understanding of U.S. policies and power was formed by looking at the United States from a Latin American perspective, through a Latin American lens. The United States and Latin America were operating within the same system, and contradictions in that system were frequently bubbling up and becoming visible in Latin America first, particularly those involving U.S. interventions that violated Washington's self-declared democratic principles: the 1954 CIA-orchestrated overthrow of the reformist Arbenz regime in Guatemala; the 1961 invasion of Cuba's Bay of Pigs by a Florida-based anti-Castro mercenary force; the 1965 invasion and occupation of the Dominican Republic. Later, the 1973 overthrow of Salvador Allende's elected government in Chile and the U.S. role in the Central American wars of the 1980s would dominate NACLA's agenda. In NACLA's first year, the group was given free office space in the Presbyterian offices of the Interchurch Center in uptown Manhattan. Printing of the newsletter, promotional materials, stationery and small pamphlets was also underwritten by the Presbyterians. Those in-kind contributions aside, NACLA's first annual budget, including salaries, stood at just over $11,000. Sources of income were newsletter sales (about $200 per month) and grants from the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Division of Youth Ministries of the National Council of Churches. Few thought the group would survive long. 1970s–1990s The 1970s produced further research on United States (U.S.) involvement in the 1973 overthrow of Salvador Allende's elected government in Chile. The coup reinforced the American \\"fears\\" of socialism succeeding in America. That year, the NACLA report called \\"Facing the Blockade\\" documented President Richard Nixon's Administration's \\"invisible blockade\\" that denied Allende and his regime's \\"credit arrangements necessary for export-import operations\\". Salvador Allende responded to NACLA's book called New Chile in his speech to the United Nations by saying, \\"If you want to know how the U.S. has affected Chile, just read New Chile by NACLA.\\" In 1978, NACLA split into two groups, with one group moving to Oakland, California called the \\"Data Center\\". In the 1980s, NACLA's reporting focused on the United States' role in the Central American Wars of the 1980s. NACLA activists travelled frequently to El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala, studying conflicts in such areas. In the 1990s, NACLA stated that there was a pervasive culture of impunity in Latin America's new democracies. They highlighted the military consequences of the Drug War and criticized the neoliberal revolution occurring in Latin America. Rubén Zamora, a presidential candidate for the leftist Democratic Convergence in El Salvador, said that he regards NACLA as responsible for the better part of his political formation. During the darkest part of Haiti's military rule in the early 1990s, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's ambassador-in-exile to the United States, Jean Casimir, wrote to “express [his] gratitude to NACLA for its unflinching solidarity during this important period of our history.\\" Present Today, with Latin American leaders and social movements confronting what they call inequalities brought on by neoliberalism and rejecting the Washington Consensus, the growing movement for global justice pushes NACLA's intentions to take a prominent role just as it did in the 1970s and 1980s. Using the internet as an organizing tool and information portal, NACLA's website intends to provide coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean along with an analysis magazine, 50 years of archives, discussion forums, electronic newsletters, action alerts, links to social movements and organizations, and a media analysis project to examine mainstream coverage of the region. In 2006, the NACLA Report was rewarded with the Utne Independent Press Award for International Coverage. Since 2013, NACLA has partnered with the New York University Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, in the King Juan Carlos of Spain building, which houses NACLA's offices. After a brief pause in 2015, the NACLA Report on the Americas resumed publication in May 2016 as a quarterly publication published under the Taylor and Francis imprint Routledge. Content is managed by a small editorial staff and editorial board of academics, activists, journalists, and researchers. Programs and activities NACLA developed programs involving public debate and activism surrounding issues in the Americas. This includes its flagship publication, NACLA Report of the Americas, among other books, anthologies, and pamphlets. To support its bi-monthly newsletter, NACLA's site includes blogs, interviews, photo essays, its own radio department, and articles for investigative research and journalism. NACLA hosts and collaborates with various conferences, seminars, teach-ins, and workshops to bring journalists, students, scholars, and others together such as The Media Accuracy on Latin America project, which involved a network of participants that generate constructive media criticism on U.S. policy in the region. Magazine NACLA Report on the Americas is the political magazine produced by the North American Congress on Latin America. The journal describes itself as \\"the oldest and most widely read progressive magazine covering Latin America and its relationship with the United States\\". The magazine changed from bimonthly to quarterly in 2012. It ceased print publication in 2015. However, the magazine announced a return to print through a partnership with Routledge in April 2016. The relaunch of the magazine is set for May 27, 2016.NACLA returns print Format A standard issue began with several short pieces on Latin American and Caribbean current events followed by a series of longer in-depth articles grouped in a thematic section on a particular topic of Latin American affairs and/or U.S. policy toward the region. Each issue ended with a review section on books related to Latin American and Caribbean political themes. Analysis The Heritage Foundation stated in 1984 that NACLA \\"openly acknowledges its leftwing bias, even though other Latin American lobby groups have grown more circumspect\\" and that \\"despite the organization's theoretical ties to Marxist-Leninism, it can respond to the changing political realities of Capitol Hill\\". NACLA was also criticized by Brian Nelson, author of The Silence and the Scorpion, for having Gregory Wilpert and Michael Fox of the pro-Bolivarian government website Venezuelanalysis.com on their editorial team.

With the doubled period, it takes twice as many iterations as before for the numerical values visited by the system to repeat themselves. A period doubling cascade is a sequence of doublings and further doublings of the repeating period, as the parameter is adjusted further and further. Period doubling bifurcations can also occur in continuous dynamical systems, namely when a new limit cycle emerges from an existing limit cycle, and the period of the new limit cycle is twice that of the old one. Examples=Logistic map Bifurcation diagram for the logistic map. It shows the attractor values, like x_* and x'_*, as a function of the parameter r. Consider the following simple dynamics: x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n) where x_n, the value of x at time n, lies in the [0,1] interval and changes over time according to the parameter r\\\\in (0,4]. This classic example is a simplified version of the logistic map. For r between 1 and 3, x_n converges to the stable fixed point x_* = (r-1)/r. Then, for r between 3 and 3.44949, x_n converges to a permanent oscillation between two values x_* and x'_* that depend on r. As r grows larger, oscillations between 4 values, then 8, 16, 32, etc. appear. These period-doublings culminate at r \\\\approx 3.56995 from where more complex regimes appear. As r increases, there are some intervals where most starting values will converge to one or a small number of stable oscillations, such as near r=3.83. See figure. In the interval where the period is 2^n for some positive integer n, not all the points actually have period 2^n. These are single points, rather than intervals. These points are said to be in unstable orbits, since nearby points do not approach the same orbit as them. See Sharkovskii's theorem.

Credited with 44 aerial victories during World War I, he was one of Germany's leading flying aces, as well as commander of one of the first Imperial German Air Service Jagdeschwaders. Loerzer's close friendship with Hermann Goering led to Loerzer's service in the World War II Luftwaffe, with subsequent promotion to Generaloberst by the war's end. Goering described Loerzer as \\"his laziest general,\\" but swept aside criticisms of him, commenting \\"I need someone I can drink a bottle of red wine with in the evening.\\" Career=World War I May 1918 members of \\"Jasta\\" 26: Loerzer is in the middle; at far right Fritz Beckhardt Born in Berlin, Loerzer was a prewar army officer who learned to fly in 1914. Hermann Göring flew as Loerzer's observer from 28 October 1914 until late June 1915. Transferring to fighters, Loerzer flew with two in 1916 before joining Jagdstaffel 26 in January 1917. By then he had scored two victories over French aircraft. He had his aircraft painted distinctively striped in black and white. As his victory score mounted, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class and House Order of Hohenzollern. In November 1917, he and his squadron mate Goering each had 15 kills, and both still coveted the highest Prussian decoration - the blue enamel cross of the Pour le Mérite. Thirty years later, Loerzer would snicker to colleagues that Goering had inflated his mission claims. \\"Do the same,\\" Loerzer claimed Goering had urged him, \\"otherwise we'll never get ahead!\\" In fact Goerings claims were a modest 22 [half of Loezer claims] See \\"Under the Guns of the German Aces\\" His tally reached 20 victories at the end of October and he received the Pour le Mérite in February 1918. The same month, he took command of the newly formed Jagdgeschwader III, the third of Germany's famed \\"flying circuses.\\" His aces included his brother Fritz, who claimed 11 victories. Leading Jasta 26 and three other squadrons, with Hermann Dahlmann's support as adjutant and wingman, Loerzer proved a successful wing commander. Equipped with the new BMW-engined Fokker D.VII, JG III cut a wide swath through Allied formations in the summer of 1918, and his own score mounted steadily. He achieved his last ten victories in September when he reached his final score of 44 victories. Shortly before the armistice, he was promoted to (captain). Between the world wars Loerzer irregularly fought with anti-communist paramilitary units from December 1918 until March 1920. He commanded FA 427 in the Baltic area, supporting the in the tactical air role. During the 1930s he was a leader in various civil aviation organizations (National Socialist Flying Corps: NSFK), and rejoined the in 1935 with the rank of (colonel). Loerzer benefited from his long friendship with Göring, becoming Inspector of Fighters with rank of major general in 1938. World War II During the early war years he was commander of II Air Corps, being awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in May 1940. His II Air Corps participated in the invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, as a section of Kesselring's 2nd Air Fleet—in support of Field Marshal von Bock. His unit was transferred to Messina, Sicily in October 1941, and he remained there until the middle of 1943, when his section returned to the Italian mainland after suffering heavy losses. In December 1942, Fighter Ace Werner Baumbach, Group Commander of III/Kampfgeschwader 30, wrote a letter to Hans Jeschonnek, then Chief of the General Staff of the Luftwaffe, regarding the heavy losses suffered by the II Air Corps under Loerzer's leadership. Loerzer was removed from command of the II Air Corps in February 1943, and subsequently promoted by Goering to as Chief of the Luftwaffe Personnel Department and Chief of Personnel Armament and National Socialist Leadership of the Luftwaffe. Loerzer showed his gratitude on the occasion of the Reichsmarshall's birthday in January 1944, where he presented Goering with a carload of black market goods from Italy - women's stockings, soaps, and other rare items, complete with a price list in order to keep black market prices uniform throughout Germany. In December 1944 he was assigned to the Fuhrerreserve. He retired in April 1945, and was captured by the Americans in May 1945, and held until 1948. Postwar Loerzer died in Hamburg in 1960, at the age of 69.

The tombs at Sillustani are most famous. Recent research has focused on the connection between chullpas and the ritual pathways etched into the landscape around Nevado Sajama, as well as possible patterns within chullpa sites. Description Corpses in each tomb were typically placed in a fetal position along with some of their belongings, including clothing and common equipment. In virtually all cases, the only opening to the tomb faces the rising sun in the east. The construction of the chullpa varied with ethnic group: in general, those of the north Altiplano are circular and constructed with stone, while those of the south are rectangular and constructed with adobe. Some are unadorned, while others have intricate carvings. At Sillustani, many of the chullpas have lizards, which were considered a symbol of life because they could regenerate their tails, carved into the stone. Similar tombs It is possible that chullpas were also used by the Inca following their conquest of the Aymara.

In the context of the ICRS, a reference frame is the physical realization of a reference system, i.e., the reference frame is the set of reported coordinates of the reference sources, with the coordinates derived using the procedures spelled out by the ICRS. The ICRF creates a quasi-inertial frame of reference centered at the barycenter of the Solar System, whose axes are defined by the measured positions of extragalactic sources (mainly quasars) observed using very long baseline interferometry. Although general relativity implies that there are no true inertial frames around gravitating bodies, the ICRF is important because it does not exhibit any measurable angular motion since the extragalactic sources used to define the ICRF are so far away. The ICRF is now the standard reference frame used to define the positions of the planets (including the Earth) and other astronomical objects. ICRF1 The ICRF, now called ICRF1, was adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on 1 January 1998. ICRF1 had an angular noise floor of approximately 250 microarcseconds (µas) and a reference axis stability of approximately 20 µas; this was an order-of- magnitude improvement over the previous reference frame derived from Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5). The ICRF1 contains 212 defining sources and also contains positions of 396 additional non-defining sources for reference. The positions of these sources have been adjusted in later extensions to the catalogue. The ICRF1 agrees with the orientation of the Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5) \\"J2000.0\\" frame to within the (lower) precision of the latter. ICRF2 An updated reference frame ICRF2 was created in 2009. The update was a joint collaboration of the International Astronomical Union, the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, and the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry. ICRF2 is defined by the position of 295 compact radio sources (97 of which also define ICRF1). Alignment of ICRF2 with ICRF1-Ext2, the second extension of ICRF1, was made with 138 sources common to both reference frames. Including non-defining sources, it comprises 3414 sources measured using very-long-baseline interferometry. The ICRF2 has a noise floor of approximately 40 µas and an axis stability of approximately 10 µas. Maintenance of the ICRF2 will be accomplished by a set of 295 sources that have especially good positional stability and unambiguous spatial structure. The data used to derive the reference frame come from approximately 30 years of VLBI observations, from 1979 to 2009. Radio observations in both the S-band (2.3 GHz) and X-band (8.4 GHz) were recorded simultaneously to allow correction for ionospheric effects. The observations resulted in about 6.5 million group-delay measurements among pairs of telescopes. The group delays were processed with software that takes into account atmospheric and geophysical processes. The positions of the reference sources were treated as unknowns to be solved for by minimizing the mean squared error across group-delay measurements. The solution was constrained to be consistent with the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2008) and earth orientation parameters (EOP) systems. ICRF3 ICRF3 is the third major revision of the ICRF, and was adopted by the IAU in August 2018, to become effective 1 January 2019. The modeling incorporates the effect of the galactocentric acceleration of the solar system, a new feature over and above ICRF2. ICRF3 contains positions for 4536 extragalactic sources. Of these 303 have been identified as defining sources. ICRF3 also increases the number of defining sources in the southern sky.

Fifth of July. New York: Dramatists Play Service, 1982. Set in rural Missouri in 1977, it revolves around the Talley family and their friends, and focuses on the disillusionment in the wake of the Vietnam War. It premiered on Broadway in 1980 and was later produced as a made-for-television movie. The play is part of the Talley Trilogy, a series of Wilson plays revolving around the Talley family of Lebanon, Missouri. The other plays, both set on July 4, 1944, are Talley's Folly, a one-act dialogue between Sally Talley and her husband-to-be, Matthew Friedman, and Talley & Son, the story of a power struggle between Sally's father and grandfather. Plot summary Kenneth Talley Jr. is a gay paraplegic Vietnam veteran living in his childhood home with his boyfriend, botanist Jed Jenkins. At the beginning of the play, he is due to return to his former high school to teach English, but has decided not to. Visiting Ken and Jed are Ken's sister, June Talley, and her daughter, Shirley, as well as Ken and June's longtime friends, John Landis and his wife Gwen, inheritor of a large industrial copper conglomerate. John is ostensibly visiting to purchase the Talley house for Gwen to convert to a recording studio, so that she can have a career as a country singer. Unbeknownst to anyone but June, John and Ken, Shirley is actually John's daughter, and the visit is also his attempt to gain joint custody of Shirley. Ken, meanwhile, believes that the singing career is a way of distracting Gwen so that John can take over her business. Other visitors include Weston Hurley, Gwen's guitarist, and Ken's aunt, Sally Talley, who still has her husband Matt's ashes in a candy box a year after his death. The play culminates with a \\"bidding war\\" between Sally and John for the house, after it is revealed that Ken planned on selling it to Landis. Sally ultimately outbids Landis and says she will give the house to Jed so he can finish his garden. Production history Fifth of July debuted off-Broadway at the Circle Repertory Company on April 27 and closed on October 1, 1978. Directed by Marshall W. Mason, the cast starred William Hurt as Kenneth Talley Jr., Jeff Daniels, Amy Wright, Danton Stone, and Jonathan Hogan, who also composed the incidental music for the production. The production was designed by John Lee Beatty. It ran for 159 performances.\\"'Fifth of July' 1978\\" Lortel Archives. Accessed September 4, 2015. The play made its Broadway debut at the New Apollo Theatre on November 5, 1980, directed by Mason with Daniels reprising the role of Jed, Christopher Reeve as Ken, and Swoosie Kurtz as Gwen. Replacement actors for the role of Ken included Richard Thomas, Michael O'Keefe, Timothy Bottoms, and his brother Joseph Bottoms. Laraine Newman replaced Kurtz as Gwen. Kathy Bates was also a replacement, in the role of June. A television film was made in 1982, directed by Mason and Kirk Browning. The film stars Daniels, Kurtz, Hogan, Stone, Cynthia Nixon, Joyce Reehling, Helen Stenborg, and Richard Thomas as Ken, the role in which he succeeded Reeve on Broadway. A revival, starring Robert Sean Leonard as Ken and Parker Posey as Gwen, was included in the Signature Theater Company's 2002-2003 tribute season to Wilson.

He was born on 29 January 1912 in Bila Tserkva, Ukraine, and died on 19 November 1981. He lived in Lochearnhead, Scotland, before moving to Somerset, England, where he settled in Glastonbury. Biography Axel Firsoff held an MA degree in languages and worked as a Swedish translator and in the United Kingdom Patent Office. He was a keen mountaineer and skier, as some of his earlier books reveal, and he was a ski instructor for the British Olympic Ski Team in the 1950s. He developed an interest in science, in particular geology and astronomy and this led him to publish numerous books on the moon and inner planets. Many of his books also touched on extraterrestrial life and the nature of the mind. In Life, Mind and Galaxies, he speculated that \\"mind seems to be an entity of the same order as energy and matter\\", an idea well before its time. In other aspects of his work, such as the nature of the lunar craters, which he considered to be of volcanic rather than cosmological origin, he was later proved to be well wide of the mark. Honors Firsoff crater, located in Meridiani Planum on the planet Mars, is named in Firsoff's honor. Firsoff Crater is located at 2.63° North, 350.58° East.

Despite characteristics of an efficient embers are not directly known, trees bark is generally considered the most dangerous source in Australia. This led to the definition of a categorical classification (Bark Hazard) used to evaluate the potential threat of ember attack. The Stringybark species of Eucalypt is particularly notorious for contributing large flaming sections of bark that due to their size, weight and shape, can be carried up to several kilometres away. The movements of embers from a bushfire are the primary cause of spot fires, which contribute to the continued spread of a bushfire. Fire spotting due to embers Embers landed on a well irrigated lawn (black material). The heat from embers caused the yellowing of the grass. Ember attack can ignite additional fires ahead of the main fire front. This process is called fire spotting and occurs predominantly with two distinct spatial patters: * Short distance spotting, where the concentration of spot fires decreases with increasing distance from the ember source. This pattern is generally associated with embers falling from the convective plume due to its turbulence * Long distance spotting, where fire spotting occurs in distinct and isolated groups at varying distance from the fire front. This is generally associated with the collapse of the pyrocumulus generated by intense fires The likelihood of ignition caused by embers is a function of several environmental variables and ember characteristics, including: * Ambient temperature * Relative humidity * Receiving fuel moisture content * Wind intensity * Ember material, including its density * Ember geometry, including shape, aspect ratio, surface area Effect on firefighting Ember attacks have the potential to start small fires ahead of the main fire trapping firefighters between the two fires. They can also lodge themselves within firefighting equipment, clothing and vehicles. In late 2019, a fire truck caught fire in an ember attack in the Currowan bushfire in New South Wales, Australia. Fortunately, the fire team made it out alive. Ember attacks are particularly dangerous to an individual's exposed skin and face. Effect on property Wood fence damaged due to ember. The horizontal wood beam offered a combustible landing area for the ember to sit and ignite the material Embers account for 75-80% of total property loss in Australia Direct ignition of structures due to ember is possible, for example: * due to embers entering the property through gaps, vents, windows and doors. This can land to highly combustible material (for example carpet) and start the structural fire * due to embers landing in gaps within combustible material, for example between the decking boards spacing and on top of deck bearers However, the majority of property loss happens due to secondary ignitions, for example: * ignition of garden furniture, house mats, fire wood piles * ignition of garden litter, for example within roof gutters or under the house * ignition of other structures like sheds, wood fences, cars. This is often referred as consequential fire Embers commonly cause house loss up to 500 meters from the fire front, and in exceptional circumstances up to kilometers In Australia, evaporative air conditioners are known to ignite from ember attack. Ember attack causes the filter pads from evaporative AC to ignite, and the fire spreads through the roof space destroying the home. Ember guards (also known as ash screens) are recommended to protect air conditioners from ember attack.

Located in the centre of Tallinn, the capital city of Estonia, Tallinn University is one of the three largest institutions of higher education in the country. Both QS World University and Times Higher Education rankings place it among the top 1000 universities in the world. History Tallinn University's predecessor, Tallinn Teachers' Seminar, was founded in 1919. Tallinn University in its present form was established on 18 March 2005 as the result of a merger of several universities and research institutions in Tallinn: Academic Library of Estonia (1946), Baltic Film and Media School (1992/97), Estonian Institute of Humanities (1988), Institute of History (1946) and Tallinn Pedagogical University (1919/52/92). In 2015, Tallinn University underwent a structural reform, whereby its 20+ structural units (the legacy of the numerous mergers leading to its establishment) were reorganized into six schools in order to optimize funding and eliminate overlap between units in research and teaching. Academics As of 2016, about 8,000 degree students were enrolled at Tallinn University (with over 13,000 more taking part in continuing education programmes). This makes Tallinn University the third largest provider of higher education in Estonia. Among degree students, 8.7% were international. There are 837 full-time employees at the University, of which 409 are academic staff. 11.1% of the faculty are international. Education and research at Tallinn University focus on five core interdisciplinary fields: educational innovation, digital and media culture, cultural competences, healthy and sustainable lifestyle and society and open governance. Each of the fields is represented by a school of the University: School of Educational Sciences, Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School; School of Humanities, School of Natural Sciences and Health, and School of Governance, Law and Society. The School of Digital Technologies is the sixth school, contributing to all of the fields. Tallinn University's Baltic Film, Media, Arts and Communication School is the only institution in Northern Europe teaching film, television and audiovisual production in English, and one of the largest film schools in the region.

Outside Portugal, they are particularly popular in other parts of Western Europe, Asia and former Portuguese colonies, such as Brazil and Macau. The Macanese Pastel de nata was also adopted by KFC and is available in countries such as mainland China and Taiwan. In Indonesia, this pastry is also quite popular, especially in Kampung Tugu (Jakarta), an ethnic Portuguese (Mardijker) enclave. History The pastéis de nata were created before the 18th century by Catholic monks at the Hieronymites Monastery () in the civil parish of Saint Mary of Bethlehem, in Lisbon.Pastéis de nata were created before the 18th century by Catholic monks at the Jerónimos Monastery () At the time, convents and monasteries used large quantities of egg-whites for starching clothes, such as friars and nuns' religious habits. It was quite common for monasteries and convents to use the leftover egg yolks to make cakes and pastries, resulting in the proliferation of sweet pastry recipes throughout the country. Following the extinction of the religious orders and in the face of the impending closure of many of the convents and monasteries in the aftermath of the Liberal Revolution of 1820, the monks started selling pastéis de nata at a nearby sugar refinery to bring in some revenue. In 1834, the monastery was closed and the recipe was sold to the sugar refinery, whose owners in 1837 opened the Fábrica de Pastéis de Belém. The descendants own the business to this day. In 2009 The Guardian listed pastéis de Belém as one of the 50 \\"best things to eat\\" in the world.  Japanese cuisine  The cuisine of Japan was heavily influenced by Portuguese traders during the 16th century. Notable Japanese baked goods including pan (), called pão in Portuguese, and castella have their origins in this period. Pastel de nata is one of these. In addition to the traditional form of the pastry, some variations have been developed especially for the Japanese market by adding green tea flavoring. This green tea pastel de nata was eventually exported to South Korea and other Asian markets.

It requires the Department of Defense to establish education and training standards, requirements, and courses for the civilian and military workforce. The DAWIA has been subsequently modified by amendments to the USC Title 10 Chapter 87. Background In 1985, the DoD called for an extensive review of the education and training functions. At the same time, President Reagan established the Packard Commission to review the management of the DoD. Both studies indicated that acquisition workers were undertrained and inexperienced, resulting in the enactment of DAWIA as part of the FY 1991 National Defense Authorization Act. Content The DoD Directive 5000 series set forth a unified approach that all services were to follow. As part of this the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) was established, a unified consortium of previously separate services and separate courses.

It is the capital of Poddębice County. Population is 7,630 (2016). Jewish Population At the beginning of World War II, the Jewish population of Poddębice numbered around 1400. During the occupation, they were confined to a ghetto and subject to forced labor. In 1942, five were hung publicly and in April, 1800 Jews, including several hundred forcibly resettled from Leczyca, were confined in a church for ten days without any essentials, including food until a bribe was paid. Ten died there. After a few days, the sick and the elderly were then murdered nearby. After ten days, some skilled workers were sent to the Lodz ghetto. All the remainder were sent to the Chelmno killing camp where they were immediately gassed. Few of Poddębice's Jews survived the war. The German administrator of Poddębice (probably Franz Heinrich Bock) kept a secret diary published after the war. His diary was critical of the anti- Jewish policies. He had tried to help the Jewish population when he could. He was removed from his post during the war.

For the fictional Paul Bäumer, see All Quiet on the Western Front. For the late member of electronic music group Bingo Players, see Bingo Players Paul Wilhelm Bäumer (11 May 1896 – 15 July 1927) was a German fighter ace in World War I. Background Bäumer was born on 11 May 1896 in Duisburg, Germany. He was a dental assistant before World War I, and earned a private pilot's license by Summer 1914.Franks et al 1993, pp. 66–67. Involvement in World War I  At the start of the war, he joined the 70th Infantry Regiment. He served in both France and Russia, being wounded in the arm in the latter. He then transferred to the air service as a dental assistant before being accepted for military pilot training. By October 1916, he was serving as a ferry pilot and instructor at Armee Flugpark 1. On 19 February 1917, he was promoted to Gefreiter. On 26 March, he was assigned to Flieger Abteilung 7; he was promoted to Unteroffizier on the 29th. On 15 May 1917, he was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. He subsequently received training on single-seaters, consequently being posted to fighter duty. Bäumer joined Jagdstaffel 5 on 30 June 1917, scoring three victories as a balloon buster in mid-July before going to the elite Jasta Boelcke. Albatros D.V of Paul Bäumer while with Jagdstaffel 5 Bäumer claimed heavily, reaching 18 victories by year end. He was commissioned in April 1918. On 29 May Bäumer was injured in a crash, breaking his jaw, and he returned to the Jasta in September. With the arrival of the Fokker D.VII he claimed even more success, including 16 in September. Nicknamed \\"The Iron Eagle\\", he flew with a personal emblem of an Edelweiss on his aircraft. He was one of the few pilots in World War I whose lives were saved by parachute deployment, when he was shot down in flames in September. He received the Pour le Mérite shortly before the Armistice and was finally credited with 43 victories, ranking ninth among German aces. Post-War Career After the war, Bäumer worked briefly in the dockyards before he became a dentist, and reportedly one of his patients, Erich Maria Remarque, used Bäumer's name for the protagonist of his antiwar novel All Quiet on the Western Front. Continuing his interest in flying, he founded his own aircraft company in Hamburg. Bäumer died in an air crash at Copenhagen on 15 July 1927, age 31, while test flying a Rohrbach Ro IX fighter.

It has an enrollment of approximately 1200 students in grades 9-12. The students it serves come from Holland, Sylvania Township, Maumee, Spencer Township, Toledo, and most of Springfield Township.  Early history  The first school house in Springfield Township was a log cabin on the south side of Angola Road between McCord and Clark Street. Land for more schools was deeded to the township. The Eight Square School on Garden Road in 1846; the Red School on Holloway Road in 1847; the Green School on Holland-Sylvania in 1847; Starr School at Crissey in 1848 and Clark Street School in 1847. In 1893 a new three winged school house for grades 1-12 was completed. It was located where our current Holland Elementary now stands on Kittle Road and Madison Street. Leo Jacobs was the first principal. By 1921 Holland had a centralized school system with nine teachers and 300 students. The library consisted of 261 volumes and a school bus fleet of two and the school budget for 1921 was $15000. In 1925 a grassroots effort took place to fund a gymnasium. With the help of the Manual Training Boys and several generous citizens, the gymnasium was built for entertainment and sport events. Then, seating capacity was 1,350. It was the largest auditorium in Lucas County. It housed the music department in the 1950s-1970s. From the 1970s through 1980 this building housed the district's Administration offices. On January 21, 1938, the community held a dedication ceremony for the most modern high school in Lucas County. The estimated cost of the project was $150,000. Touted as \\"the most modern building in Lucas County\\", the high school was complete with clocks in all classrooms, the latest in visual education and sound equipment, a cafeteria and cafeteria kitchen, a modern stage, the latest improved typewriters, the most modern and up-to-date heating and ventilating system, a separate library room, individual steel lockers, a girls' rest room, and chair storage. The graduating class for that year numbered 26. This remained the high school until 1968. Since 1968 this building has housed Springfield Middle School. Many additions have also been made to this building, which is now connected to the renovated Holland Elementary School.  Springfield High School  In 1960 Holland Schools became Springfield Schools and changed its high school mascot from the Holland Blue Zippers to the Springfield Blue Devils. When offered the opportunity to select their new mascot, Springfield High School students conducted research, learned of the honor associated with the Chasseurs Alpins regiment from France during World War I (known as \\"les diables bleus\\" or \\"blue devils\\"), and the Blue Devils from Duke University, and recommended in the early 1950s that the mascot be changed from the Blue Zippers to the Blue Devils. That was also the year that the school colors changed from blue and gold to blue and white. In 1960, students Judy and Mary Frumpkin, along with Connie Sherman, wrote the lyrics to the song \\"Stand Up And Cheer\\" song that is still played by the band and sung today. Students started attending the \\"new\\" high school in 1968. This building still houses the current high school, but has also enjoyed many renovations and additions since 1968. Springfield High School now has a field house, gymnasium, the Tombaugh Auditorium/theater that seats 800, a media center that holds 13,000 volumes, 68 classrooms and two computer labs. Voter approval of a \\"no new tax\\" bond levy in November 2007 also allowed the district to add classrooms and updated fitness facilities to Springfield High School, an off-street loop for bus transportation at the high school and middle school, and additional parking for Springfield Middle School and Holland Elementary School guests.  Current building  In 1967, SHS moved again to its current location at 1470 S. McCord in Holland. This location sits behind the old building. When the new building first opened it housed only grades 10-12. In 1974, the building was expanded and welcomed the ninth grade. The building has been expanded two more times, once in 1988 and again in 1993. The 1993 expansion included a new media center, 12 classrooms, a section where the school can be expanded to a second floor, and a new gym called the field house. In 1984 Springfield High School established Army JROTC. It is the only one in the area and one of only six in the State of Ohio. It is most noted for its outstanding drill team, which has received numerous awards, and attended several national competitions over the past several years.  Blue Devil Band  The Blue Devil Band goes to many different parades and events. The band has marched in several major parades, including the Indianapolis 500 Parade, the Electric Parade in Downtown Disney, and several others. Many students participate in local and national honor bands including the OMEA District I Honor Band, the BGSU Honor Band, and the Ohio State Honor Band. Athletics Springfield High School competes in the Northern Lakes League, made up of schools in northwest Ohio. SHS joined the league in 1962.

He was considered by the Soviet government to be a representative of Soviet Jews. Early years  Dimanstein was born in Sebezh, Vitebsk Governorate (today Pskov Oblast) in a Litvak family of a trader. He studied in a Chabad yeshiva where eighteen-year Semyon was ordained as a rabbi. He suffered from poverty and homelessness, and gradually abandoned his religious upbringing in favor of revolutionary activities.  Pre-Revolution Socialist activities  In 1904 Dimanstein became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in Vilnius. In political debates, he often clashed with Jewish Socialist Party, Bund and Zionist parties. After the range of the government repression in 1908, he was sentenced to life settlement in the Irkutsk region. Dimanstein escaped and left the Russian Empire for France until the March Revolution 1917. Party career At that time Russia was at war and Dimanstein was a propagandist of a peace treaty. He was one of the editors of Trench Truth (Окопной правды). Dimanstein played a significant role during the Bolshevik October Revolution in 1917. He was appointed a head of Yevsektsiya in January 1918. In 1920 Dimanstein was sent to Bukhara People's Soviet Republic where he established Soviet institutions and supported creation of a local Party-approved elite. In 1922-1924 Dimanstein worked in the Agitation Department of Ukraine. In 1924 he returned to Moscow where he headed different propaganda departments which aimed to spread Soviet ideology among non-Russian peoples. Dimanstein was an editor of New East and Revolution and Nationality. He was a steady supporter of Stalin's policies. His last appointment was as head of the Central Committee of OZET. He was also editor of the Yiddish language newspaper Der Emes (The Truth). Semyon Dimanstein advocated the establishment of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast the Russian Far East. In 1930 he published in media against the collectivization of Jewish settlements in Jewish national districts of Southern Ukraine and Northern Crimea. In 1935 Dimanstein was an editor of a propaganda book entitled Yidn in FSSR (Jews in the Soviet Union). From October 1936, Dimanstein was one of the editors of Forpost, a newspaper in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast's capital city of Birobidzhan.  Death  On 21 February 1938, Dimanstein was arrested. He received a death sentence on 20 August 1938 and was executed. He was rehabilitated posthumously on 13 August 1955, two years after the death of Stalin.

Though he wrote for various ensembles, Rouse is primarily known for his orchestral compositions, including a Requiem, a dozen concertos, and six symphonies. His work received numerous accolades, including the Kennedy Center Friedheim Award, the Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition, and the Pulitzer Prize for Music. He also served as the composer-in-residence for the New York Philharmonic from 2012 to 2015. Biography Rouse was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Christopher Rouse Jr., a salesman at Pitney Bowes, and Margorie or Margery Rouse, a radiology secretary. He studied with Richard Hoffmann at Oberlin Conservatory of Music, graduating in 1971. He later completed graduate degrees under Karel Husa at Cornell University in 1977. In between, Rouse studied privately with George Crumb. Early recognition came from the BMI Foundation's BMI Student Composer Awards in 1972 and 1973. Rouse taught at the University of Michigan from 1978 to 1981, where he was also a Junior Fellow in the University's Society of Fellows and at the Eastman School of Music from 1981 to 2002. Beginning in 1997, he taught at the Juilliard School. Rouse's Symphony No. 1 was awarded the Kennedy Center Friedheim Award in 1988, and his Trombone Concerto was awarded the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 2002, Rouse was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Also in that year, he won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition for his Concert de Gaudí. In 2009, Rouse was named Musical America's Composer of the Year and the New York Philharmonic's Composer-in-Residence in 2012. Rouse also served as Composer-in-Residence with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (1985–88), the Tanglewood Music Festival (1997), the Helsinki Biennale (1997), the Pacific Music Festival (1998), and the Aspen Music Festival (annually since 2000). His notable students included Kamran Ince, Marc Mellits, Michael Torke, Lawrence Wilde, Nico Muhly, Robert Paterson, Jeff Beal, Jude Vaclavik, Kevin Puts, D. J. Sparr, and Joseph Lukasik. Rouse died on September 21, 2019 from complications of renal cancer in Towson, Maryland at the age of 70. Personal life Rouse was married twice, first to Ann Rouse (née Jensen) in 1983 and then in 2016 to Natasha Rouse (née Miller). Rouse had four children, Angela, Jillian, Alexandra, and Adrian. Music Rouse was a neoromantic composer. Some of his works were predominantly atonal (Gorgon, Concerto for Orchestra) while others are clearly tonal (Karolju, Rapture, Supplica). Most often he sought to integrate tonal and non-tonal harmonic worlds, as in his concerti for flute, oboe, and guitar. All of his music was composed, in his words, \\"to convey a sense of expressive urgency.\\" Rouse was praised for his orchestration, particularly with percussion. He often quoted other composers' works (e.g., his Symphony No. 1, composed in 1986, incorporates quotations of Bruckner and Shostakovich).Rouse, Christopher. Symphony No. 1: Program Note by the Composer. 1986. Retrieved March 4, 2015. Rouse's oldest extant works are two brief pieces for percussion ensemble, both inspired by mythological subjects: Ogoun Badagris (1976, Haitian) and Ku-Ka-Ilimoku (1978, Polynesian); a later percussion score inspired by rock drumming, Bonham was composed in 1988. The death of Leonard Bernstein in 1990 was the first in a series of deaths that made a profound impression on Rouse, and his Trombone Concerto (1991) became the first score of his so-called \\"Death Cycle,\\" a group of pieces that all served as reactions to these deaths. These scores memorialized William Schuman (Violoncello Concerto—1992), the James Bulger murder (Flute Concerto—1993), the composer Stephen Albert (Symphony No. 2—1994), and Rouse's mother (Envoi—1995). After Envoi he purposely set out to compose scores that were more \\"light infused\\", works intended to take on a less dark cast; pieces from this second half of the 1990s include Compline (1996), Kabir Padavali (1997), the Concert de Gaudí (1999), Seeing (1998), and Rapture (2000). Beginning in 2000, Rouse created works of varying moods, from his thorny Clarinet Concerto (2001) to his rock-infused The Nevill Feast (2003) to his romantic Oboe Concerto (2004). The most significant piece from these years was his ninety-minute Requiem, composed over 2001 and 2002. Rouse himself referred to the Requiem as his best composition. Major compositions of more recent vintage included his Concerto for Orchestra (2008), Odna Zhizn (2009), Symphony No. 3 (2011), Symphony No. 4 (2013), Thunderstuck (2013), Heimdall's Trumpet (a trumpet concerto—2012), Organ Concerto (2014), Symphony No. 5 (2015), Bassoon Concerto (2017), and Berceuse Infinie (2017). In late 2006, Rouse composed the wind ensemble piece Wolf Rounds, which premiered in Carnegie Hall March 29, 2007. Legacy Excerpts from Symphonies 1, 2 and 4, and Concerto per corde were used as the soundtrack to William Friedkin's 2017 film The Devil and Father Amorth.

Located in Jefferson County, it is part of Deschutes National Forest. Black Butte forms part of the Cascade volcanic arc. The butte lies just south of the Metolius Springs, which merge to form the headwaters of the Metolius River. The Metolius River's basin sustains a wide array of plant life, large and small mammals, and more than 80 bird species. Black Butte last erupted during the Pleistocene; geologists have estimated its age at 0.4, 0.5, and 1.43 ± 0.33 million years ago. The duration of the eruptions that built the volcano remains unclear, though the activity likely coincided with large-scale block faulting in the vicinity of the Metolius Springs. Black Butte has a prominent volcanic cone and is made up of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) basaltic andesite lava. Despite having a well-preserved, symmetrical shape and an unexposed pyroclastic core, the butte has undergone moderate erosion, with shallow ravines, deep gullies on its sides, and rocks with weathering rinds. A number of cinder cones and a volcanic field also lie nearby the butte. There was a fire lookout ground house on the butte, which was burned down by the United States Forest Service in 2016. A white cupola structure sits on the top of the butte as well as a more modern fire lookout tower. The resort community Black Butte Ranch lies nearby and offers recreational activities like horseback riding, biking, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, and paddleboarding; during the winter, activities include Nordic skiing and snowshoeing.  Geography  The summit of the butte with Three Fingered Jack in the distance. The fire lookout ground house in the foreground was burned down by the United States Forest Service in 2016. Black Butte lies about to the southeast of Mount Jefferson and about northwest of the junction of U.S. Route 126 and U.S. Route 20, at the western edge of the city of Sisters. The butte is part of Jefferson County in the U.S. state of Oregon. Other volcanoes such as Three Fingered Jack and Mount Washington lie about to the west. According to the U.S. National Geodetic Survey and scientists from the United States Geological Survey, Black Butte has an elevation of ; the Geographic Names Information System database lists its elevation as , while Oregon Geographic Names lists its elevation at . The butte has proximal and draping reliefs of and , which are the \\"difference between summit elevation and that of highest exposure of older rocks overlain by the edifice\\" and the \\"difference between summit elevation and that of lowest distal lavas of the edifice (not including distal pyroclastic or debris flows),\\" respectively. According to E. M. Taylor, Black Butte has a diameter of . The U.S. National Geodetic Survey report describes Black Butte as a \\"very prominent\\" mountain; it is an imposing feature and landmark in the Deschutes Valley because of its dark color and symmetry. Part of the Cascade volcanic arc in the northwestern United States, it lies within a rain shadow about to the east of the major mountain range. In the High Cascades, the equilibrium line altitudes for valley glaciers follow a gradient of about , which is significantly steeper than the gradient for the Western Cascades. Moving east, precipitation decreases across the Cascade arc; the gradient is even steeper east of the major crest at Black Butte, where the gradient is more than . W. E. Scott argues that the volcano displays no evidence of glaciation. Black Butte lies just south of the Metolius Springs, which lie in the southwestern corner of Jefferson County. Accessible by roads branching off U.S. Route 20, the springs are located about northwest of the cities of Bend and Redmond. Black Butte rises above the surrounding Metolius Valley, which has a width of about and an elevation above sea level of . At the volcano's northern base lie two openings spaced about apart, which give rise to the Metolius Springs. Bubbling out at a temperature of , the springs merge to form the headwaters of the Metolius River, generating a total flow of over the course of each year. The river runs for to the north and east before reaching the Deschutes River, picking up along the way from other springs and tributaries along the eastern Cascade Range. As glaciers advanced and retreated and snow fields formed over time, they caused erosion, which was carried by streams associated with the Metolius River to spread across the river valley's floor. The last of these glaciers existed until about 10,000 years ago, with their end points marked hummocks of debris. The glaciers formed glacial troughs, deposited moraines, and moved sand and gravel along with volcanic ash and cinders to cover the Metolius Valley floor. Black Butte lies about east–southeast of Suttle Lake, which occupies one of the local glacial troughs. Eruptions from Black Butte buried the ancestral Metolius River and left boulders of lava in the area, and Black Butte's formation dammed drainages for the Metolius, dividing the Metolius Valley into the northern segment where the river now runs and a southern portion that includes Black Butte Swamp, Glaze Meadow, and Indian Ford Creek. Black Butte Swamp and Glaze Meadow were likely formerly shallow lakes, though they now serve as sumps for streams and drainages from the Cascades, which are located to the southwest. Black Butte Swamp is a particularly important sump for extensive drainage from the southwest, its basin water lapping against Black Butte's southern base. Because it is elevated about above the Metolius Springs, the swamp acts as a hydraulic head for the spring water keeping the flow of the springs constant, and ensuring that there is a net influx of water into the swamp. Any excess water exits through Indian Ford Creek to flow east then south past the city of Sisters. In modern times, the Metolius Valley consists of glacial outwash, lava strata, and stream sediment, which together act as a sponge for snow and rain water percolating into the river basin.  Ecology  Wildflowers on Black Butte Black Butte lies east of the major crest of the Cascades, which is more arid compared to the Western Cascades. Two forest populations at Black Butte were analyzed in a 1975 study conducted by D. B. Zobel of Oregon State University. These forest areas included ponderosa pine and tree species intermediate to grand and white firs. The study found that trees at Black Butte did not experience significant moisture stress and that photosynthesis rates during dry summer seasons were more reduced at tree sites in the Western Cascades compared to at Black Butte. Black Butte was found to have a shorter growing season and less favorable winter temperatures for photosynthesis at its forest sites than study areas in the Western Cascade Province. Along the trail that runs up Black Butte, the forest is diverse, with yellow-bellied ponderosa pines, mixed conifers, and subalpine vegetation. Black Butte is part of the Deschutes National Forest, which covers close to in central Oregon. It is also part of the Metolius Black Butte Scenic area within the Metolius Conservation Area, which encompasses about and includes suitable habitat for northern goshawks. The Metolius River passes through old-growth forests of ponderosa pine, as well as forests of Douglas fir and western larch. Every May native plants and wildflowers appear, including early blue violets, larkspur, serviceberry, Sitka valerian, and western buttercups. During the summer season, river trails more prominently display plant species like arrowleaf balsamroot, American brooklime, bigleaf lupine, Douglas's spirea, Indian paintbrush, and monkeyflower plants. On islands in the river, wildflowers occasionally grow after their seeds bloom after falling into the water and accumulating over time. The area is noted for a rare species of Penstemon known as Penstemon peckii, a wildflower that appears in 7 different colors, which is endemic to the Sisters area. Other plants within the Metolius Preserve include incense cedar trees, nutka rose, ocean spray, snowberry, and vine maple trees. More than 80 species of bird inhabit the Metolius Preserve area such as the white-headed woodpecker. The area supports large mammals like American black bears, badgers, bobcats, beavers, deer, cougars, elk, and otters, as well as smaller mammals like northern flying squirrels, shrews, and voles.  Geology  In the Oregon segment of the Cascade Volcanoes that runs for south of Mount Hood, there are at least 1,054 Quaternary volcanoes, which form a volcanic belt in width. This volcanic belt extends up to to the north of the border with California, where Quaternary volcanic activity is interrupted by a gap up to the Quaternary volcanoes near Mount Shasta. The Quaternary volcanoes within the Oregon Cascades are extremely dense, concentrated within an area of about . Rocks within the Metolius Springs area form part of the High Cascades province and include both volcanic and glaciofluvial deposits. Black Butte marks the edge of the Sisters fault zone, which includes about 50 known faults that extend southeast through the cities of Sisters and Bend. In total, the Sisters fault zone runs for in length, with its width varying between . Black Butte itself sits on a small fault that straddles the graben, and its lava deposits have been displaced slightly by a fault on the northwestern side of the volcano. To the north lies the Green Ridge fault scarp, which trends to north and rises about above the Metolius Valley. The fault's steep escarpment contains exposed, alternating layers of basaltic andesite, breccia, and agglomerate from shield volcanoes, which mark the oldest rocks in the area. They are of Pliocene age, overlying diatomite, pumice, and tuffaceous sandstone layers. Most of the volcanoes in the Oregon Cascades are either scoria cones, small shield volcanoes, or lava fields, though the segment contains a number of basaltic andesite stratovolcanoes such as Mount McLoughlin. Black Butte is one such stratovolcano (also known as a composite volcano), with a mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) composition. It is an extinct volcano. Also composed of basaltic andesite, the cone rises over the surrounding plateau. Black Butte is a striking feature just north of US Highway 20, which descends from the east flank of the Cascades. It is nearly symmetrical with a youthful profile, though it is actually older than any other visible High Cascades volcano. Black Butte is well-preserved due to a lack of glaciation east of the major Cascade arc. Black Butte has undergone mild erosion, with shallow ravines on its slopes, deep gullies on its sides, and rocks with weathering rinds. Black Butte forms a steep-sided volcanic cone, with an unexposed pyroclastic core and no summit crater. It is one of the larger mafic volcanic cones in the Oregon Cascades, with a volume of . Black Butte's composition is characteristic for the High Cascades, consisting of light to dark gray basaltic andesite rock with a fine to medium grain. The flanks of the volcano display outcrops of the lava, which are blocky and mixed with zones of breccia, suggesting the flows were slow-moving and were erupted from a central vent.  Nearby features  The Sixmile Butte lava field, of Pleistocene age, consists of ten cinder cones between Black Butte and Black Crater. These cones erupted basaltic andesite, which was deposited prior to the glacial advance at Suttle Lake. The field encompasses about . Lava deposits from nearby Cache Mountain have a normal magnetic polarity, corresponding to an potassium–argon dating age of 0.9 ± 0.05 million years, suggesting they were produced during the Jaramillo normal polarity of the Matuyama period between 0.98 and 1.04 million years ago. There is a chain of Pleistocene cinder cones east of the butte that trends from northwest to southeast, with other Pleistocene cinder cones located to the south. There is also a mafic, well-preserved cinder cone above the Green Ridge fault zone, which produced a Pleistocene lava flow.  Eruptive history  A study by Sherrod and his associates used potassium–argon dating to trace samples from Black Butte to 1.43 ± 0.33 million years ago, during the Matuyama Polarity Zone of reversed magnetic polarity. These dates superseded an earlier determination of 400,000 years, which was recognized as incorrect based on polarity magnetization of the lava; according to Peterson and Groh, E. M. Taylor also communicated an age of about 500,000 years for Black Butte from K–Ar dating of its rock. Large-scale block faulting in the vicinity of the Metolius Springs could have coincided with the beginning of volcanic activity in the High Cascades, which gradually progressed from building shield-shaped edifices to more violent eruptions. Volcanism resumed after the Green Ridge fault scarp reached its maximum height and fault movement ceased, occurring along a fault within the graben in the Metolius Springs vicinity. These eruptions built up Black Butte, though their duration is not clear. The magmas at Black Butte likely had to ascend through the Green Ridge fault. Sherrod and his associates described an ancient basaltic andesite deposit from the Pleistocene, which displays reverse polarity and is older than 0.78 million years. This deposit includes lava flows from Black Butte, which are slightly to moderately porphyritic in texture and exhibit 5–10 percent plagioclase phenocrysts, about in length. They also have 3–5 percent olivine phenocrysts, which are about across. Sherrod et al. also described two previously identified, reverse-polarized basaltic andesite lava deposits at Black Butte, with ages of 0.46 ± 0.30 and 0.48 ± 0.2 million years, respectively. The volcano's last known eruption was during the Pleistocene. However, some eruptive activity has continued in the High Cascades; there is one lava flow in the McKenzie Pass area to the west of Black Butte, which is only 1,500 years old.  Human history  A hiker on Black Butte Black Butte was a familiar landmark to the Native Americans. Ella E. Clark records a traditional story of the butte told to her by two Native Americans living on the Warm Springs Reservation, which had been told to them by their grandfathers. According to this tale, the mountains of Central Oregon were once people: Black Butte was the wife of nearby Green Ridge. Mount Hood and Mount Adams quarreled over a woman, and would regularly cross the Bridge of the Gods to fight. Coyote called the other mountains to come and help arbitrate the dispute. The mountains marched north, including Black Butte and Green Ridge. The trip tired Black Butte, and she stopped to rest at the head of the Metolius River; Green Mountain was annoyed that she had stopped, and laid down, pouting. Coyote decided he could wait no longer, and broke the Bridge of the Gods; this caused the mountains to remain where they had stopped.Clark, Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest (Berkeley: University of California, 1953), pp. 12f It is not known who gave Black Butte its modern name, though historical records show settlers calling the volcano by that name as early as 1855. Lieutenant H. L. Abbot, one of the engineers involved with the Pacific Railroad Surveys, referred to the volcano as Pivot Mountain in a diary entry published in the Oregon Historical Quarterly, though he also used the name Black Butte in the Pacific Railroad Surveys Reports. During his work for the surveys, Abbot scouted railroad routes in the area surrounding Black Butte, ultimately concluding that a railroad could not be built over the Cascade Range near Mount Jefferson. The butte had a fire lookout ground house, which was built in 1979 out of wood, though the butte has been used for fire detection since 1910. Fire lookout staff used the station to cook and sleep before it was condemned in 2014 and burned down in 2016 by the United States Forest Service, who released a statement that it \\"was ineligible for preservation as a historical structure both in time and because of improvements made.\\" Lookouts still work at Black Butte during the fire season but use a yurt (a type of portable tent) instead. There has been a white cupola structure on the top of the butte since 1923 and a more modern fire lookout tower, tall, which was built in 1995; neither are accessible to visitors.  Recreation  The land around Black Butte and the Metolius Springs is managed by the United States Forest Service, which has constructed a parking lot, trail, and viewpoint for the area. There are a number of famous fishing resorts and a popular recreation area nearby. Black Butte Ranch, which lies in Deschutes County within Deschutes National Forest, is a resort community that encompasses and offers recreational activities including horseback riding, biking, hiking, canoeing, kayaking, and paddleboarding; during the winter, the resort activities include Nordic skiing and snowshoeing. The Black Butte hiking trail runs for about from a trailhead up the butte. Trees thin in the second mile of the hike. The trailhead is particularly busy during the summer season with vehicles and hikers, though the hiking trail itself is for hikers only. The hike is popular and not demanding, climbing about to the peak, where Three Sisters, Mount Washington, and Mount Jefferson can be seen.

Coulson has also received praise for her vocal contributions, with her powerful delivery earning comparisons to Janis Joplin and Grace Slick. History Tragic Mulatto formed in 1982, initially consisting of Gail Coulson on saxophone, Alistair Shanks on bass guitar, Karl Konnerth on trumpet, Daved Marsh on vocals and Patrick Marsh on drums. The quintet recorded two records for Alternative Tentacles, an eponymously titled 7\\" single in 1983 and the EP Judo for the Blind in 1984. Konnerth and the Marsh brothers left the band afterward to pursue other interests. Coulson and Boyle became the core creative force behind the group and took the stage names Flatula Lee Roth and Reverend Elvister Shanksley respectively. The duo recruited guitarist Tim Carroll of The Dicks (Richard Skidmark) and recorded the album Locos por el Sexo in 1986. Representing a change in musical direction for the band, the album emphasized melody and \\"enough structural backbone to give the songs non-satirical legitimacy\\". Spin described them as sounding \\"like a throbbing punkoid cross between Frightwig, real early Jefferson Airplane, and a fertile war pig from Planet 9\\". The band changed guitarists and expanded their line-up to include dual percussionists for their second album titled Hot Man Pussy. The album included a cover of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" by Led Zeppelin and exhibited further musical maturity by the band. Their final release, Chartreuse Toulouse, incorporated psychedelic and Middle Eastern influences. Tragic Mulatto disbanded in 1990 after they had released their third album, with its members pursuing separate projects. Live performances The band was infamous for their deliberately perverse live performances, which sometimes consisted of its members performing lewd acts onstage. Lead vocalist Coulson was known to perform mostly naked, while adorning her breasts with duct tape, polyethylene food wrap and fried eggs, and clothespins. Boyle occasionally performed naked or used a Pink Panther puppet to cover his genitals.

An electron releasing group (ERG) or electron donating groups (EDGs) releases electrons into a reaction center and as such stabilizes electron deficient carbocations. An ERG can essentially promote groups into having a higher effect. These higher effects are defined as steric effects to a degree, however other effects include observations to changes in polarity, which can thus produce an entirely different molecule. This entirely different molecule is the ERG, plus whatever substituent was left behind. This is partially true but in truth the entirely different molecule is composed of parts and can be further differentiated and stabilized as separate molecules as well, although this can prove difficult for the beginner. Different steric effects can produce different molecules as well, and these essentially allow certain molecular formations to take themselves apart, and if this is done, then the ERG can be recognized as a separate molecule. This is difficult but can prove that ERGs form themselves not due to some type of separation but due to the fact that the presence of weak electronic sources, that an ERG must form. If it does not then the electron weak reaction center will fall apart, and return to its original formation, and thus the separation must occur due to the steric effect itself, and not the fact that the alcohols donate electrons, but due to the change in electrons that allows the center to remain stable without the need for the other molecules to be present (Examples). Examples of electron releasing groups are * alkyl groups; * alcohol groups; * amino groups. The total substituent effect is the combination of the polar effect and the combined steric effects. In electrophilic aromatic substitution and nucleophilic aromatic substitution substituents are divided into activating groups and deactivating groups where the direction of activation or deactivation is also taken into account.

Corporate history  In 1869, Baikuntha Natta inspired by his younger brother, Srinath Natta, came up with his venture in the entertainment industry. He named his group \\"Machrang Baikuntha Sangeet Samaj\\". The local people used to call the group – \\"Natta-der Dal\\" (translated Natta's group). As time passed by the name \\"Natta Company\\" became a well known name in Bengal’s folk theatre and then in stage theatre. In the early years the group used to perform in different Zamindar’s (landlord’s) palaces. As time passed on they started to perform in different villages, small towns and also in cities like Kolkata (Calcutta). The responsibilities came in the hands of Baikuntha Natta’s descendants – Mathuranath Natta and then Jagendranath and Radhendranath Natta. Natta Company is being managed by Sri Makhan Lal Natta, a man in his late 70s.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1051016/asp/look/story_5350432.asp The Telegraph - Calcutta : Look In the early 1950s, Natta Company started to use handbills for publicity. From the mid-1950s they started to publish their advertisements in the local magazines. As they moved to cities, they started to use the print media effectively for advertisements and promotion. They published their advertisements in different newspapers like – Jugantar, Ananda Bazar Patrika, Dainik Bosumoti, Swadhinata etc. In the early-1970s Natta Company became very popular in Bengal and Eastern Regions of India.  Corporate evolution  Natta Company started its journey in the nineteenth century in Bangladesh. It started from villages of Barisal known as Machrang and Pangiputhipara. At that time jatras, were based on stories, written on religious, mythological and historical plots. Different parts of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata were also performed. They performed in temple courtyards, narrating the events of their patron god's life, and expressed their devotion with frenzied acting. The collective singing amidst the clang of gongs and fumes produced a mass hypnosis and sent these singers into an acting trance. Natta Company became more popular for its musical presentations and their colorful and glittering outfits, which were the main attractions for the poor and illiterate rural audience. Moreover, as they were vastly familiar with the various religious and mythological stories, so the themes of palas were predominantly based on them. It stated venturing out to nearby towns and gradually to the cities like Dhaka, Barishal, Jashor, Khulna etc. The influence of regional variations in culture and language also enriched the contents of their palas. Socio-political environment always had a prominent effect on jatras. The influence of society helped the audience to relate themselves and their environment with the jatra. As political consciousness grew in pre-independence India, jatra writers started exploring the social and political scenario related to Indian freedom movement to find new ideas for their palas. Mythological stories, fights between good and evil, symbolised the Indian masses and the British. The Devil was dressed in the tight trousers and black jacket of the nineteenth century, and the Noble Prince wore the Indian dhoti. \\"Swadeshi Jatra\\", written by Mukunda Das, came when India and Bengal were going through a turbulent time. Natta Company, in their jatras, never confronted or criticised the political system directly. For this reason, at the times of swadeshi movement when the British were closing down different jatra group or banning different stage theatres and jatras, Natta Company was not affected. After the ‘Great Bengal Famine' of 1943, Natta Company performed the jatra pala – \\"Akaler Desh\\" which became very popular with the masses. In 1948, they made \\"Parashmani\\" to highlight the importance of educating women. In the 1960s, \\"Plaban\\" was made to focus on the different facets of the Zamindari system. The golden period of Natta Co. started from late-1960s and continued until the 1970s when they produced quite a few popular palas. Some of the other prominent palas from the Natta Co. were ‘Karunasindhu Vidyasagar', ‘Patiter Bhagaban'. But all throughout, they were always focused on quality offering and entertaining the common people. Monetary gains were never an important issue for them. Natta company's objective was not to earn money rather it was the a social responsibilities to educated the rural people and it was to entertain and to inform the general mass about the social scenario\\". The Juri system, which utilized surrogate singers for otherwise talented actors, continued till the first decade of the present century. By the second decade people were tired of the Juri because it continued for hours, spinning fine melodic gossamers that suspended the theatrical enjoyment. It had become a sort of an exercise in classical singing out of proportion to the drama. The public would taunt if the singers over did their long musical performance. Slowly it went into disrepute. Natta Company used actors who could sing very well. There was no concept of playback singing but in some cases chorus was used. Traditionally, all roles have been played by male actors. Some played young heroes, some vicious villains, some comic fools, some the Vivek (Conscience) and some specialise in female roles. Until the 1970s there was no actress in Natta Company. Male actors used to play the female character. Most actors add the suffix Rani (graceful lady) to their name to distinguish themselves as female artist. In ‘Patiter Bhagaban' Phani Bhattacharya, who plays the Queen Mother and Hari Gopal Das became famous as the best emotional \\"actress.\\" In the role of ‘Debi', wife of the cobbler saint in ‘Petiter Bhagwan'. He had twenty years of experience behind his feminine grace and wifely pathos. But, with the passing time, tastes change. To satisfy the changing taste of the audience Natta Company appointed actresses. Instruments like Harmonium, Cornet, Clarinet, Violin, Tabla, Dholak, etc. were played by experienced musicians, which enchanted the audience. In the beginning, Natta Company appointed writers who would write the prose, script, poems, songs and dialogs. Afterward with the increasing number of jatra troops, competition from different other players of the entertainment industry and due to the changing scenario writers were not appointed. Freelance writers and professional writers started to write for Natta Company on mutual contract. Natta Company always made it sure that the story is not copied from anyone or anywhere and it should be original. After the partition of India, Natta Company shifted permanently to Kolkata (Calcutta). Natta Company was already popular in Kolkata, so it was not very difficult to establish its popularity. In Kolkata, Natta Company started to perform in different theatres like – Star Theatre, Mahajati Sadan, Rang Mahal, Bidyamandir, Minarva etc. Renowned actors of Bengali film industry and stage-theatre worked with Natta Company and Makhan Lal Natta was a well known name in the Industry. As time moved on television, VCRs and VCPs came in. Increasing number of television channels and movie theatres were stealing away the popularity of jatra. Even in Calcutta where it was fast losing its ground, it cropped up in night in various squares and alleys. There is hardly a Bengali who in his childhood has not sat for hours watching the colorful jatra. Today a jatra pala, lasting four hours, consists of action-packed dialogue with only six to eight songs. Still it retains its musical character. People wait for the songs, which in their popularity compete with those from films. Among the people the form retains its name, \\"jatragan\\", which means \\"musical jatra.\\" When a Bengali goes to see a performance he says that he is going to \\"listen to\\" a jatra. Natta Company also focused on the rural sector of Bengal. They were mainly focused towards the audience of Purulia, Midnapur, Bankura. They also started to perform in various cities and towns of Assam, Tripura and part of Bihar.  Inside story  Natta Company consists of 70 to 75 people. The number of people varies on the requirement of the jatra. They open their season in September and perform nightly until the monsoon breaks in June. All the troupes are then disbanded, and the actors are free to join any company. The manager - the only person on permanent staff - spends the rest of his time clearing the accounts and sourcing good actors with offers for the next season. Each actor signs a seasonal contract for nine months and is given a pay advance. The jatra addicts know that the artistic standard of a company changes with the changes of actors. Surya Dutta, the Director-Producer of the Natta Company helped to maintain a sound artistic standard year after year, and for this Surya Dutta's personal magnetism was responsible. Some of the actors have been with him for thirty years, and that give the repertory a style and stability. Surya Dutta, affectionately called ‘Surya mama' by Makhan Lal Natta, was not only the guiding force behind Natta Company but also played the role of a mentor to many people associated with it including Makhan Lal Natta. The selection of actors and actresses are the most important part in this profession. The actors and actresses are given more priority who had worked with reputed jatra groups. However, for newcomers and not so famous actors and actresses, their audition is taken. The ability of voice modulation and tone is given high priority. The overall appearance of the person also has a lot of importance. Apart from actors and actresses, there are many other people as the supporting team member. The supporting team looks after the stage setup, green room, transport, cooking etc. The actors and actresses are provided with facilities like – cars and separate hotel rooms. The association of Natta Company and the Natta family cannot be separated. Makhan Natta who admits himself as a publicity adverse person, could have leveraged the Natta's legacy in jatra, through publicity and advertising. But the old man's eyes glitter with hope when he says – \\"It is just a slump. Jatra is an art, it shall never die\\".

A skating party held in Montreal to celebrate a visit to the city by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. Canadian monarchism is a movement for raising awareness of Canada's constitutional monarchy among the Canadian public, and advocating for its retention, countering republican and anti- monarchical reform as being generally revisionist, idealistic, and ultimately impracticable. Generally, Canadian monarchism runs counter to anti-monarchist republicanism, but not necessarily to the classical form of republicanism itself, as most monarchists in Canada support the constitutional variety of monarchy, sometimes referred to as a crowned republic. These beliefs can be expressed either individually—generally in academic circles—or through what are known as loyal societies, which include monarchist leagues, legions, historical groups, ethnic organizations, and sometimes police and scout bodies. Though there may be overlap, this concept should not be confused with royalism, the support of a particular monarch or dynasty; Canadian monarchists may appreciate the monarchy without thinking highly of the monarch. There have also been, from time to time, suggestions in favour of a uniquely Canadian monarch, either one headed by a descendant of the present monarch and resident in Canada or one based on a First Nations royal house. In Canada, monarchism, though it is sometimes mocked by its opponents, is driven by various factors: monarchists support the perceived practicality of popular power being ultimately placed in the hands of a non-partisan, apolitical individual, and see the Canadian monarchy as a modern link, via the Crown's shared nature, to ethnically and historically similar countries around the world. It is also celebrated by monarchists as being a significant element of Canada's national identity, stemming from the organization's 500 year deep roots in the country's tradition, as well as having a pivotal role in maintaining Canada's independence from the United States. Though a majority of polled individuals agree that the monarchy has a role as a Canadian identifier, as with its political counterpart, strong monarchism is not a prevalent element of contemporary Canadian society; according to surveys, the population is generally unaware of the existence of a monarch as their head of state. Andrew Coyne commented on monarchism: \\"In most countries loyalty to the head of state—that is, to the existing constitutional order—is the first duty of citizens. Here [in Canada] it is a kind of rebellion, the obsession of a radical fringe group dismissively referred to as 'monarchists'.\\" National identity A monument to the United Empire Loyalists in Hamilton, Ontario. Legal and cultural sovereigntyColonial era= From Canada's colonial period until the end of the Second World War, monarchism was prevalent among the region's inhabitants. Even after the transfer of New France to the British in 1763, a faction of the French-speaking population was loyal to the British Crown and its institutions of government, while the Catholic Church in Quebec fostered monarchism in a different form by urging its parishioners to appreciate the absolutist monarchy system that existed in France. The majority could be lured to neither the republicanism that boiled south of the border, nor to the revolution and regicide that took place in France in 1789. At the same time, those who remained loyal to the British monarchy and its empire during the American Revolutionary War faced repercussions then and after the conflict. By seeking refuge in the Canadas and settling much of what is now Ontario and the Maritimes, they, who came to be known as the United Empire Loyalists, brought with them their support for the Crown and gave root to the idea that the monarchy stood for \\"beliefs and institutions ... considered essential in the preservation of a form of life different from, and superior to, the manners, politics, and social arrangements of the United States.\\" Republicans were seen as being generally of American origin, having thus been taught to admire republican government as the best in the world and to ridicule monarchism, \\"a few individuals, who unfortunately, are led by those, whose hostility to the British constitution is such, that they would sacrifice any and every thing to pull it down, in order that they might build up a Republic on its ruins.\\" Predominantly, Canadians retained their loyalty to Britain's constitutional monarchy, a feeling that was only intensified by the American invasions of the Canadas in 1812. Further, the republican rebellions of 1837—with their significant minority of conservative followers who critiqued Canada's Westminster parliamentary constitutional monarchy as both too democratic and too tyrannical in comparison to their preferred American model of checks and balances—failed to inspire the majority of colonists to espouse a break with the Crown. The Orange Order played a role in maintaining this allegiance, as, after expressed fears that the order's establishment in Upper Canada would cause conflict between Protestants and Roman Catholics, in 1830 the Grand Orange Lodge of British America's first Grand Master, Ogle Robert Gowan, moved to diminish the organization's religious exclusivity and instead have the order exist partly to foster appreciation of the King and constitution. Casualties of the American Civil War in September 1862; the Canadian Fathers of Confederation blamed the conflict on weaknesses in the American republican system Fathers of Confederation at the Quebec Conference, October 1864 =A confederated Dominion= Monarchist feelings were further entrenched in many English Canadians' minds following the American Civil War, which was seen by them as \\"the final stage in the discredit of [American] democracy and republicanism.\\" Thus, by the time of Canada's formation in 1867, constitutional monarchy was, after their analysis of the American republic, unanimously selected by the Fathers of Confederationled by the monarchist John A. Macdonald, and including delegates from Quebecand approved of by the three elected legislatures of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. It was noted in the early 1960s by William Lewis Morton, in his attempt to clarify both the historic and continuing significance of the Canadian monarchy, that the structuring of Canada as a kingdom was not \\"bait for dim-witted Tory voters\\", but was instead a way for Canada to assert its presence in North America and thwart American expansionism into Canadian territories; the constitutional monarchy was meant as a balance between the autocracy of the Russian Empire and the popular sovereignty of the United States that had just led to the Civil War. Instead of the constitution being based on a promise between the state and the people, it was created around a form of allegiance, wherein, as Morton put it, \\"there was no pressure for uniformity ... Monarchy made it possible to achieve all these things, whereas republican democracy would, it seemed, have ensured the victory of local interests and race antagonisms in British North America, a victory ending in absorption into the United States. Still, republican idealsby their wider definitiondid have influence during the setting period of after Confederation, wherein the use of laws and the institutions formed by them was moulded by popular attitudes coexistent with monarchical preference. For instance, against the intentions of those who framed the constitution, the provinces began to regard themselves as homogeneous communities, each with a right to a certain amount of self- governance founded on a co-sovereign crown, a notion that was eventually cemented in by the 1882 Judicial Committee of the Privy Council case of Maritime Bank vs. Receiver-General of New Brunswick. =Post-Quebec sovereignty movement= The \\"almost cult status\\" the monarchy enjoyed in the first half of the 20th century began to waver between the 1950s and 1970s, as the British Empire evolved into the Commonwealth of Nations and a new Canadian identity emerged, multiculturalism was established as an official policy in Canada, and Quebec separatism began to blossom; the latter becoming the major impetus of political controversy around the Crown. Prime Ministers Louis St. Laurent and Lester B. Pearson both saw the Crown as a Canadian icon making the country distinct from the US; indeed, Queen Elizabeth II's royal tour of 1959 was said by the Financial Post to be a demonstration that Canada was \\"not just the fifty first state of the Union,\\" and even amongst the various letters sent to newspapers denouncing the lack of fully Canadian symbols available for use, few called for abolition of the monarchy, most Canadians seeing a need for their country to have a form of government different from that of the United States. At the same time, and into the period of Pierre Trudeau's prime ministership, however, some of the royal symbols that had previously been accepted as representative of Canada because of their British heritage became the target of iconoclasm for exactly the same reason, and the Crown was more frequently said to be at odds with multiculturalism; Canadians were, according to Arthur Bousfield and Gary Toffoli, being encouraged to \\"neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy and history\\", including the monarchy. This phenomenon was the inspiration for the founding in 1970 of the Monarchist League of Canada (MLC) as an organised way for citizens to voice their opposition to any downplaying of the Crown. Still, at the height of the Quiet Revolution, in 1967, Vincent Massey opined that \\"the Monarchy is so essential to us that without it as a bastion of Canadian nationality, of Canadian purpose and of Canadian independence, we could not remain a Sovereign State\\", and three years later, Roland Michener said of the Canadian Crown and identity: \\"[The Monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America\\", which was echoed by John Diefenbaker, who questioned: \\"well, having a royal family means we're not American. And isn't that enough?\\" In polls from the 1970s onwards, majorities continued to believe the Crown was a Canadian foil against the cultural intrusions of the United States, leading monarchists, for their part, to maintain the notion that the Crown keeps Canada culturally and legally sovereign from its largest republican neighbour, even claiming in the early 21st century to have seen a rise in support for the monarchy amongst Canadian youth for just such a reason. Those like the University of Lethbridge's Professor of Native American Studies Tony Hall, George Grant, and Eugene Forsey, theorised that the greatest threat to the Canadian Crown was not its British origins, but instead the \\"expansionist powers of Manifest Destiny in the United States and those who wished to move Canada closer to the American sphere and its presidential style marketplace politics\\", where corporate personalities amongst the sovereign populace could wield significantly more power over government than in the monarchical system where sovereignty is above popular control. Constitutional and societal keystonePersonification of Canada= Canadian monarchists support the official government position (both federal and provincial) of the monarch as the personification of the Canadian state. They consider a globally travelling, super-celebrity monarch to be apt for a post-modern, multicultural nation like Canada, and see the sovereign as a more personal, less bureaucratic, symbol of the will and character of the \\"Canadian national family\\", giving a human face on the nation and locus of allegiance, as opposed to republics where the objective constitution, flag, or \\"the country\\" is revered instead. It is the position of the Department of Canadian Heritage and the Canadian Secretary to the Queen that \\"in every respect, [the monarch] represents the humanity of our country and speaks eloquently of the collective spirit that makes us truly Canadian.\\" Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch is also one of the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both \\"the historic consciousness of the nation\\" and various forms of patriotism and national love \\"[on] the point around which coheres the nation's sense of a continuing personality\\", and reflecting this back through lifelong public duties and service, an arrangement its supporters contend allows for diversity, as opposed to the American ideology of the state being the majority and demanding allegiance. Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated that the monarchy \\"is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian.\\" Gary Toffoli, past chairman of the Toronto branch of the MLC, stated on this concept that \\"it is one of the great protections of democracy and one of the weaknesses of the republican system that in our system the Queen is the state and the people are not the state\\", arguing that such a society permits its members, though they be in an inseparable symbiosis with it, to exist apart from the state, to criticise it, and not take responsibility for what the state might have done. This, he asserted, avoids the paradox wherein opposing the state is opposing the people, which would mean one opposes one's self. George-Étienne Cartier predicted that Canada, with its cohabitational French and English-based cultures, could never have an ethnic nationality, but through allegiance to the common symbol of the Crown, it was possible for the country to be a unified political nationality. =Canadian institution and symbol= Combining constitutional law, the concept of national personification, and their acknowledgement of the reigning monarch as the end of an unbroken chain of sovereigns of Canada that starts with the first European settlement of the region in the 16th century, monarchists in Canada share the Department of Canadian Heritage's view that the sovereign is at least partly, and the monarchy within Canada is fully, Canadian, the monarchy's supporters thus often employing the phrase \\"Maple Crown\\", first coined by The Lord Grey in 1905. The contrary opinion of republicans, who continue to brand the persona and institution of the Crown as purely British and foreign intrusions in Canada, is considered by monarchists to be a superficial argument, representative either of ethnic prejudice, or of a cultural and historical confusion that forgets a number of Canadian valuespeace, order, and good government; parliamentary democracy; the elevation of public welfare over personal greed; responsible government; etc.were similarly inherited from the United Kingdom. Already by the end of the Second World War, a difference had been established amongst Canadians between loyalty to the Crown and loyalty to Britain. Because of this history and contemporary sentiment, the monarchy's supporters allege that presidential republicanism is not a part of the Canadian psyche, and any move towards such an end, without provocation or real reason, would run contrary to the national persona and be foreign to Canada, as no part of the country had ever been a republic. Indeed, the Quiet Revolution, like earlier revolts, failed to inspire republicanism in the Canadian populace outside of Quebec; amongst that remaining bulk of Canadians, the level of monarchism became difficult to gauge over the ensuing decades, as public opinion polls found instability and sometimes even contradictions in numbers for and against the Canadian monarchy (frequently labelled in questions as \\"British\\"), but no popular desire to alter the status quo ever expressed itself. When, in December 1998, Peter Donolo unaccountably announced through a story by Lawrence Martin that the Prime Minister's Office was considering the abolition of the monarchy as a millennium project, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien expressed on television that the topic of a republic was neither a Liberal priority, nor one for average Canadians, admitting \\"[t]here's no big debate in Canada.\\" The provincial premiers at the time displayed the same sentiment, as did various newspaper editorials, with the Ottawa Citizen's headline about the so-called millennium project reading: \\"Which millennium?\\" The lack of interest in republicanism cannot, however, be taken automatically as proof of monarchism; Canadians are generally indifferent to the subject, and, as early as the 1950s, it was observed that Canadians don't \\"think of themselves as citizens of either a republic or a monarchy\\". Canadian loyalists further aver that, rather than be ashamed of the country's monarchical chronicle and present arrangements, they should be embraced. Monarchists find that republican arguments often take the form of cultural cringe, focusing, as they perceive it, on long settled issues like Canada's independence and responsible government, or unsubstantiated ones, such as the republican claim that the monarchy was non-consensually imposed on Canadians, and demonstrating a sophistry that has been described as \\"'presto-you're-an-adult' immaturity that would malign Canada as some sort of pimply-faced adolescent thinking she could prove she is grown up by smoking a cigarette and telling Mom where to get off.\\" Monarchists have contended that this is a product of inadequate knowledge of the monarchy's role in both Canadian history and modern civics, a phenomenon sometimes compounded by the pervasiveness of American culture in Canada. The central role of the monarchy in the Canadian constitution, and the difficult prescriptions to removing it, are said by monarchists to illustrate the importance of the Crown as the centre of the entire system of government and justice in Canada, to the point where Crown and constitution are inseparable. Dr. Stephen Phillips, Chair of the Department of Political Science at Langara College, said that the monarchy was more entrenched in Canada than generally realised, having undergone profound changes since Confederation in reaction to and in parallel with Canada's transition from a self-governing Dominion to a fully sovereign state, thereby pre-empting the rise of any significant republican movement. As the monarchy works satisfactorily and still has a \\"powerful, if under-stated\\" symbolic value to English Canadians, republicans are left to build popular support for its abolition, necessitating the suggestion of constitutional reform, from which Canadians commonly recoil, and causing a debate that monarchists feel would be nationally divisive. First Nations, Quebec, and multiculturalism George VI and Queen Elizabeth meet with Nakoda chieftains, who display an image of the King's great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, in Calgary, 1939 Canada's aboriginal peoples have been described as \\"strongly supportive of the monarchy\\", due partly to the constitutionally entrenched fiduciary obligations of the monarch alone to be the negotiator between First Nations and non and provide to the former certain guarantees, which all makes the Crown's inherent stability and continuity, as opposed to the transitory nature of populist whims, an important factor to aboriginal people in Canada; Tony Hall has argued that the \\"living heritage\\" of Crown-First Nations treaties must not be sacrificed to reductivist republican views of constitutional change that do not consider the relations between the Crown and Canadian aboriginal peoples. Further, those loyal to the Crown have felt that aboriginal peoples in Canada cherish their ability to present grievances directly to the sovereign before the witness of international cameras. Quebec in the latter half of the 20th century has been regarded as less inclined towards the Crown. However, it was expressed by Jacques Rouillard that from the mid-19th century until the end of the Second World War, in Quebec the monarchy was seen as a source of democracy that permitted the prosperity of French Canada. At the time of Confederation, there existed French-Canadian royalists who favoured the retention of the monarchy in the new polity that would include the new province of Quebec, some 40 years before Raymond Auzias- Turenne published in Montreal his book République royale, extolling the virtues of constitutional monarchy, and of monarchism in the province, Prime Minister of Canada Wilfrid Laurier stated: \\"people are surprised at the attachment French Canadians feel for the Queen, and we are faithful to the great nation which has given us liberty.\\" In 2007, though polls showed the province's population to be that which held the monarch most unfavourably, and despite threats of violence and protest from separatists, the Executive Council of Quebec and the Mayor of Quebec City, Régis Labeaume, desired the attendance of Elizabeth II, or either Prince William or Prince Harry, at the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec. Monarchists have also come to find that the Canadian monarchy correlates well with multiculturalism, the monarch being a living illustration of the concept: the Crown's non- partisanship extends to culture and religion, the sovereign reigns over multiple socially diverse nations, appoints persons of each gender and different races to be viceroy, and is him or herself of a heritage that including more than 30 ethnicities, from Danish to Mongol. The monarchy has also been seen by new Canadian citizens as a favourable symbol; in the late 1950s, for instance, recent immigrants from Eastern Bloc countries made public expressions of loyalty to the Queen and criticism towards those who were dismissive of the Crown. Indeed, Member of Parliament Hubert Badanai said during Queen Elizabeth II's 1959 tour of Canada that \\"non-Anglo Saxons are more keen about the Queen than the Anglo Saxons\\". Alistair Horne observed at the same time that, while Canada's cultural mix grew, the monarchy remained held in high regard: \\"At its lowest common denominator, to the average Canadian—whether of British, French or Ukrainian extraction the Crown is the one thing that he has that the rich and mighty Americans have not got. It makes him feel a little superior.\\" Some, such as journalist Christina Blizzard, emphasise that the monarchy \\"made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world\\". Michael Valpy contended that the Crown's nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism. In regards to the anti- Catholic provisions of the Canadian constitution, monarchists either see them as a non-issue, as no one who is Catholic is near to the throne in the line of succession, or see them as a discriminatory clauses of a law for which, as it was enacted by elected parliamentarians in Britain and inherited by Canada with Canadian parliamentary approval, the monarchy cannot be held responsible, and can be altered by parliament to repeal the offending parts. The Succession to the Throne Act, 2013, for example, ended the historical disqualification of a person who married a Roman Catholic from the line of succession. Democratic principles and governmental role Monarchists in Canada uphold that \\"the old view that democracy and monarchy are fundamentally incompatible has been proven wrong\\" by countries such as Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, and the like; and there is no reason why Canada is different. Not only is a monarch trained from birth to be a competent head of state, they argue, but also that constitutional monarchy is a democratic institution, given that the monarch's position is created and filled by and according to the Canadian constitution, which continues to be supported by the Canadian people through their elected representatives in parliament. It has been noted that such a system is already built on republican principles, wherein the Crown's power has, since long before Confederation, been tempered by the will of the elected legislature, coming directly into play only when an elected individual abuses the power lent to him. Arguments against the monarchy include the idea that the existence of the Royal Family prevents Canada from becoming a meritocracy, the royal clan being \\"the prime representation of a class system that divides the nation not on ability but by the hidden mechanisms of privilege\\". Against that, and in a reversal of the republican derision that they comprise are a modern \\"Flat Earth Society\\", however, monarchists declare that such thoughts are quaint and outdated; the modernization of the monarchy has given the country \\"a figurehead which is as apolitical as it could possibly be\\" and a royal family that acts as a symbol of a modern, democratic, and multicultural meritocracy. The dignity of the monarchy above partisan politics has also been said by Peter Boyce to have \\"underlined the distinction between polity and executive\\" and fostered trust in political institutions. The system is generally viewed by supporters of the monarchy as well functioning, and, as such, adhere to the analogy of \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\". Along those lines, at a 1968 constitutional conference in which Quebec delegates raised the proposal of a republic, the other provincial representatives agreed that the monarchy had worked well and was not a matter for discussion; two years later Pierre Trudeau, who was by then in the Cabinet of Lester Pearson, said: \\"I wouldn't lift a finger to get rid of the monarchy ... I think the monarchy, by and large, has done more good than harm to Canada.\\" Later, Trudeau said: \\"Canadians should realise when they are well off under the monarchy. For the vast majority of Canadians, being a monarchy is probably the only form of government acceptable to them. I have always been for parliamentary democracy and I think the institution of monarchy with the Queen heading it all has served Canada well.\\" Former Governor General Roland Michener said in a 1970 speech to the Empire Club of Canada: \\"Canadians refuse to consider the question at all on the simple ground that what we have works. Isn't this the acid test of any system?\\"; and one of his viceregal successors, Ed Schreyer, stated: \\"on a list of 100 things that need fixing, the monarchy ranks 101st.\\" Though political scholar David Smith theorised that the Canadian monarchy had benefited from the dearth of discussion around it, he also expressed his feeling that those monarchist arguments in favour of the Crown that focused on legalities, despite their strong legislative and logical foundations, were actually counter-productive, serving only to further distance average Canadians from their monarchy, which they perceived mostly through the filter of mass media. Non-partisanship John A. Macdonald, one of the Fathers of Confederation, who upheld the monarchical principle in Canada. The institution was used as the bedrock of the constitution because it was viewed by the Fathers of Confederation as a guarantor of Canadians' \\"life, liberty, and prosperity\\", and a body that was both inclusive and still subject to the rule of law; parliament, of which the monarch is one of the three pillars, spoke for all. The sovereign was also seen as an ideal representative of the Canadian state, as opposed to a president, who, due to the election process, would simply be another politician, always accompanied by an inherent amount of division between his or her supporters and detractors, and therefore unable to appear as non-partisan and unbiased as a constitutional monarch. This \\"rigorously neutral civic identity\\" at the national level, monarchists argue, benefits democracy as the sovereign and his or her viceroys are free to represent all Canadians, un-reliant on blocks of voters divided by age, race, gender, financial worth, or political leanings, appealing to, for example, Farley Mowat, a self-described New Democrat and socialist; Eugene Forsey, a trade unionist and founder of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, precursor to the New Democratic Party; George Grant, a Red Tory; and Dalton Camp, a Progressive Conservative. Monarchists opine that in a country such as Canada, where regional, linguistic, and cultural divisions already exist, a divisive head of state would be detrimental rather than beneficial; it was said by George-Étienne Cartier that symbolizing the entire nation is \\"one reason monarchs flourish in countries split by ethnicity\\", and that the monarchy permitted \\"the formation of a political nationality where a cultural nationality was not possible\\". As Governor General the Lord Tweedsmuir put it, the monarch was \\"the friend of every citizen, but the master of none, for friendship implies a noble equality\\", and a link not only between all the peoples of every country that shared the same king in a personal union-type relationship, but also those of Canada. W. L. Morton felt that because Canadians owed their allegiance to a monarch, rather than to a concept like \\"the People\\", there was no pressure on anyone to conform to a singular Canadian way of life; he said \\"the society of allegiance admits of a diversity the society of compact does not, and one of the blessings of Canadian life is that there is no Canadian way of life, much less two, but a unity under the Crown admitting of a thousand diversities\\". John A. Macdonald, speaking in 1865 about the proposals for the upcoming Confederation of Canada, said: > By adhering to the monarchical principle we avoid one defect inherent in the > Constitution of the United States. By the election of the president by a > majority and for a short period, he never is the sovereign and chief of the > nation. He is never looked up to by the whole people as the head and front > of the nation. He is at best but the successful leader of a party. This > defect is all the greater on account of the practice of reelection. During > his first term of office he is employed in taking steps to secure his own > reelection, and for his party a continuance of power. We avoid this by > adhering to the monarchical principlethe sovereign whom you respect and > love. I believe that it is of the utmost importance to have that principle > recognized so that we shall have a sovereign who is placed above the region > of partyto whom all parties look up; who is not elevated by the action of > one party nor depressed by the action of another; who is the common head and > sovereign of all.\\" Indeed, five years prior, it was said that Canadians' enthusiasm for the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), during his 1860 tour of Canada was \\"the intelligent appreciation by a free people of a principle of government and law, which is above party ... It is in this that a free monarchy is distinguished from a free republic on the one side and an arbitrary despotism on the otheras the personification of impartial authority and supreme law and not the head of a party.\\" In the late 1930s, Tweedsmuir said in a speech that, while the will of the populace prevailed through their election of parliamentary representatives, the King embodied the people on a higher level, above all the \\"mutations and vicissitudes of parties\\", and some 60 years later, New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Bill Blaikie opined: \\"[The Queen] symbolizes for many the merits of a constitutional monarchy in which the head of state ... is separate and apart from the ongoing political struggles of the day\\", a sentiment echoed in 2009 by American-born, Simon Fraser University professor Anthony Perl. Constitutional guarantor It is felt by monarchists that the monarch's position apart from the machinations of politics allows him or her to work as an effective intermediary between Canada's various levels of government and political partiesan indispensable feature in a federal system. It is thus reasoned that the monarchy makes the provinces in their fields of jurisdiction equally as potent as the federal authority, allowing for a flexible and sustainable federalism that thwarts \\"the political, academic and journalistic elites\\" in Canada. During constitutional talks in the 1970s, the provinces did not endorse any alterations to the Crown in either its federal or provincial fields, all agreeing that the Crown \\"has served us well\\", and later analysis by David Smith showed that the federal Cabinet at the time failed both to understand the complexity of the Canadian Crown and to \\"recognize its federalist dimension,\\" the monarchy being said to be crucial to provincial co- sovereignty. Even beyond provincial geo-politics, the monarchy has been said to be the only body in which Canadian sovereignty can be vested, as none of the alternativesthe people or the nationhas enough cohesiveness in Canada to serve the purpose. The Irish presidency, which Canadian republicans theorise could be copied in Canada, is not the head of a federated country and thus a hypothetical Canadian president's role would not be the same as that in Ireland. Monarchists, such as the Lord Tweedsmuir, felt that, despite having some drawbacks, constitutional monarchy offered greater stability, it's being seldom thought of an illustration that it was working properly. This, loyalists assert, is because the Crown's non-partisanship permits it to be a permanent guarantor against the misuse of constitutional power by transitory politicians for their own personal gain, the monarch being a required co- signatory to political instruments and having a personal stake in protecting constitutional government from non-justifiable abuses, but having no policy powers or job security reliant on the prime minister of the day. As Forsey and George Grant put it, by simply being there, the sovereign denies more sinister forces, such as a partisan or corrupt president, access to the state's power, forming a \\"vital safeguard of democracy and liberty\\" by acting as a \\"bulwark against cabinet despotism\\", or as \\"the last bulwark of democracy\\", as former Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson, Jr. put it; the worth of the monarchy being not its power, but the power it denies any other person. Thus, the reserve powers of the Crown and the peculiar nature of the office holder are viewed as making the position a useful, if limited, asset against the \\"presidential\\" aspirations of prime ministers, and a superior safeguard for executive oversight than any republican alternative. As Andrew Coyne described it, the sovereign's supremacy over the Prime Minister in the constitutional order is a \\"rebuff to the pretensions of the elected: As it has been said, when the Prime Minister bows before the Queen, he bows before us\\". The analogy monarchists use is that the Crown is like a fire extinguisher, rarely used, but highly visible, and there in case of emergencies. Monarchists thus see the monarch, unconnected as he or she is to party politics, as \\"a political referee, not a political player, and there is a lot of sense in choosing the referee by a different principle from the players. It lessens the danger that the referee might try to start playing.\\" They further theorise that having both an elected president and prime minister could lead to the two coming to odds over who holds more authority; each could claim to be \\"elected by the people\\", as happened in the Congo in 1960, Burma in 2004, and East Timor in 2006. The Canadian republican group Citizens for a Canadian Republic has proposed the Governor General be elected as a step towards some form of republic, to which monarchists counter that this move would bring divisiveness to the office, citing the situation that emerged in 2004 between the rival candidates for the viceregal office in fellow Commonwealth realm Papua New Guinea, where the nominee for governor-general is selected by parliamentary vote. To the idea that the head of state be selected by the Companions of the Order of Canada, monarchists have said that such a situation would \\"politicise and destroy\\" the Canadian honours system by turning it into a form of electoral college, and they further counter Edward McWhinney's notion that Canada could become a republic simply by failing to proclaim another sovereign upon the next Demise of the Crown, stating that such a proposal ignores the necessity of provincial input, and \\"would be contrary to the plain purpose of those who framed our system of government\\". Quebec sovereignty The Canadian monarchy has been presented by monarchists in Canada as being a continuation of the French monarchy under which New France was founded, the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec representing the sovereign in \\"the same way representatives of the French Crown were resident in Château St-Louis\\". It is further argued that, as with the rest of Canada, Quebec has never been a republican order, and monarchism is not an alien concept to the populace of the province. Moreover, far from being dismissive of the French heritage of Canada, the country's royalty has always gone to allowable lengths to ensure the inclusion and appreciation of that culture. In response to the republican claim that Canada becoming a republic would appease the drive for Quebec sovereignty, monarchists say that those in Quebec who wish for their province to secede from confederation rely on anti-British, historical revisionism, and view any federal authority as repressive, regardless of whether that authority is republican or monarchical; hence, the future of the monarchy is regarded as a non-issue by separatist parties like the Bloc and Parti Québécois. Monarchists also say that Canadian presidents would be more often selected by and/or from the majority Anglophone population of the country, and thus sovereigntists would argue that Québécois are not being represented by the head of state. Even if a sovereignty- association relationship with Canada was established, questions remain as to whether or not Quebec would truly be free of the Canadian monarchy.

The group is characterized by extreme conservatism and a desire to preserve the life of the old Yishuv in Jerusalem, in sharp opposition to Zionism, in a strict Haredi way of life, in a special style of clothing, and in an emphasis on prayer at a moderate pace and with enthusiasm. Headquartered in Jerusalem's Meah Shearim neighborhood, it also has significant numbers in Ramat Beit Shemesh, London, and New York City, and additional members in Tiberias and in Harish. The sect has about 1,800 households.Marcin Wodziński, Historical Atlas of Hasidism, Princeton University Press, 2018. p. 199. Toldos Aharon is a split-off from Shomer Emunim. It is led by its Rebbe, Dovid Kohn.

In 1928, Rabbi Roth immigrated to the Land of Israel. Because of the special importance he saw in reciting amen aloud, Roth changed the group's name in 1933 to \\"Shomer Emunim\\". Roth died on 6 Nisan in 1947. About a year later, his students split up, and a relatively small group chose his son, Avraham Chaim Roth, to succeed his father as Rebbe. Most of the students chose Aharon's son-in-law, Avrohom Yitzchok Kohn. He established his court on the outskirts of the Mea She'arim neighborhood (today, stands instead the beth midrash of the Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok Hasidic group). Yoel Teitelbaum of Satmar opposed Aharon's approach, but with the rise of Kohn, who was his disciple, to serve as rebbe, there was a rapprochement between the two Hasidic sects. Avrohom Yitzchok Kohn died during Hanukkah of 1996. Kohn had many sons, four of whom are rebbes today.  Accession of the current rebbe  At the end of Avrohom Yitzchok Kohn's life, and in the context of two years in which he did not function, there was controversy in the community over who would inherit it. During these years, the institutions of the community found it difficult to function. Most of the members of the community and the administration of its institutions supported Kohn's second son, Dovid, who until then served as rabbi of Toldos Aharon in the town of Monsey, New York. Others favored the eldest son, Shmuel Yaakov, as successor. Among the supporters of the first-born were also the rabbi of the community in Jerusalem and its representative in the beth din of the Edah HaChareidis, Meir Brandsdorfer, and the kabbalist Daniel Frisch. After Rabbi Kohn died, two of his sons came to an agreement, whereby the younger son, Dovid, from Monsey, New York, inherited the title \\"Toldos Aharon Rebbe\\". The eldest son, Shmuel Yaakov, a disciple of the Viznitzer Rebbe, became a rebbe as well, of a group that was entitled Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok, named after his father. The main beth midrash of Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok is also in Meah Shearim, one block away from the Toldos Aharon building. Both live in Jerusalem. Another son is a rosh yeshiva in Kiryas Joel, New York. The other two sons formed Hasidic courts on their own, both located in Meah Shearim as well, and are known as the Mevakshei Emunah Rebbe and the Nachlas Aharon Rebbe, respectively. *Aharon \\"Reb Areleh\\" Roth (1894-1946) - author of Shomrei Emunim, Shulchan HaTahor, and Taharas HaKodesh - founding Rebbe of Shomrei Emunim dynasty in the town of Satmar, (At that time, Hungary ; now, Romania), and Jerusalem. **Avrohom Chaim Roth (1924-2012) - author of Chukei Chaim - Shomrei Emumim Rebbe in Jerusalem and Bnei Brak - son of \\"Reb Areleh\\" Roth. ***Rafael Aaron Roth - Shomrei Emunim Rebbe in Bnei Brak - son of Rabbi Avrohom Chaim ***Gedalya Moshe Roth - Shomrei Emunim Rebbe in Ashdod - son of Rabbi Avrohom Chaim ***Shlomo Roth - Shomrei Emunim Rebbe in Jerusalem and Beth Shemesh - son of Rabbi Avrohom Chaim ***Yaakov Yitzchok Roth - in Beitar Illit - son of Rabbi Avrohom Chaim **Avrohom Yitzchok Kohn (1914-1996) - author of Divrei Emunah - previous Toldos Aharon Rebbe of Jerusalem - son-in-law of \\"R' Areleh\\" Roth. ***Shmuel Yaakov Kohn - present Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok Rebbe in Jerusalem - eldest son of the previous Toldos Aharon Rebbe. ***Dovid Kohn - present Toldos Aharon Rebbe in Jerusalem - son of the previous Toldos Aharon Rebbe. ***Yosef Yoel Kohn - present Mevakshei Emunah Rebbe - son of the previous Toldos Aharon Rebbe ***Yisroel Chaim Kohn - present Nachlas Aharon Rebbe - son of the previous Toldos Aharon Rebbe Dress and customs Toldos Aharon children dressed for Shabbat, Mea Shearim, 2007 In Jerusalem, married men wear white and grey \\"zebra\\" coats during the week and golden bekishes/Caftan (coats) on Shabbos. Toldos Aharon and Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok are the only groups where boys aged 13 and older (bar mitzvah) wear the golden coat and a shtreimel, as married men do; however, married men can be differentiated by their white socks, while the unmarried boys wear black socks. In other Hasidic groups, only married men wear a shtreimel. All boys and men wear a traditional Jerusalemite white yarmulke. Unmarried boys wear a regular black coat with attached belt on weekdays, unlike the married men, who wear the \\"zebra\\" style coat. Married women cover their hair without wearing wigs, and the standards of tzniut expected from them are the strictest among all Hasidic/Orthodox Jewish groups. As is customary in the traditional Jerusalemite community, unmarried girls have their hair in two braids, unlike most other Haredi communities, where the girls wear a simple ponytail. The Shomrei Emunim are characterized by fervent and visibly emotional prayer, and by a rigid lifestyle controlled largely by \\"takanos\\" - decrees written by the Rebbe. One such decree, for example, forbade wearing wool. (Jewish law forbids wearing anything that contains both wool and linen. Rabbi Aharon worried that it would be safest not to wear wool at all, in order to avoid the possibility of violating the law altogether.)See Sefer Takanos v'Hadrochos. A strong emphasis is placed on the importance of full-time Torah study, and daily immersion in ritual baths. Hasidic books of the Shomer Emunim, Toldos Aharon, and Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok groups In addition to those books which are revered by all Hasidic Jews, the Toldos Aharon Hasidim particularly revere the books, Shomer Emunim, Shulchan HaTahor, and Taharas HaKodesh, by Aharon Roth, and Divrei Emunoh by Avrohom Yitzchok Kohn. The version of the prayer book used by Toldos Aharon Hasidim is called Brochoh u'Tehilloh. The Toldos Avrohom Yitzchok have published a weekday prayer book called, Tehillas Avrohom Yitzchok, but also use the Brochoh u'Tehilloh version as well. Avrohom Yitzchok Kohn was said to have instructed his followers to learn the works of Aharon HaLevi of Staroshelye, which include \\"Sha'arei HaYichud VeHaEmunoh\\", \\"Sha'arei Avoda\\", and \\"Avodas HaLevi\\". The Staroselyer Rebbe was a follower of the first Rebbe of Chabad, Shneur Zalman of Liadi. After the passing of Shneur Zalman, Aharon HaLevi started his own Hasidic following, an offshoot of Chabad, in Staroselye.

The technique consisted of positioning three wooden or bamboo boards, connected by rope, around and between the suspect's bare feet. The construction of the device enabled the boards to be either snapped open and closed (like the wings of a butterfly) or gradually tightened. Each time the prisoner refused to testify or confess, the rope was pulled smartly and the boards either whacked sharply at the ankles or slowly squeezed the feet ever more tightly. A similar device called the tean zu, applied exclusively to women, employed essentially identical mechanics to squeeze and crush the finger-bones. The torture was typically conducted while the prisoner was forced to painfully kneel on top of folded chains made of sharpened iron links. References * Scott, George Ryley.

This unusual project was conceived by novelist William Dean Howells and carried out under the direction of Harper's Bazaar editor Elizabeth Jordan, who (like Howells) would write one of the chapters herself. Howells' idea for the novel was to show how an engagement or marriage would affect and be affected by an entire family. The project became somewhat curious for the way the authors' contentious interrelationships mirrored the sometimes dysfunctional family they described in their chapters. Howells had hoped Mark Twain would be one of the authors, but Twain did not participate. Other than Howells himself, Henry James was probably the best-known author to participate. The novel was serialized in Harper's Bazaar in 1907-08 and published as a book by Harpers in late 1908. Chapters and authors #The Father by William Dean Howells #The Old-Maid Aunt by Mary E.

Van Dyke was paid $600, Brown $500, James $400, Cutting $350, Freeman $250, and Howells contributed without additional payment.Crowley, John William. The Dean of American Letters: The Late Career of William Dean Howells. The University of Massachusetts Press, 1999: 97. Plot summary In the opening chapter Howells introduces the Talbert family, middle-class New England proprietors of a silverplate works that turns out ice-pitchers and other mundane household items. Daughter Peggy Talbert has just returned from her coeducational college engaged to a harmless but rather weak young man named Harry Goward. Eventually, after many twists and turns introduced by the subsequent contributors, Harry Goward is dismissed as a suitor, Aunt Elizabeth is sent off to New York City, and a more suitable mate for Peggy is found in a college professor named Stillman Dane. Peggy marries Dane and the couple sails off to Europe with Peggy's brother Charles and his wife Lorraine for a honeymoon tour. Composition and publication history William Dean Howells thought of the collaborative project in the spring of 1906. William Dean Howells conceived of the project in the spring of 1906 as a showpiece of his brand of literary realism. He enlisted the help of Elizabeth Jordan, then editor of Harper's Bazar, and pitched the book as an opportunity to create \\"a showplace for Harper's family of authors\\".Crowley, John William. The Dean of American Letters: The Late Career of William Dean Howells. The University of Massachusetts Press, 1999: 96. Jordan was excited and hoped \\"to bring together the greatest, grandest, most gorgeous group of authors ever collaborating on a literary production\\".Kilcup, Karen L. \\"The Conversation of 'The Whole Family': Gender, Politics, and Aesthetics in Literary Tradition\\", from Soft Canons: American Women Writers (Karen L. Kilcup, editor). University of Iowa Press, 1999: 6. Mark Twain may have inspired the collaboration after previously suggesting a similar project involving himself, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, Bret Harte, and others, though the idea was dismissed. For The Whole Family, Twain was offered the light-hearted school-boy chapter but declined.Powers, Ron. Mark Twain: A Life. New York: Free Press, 2005: 387. Howells was concerned about which writers would contribute, especially if he intended to contribute a chapter himself. As he wrote to Jordan, \\"If you find the scheme does not commend itself to the more judicious and able among the writers to whom you propose it, you had better drop it. I should not like to appear in co-operation with young or unimportant writers.\\" Jordan set about finding contributors, though only half of those approached agreed to the project. Howells had predicted that neither Edith Wharton nor Henry James would be willing, though James ultimately did contribute. James, in fact, was immediately impressed with the idea and wrote to Jordan he was interested in writing any of several characters' chapters.Tintner, Adeline R. The Twentieth- Century World of Henry James: Changes in His Work After 1900. Louisiana State University Press, 2000: 122–123. Hamlin Garland declined to take part and Kate Douglas Wiggin withdrew after initially agreeing.Heller, Dana. Family Plots: The De-Oedipalization of Popular Culture. The University of Pennsylvania Press, 1995: 16. It was Howells's intention that each of the authors would examine the impact of Peggy's engagement on a different member of the Talbert family. The second chapter, by Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, immediately disrupted Howells's intended trajectory. Freeman apparently took issue with Howells's reference to the old maid aunt as a quiet old spinster and transforms her from a minor character to be pitied into a major one to be envied.Glasser, Leah Blatt. In a Closet Hidden: The Life and Work of Mary E. Wilkins Freeman. The University of Massachusetts Press, 1996: 88–89. Her character, Aunt Elizabeth or \\"Lily\\", was instead a vibrant and sexually attractive woman who doesn't mind getting noticed by Peggy's fiancé. Jordan, herself unmarried, was impressed by Freeman's character and, as she called it, the \\"explosion of a bombshell on our literary hearthstone\\", but she dealt with considerable negative response from some of the other collaborators, particularly Howells and van Dyke.Glasser, Leah Blatt. In a Closet Hidden: The Life and Work of Mary E. Wilkins Freeman. The University of Massachusetts Press, 1996: 92. Howells, never particularly comfortable with frank sexuality, recoiled from Freeman's spicy conception of a character he had intended as a harmless old lady. Contributor Henry Van Dyke, who would eventually write the concluding chapter, reacted in a half-humorous, half- worried letter to Jordan: Mary Wilkins Freeman's chapter on the \\"Old Maid Aunt\\" was controversial among her collaborators. Freeman, who had been single until her marriage at age 49, defended herself to Jordan by noting the changing role of single women: As subsequent critics have pointed out, the rest of the novel became an effort by the later writers to cope somehow with this introduction of Aunt Elizabeth as a sexual competitor with Peggy for her fiancee's affections. The book was first serialized in Harper's Bazar from 1907 to 1908.Tintner, Adeline R. The Twentieth-Century World of Henry James: Changes in His Work After 1900. Louisiana State University Press, 2000: 122. In serial form, the chapters were published anonymously, though there was an accompanying list of contributors and a teasing note that an \\"intelligent reader\\" would \\"experience no difficulty in determining which author wrote each chapter—perhaps. Elizabeth Jordan later utilized the collaborative authorship approach in the book The Sturdy Oak (1917), in which several authors wrote on behalf of woman's suffrage.Chapman, Mary. Making Noise, Making News: Suffrage Print Culture and U.S. Modernism. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014: 165–166. Key themes Critics, both contemporary and modern, have concentrated on the interactions of the various writers more than the actual substance of the book. As several commentators have pointed out, each writer seemed to want to bend the novel to his or her own particular vision of the plot and characters. Freeman's reinvention of the maiden aunt as an independent, sexually alluring woman has come in for much comment, favorable and not. Feminist critics have applauded Freeman's imagining of Aunt Elizabeth as a lively woman of spirit and intelligence. Others, such as contributor Alice Brown, thought Aunt Elizabeth was a gauche projection of Freeman's own personal issues. Brown believed that in creating Aunt Elizabeth, Freeman was reacting subconsciously to growing older. (In 1902 at age 49 Freeman had married a man seven years younger than herself, and the marriage proved unhappy.) Whatever the truth of this conjecture, Brown's penultimate chapter tied up the loose ends of the plot and helped resolve many of the difficulties of the collaboration. The book's treatment of the issues of family, marriage and women's roles in society has generated some comment, often colored by the personal ideology of the commentator. Critics of all persuasions have admired editor Elizabeth Jordan's firm control over what sometimes threatened to be a hopelessly contentious project. Contributor Edith Wyatt, for instance, originally produced an unpublishable chapter, a series of letters that were out of harmony with the rest of the book. Jordan finally coaxed a rewritten and acceptable chapter from her. Then there were the inevitable disputes over payments. Many authors were insistent on generous compensation; Elizabeth Stuart Phelps demanded no less than $750, for example, easily equivalent to $15,000 in today's pre-tax money. And simply assembling the cast of authors was no easy task, as some writers—particularly Mark Twain—declined to participate in what some regarded as a literary stunt. Critical response First page of the first chapter of The Whole Family as it appeared in Harper's Bazar, December 1907 The novel's contemporary reception was favorable, with decent sales and mostly positive reviews. Its contemporary popularity was spurred by the literary novelty of the project, as well as the guesswork required from its initial anonymous publication, in addition to rumors of in- fighting between contributors.Crowley, John William. The Dean of American Letters: The Late Career of William Dean Howells. The University of Massachusetts Press, 1999: 96–97. Many years after the book was published, Elizabeth Jordan exclaimed in her autobiography: \\"The Whole Family was a mess!\\" Critic Alfred Bendixen sympathized when he wrote: \\"As The Whole Family developed, the plot increasingly focused on family misunderstandings and family rivalries, which were mirrored by the artistic rivalries of the authors. The writing of the novel became a contest as much as it was a collaboration, with each author trying hard to impose his vision on the entire work.\\" In his long, dense but insightful chapter, and with charged rhetoric reminiscent of his late novels, Henry James has the aesthetic son Charles Talbert rail against the frustrations that he and his equally artistic wife Lorraine experience due to the claustrophobic realities of family life in his small New England town: :It's in fact in this beautiful desperation that we spend our days, that we face the pretty grim prospect of new ones, that we go and come and talk and pretend, that we consort, so far as in our deep-dyed hypocrisy we do consort, with the rest of the Family, that we have Sunday supper with the Parents and emerge, modestly yet virtuously shining, from the ordeal; that we put in our daily appearance at the Works—for a utility nowadays so vague that I'm fully aware (Lorraine isn't so much) of the deep amusement I excite there, though I also recognize how wonderfully, how quite charitably, they manage not to break out with it: bless, for the most part, their dear simple hearts! James might as well have been talking about the frustrations that many of the authors felt with the \\"family\\" of their collaborators.

History Founded in 1987 by Roland Cattin, Time creates, manufactures and distributes highly technical bicycle products. Time history began with a clipless bicycle pedal system designed to accommodate the biomechanical constraints of the rider. In 1993, Time began to diversify with carbon composite frames using resin transfer molding (RTM) technology. Time weaves its own custom tubular carbon layers in its RTM factory in Vaulx-Milieu France, outside of Lyon. This gives Time's engineers control of the technical characteristics of each carbon layer, as well as freedom of shape of the frame component parts. Time products gained fame in the early 1990s, after being debuted on the podium by Pedro Delgado in 1988, then multiple Tour de France winner Greg LeMond in his champion-style 1989 Tour de France victory which was followed by multiple Tour de France winner Miguel Indurain. This was a major change for the field, in which Look had been the most notable brand until then. Today, Time is one of the leading brands of carbon fiber racing bicycle frames and forks. Time's off-road pedals, use a concept Time calls ATAC (Auto Tension Adjustment Concept). This concept allows release angle to be independent of spring tension. Among the most widely used pedals by both recreational and professional cyclists, 120,000 pairs are manufactured annually. They have also become a favorite of inner-city bicycle couriers, because of their small cleat size, ease of entry and exit, lightweight, and reliability. TIME created the first automatic pedal to provide a freedom of lateral and angular float, Time pedals claim to considerably reduce tendinitis, a problem that many riders and especially professionals face. Professionals TIME has sponsored several professional cycling teams, most recently ProTour teams Quick Step-Innergetic, Cofidis and Bouygues Telecom. Several other professionals and teams use Time shoes and/or pedals, including Saunier-Duval, Ag2r, and 2008 Beijing Olympic mountain biking gold medalist Julien Absalon. Tom Boonen, the 2005 Road Race World Champion, used Time bikes while he was with Quick Step-Innergetic. His successful 2005 season included the Tour of Flanders, Paris–Roubaix, the Tour of Belgium and the 2005 World Road Race Championships in Madrid, Spain. The following season, Time developed a special bike, the Time VXS, for Boonen to ride in the 2006 spring classics.The bikes of Hell: Tom Boonen's Quick.Step Innergetic Time VXS Spécial Paris-Roubaix, April 8, 2006 The VXS is similar to the VXRS Ulteam, but is a little more compliant as a result of a longer wheelbase and the vectran fibres that are used in the Time manufactured carbon fibre. In addition to Boonen's triumphs, Time has been ridden to more victories at the Olympics and World Championships. Italian rider Paolo Bettini rode TIME bicycles during his gold medal-winning ride in the 2004 Athens Olympic Road Race and in the 2006 World Championship Road Race. Australian rider Michael Rogers rode Time time-trial bikes to victory in the 2003, 2004, and 2005 world championship time trials.

The insect is described as sylvatic; subsisting primarily in humid forests, and is also known to inhabit vertebrate nesting places such as those of the armadillo (dasypus novemcinctus or dasypus), and is also involved in enzootic transmission of T. cruzi to those species. It has wide distribution throughout 16 Latin American countries. There have been few scientific studies of this particular species because of the low number of collected specimens and difficulties in rearing and maintaining populations in the laboratory. However, currently P. geniculatus is receiving attention as a potential vector of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) due to reports of this species invading the domestic and peridomestic habitats over a vast area: Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Argentina. P. geniculatus is apparently in the process of domiciliation, using the same strategies as highly domesticated species like Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus. This is also the case for other sylvatic triatomine species (Triatominae) that are experiencing similar ecological pressures originating from human disruption of the natural habitat.  Prevalence in Venezuela  A 2005 study conducted by the Universidad Central de Venezuela, used Panstrongylus specimens collected from Caracas City and the neighboring areas of Miranda and Vargas States. Through the use of a dot-ELISA test and other techniques to determine the presence of trypanosome cruzi, it was found through the examination of feces that 67 of the 88 (76.1%) specimens collected were carrying the parasite and that 53 (60.2%) of those reacted positively to human antiserum.

Background Wells was born in New York City and raised in Red Bank, New Jersey. She married architect Thomas Moore Wells in 1963 and attended the Boston Museum School. Writing style A common theme in Rosemary Wells' stories is the use of animal characters rather than humans. In the children's journal Stone Soup, Wells has stated that she writes using animals because it allows her to address sophisticated, controversial topics in way children can understand and adults can accept. For example, Yoko tackles the thorny topics of racism. It is about a young Japanese kitten who is ostracized when she brings sushi in her school lunch. At the book's conclusion, she gains acceptance by hosting a school luncheon where everyone brings food native to their family. Many of the animal characters, such as those in Max & Ruby, interact with one another much as humans would, while others such as McDuff th – a West Highland Terrier – take on a more realistic role as the adopted pet of a young couple.\\"Interview with Rosemary Wells\\".

It was the first exclusive hardcore feature film produced and released in France to meet international success, and has been called a cult film. In 1977, Mulot directed the sequel Le Sexe qui parle II, which starts with the \\"infection\\" passed by Eric to a prostitute. Cultural background The film is an example of a significant tradition in literature and art of talking vaginas, dating back to the ancient folklore motif of the vagina loquens, or \\"talking cunt\\". These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity. Talking female genitals feature in the Ozark folktale The magic walking stick, are an early theme in French literature, most notably in Les bijoux indiscrets and the 13th century fabliau Le Chevalier qui faisoit parler les cons et les culs, and the theme continues with The Vagina Monologues. Plot Joëlle (Pénélope Lamour) is a beautiful executive at an advertising company who is married to Eric (Jean- Loup Philippe). Her vagina is infected with a mysterious affliction, ostensibly after she is seduced by an attractive blonde girl, and begins to talk and lead her to indecent sexual acts. However, it is soon revealed that her problems root from her sexual hardships and obsessions as an adolescent. In the finale, she has sex with Eric and passes the \\"infection\\" to his penis.

He was among the first stage actors to star in Hollywood, and he pursued work in film features for a number of years. Early life Born to Irish Catholic parents in Dubuque, Iowa, Keenan acquired his education both there and at Boston College. Career Poster for Keenan's performance of A Poor Relation (1900) Blanche Bates and Keenan in the original Broadway production of The Girl of the Golden West (1905) Advertisement (1919) In New York, he became a star, a celebrated Shakespearean actor who later specialized in King Lear. He was a noted Broadway matinee idol, and his name appearing at the top of showbills. He acted in such hits as The Capitol, A Poor Relation and The Girl of the Golden West. He played the title role in Macbeth opposite Nance O'Neil. At one point, he briefly operated his own theater, the Berkeley Lyceum in New York, which brought him recognition as both actor and director. Keenan made his screen debut under the direction of Reginald Barker in The Coward (1915). His career lasted into his late 60s, and he was a leader in the Actors' Equity Association. His last stage appearance, at 68, was as a Southern colonel in Black Velvet. Family Keenan was married for many years to Katherine Agnes Long, who often acted with him.

It has a wide range of ecotopes, mainly savanna and foothills with an altitude of between 500 meters to 1,500 meters (1600 feet to 4,900 feet) above sea level and temperatures of 16 °C to 28 °C (61 °F to 82 °F). Sylvatic R. prolixus, as virtually all Rhodnius spp., is primarily associated with palm tree habitats and has a wide range of hosts including birds, rodents, marsupials, sloths, and reptiles. The insect was used by Sir Vincent Wigglesworth for the detection of insect hormones. It has been implicated in the transmission of transposons between it and some of its vertebrate hosts, squirrel monkeys and opossums. Rhodnius prolixus is also known as the kissing bug because it tends to feed on the area around victims' mouths.http://neurosci.arizona.edu/kissingbugs/basicfacts History Rhodnius prolixus established itself throughout Central America after specimens that originated in Venezuela accidentally escaped from a San Salvadoran research laboratory in 1915. It colonized houses and invaded neighboring countries, probably through accidental carriage by travelers. Life cycle The insect has five larval stages, with a moult between each. Each larval stage consumes a single large meal of blood, which triggers the moulting process, 12–15 days later. Wigglesworth demonstrated that the moult is started by prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) secreted into the blood in response to hormone release by neurosecretory cells in the brain. Further it was demonstrated that the corpora allata secrete the juvenile hormone which prevents the premature development into an adult. The removal of the head during any larval stage causes early development into an adult, whereas the implantation of a juvenile head during the fifth larval stage results in a giant sixth stage larva. As disease vector Chagas disease is caused by the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Infection with Chagas disease occurs after Rhodnius releases protozoans in its feces immediately following a blood meal. The parasite enters the victim through the bite wound after the human host scratches the bite. Infection may also occur via blood transfusion and ingestion of food contaminated with kissing bug feces.

History The castle dates from the late 12th century. In the 14th century it was acquired by Sir Robert Savage. The Annals of the Four Masters record the capture of the castle in 1470 by an army led by the O'Neill to assist the MacQuillans. They took the castle and it was given to MacQuillan for safe keeping. It was intact until 1896 when a storm demolished much of it. Features Sketrick Castle was originally 57 ft high, 51 ft long and 27 ft wide, four storeys high, with a boat bay and a stone subterranean passage discovered in 1957. It had four chambers at ground level, the largest with a vault constructed on wicker centring, as well as two brick-lined recesses, probably ovens. It has lintels running under the bawn wall to a chamber with a corbel over a fresh water spring. Parts of the bawn wall still survive to the north and east of the castle.

He was born in Rendsburg, Prussia, in 1867. He started his career as an artist in his youth, and attended the Berlin Royal Art Academy before being appointed a professor in 1913. He taught at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bremen from 1898 to 1931. He was also involved in the founding of a series of modern Pagan religious groups in the early 20th century, as part of a movement to create what its adherents referred to as a \\"Germanic religious community\\". Artistic influences Fahrenkrog was trained in the classical tradition, and had a successful artistic career. He became a professor of art in 1913, and was later appointed a guest professorship at Dakota University in 1925. In 1928 he received first prize at the Grand Palace exhibition in Munich. His style, however, is more dependent on Art Nouveau and Symbolist influences than on the classical tradition. In an article on Fahrenkrog's work, Marcus Wolff points to \\"his insistence on the religious nature and mission of art.\\"Marcus Wolff, \\"Ludwig Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community: Wodan Triumphant\\" in Tyr: Myth—Culture—Tradition, Ultra 2004 The \\"religious mission\\" in question is the revival of the pre-Christian Germanic faith and the rejection of Christianity, which is hinted at in paintings such as Lucifer's Lossage von Gott (Lucifer's Renunciation of God, 1898). While Fahrenkrog's work can be seen in the context of contemporary art movements, it was also strongly influenced by his participation in the religious movement taking place at the same time. Fahrenkrog and the Germanic Faith Community The first group started by Fahrenkrog was the Deutscher Bund für Persönlichkeitskultur (German League for the Culture of the Personality), which also supported a publication called Mehr Licht! (\\"More Light!\\", the famous last words of Goethe). He was also involved with the Deutsche Religionsgemeinschaft (German Religious Community [DRG]), which would later change its name several times, first in 1912 to Germanisch-Deutsche Religionsgemeinschaft (Germanic-German Religious Community [GDRG]), then in 1915, following a split in the membership, to the Deutschgläubige Gemeinschaft (Association of the German Faithful [DGG]). Fahrenkrog remained with the GDRG after several members left following disagreements over the place of the old Germanic gods and the inclusion of a partly Jewish member, and shortly thereafter the group changed its name to the Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft (Germanic Faith-Community [GGG]), its final form. In 1916, the group set out ten points of common belief which they later published in Das Deutsche Buch (The German Book). In 1923, the GGG's sixth year of existence, Fahrenkrog gave a speech that emphasized the non-political nature of the group, and stated the goal of \\"ascent and united will of all Germanic people.\\" At that point, the group had a large membership spread across several neighboring countries, and plans for further growth included the building of a Germanic temple designed by Fahrenkrog's stepson. However, the temple's construction was obstructed by protests from local Christian groups and disagreement among GGG members, and it was never finished. In 1925, Fahrenkrog and Adolf Kroll, another early member, argued over the role that the Edda should play in the group's mythology. Fahrenkrog believed that the GGG should evolve a new mythos incorporating but not dependent upon the Edda, Kroll apparently seeing this as disloyalty to the old Germanic myths. The GGG under the Third Reich When the Nazis came to power in 1933, they outlawed almost all other groups not affiliated with the party. The GGG, however, was not forced to disband, partly, says Wolff, \\"because of Fahrenkrog's international status as an artist.\\" Nevertheless, some of its activities were limited. They could no longer hold public meetings, and after 1938 could no longer use the swastika, which the GGG had been using as its symbol since 1908. Fahrenkrog himself was reluctant to use the greeting \\"Heil Hitler!\\" in letters, and as a result never gained any recognition within the party. In 1934, an exhibit of his paintings was prohibited by the ministry of propaganda.

The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1984 but lost to Sting's \\"Brimstone and Treacle\\".  Origin and structure  \\"Rude Mood\\" is a take-off of a Lightnin' Hopkins song called \\"Hopkins' Sky Hop\\".

There are also versions where he uses an acoustic guitar instead of his characteristic Stratocaster, while sometimes also taking it notably faster or slower than the recorded studio version. The song starts out with the main riff introduced by the guitar; the bass notes are played quickly with muted notes in between, resulting in a swung feel. The bass guitar and drums are introduced after the introduction, establishing the beat that continues to the end. The song can be broken up into many sections, separated by each 12-bar blues progression, with most sections ending in the same fashion as the beginning riff.

Little is known about his life, except as told by his political and literary enemy Josephus Flavius. Shaye J. D. Cohen, Josephus in Galilee and Rome: His Vita and Development as a Historian, pages 114-144 (Leiden: Brill, 1979). Life Justus, the son of Pistus,Josephus, War p. 9 was born in Tiberias, a highly Hellenistic Galilean city and was a man of learning. He was close to the Tetrarch Agrippa II and became a leading citizen of his hometown. Joan Comay, Who's Who In Jewish History: After the Period of The Old Testament, page 210 (David McKay Company Inc., 1974; revised version by Lavinia Cohn-Sherbok, Routledge, 1995). During the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73), he ran into conflict with Josephus, a Jewish leader in Galilee. When the Romans had reconquered Galilee, Justus sought sanctuary with the Tetrach Agrippa. Vespasian, who led the Roman troops, demanded that Justus be put to death, but Agrippa spared him and merely imprisoned him. The tetrarch even appointed Justus as his secretary, but later dismissed him as unreliable. Justus wrote a history of the war in which he blamed Josephus for the troubles of Galilee. He also portrayed his former master Agrippa in an unfavourable light, but did not publish the work until after Agrippa's death. Justus also wrote a chronicle of the Jewish people from Moses to Agrippa II. Both his works survive only in fragments. Flavius Josephus, Justus' rival, criticized the Tiberian's account of the war and defended his own conduct in the Autobiography, from whose polemical passages we derive most of what we know about Justus' life. Works As well as a history of the war, Justus also wrote a chronicle of the kings of Israel from the time of Moses to Agrippa II, which Photios remarked failed to make any mention of Jesus Christ. James Carleton Paget, Jews, Christians and Jewish Christians In Antiquity, page 202, citing Photius' work Bibliotheke 33 (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2010). Neither of his works has survived.

Description =Appearance Also known as the Pražský Krysařík, and often confused with the Chihuahua and the Miniature Pinscher, the Prague Ratter is a small toy dog. Ideal height is 20 cm to 23 cm, being 2 cm shorter in maximum height than the minimum height of the Miniature Pinscher. Adult weight is mostly between 1.5 kg to 3.5 kg. Generally the best weight is 2.6 kg. There are two coat variations:FCI-Standard N°363: Prague Ratter.

Lately, other colors have been approved: brown and tan, blue and tan, lilac and tan, yellow, pink, red and merle. Temperament Best known for its active and lively nature, the Prague Ratter is a spunky breed that is full of original character. These tiny dogs thrive on strong and dependable relationships with humans, love to receive affection and play the role of lap dog during down time. This breed is highly intelligent and generally responds well to basic training and commands. As a pet, the Prague Ratter is obedient, loyal, loving, and very affectionate. The Prague Ratter adapts well to full-time indoor and apartment living, yet still enjoys spending time outdoors, playing games such as fetch, and taking long and leisurely walks. They are also known to be a very quiet dog, unlike many other small dogs who tend to be very \\"yappy\\". Like any small dog, one should be wary of allowing them to develop Small Dog Syndrome, as they can become aggressive if they are not well-socialized from an early age. Train-ability Due to its need for human attention and eagerness to please and impress its owner, the Prague Ratter generally responds well to basic training and commands. This bright breed has the ability to learn to perform many impressive tricks and tasks. Many owners claim that these dogs can easily be taught to use a litter box, thus eliminating the need for constant trips outdoors.

It was already an established breed by the time of the rule of the Polish king Bolesław II the Generous (1058–1081). He became fond of the Ratter and had two of them imported from Bohemia. As their name suggests they were also commonly used as rat catchers in rural and urban households. The popularity of the Prague Ratter started to decline in the 19th century when the Miniature Pinscher became more fashionable. The breed went through a renaissance in the 1980s as Czechs and Slovaks started to breed them again. In 2019, it became an FCI acknowledged breed. There are only about 6,000 Prague Ratters registered in the world and they usually only have 1-3 puppies per year. They are nevertheless presented at shows in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Scandinavia. Health Subject to bone injuries due to their small size. Also subject to patellar luxation, an ailment common to small breeds. Krysariks can also have retained baby teeth, which may need to be pulled to prevent further problems with dentition.

It is located on the Honeybourne Line which linked Cheltenham and and which was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1906. The station closed to passengers in 1960, although the line itself remained open for freight and diversionary use until 1976, when a freight train derailed near Winchcombe and damaged the track. By the late 1970s, the line had been dismantled. The stretch between and , including Winchcombe, has since been reconstructed and reopened by the heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. A new station has been erected in Greet, Winchcombe, on the site of the original building, the building being the former station at . Nearby is the Greet Tunnel, the second longest on any preserved line in Britain.  History  On 9 July 1859, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened a line from to . The OW&W; became the West Midland Railway in 1860 and was acquired by Great Western Railway in 1883 with a view to combining it with the Birmingham to Stratford Line to create a high- speed route from the Midlands to the South West. The GWR obtained authorisation in 1899 for the construction of a double-track line between Honeybourne and Cheltenham and this was completed in stages by 1908. Winchcombe was opened on 1 February 1905. It is situated close to the small village of Greet but ¾-mile to the north of Winchcombe. Two facing platforms were provided; the original station building built of red brick on a plinth of blue brick was situated on the Down platform. A verandah canopy, similar to that at , extended from the front of the building to a covered footbridge linking the two platforms. On the Up platform was a passenger waiting shelter and gentlemen's lavatory. The goods yard lay on the south-eastern side of the station and comprised cattle pens, a goods shed, weighbridge and 6-ton crane. A brick-built 31-lever signal box controlled access to the yard, while a 50-wagon Up refuge siding led to the rear of the Up platform. As with , the station was lit by acetylene lamps with the gas hut situated behind the weighhouse. From February 1905 to June 1906, Winchcombe was the southern terminus of the line and buses to Cheltenham were provided pending the extension south. From June 1906, eight local services each way ran between Honeybourne and . The completion of the North Warwickshire Line in July 1908 saw the first through services from to . By 1938, nine Down and ten Up services ran daily, with three on Sundays. Traffic receipts for 1913 showed that 21,824 passengers had been carried, representing £1,436 in fares collected (equivalent to £ in ), whilst 11,828 tons of goods traffic had been handled (mainly coal/coke and livestock), giving a total income of £5,837 (equivalent to £ in ). By 1933, both of these figures had fallen: receipts to £4,436 (equivalent to £ in ) and goods tonnage to 8,320. The Second World War however saw tonnage peak at 17,045, with the bulk of it consisting in agricultural machinery, fertilisers and foodstuffs. Winchcombe closed to passenger traffic on 7 March 1960, the distance between the town and its station contributing to its demise. The goods yard remained open for a further four years until 2 November 1964. By March 1965, the station site had been levelled, leaving only the weighhouse, goods shed and residential accommodation. The signal box remained in operation until 24 February 1965, shortly after which it was demolished. The line remained open to goods and diversionary traffic until 25 August 1976 when the 06.35 Toton to derailed at a point east of the bridge carrying the B4632 road linking Winchcombe and Toddington over the line.

The former Great Western Railway station building at was dismantled stone-by-stone and re-erected at Winchcombe in 1986. The platform slabs came from and Cheltenham St James. The only original buildings left are the old goods shed, now the main workshop for the carriage and wagon group on the railway, and the weighbridge.

Its color is a unique pattern of black, greens, yellows, greys and even sometimes blues, flecked with white or yellow. Their underside is white or cream- colored.  Geographic range  The buttermilk racer is found only in the United States, in southern Arkansas, Louisiana and southern and eastern Texas. Common names Other common names for Coluber constrictor anthicus include the following: ash snake, blue racer, brown racer, Louisiana black snake, spotted black snake, spotted racer, variegated racer, and white oak racer.Wright, A.H. and A.A. Wright. 1957. Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Comstock. Ithaca and London. 1106 pp. (Coluber constrictor anthicus, pp. 136-138, Figure 43., Map 16.)  Behavior  Racers are diurnal, active predators. They are fast moving, and are often quick to bite if handled. They generally eat rodents, lizards and frogs, but as juveniles they will also consume various kinds of soft-bodied insects. They are fairly nervous snakes, and as such, do not typically fare well in captivity. For protection, they release a foul-smelling scent when caught to deter predators. They also thrash around to escape and can unknowingly injure themselves.

Bradley, M.D. (1917-1998) and popularized by his book Husband-Coached Childbirth, first published in 1965. The Bradley method emphasizes that birth is a natural process: mothers are encouraged to trust their body and focus on diet and exercise throughout pregnancy; and it teaches couples to manage labor through deep breathing and the support of a partner or labor coach.Childbirth education: Get ready for labor and delivery, Mayo Clinic, July 25, 2009, accessed July 10, 2011. Teachers of the Bradley method believe that—with adequate preparation, education and help from a loving, supportive coach—most women can give birth naturally, without drugs or surgery. The Bradley method emphasizes measures that can be taken to help keep women healthy and low-risk in order to avoid complications that may lead to medical intervention. The primary goal of the Bradley method is healthy mothers and healthy babies. The method holds that, in most circumstances, a natural (drug-free) childbirth is the best way to achieve that goal. Proponents of The Bradley Method claim that 86% of Bradley mothers have vaginal births without drugs. The classes teach nutrition, relaxation and natural breathing as pain management techniques along with active participation of the husband as coach. Parents-to-be are taught to be knowledgeable consumers of birth services and to take responsibility in making informed decisions regarding procedures, attendants and the birthplace. The method itself is first of all an application of what Dr. Bradley termed \\"the six needs of the laboring woman\\", most notably deep and complete relaxation and abdominal breathing, but also including quiet, darkness and solitude, physical comfort, and closed eyes and the appearance of sleep. Secondly, the Bradley Method relies heavily on training fathers to be labor \\"coaches\\", or partners. Bradley Method teachers usually supplement these primary techniques with training in different labor positions and comfort measures. In order to master the ability to relax completely as a pain relief tool, couples are taught several different relaxation techniques and encouraged to practice relaxation daily, so that the mother can rely on a conditioned relaxation response to her partner's voice and touch. Bradley entered into obstetrics in 1947; at the time mothers were restrained in large cribs and wore protective helmets to protect their heads from hitting the sides of the crib due to the effect of the medication they were given.Erin Hinze, Dr. Robert A. Bradley , \\"Happy Birth Happy Baby\\", accessed July 10, 2011. Terming this era as \\"knock-em-out, drag-em-out obstetrics\\", when \\"twilight sleep\\" and general anesthesia were common in hospital deliveries, he decided to develop his own method. Having been raised on a farm and having witnessed many animal births as a part of farm life, Dr. Bradley believed that women, like the non-human animals he had observed growing up, could give birth without drugs or distress. Based on observations of mammals during labor and birth, he developed a childbirth method to teach women to do the things that animal mothers do instinctively. Soon after starting to implement his new childbirth method with pregnant nurses as a trial, Dr. Bradley began to believe that the presence and support of the father during labor and birth was important to the mother's success in achieving a natural birth. He became a pioneer in including fathers in the birth process and eventually expanded his childbirth method to include extensive instruction of the father as labor coach. Bradley method instructors are certified by the American Academy of Husband-Coached Childbirth™ (AAHCC). ReferencesSources * Bradley, Robert A. (1996). Husband-Coached Childbirth (4th ed.).

It received strong negative reviews with a few positive ones. Literary critic James Wood said that the novel had \\"invented its own category of badness\\". However, a 2006 poll of various literary critics voted the novel as the third \\"best British, Irish, or Commonwealth novel from 1980 to 2005\\", tied with Anthony Burgess's Earthly Powers, Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, Ian McEwan's Atonement, and Penelope Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower. John Carey, book critic for the Sunday Times, also placed the novel on his list of the 20th century's 50 most enjoyable books, later published as Pure Pleasure: A Guide to the Twentieth Century's Most Enjoyable Books.

Three year later in 1866 he became director of the Harvard College Observatory, succeeding George Bond, and making many improvements in the facility. He was also appointed professor of astronomy at Harvard. He remained at the university, eventually becoming professor of geodesy until his sudden death in 1875.

In the game, the player assumes the role of Mustafa, an Iranian asylum seeker being held at Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. Mustafa's request for asylum has been denied, and, fearing that he will be killed by the Iranian government upon his repatriation to Iran, he decides to attempt to escape Woomera. Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre to devise and execute an escape plan. The game was developed in 2003 and 2004 by a team of Australian video game industry professionals and an investigative journalist, using Half-Lifes GoldSrc engine. The developers received an AU $25,000 grant from the Australia Council to make the game, propelling the project to national attention, where the idea received a predominantly negative reception. The Australia Council's decision to fund the game drew condemnation from both Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock and Australian Human Rights Commission leader Dr. Sev Ozdowski. Without further funding, a full game was never developed, and the playable prototype was made available free of charge online. Plot Mustafa speaks with a woman whose Quran was thrown to the ground by a guard, while detainees line up behind her to use a pay phone. In the upper left corner, the hope meter is shown. Escape from Woomera opens with three screens of text that explain the game's background. Players assume the role of Mustafa, who paid smugglers to bring him to Australia after his parents were killed by the Iranian secret police. After the boat transporting him crashed in the Ashmore Reef, Mustafa was brought to the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre, where he was given the identification number \\"RAR-124\\". After three months, Mustafa was informed that his request for asylum was denied, and that he would be repatriated to Iran. Believing that he would be tortured and killed upon his return, Mustafa decided to escape Woomera.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 174. Because the game was never completed, only a small portion of the intended gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 174–175.Poremba (2013), 2–4. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt. Gameplay Escape from Woomera is a point-and-click adventure game. The player, controlling Mustafa, explores the Woomera centre, which is populated with non-player characters—computer-controlled individuals that move about the facility on their own. Some of these characters can speak with Mustafa, giving him information about the facility, sharing their backgrounds or experiences at Woomera, or directing him to find and retrieve objects scattered throughout the facility. Speaking with characters and completing their tasks allows Mustafa to progress towards his goal of escaping the facility.Poremba (2013), 2–3. The game has a meter that tracks Mustafa's hope. As he completes tasks that take him towards the goal of escaping, the meter increases. Listening to the experiences of fellow detainees, which in some cases is required to gain access to other information or tasks, drains Mustafa's hope. If he is caught breaking rules by the guards, Mustafa is placed in solitary confinement, which also drains hope. Should the hope meter run out, Mustafa loses the ability to continue to attempt an escape, and is deported.Poremba (2013), 19–20. Development The idea for a video game centred on asylum seekers in Australia came to Katharine Neil, then an developer at Atari's Melbourne studio, in the aftermath of the 2001 Tampa affair.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 175. Neil spent a year and a half assembling a team to work on the game and securing initial funding for the project. Fourteen people contributed to the game, with a core development team of four. Many of the Australian members of the development team, including Neil, contributed to the project anonymously to protect their jobs. Neil stated that her motivation for the project was a desire to create a video game in which the asylum seekers were the heroes. The purpose of the game, according to Neil, was twofold. The team wanted to criticise the treatment of detained asylum seekers in Australia, and they also wanted to prove that video games were capable of the task. At the time, the idea that video games could convey political topics in a serious manner, and that they were a form of culture worth being taken seriously, had not caught on strongly.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 178–179. The game also was a statement against the Australian government's attempts to suppress media access to, and coverage of, the detention facilities. The original plan for Escape from Woomera involved several choices in playable detainees, each with a different story about how they came to seek asylum in Australia. The game would have players \\"battle the bureaucracy and try and survive day to day\\" while working towards any of several escape strategies. As originally envisioned, players could attempt to escape through the legal channels, using lawyers and activists, or could attempt to flee by scaling fences or digging tunnels. The development team worked to create the most realistic depiction of the Woomera centre possible, despite the media not being allowed in the facility. The team utilised interviews with former detainees and activists, existing press reports, and a copy of the facility's floor plan obtained from a member of the Department of Immigration. Kate Wild, an investigative journalist hired by the development team to conduct research, was able to visit Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. She witnessed guards using spotlights and helicopters to keep detainees awake throughout the night, and police on horseback trampling over tents. Aside from Woomera and Baxter, Port Hedland Immigration Reception and Processing Centre and Villawood Immigration Detention Centre were also used as influences. Details from the daily lives of detainees, such as their being referred to by number and communicating with the outside world through payphones, were incorporated into the game. Tasks that players had to complete, as well as the escape strategies themselves, were also based on the experiences of real detainees. Initial funding for the development of Escape from Woomera came from the Australian government's arts funding organisation, the Australia Council for the Arts. The Australia Council gave the developers AUD $25,000, intended to get the game developed to the point that it could secure funding from other sources. While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 175–176. The playable demo, which was built as a modification of the video game Half-Life, was made available for download on the game's website.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 173. Reception The Australia Council's decision to fund Escape from Woomera was poorly received. The game received heavy criticism before development even began. Australia's Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock, released a statement saying that the \\"decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement, that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour\\". Kate Wild, in a 2013 interview, recalled that she was surprised at how strongly Ruddock attacked the game, a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment. The leader of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Dr. Sev Ozdowski, released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of misconstruing asylum seekers as criminals, and saying that \\"The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick.\\" Chairman Michael Snelling of the New Media Arts Board, the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money, defended the decision to fund Escape from Woomera, stating that the game's purpose was not to promote crime. He characterised the team's application for funding as both strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board's goal of promoting cross-disciplinary media. In the 2010s, the retrospective view of Escape from Woomera is significantly more positive. In 2013, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation called it \\"one of the first—and still one of the most important—politically- focused videogames\\". The textbook The Alternative Media Handbook used the game as a case study in culture jamming, and categorised it as an early example of video games carrying a political message.Coyer, Dowmunt, and Fountain (2011), 177–179.

As of March 2006, Germany operates three other research vessels of its class, none of which is as well-equipped. The Merian was financed by the German government and is assigned to the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research at Warnemünde, with Rostock as its home port. It is also available to several other German research institutes. Its tasks are Arctic research, research on the Gulf Stream, and seabed research to a depth of 10 km. It is manned by a crew of 21, and can additionally accommodate 22 scientists. The vessel is equipped with several laboratories. It has room for 150 tonnes of additional scientific equipment in accessible containers, providing flexibility in research assignments. The ship is equipped with two azimuth thrusters, a lateral pump-jet, and satellite navigation, enabling it to automatically maintain an exact position. It can operate without any polluting emissions for 48 hours (apart from the normal engine exhaust), allowing it to conduct research in ecologically sensitive areas. The Merian is capable of operating in near-polar regions and can handle drift ice up to a thickness of 50 cm. It is 94.80 m long, 19.20 m wide, and has a maximum draft of 6.50 m.

Originally created by pianist Belkis Concepción, several teams of female vocalists and musicians have alternately performed under the name Las Chicas del Can throughout the group's history. Founded in 1981, Las Chicas del Can performed a number of hits throughout the eighties, and a great number of their singles and albums achieved gold and/or platinum status. Hits such as \\"El Negro No Puede,\\" \\"La Media María,\\" \\"Sukaína,\\" \\"Juana la Cubana,\\" \\"Culeca,\\" \\"Ta' Pillao,\\" \\"Fuego,\\" \\"Fiebre,\\" and \\"Las Pequeñas Cosas\\" are now regarded as merengue classics. Las Chicas Del Can had tremendous success, receiving platinum records and gold records and made extensive tours around the world and Europe, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Peru, Puerto Rico, the United States, Holland and others. The dance \\"Juana La Cubana\\" was popularized by the eternal Juana the Cuban Teresa Dominguez, who with her charisma and dance captivated the whole world. The disc Juana la cubana received a platinum record in Venezuela in 1988 for 100,000 thousand copies sold and another more for the song of 50,000 copies combining it in one of his most recognized works in the entire trajectory of Las Chicas Del Can Pianist Belkis Concepción left the group early to go solo in 1985. Singers Miriam Cruz and Eunice Betances then teamed up and got vocal support from, among others, Luchy Betances and Verónica Medina. Verónica Medina herself then went solo in 1987. In 1988 singer Heidy Bello joined Las Chicas Del Can but was replaced in 1991 by singers Arismar Eduardo and Rosana Eusebio. In 1992, the group reinvented itself under the name Míriam Cruz y Las Chicas. The first year under that name, they produced a successful album entitled Nueva Vida featuring a hit song written by Juan Luis Guerra, \\"Te Propongo.\\" Later that year, \\"La Loba\\" was also well received by merengue fans and quickly became another hit. A European tour (1993-1994) soon followed. In 1994 Miriam Cruz y Las Chicas scored another hit with the song \\"Con Agua de Sal (OTI),\\" and 1995 included another successful European tour. Meanwhile, the original name was kept alive by a music industry manager who discovered a group of new and talented young ladies who would carry the torch for Las Chicas del Can. In 1993, Michell Flores, Grissel Baez and Florángel del Villar teamed up to keep the legacy alive. Due to the situation not entirely clear among fans, the new girls were hailed as the \\"Monumental\\". They started traveling around the globe, covering the band's original repertoire with songs like \\"Juana la Cubana\\". This 2nd line-up of Las Chicas Del Can quickly became a successful act in their own right with hit tunes such as \\"Voy Pa'llá,\\" \\"Hacer El Amor Con Otro,\\" \\"Celoso,\\" \\"Explosivo\\" and \\"Sin Compromiso.\\" After the albums \\"Botando Chispas\\" (1994) and \\"Derramando Sueños\\" (1996) lead singer Michell Flores went solo and the 2nd line-up of Las Chicas del Can disbanded in 1998. Las Chicas del Can was eventually reformed a third time in 1999, but this particular group was never able to achieve the success of earlier line-ups. To this date, the first line- up of Las Chicas Del Can (which featured Míriam Cruz, Eunice Betances and Theresa Domínguez) has proven to be the most successful line-up. Carmen Santos (née De Leon), former member of the group, is the mother of reggaeton artist Austin Santos, better known as Arcángel.

Classical sources Our written sources about Antigonia of Paeonia are quite obscure. In a description of Paeonia, Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD) lists a number of tribes, regions and towns. He tells us that Stobi is a town with many Roman citizens, followed by the phrase \\"next comes Antigonea, Europus, upon the river Axius\\" and so on. Thus, we know that Antigonia is located somewhere near Stobi and that Antigonia is not placed on the bank of the river Axius like Aeropus as said by Pliny. In 272 BC Antigonus II Gonatas gained full control of Macedonia and we know that he founded at least three cities with this name; an Antigonia on the mainland of Chalkidike near Cassandreia (Antigonia Psaphara), another in Atintania, Epirus, as a useful barrier against the Illyrians (Chaonian Antigonia) and a third one as we assume in Paeonia, with the aim of controlling the conquered province. Livy (59 BC - 17 AD) who described the events of the Third Macedonian War gives details of the formation of the Macedonian troops before the Battle of Pydna (168 BC). He writes that on the right wing were the Macedonian cavalry and Cretan light infantry; Midon of Beroea was in charge of the latter force, Menon of Antigonia commanded the cavalry and the formation as a whole. Next to the wings were posted the royal cavalry and mixed units of the picked auxiliaries of many nations; Petrocles of Antigonia and Didas, the governor of Paeonia were in command of these.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita Libri, Book 44 From this description of the forces we are informed that lower Paeonia (Macedonian Paeonia) was commanded by a Macedonian governor and that Paeonia played a central role for providing troops and cavalry to the Macedonian army. After the defeat of the battle at Pydna, the kingdom of Macedon was severely punished and reduced to a Roman Province. Antigonia as one of the main suppliers of cavalry to the Macedonian army was by no means spared. However, in spite of that, we know that Antigonia continued to exist as a city since Ptolemy (90 -168 AD) listed it in his work Geographiae.

The attack was unsuccessful. In 1439, King Sigismund of Hungary argued with King Wladislaw of Poland about dividing Moldavia between their two countries. Sigismund complained that the Moldavians refused to aid him in his expeditions against the Turks, but King Wladyslaw argued that the Moldavians couldn't aid Sigismund with troops because they aided him, instead, and Sigismund had to give up on his claims.The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 449 In 1444, Moldavia sent troops that joined King Władysław III of Varna at the Battle of Varna. The Turks had camels with them and in case of defeat, they would spill gold and silver coins on the ground in order to slacken the enemy. The Moldavians went after the camels for the money.The Annals of Jan Długosz, p. 496 Between 1451 and 1457, Moldavia was in civil turmoil and under Petru Aron, the principality paid the Porte an annual tribute of 2,000,000 gold coins. In 1470, during the rule of Stephen the Great, the relationship between Moldavia and the Porte became hostile, and resulted in several confrontations, most notable being the Battle of Vaslui, where the Ottomans were heavily defeated, and the Battle of Valea Albă, where Mehmed II was victorious, but was forced to retreat. In 1484, the Ottomans managed to annex Chilia and Akkerman. After the death of Stephen the Great, 1504, Moldavia fell into decline and was forced to accept vassalage for the Porte in 1512, but conflicts continued to rage until the 19th century, giving the country brief periods of independence.

On the strength of Sometime Stories, Ewins soon started providing covers for 2000 AD, the first being issue #33 published in October of the same year. Ewins and McCarthy continued working together on Future Shocks and Judge Dredd, but soon after Ewins began working solo on Rogue Trooper and later Judge Anderson. In 1985 Ewins started working on Bad Company, a sci-war epic, written by Peter Milligan with artwork by Ewins and Jim McCarthy (brother of Brendan). Bret Ewins did the cover art for the Judgement Day (1986) supplement for Games Workshop's Judge Dredd: The Role-Playing Game.

It was hinged to permit the free insertion and removal of the bare foot. A crank projected from a housing over the instep, which concealed a long, thick, serrated iron blade, grooved so as to inflict maximum damage and promote liberal blood flow. Turning the crank slowly advanced the blade into the boot, punching a hole through the center of the instep. The resultant wound was so large that it was not unusual for the prisoner to die of toxaemia soon after. It is likely that, like the \\"Iron maiden of Nuremberg,\\" or Eiserne Jungfrau, the instep borer is more reflective of myth than of reality. The only standard source that mentions it Hirsch, A. E., ed., The Book of Torture and Executions (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944), p. 69, which the Library of Congress attributes to Richard Sair--even though that author's name appears nowhere on the work--claims to be based upon the Earl of Shrewsbury's exhibit of devices from the Royal Castle of Nuremberg that traveled the world after 1890. Yet, the catalogue that fully annotates the earl's collection of more than one thousand pieces--including dozens of \\"feet squeezers [and] iron boots\\"Shrewsbury and Talbot, Earl of, Collection of Torture Instruments from the Royal Castle of Nuremberg (New York: J. & J. Little & Co., 1893), p. vi that variously and ingeniously tortured the foot and leg with screws, cranks, wedges, burs, spikes, teeth, red-hot coals, fire, etc.--makes no mention whatsoever of the instep borer.

He started his career aged 17, finding his niche at Warner Brothers in the 1930s. It was Amy's editing that was one of the main reasons Warners' films got their reputation for their fluid style and breakneck pace. He was a favorite of such top Warners directors as Michael Curtiz and Howard Hawks, and won an Academy Award for Best Film Editing for Hawks' Air Force (1943). He received Oscar nominations for Curtiz's Yankee Doodle Dandy in 1942 and Raoul Walsh's fanciful war film Objective, Burma! in 1945. Although Amy directed several shorts and a few features (including She Had to Say Yes) on his own for Warners, they didn't meet with much success. In the 1950s he turned to editing and directing for television.

The books are compilations of mini- mysteries that the reader must solve involving various crimes committed at the home of Reginald Boddy by six of his closest \\"friends\\". Format Each book begins with a small chapter where Mr Boddy introduces himself to the reader. He explains the situation and introduces the six suspects. This ends with some kind of cliffhanger that leads into the first chapter. Except for the first book, which contains thirteen, all the books contain ten mini-mysteries similar to the Encyclopedia Brown books. Each mystery ends with a question to answer, and a picture of the checklist from the game is provided to assist with solving. The answer is printed upside-down on the next page, providing an explanation of how the criminal was foiled, or how the victim (if there was one) survived. The first nine mysteries typically involve some sort of competition between the guests (in which case readers must deduce who won), a guest attempting to murder another guest, or some sort of rare treasure of Mr Boddy's that has been stolen. Deduction of the guilty party is done by tracking particular oddities given specific to the mystery, such as the guests all trying on specific scents of perfume or a note that some are wearing a particular style or color of clothing. The guests also have very distinct, exaggerated personalities that betray their identities to the reader when they are not directly named. Someone attempts to murder Mr Boddy in the final chapter of each book. In the solution, no explanation is given, and it is suggested that Mr Boddy actually dies. In the introduction of subsequent books, however, Mr Boddy explains how he survived the end of the previous book, with the exception of the eighteenth book. This allows the series to come to an end at any point without ending abruptly and also leaves it open for another book. Books Except as noted, the original hardcover editions were published by Turtleback Press, and had four different authors. Later paperback reissues are credited \\"Book created by A.E. Parker\\", and are published by Scholastic Press. The series is currently out of print. ISBNs are for the paperback reissue. #Who Killed Mr. Boddy?, by Eric Weiner (1992) #The Secret Secret Passage, by Eric Weiner (1992) #The Case of the Invisible Cat, by Eric Weiner (1992) #Mystery at the Masked Ball, by Eric Weiner (1993) #Midnight Phone Calls, by Eric Weiner (1994) #Booby-Trapped, by Jahnna N.

Books 1-4 feature the characters as they appeared in the 1986 edition of the board game. From Book 5 onwards, the character redesigns from the 1992 edition were used. * Mr. Boddy is a wealthy philanthropist and a painfully trusting host. He collects valuable items while generously forgiving his guests for attempting to commit any crime, including theft, murdering each other and so even himself. * Colonel Mustard is a military man with a short temper who constantly challenges the other guests to a duel (once even challenging himself). He is only shown fighting actual duels twice; once with Mr. Green in the ballroom (The Secret Secret Passage) and once with Professor Plum in the dining room (The Haunted Gargoyle). * Professor Plum is an absent- minded jack-of-all-trades professor who constantly does things like steal something and forget why or create a poison and forget where he left the antidote. * Mr. Green is a businessman always interested in making easy money. He, too, has a short temper, often making threats and laughing at others' misfortunes. * Mrs. Peacock is prim and proper, doing her best to spread social correctness amongst the other guests and scolding them when they are being rude. However, she is willing to kill or steal things to get her way. * Miss Scarlet is a flirtatious young woman who likes to seduce, steal from, and murder people for money, revenge, etc. * Mrs. White is Mr. Boddy's housekeeper and cook who constantly pretends to not take any offense to what someone said, only to immediately turn her back and scowl, thumb her nose, and do things of that nature. She will steal or kill to get herself away from housekeeping, but her plans always fail and she is forced to return as \\"Mr. Boddy's bitter cook\\". 2003 series In 2003, Canadian mystery writer Vicki Cameron wrote a new set of mini-mysteries, the Clue Mysteries books, after the original author, Nigel Tappin, backed out of the project. Only two were published. Both books feature more complex storylines and vocabulary, fifteen mysteries apiece. The setting is at the fictional mansion Tudor Hall in Hampshire, Britain in 1926. The stories are formatted to be more like the game, with each mystery being about the murder of Boddy and featuring one guest conducting the entire investigation before accusing another guest of the crime.

A limited edition release of the album included a 196-page book, containing additional artwork and writing in the same style. \\"My Kingdom\\" and \\"We Have Explosive\\" were released as singles. The \\"My Kingdom\\" music video was directed by the same artistic collaboration, whereas the \\"We Have Explosive\\" music video was directed by 2D-animator Run Wrake.

It is endemic to North America.Integrated Taxonomic Information Sysyem (ITIS). www.itis.gov. Description The eastern yellow-bellied racer is a thin- bodied snake, capable of attaining a total length of 1.5 metres (60 inches). As an adult, its color is an olive grey-green with a yellow underside. As a juvenile it is remarkably different, having a tan or cream-colored body with brown or grey blotches. The color gradually changes as the snake ages, becoming solid olive grey-green. Authors disagree as to when this transformation is complete, from 1½ to three years old, and from 18 to 30 inches (46–76 cm) in total length.Wright, A.H., & A.A. Wright (1957).

Considered a landmark in Waltham and the surrounding area, Wal-Lex consisted of a 60-lane candlepin bowling facility, a rollerskating rink, billiard tables, and video games. It also featured mini-golf until 1985. The name is a portmanteau of Waltham and Lexington, as the facility was located on Lexington Street in Waltham, not far from the town line where the road became Waltham Street in Lexington. History Wal-Lex, the brainchild of John Rando, Fred Tortola Sr., Thomas Cappadona and George Rando, first opened its facilities on July 4, 1947 and at the time consisted only of a twenty lane candlepin bowling alley. During the 1950s and 60s, the Wal-Lex became increasingly popular necessitating the addition of an eighteen lane annex building in 1954 and the addition of a twenty-two lane second floor in 1960. The complex was a major attraction in the Greater Boston area and became a popular spot for celebrities heading into Boston as well as professional bowlers.Vellante, John. \\"For 50 Years, Recreation Has Been Right Up His Alley\\", Boston Globe, July 6, 1997. In 1950, a roller-skating rink was constructed next door to the bowling alley which featured skate rentals, a snack bar, and a live organ player. At one point, the facility also included a mini-golf course, kiddie rides, and a dairy stand. At the time of its closure, the facility was showing its age. The original pinsetters were still operational (although, at first the pins were set manually by pinboys) and scores were still being taken by paper and pencil. The wooden lanes has been sanded down to the nails. Still a popular attraction for youths and bowling leagues, the Wal-Lex didn't shut its doors due to lack of business, rather because the facility had simply become a victim of its own age.Sweeney, Emily. \\"Goodbye To Another Era, Another Pleasure - Wal-Lex Slated for Demolition Later This Year\\", Boston Globe, April 11, 2002. On the spot once occupied by the mini-golf course now sits a Burger King restaurant which opened in 1986. The rest of the facility remained operational until it was closed and demolished in 2002. The former site of Wal-Lex now houses a CVS and a Staples store. The Wal-Lex bowling alley was the filming site for the television show Candlepins for Cash after the show moved to WXNE-TV Channel 25 in 1982.

Placemaking is a multi- faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that promote people's health, happiness, and well-being. It is political due to the nature of place identity. Placemaking is both a process and a philosophy that makes use of urban design principles. It can be either official and government led, or community driven grass roots tactical urbanism, such as extending sidewalks with chalk, paint, and planters, or open streets events such as Bogotá, Colombia's Ciclovía. Good placemaking makes use of underutilized space to enhance the urban experience at the pedestrian scale to build habits of locals. History Mrs. Jane Jacobs, chairman of the Comm. to save the West Village holds up documentary evidence at press conference at Lions Head Restaurant at Hudson & Charles Sts. The concepts behind placemaking originated in the 1960s, when writers like Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte offered groundbreaking ideas about designing cities that catered to people, not just to cars and shopping centers. Their work focused on the importance of lively neighborhoods and inviting public spaces. Jacobs advocated citizen ownership of streets through the now-famous idea of \\"eyes on the street.\\" Whyte emphasized essential elements for creating social life in public spaces. The term came into use in the 1970s by landscape architects, architects and urban planners to describe the process of creating squares, plazas, parks, streets and waterfronts that will attract people because they are pleasurable or interesting. Landscape often plays an important role in the design process. The term encourages disciplines involved in designing the built environment to work together in pursuit of qualities that they each alone are unable to achieve. Bernard Hunt, of HTA Architects noted that: \\"We have theories, specialisms, regulations, exhortations, demonstration projects. We have planners. We have highway engineers. We have mixed use, mixed tenure, architecture, community architecture, urban design, neighbourhood strategy. But what seems to have happened is that we have simply lost the art of placemaking; or, put another way, we have lost the simple art of placemaking. We are good at putting up buildings but we are bad at making places.\\" Jan Gehl has said \\"First life, then spaces, then buildings – the other way around never works\\"; and \\"In a Society becoming steadily more privatized with private homes, cars, computers, offices and shopping centers, the public component of our lives is disappearing. It is more and more important to make the cities inviting, so we can meet our fellow citizens face to face and experience directly through our senses. Public life in good quality public spaces is an important part of a democratic life and a full life.\\"/http://www.pps.org/reference/jgehl/ The writings of poet Wendell Berry have contributed to an imaginative grasp of place and placemaking, particularly with reference to local ecology and local economy. He writes that, \\"If what we see and experience, if our country, does not become real in imagination, then it never can become real to us, and we are forever divided from it... Imagination is a particularizing and a local force, native to the ground underfoot.\\"  Principles  According to Project for Public Spaces, successful placemaking is based on eleven basic principles:  The Community Knows Best  An important aspect of placemaking is taking into account inputs of the people who will be using the public space most. That is, to say, the community for which the public space is intended. This is important because members of the community are likely to have useful insights into how the space does - or should - function, as well as a historical perspective of the area, and an understanding of what does and does not matter to other members of the community.A plaza in Hallstatt Austria with an activated public realm.  Places, Not Designs  Placemaking is not just about designing a park or plaza with efficient pedestrian circulation. It involves taking into account the interrelations between surrounding retailers, vendors, amenities provided, and activities taking place in the space, then fine-tuning the space with landscape changes, additions of seating, etc., to make all of those elements mesh. The end result should be a cohesive unit that creates greater value for the community than just the sum of its parts.  Placemaking is a Group Effort  Partners for political, financial, and intellectual backing are crucial to getting a public space improvement project off the ground. These partners can range from individuals, to private or municipal institutions, to museums, to schools.  Make and Act on Observations  By observing how a public space is used, it is possible to gain an understanding of what the community does and does not like about it. This understanding can be used to assess what activities and amenities may be missing from the space. Even after a public space has been built, observation is key to properly managing it, and evolving it to better suit the community's needs over time.  Requires a Vision  As with many other types of project, a placemaking project needs a vision to succeed. This vision should not be the grand design of a single person, but the aggregate conception of the entire community.  Requires Patience  A placemaking project does not happen overnight. Do not be discouraged if things do not go exactly as planned at first, or if progress seems slow.  Triangulate  street vendor in Plazoleta del Chorro de Quevedo, located in La Candelaria, Bogotá, Colombia. Triangulation, simply put, is the strategic placement of amenities, such that they encourage social interaction, and are used more frequently. For example, \\"if a children's reading room in a new library is located so that it is next to a children's playground in a park and a food kiosk is added, more activity will occur than if these facilities were located separately.\\"  Ignore Naysayers  Just because it hasn't been done doesn't mean it can't be done. What it does mean is that there are few people, in either the private or public sectors, who have the job of creating places.  Form Supports Function  A public space's form factor should be formulated with its intended function(s) in mind.  Money Should Not Be an Issue  If networking and team building have been executed correctly, public sentiment towards the project should be positive enough to overlook its monetary cost.  Placemaking is an Ongoing Process  Placemaking is never \\"done\\". Minor tweaks can be made to improve the space's usefulness to its community over time, and regular maintenance/upkeep of facilities and amenities is a fact of life.  Healthy Placemaking - The Link Between Place and Health  Both the opportunities available to individuals and the choices made based on those opportunities impact individual, family, and community health. The World Health Organization's definition of health provides an appropriate, broad-reaching understanding of health as a \\"resource for everyday life, not the object of living\\" and an important frame for discussing the interconnections between Place and Health. A 2016 report The Case for Healthy Places, from Project for Public Spaces and the Assembly Project, funded by the Knight Foundation and focusing on research related to Shaping Space for Civic Life both offer insight into the current evidence base showing how health and wellbeing are impacted by where you live and the opportunities available to you.  The Arts and Creative Placemaking  While the arts and creative expression play a substantial part in establishing a sense of place, economic growth and production must also play an equally large role in creating a successful place. These two factors are not mutually exclusive, as the arts and cultural economic activity made up $729.6 billion (or 4.2%) of the United States GDP in 2014, and employed 4.7 million workers in 2012. This means that the arts can be deployed as a powerful tool in the creation or rehabilitation of urban spaces. Jamie Bennett, executive director of ArtPlace America, has identified the following four tools used by communities while implementing creative placemaking. * Anchoring: When a key arts institution, organization, or building in the area prompts additional foot traffic or regional draw. These anchors can attract additional business, and become a strong source of identity for the neighborhood. * Activating: When visual or performing arts are brought into the public realm, it activates the space while creating interest, activity, and engagement. More people and eyes on the street drives curiosity to explore and establishes a sense of safety. * Fixing: Taking vacant, underutilized, or blighted spaces in a neighborhood and treating them as an opportunity for new art and design projects. This can change how people think about these spaces and the opportunities that they represent. * Planning By using the arts and creative community meeting strategies, stakeholder enthusiasm can be bolstered, resulting in valuable input for community design. Bringing artists into the planning process can upend the familiar and allow participants to mentally \\"unhook\\" from their preconceived notions.  Community Attachment  Great places must do more than meet the basic requirements if they want to foster greater community attachment. A strong sense of attachment can result in residents who are more committed to the growth and success of their community. The Knight Foundation conducted a study measuring community attachment, and found that there 199x199pxwas very little variation in the primary drivers of attachment rates when compared between different cities across the United States.  Drivers of Attachment  * Social Offerings - Gathering places that foster face-to-face interactions, building trust with others, and an environment where people care for one another. This includes perceptions of a healthy nightlife, an arts and cultural scene, and community events. * Openness - How inclusive the community is to a wide range of people and lifestyles. Openness is measured by perception that the place is good for old people, racial and ethnic minorities, families and children, gays and lesbians, college grads looking for work, immigrants, and young adults without children. * Aesthetics - The physical beauty of the place. Mostly focusing on the availability of open green space, parks, playgrounds, and recreational trails.  Attachment Trends = Livable Streetscapes  A diagram displaying an artist's rendering of different examples of placemaking that architects and planners use to enhance pedestrian experiences.Streets are the stage for activity of everyday life within a city and they have the most potential to be designed to harness a high-quality sense of place. Effective placemaking in the streetscape lends special attention to the streets livability by representing a sense of security, sense of place, visible employment, variety of transportation options, meaningful interactions between residents, \\"eyes on the street\\" as well as \\"social capital\\". All of these interactions take place at the mesoscale. Mesoscale is described as the city level of observation between macroscale—being birdseye view—and microscale--being textures and individual elements of the streetscape (streetlamp type, building textures, etc.); in other words, mesoscale is the area observable from a humans eyes, for example: between buildings, including storefronts, sidewalks, street trees, and people. Placemaking for a street takes place at both mesoscale and microscale. To be effective placemakers, it is important that planners, architects, and engineers consider designing in the mesoscale when designing for places that are intended to be livable by Whyte's standards.  Placemaking tools and practices  Tools and practices of placemaking that benefit from utilizing the mesoscale context include: *Form-Based Codes *Infill Development *Urban Forestry Practices * Civil Engineering * Architecture  Social Media and Placemaking  As society changes to accommodate new technologies, urban planners and citizens alike are attempting to utilise those technologies to enact physical change. One thing that has had a massive impact on western society is the advent of digital technologies, like social media. Urban decision makers are increasingly attempting to plan cities based on feedback from community engagement so as to ensure the development of a durable, livable place. With the invention of niche social technologies, communities have shifted their engagement away from local-government-led forums and platforms, to social media groups on websites such as Facebook and Nextdoor to voice concerns, critiques and desires. In a sense, these new platforms have become a Third Place, in reference to Ray Oldenburg’s term. Social media tools such as these show promise for the future of placemaking in that they are being used to reclaim, reinvigorate and activate spaces. These online neighborhood and event-centric groups and forums provide a convenient non-physical space for public discourse and discussion through digital networked interactions to implement change on a hyper-local level; this theory is sometimes referred to as Urban Acupuncture. This type of shift towards a more crowd-sourced planning method can lead to the creation of more relevant and useful and inclusive places with greater sense of place. Other new technologies have also been used in placemaking, such as the WiFi-based project created by D.C. Denison and Michael Oh at Boston's South Station and other locations around Boston. The project was backed by The Boston Globe. The Pulse of Boston used local WiFi signals to create online hyperlocal communities in five different locations around the city.

Early life and education  Born in Oakland, California, Tallman received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1975 from the University of Santa Clara and his Juris Doctor in 1978 from Northwestern University School of Law, where he served as the executive director of the law review.  Professional career  After serving as a law clerk for Judge Morell E. Sharp of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Tallman worked as a trial lawyer for the Department of Justice and as an Assistant United States Attorney in Seattle, Washington. From 1983 until his appointment to the Ninth Circuit in 2000, Tallman was an attorney in private practice in Seattle, including as chairman of the white-collar criminal defense practice group at the former Bogle and Gates law firm between 1990 and 1999. After that firm closed on March 31, 1999, Tallman formed the firm Tallman & Severin.http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1999/9907290098.asp Among Tallman's higher-profile clients in private practice was representing the Seattle Mariners in legal disputes over scheduling rights in the Kingdome. Tallman also handled medical malpractice and defense procurement cases.  Federal judicial service  Despite being a Republican, Tallman was nominated by President Bill Clinton to his current seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on October 20, 1999 and was confirmed by a voice vote of the United States Senate on May 24, 2000. He received his commission on May 25, 2000. Tallman was nominated to fill the seat vacated by longtime Ninth Circuit judge Betty Binns Fletcher, who took senior status in 1998. Clinton's previous nominee to that seat, conservative Washington State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Durham, had been nominated in January 1999 as part of a bipartisan deal brokered by Washington's senators at the time, Slade Gorton and Patty Murray. However, Durham withdrew her nomination to the seat just four months later because of her husband's terminal heart condition. Tallman then was nominated after he was one of three potential nominees that Gorton recommended to the White House. Tallman is on the record as supporting a split of the Ninth Circuit due to the backlog of cases. On January 27, 2014, Tallman was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to a six-year term on the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, which considers appeals under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He succeeded Morris S. Arnold, whose term expired in August 2013. He took senior status on March 3, 2018.  Notable opinions  Bull v. City and County of San Francisco, August 22, 2008.

Eberhard Zangger (born 1958 in Kamen, West Germany) is a Swiss geoarchaeologist, corporate communications consultant and publicist. Since 1994 he has been advocating the view that a Luwian civilization existed in Western Asia Minor during the 2nd millennium BC. In 2014 he established the international non-profit foundation Luwian Studies, whose president he is. Life and work Eberhard Zangger studied geology and paleontology at the University of Kiel and obtained a PhD from Stanford University in 1988. After this he was a senior research associate in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge (1988-91). In June 1991 he founded the consultancy office Geoarcheology International in Zurich, Switzerland, from where he participated archaeological projects in the eastern Mediterranean each year until 1999. Zangger began concentrating on geoarchaeology in 1982. His early research work and discoveries included the coastal situation of Dimini in Neolithic Central Greece, the extent of Lake Lerna in the Argive Plain, the age and function of the Mycenaean river diversion and extent of the lower town of Tiryns,Zangger, Eberhard: Landscape Changes around Tiryns during the Bronze Age in American Journal of Archaeology 98 (2) (1994) pp189-212. the insular character of Asine,Zangger, Eberhard: The island of Asine: A palaeogeographic reconstruction in Opuscula Atheniensia XX:15 (1994) pp221-239. the artificial harbor of Nestor at Pylos, including its clean water flushing mechanism, and a human-made dam in Minoan Monastiraki in central Crete. In 1992, Zangger suggested that Plato used an Egyptian version of a story about Troy for his legendary account of Atlantis.\\"The Flood from Heaven – Deciphering the Atlantis Legend.\\" Sidgwick & Jackson, London; 256 pages 1992 Zangger based his argument on comparisons between Mycenaean culture and Plato's account of the Greek civilization facing Atlantis, as well as parallels between the recollections of the Trojan War and the war between Greece and Atlantis. He recognized similarities between the Sea People invasions and the aggressors described by Plato and he also saw parallels between the Sea People invasions and the Trojan War. In 1992 Zangger arrived at the conclusion that Troy must have been much bigger than the archeological scholarship had presumed, and that the city must have had artificial harbors inside the modern floodplain. In a 1993 article, Zangger listed many commonalities between Plato's description of Atlantis and different accounts of Troy as it looked in the late Bronze Age. In 1994, Zangger presented a chronology of political and economic developments in the eastern Mediterranean during the 13th century BC.\\"Ein neuer Kampf um Troia – Archäologie in der Krise.\\" Droemer Verlag, Munich, 1994 This time, Zangger interpreted the legend of the Trojan War to be the memory of a momentous war which led to the collapse of many countries around the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC. Zangger's overall research goal was to find an explanation for the end of the Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BC. In contrast to the archaeological scholarship of the time, Zangger attributed greater importance to the states in Western Anatolia that are known from Hittite documents, including the Luwian kingdoms Arzawa, Mira, Wilusa, Lukka and Seha River Land. In Zangger's view, if these petty kingdoms had stood united, they would have matched the economic and military importance of Mycenaean Greece or Minoan Crete. In a review of the books The Flood from Heaven and Ein neuer Kampf um Troia in the journal Journal of Field Archeology, the US prehistorian Daniel Pullen of Florida State University emphasized Zangger's approach. Zangger, Pullen says, “applies the rigors of scientific methodology to explaining the end of the Bronze Age in the eastern Mediterranean.” In his third book, Zangger turned to developments in the 12th century BC after the Trojan War.\\"The Future of the Past: Archaeology in the 21st Century.\\" Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 2001 According to Zangger, scattered groups of survivors of the Sea People invasions and the Trojan War founded new settlements in Italy and Syria/Palestine from which the Etruscan and Phoenician cultures emerged. Zangger also argued against the overrating of natural disasters as a trigger for cultural change. In his opinion, natural scientists and specialists in urban development and hydraulic engineering should become more often involved in archaeology. In collaboration with the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources in Hannover, Zanier proposed a geophysical exploration of the plain of Troy to locate settlement layers and artificial port basins. The Turkish Ministry of Culture did not grant permission to conduct this project. In 2001 Zangger said that because of a vigorous scholarly dispute with the Troy excavator Manfred Korfmann, Zangger was ceasing his research.

In the fall of 1999, Zangger became a business consultant specializing in corporate communications and public relations.Gabriela Bonin: „Geoarchäologie: Provokateur Eberhard Zangger“ (in German), Merian, Kreta, October 2000 In 2002 he founded science communication GmbH, a consultancy firm for corporate communications.  Luwian Studies Foundation  Since April 2014, Zangger is president of the board of trustees of the international non-profit foundation Luwian Studies. The commercial register of Canton Zurich (Switzerland) states as the foundation's purpose “the exploration of the second millennium BC in western Asia Minor and the dissemination of knowledge about it”.Entry for the foundation Luwian Studies in the commercial register of canton Zurich The Board of Trustees includes Ivo Hajnal, Jorrit Kelder, Matthias Oertle and Jeffrey Spier. In May 2016, Luwian Studies went public with a website in German, English and Turkish. At the same time Zangger's book appeared: The Luwian Civilization – The missing link in the Aegean Bronze Age. As part of its research, the foundation has systematically catalogued over 340 extensive settlement sites of the Middle and Late Bronze Age in Western Asia Minor. These sites are presented in a public database on the website.  James Mellaart’s Estate  In June 2017, Zangger received unpublished documents from the estate of the British prehistorian James Mellaart, which the latter had marked to be of particular importance. The material in Mellaart's estate referred to two groups of documents, both of which were allegedly found in 1878 in a village called Beyköy, 34 kilometers north of Afyonkarahisar in western Turkey. On the one hand there was a Luwian hieroglyphic inscription (“HL Beyköy 2”) on limestone which must have been composed around 1180 BC. Mellaart, however, only possessed a drawing of this inscription. According to Mellaart's notes, in addition to this, bronze tablets bearing Hittite texts in Akkadian cuneiform were also found at Beyköy (“Beyköy text”). These described the political events during almost the entire Bronze Age from the perspective of rulers in western Asia Minor. Mellaart only possessed English translations of these documents. In December 2017, Zangger and the Dutch linguist Fred Woudhuizen published in the Dutch archeology journal Talanta the Luwian hieroglyphic drawings (including texts from Edremit, Yazılıtaş, Dağardı and Şahankaya) that were retrieved from Mellaart's estate. However, early in 2018 Zangger distanced himself from Mellaart and accused him of having falsified documents. Further research in Mellaart's former study in London in February 2018 had revealed that Mellaart had completely invented the (allegedly cuneiform) “Beyköy text”. On the other hand, Woudhuizen, who published together with Zangger, continues to believe that the Luwian hieroglyphic inscription HL Beyköy 2 is certainly not forged by Mellaart and probably genuine.  Yazılıkaya  In June 2019 Zangger together with the archeologist and astronomer Rita Gautschy of the University of Basel, published a new interpretation of the Hittite rock sanctuary Yazılıkaya at Ḫattuša, according to which the sequence of rock reliefs in chamber A could have been used as a lunisolar calender.

The National Assembly in Porto-Novo as it exists today was formed in 1990. The current National Assembly has 83 members who are directly elected through a system of party-list proportional representation and serve five-year terms. History The first parliament of an independent Benin was defined by the Constitution of 28 February 1959 and lasted from April 1959 to November 1960. It was chaired by Justin Ahomadegbé Tomètin. With a 1960 and a 1964 constitution, two new National Assemblies were enacted each time. The implementation of the Basic Law of 9 September 1977 radically altered the parliament. It was renamed the Revolutionary National Assembly (ANR) and lasted until February 1990. The High Council of the Republic was formed in February 1990 to democratize the country and was chaired by Archbishop Isidore de Souza. A new constitution was passed on 11 December 1990 which formed the basic structure of the current assembly. Electoral system The 83 members of the National assembly are directly elected by the people in a party-list proportional representation system, with 24 multi-member constituencies that are corresponding to the departments of Benin. Parties select as many candidates as there are seats to be filled, and vacancies are filled by substitutes. They serve five year terms, and the most recent election was in 2015. To be eligible to vote in Benin, a person must be at least 18 years old, a Beninese citizen, fully possess civil and political rights, and not be convicted of a crime that merits a punishment of three months in prison, in contempt of court, or have an undischarged bankruptcy. Each candidate for the Assembly must be at least 25 years of age, a resident of Benin for at least a year, and a Beninese citizen by birth or a naturalized immigrant who has resided in the country for at least ten years. Being convicted of electoral fraud or guardianship disqualifies a person from running.Benin - Assemblee Nationale Electoral system Inter-Parliamentary Union Politics In the 2015 election, Cauri Forces for an Emerging Benin retained 33 seats. They were the main party supporting President Thomas Boni Yayi. The two largest opposition parties were the Union Makes the Nation (UN) with 13 seats and the Party for Democratic Renewal (PRD) with 10. Six MPs are female, while 77 are male. Coalition building is essential. The main political issue facing the Assembly in recent years has been a proposal to amend the Constitution to allow Presidents to serve more than two terms, which has failed to receive enough support.Benin - Assemblee Nationale Last elections Inter-Parliamentary Union Adrien Houngbédji was elected as President of the National Assembly on the night of 19-20 May 2015; as the candidate representing the opposition, he received 42 votes.\\"Bénin: un membre de l’opposition à la tête de l’Assemblée nationale\\", Radio France Internationale, 20 May 2015 .Hermann Boko, \\"Bénin : l’opposant Adrien Houngbédji porté au perchoir, un revers pour le pouvoir en place\\", Le Monde, 21 May 2015 .

In the United States, where the PC- Engine was marketed as the TurboGrafx-16, the HuCard is alternately called the TurboChip. The HuCard is an evolution from an earlier Hudson Soft technology, the Bee Card, which it developed in the early 1980s as a distribution medium for MSX computer software. The Bee Card is an EEPROM device that is slightly thinner than the HuCard. It has 32 connectors whereas the HuCard has 38. Most video game cartridges have a large plastic housing to protect the PCB while providing enough space inside for radiant heat and, less often, a button cell. The PCB in a HuCard or Bee Card is protected by a rigid, glossy polymer that conducts heat; since the PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 leave one side of the card partially exposed while inserted in the console, heat disperses with less obstruction. Hudson Soft, NEC, and other vendors published seven HuCard games specifically for the PC Engine SuperGrafx. Hudson Soft called this enhanced medium the Super HuCard.

Nicosia and Troina are the northernmost towns in the province of . The vicinity was traditionally made up of salt mines and arable lands.  History  The origin of Nicosia is uncertain. Engio, Erbita and Imachara are the three cities of antiquity with which historians have attempted to identify Nicosia with, but there is no evidence that the mentioned towns are in fact Nicosia. The present name of the town suggests Greek Origins: it is believed to get its name from Saint Nicholas (), who together with San Felix are the Patrons of the Town, . Another theory suggests it is a derivative of the Greek saying \\"City of Victory\\" (, ). The town is believed to stand on the site of the ancient Engynum. The modern town was founded by Byzantine colonists in the 6th century. It expanded under the Arab domination and later under that of the Normans, who settled numerous immigrants from Lombardy and Piedmont, called \\"Lombards\\", giving rise to the Gallo-Italic dialect still spoken in the town and surrounds. King William II made Nicosia a royal city. It played an important strategic role, favoured by its position halfway between Palermo and Messina.

His early plays such as Blow-Job (1971) were overtly political, often combining harsh social comment with comedy. In his later works he moved away from purely political themes, embracing a range of surrealist, magical, philosophical and madcap, darkly comic subjects. After studying literature at the University of East Anglia, Wilson began his writing career in 1969. He began to build his reputation with a series of plays and screenplays in the early 1970s and was a founder of Portable Theatre Company, a touring company concentrating on experimental theatre. In the mid-1970s, he served as dramaturge to the Royal Shakespeare Company and produced one of his best-regarded plays, The Soul of the White Ant. In 1978, his surrealist play The Glad Hand attracted favourable notice, as did his 1994 play, Darwin's Flood, among others. He continued to write plays and screenplays until the end of his life, including for the Bush Theatre. He also wrote several novels and held teaching positions. Biography=Early years Wilson was born in Reading, the son of two teachers: Leslie Wilson and his wife Pamela Mary née Boyle.\\"Snoo Wilson\\", Contemporary Authors Online, Thomson Gale, 2006, accessed 30 November 2011 Snoo was a childhood nickname.\\"Snoo Wilson: Wayward writer of challenging plays leavened with dark comedy\\", Obituaries, The Times, 5 July 2013, p. 53 He was educated at Bradfield College, where his father taught,Hughes, Dusty. \\"Snoo Wilson obituary\\", The Guardian, 5 June 2013 and the University of East Anglia (UEA), graduating with a degree in American and English Literature in 1969.\\"Wilson, Snoo\\", Who's Who 2011, A & C Black, 2011; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2010, accessed 29 November 2011 At UEA, he was a student of Lorna SageBennett, Catherine. \\"A life up in smoke\\", guardian.co.uk, 18 January 2001, accessed 30 November 2011 and Malcolm Bradbury. Wilson's early plays, the one-act Girl Mad as Pigs and the two-act Ella Daybellfesse's Machine, were first produced at UEA in, respectively, June and November 1967. Two years later, a second one-act play, Between the Acts, was first produced in Canterbury, at the University of Kent. In 1969, Wilson embarked on a writing career. Together with Tony Bicat and David Hare, Wilson founded the Portable Theatre Company, a touring company concentrating on experimental theatre, and was its associate director from 1970 to 1975.Coveney, Michael. \\"Tales of Bob and Snoo Wilson at the Manchester International Festival\\", What'sOnStage\\" , 5 July 2013 His plays from these years included four one-act works, Charles the Martyr (1970), Device of Angels (1970), Pericles, The Mean Knight (1970) and Reason (1972), most of which dealt with overtly political subjects. 1970s Wilson's first full-length works to attract notice were Pignight and Blow-Job, both produced in 1971, in which \\"Horror and farce sat side by side.\\" Pignight, the first of his own plays that Wilson directed, is a nightmarish fantasy about a mentally disturbed former soldier, who, while on a Lincolnshire pig farm, believes that pigs are about to take over the world.\\"Portable Pigs\\", The Guardian, 16 February 1971, p. 8 Dusty Hughes called it \\"a vivid and emetic portrait of rural change and urban corruption\\". Critic Michael Billington described it as a \\"savage and disenchanted portrait of rural life\\".Billington, Michael. \\"Pignight – Young Vic,\\" The Times, 5 March 1971, p. 9 Blow-Job is a political exploration of urban violence during which a quantity of raw meat is thrown on stage to simulate the corpse of an Alsatian dog that has just been blown up.De Jongh, Nicholas. \\"The Deep End of the Pool\\", The Guardian, 7 September 1971, p. 8 With some reservations, Irving Wardle praised the piece in The Times for its \\"authentic sense of horror … its intermingling of physical outrage and savage farce.\\"Wardle, Irving. \\"Blow-Job – King's Head\\", The Times, 11 November 1971, p. 12 In Wilson's 1973 full- length play, The Pleasure Principle, comedy, politics and social comment were again combined, but to less savage effect. Billington wrote, \\"On the one hand it is a strenuous indictment of ownership, property, greed and personal exploitation: on the other, it is a madhouse extravaganza that operates on the good old comic principle of always putting a bomb under the audience's expectations.\\"Billington, Michael. \\"Pleasure Principle\\", The Guardian, 27 November 1973, p. 14 In The Observer, Robert Cushman wrote, \\"This is one of the best plays of the seventies' heartless school; Coward's Design for Living is a fount of charity by comparison.\\"Cushman, Robert. \\"End of a Genius\\", The Observer, 2 December 1973, p. 33 Other full-length plays of this period were Vampire (1973) written for Paradise Foundry, The Beast (1974), staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company and The Everest Hotel (1975) for Bush Theatre, which he also directed. In the 1970s, Wilson's plays fell from favour with theatre producers who were looking for more commercial projects. Wilson was successful with screenplays and teleplays in the 1970s, including Sunday for Seven Days (1971), The Good Life (1971), More About the Universe (1972), Swamp Music (1973), The Barium Meal (1974), The Trip to Jerusalem (1974), Don't Make Waves (1975) and A Greenish Man (1979). In 1975 and 1976, he was dramaturge to the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), and in 1976 he married the journalist Ann McFerran, a theatre critic, with whom he had two sons, Patrick and David, and a daughter, Jo. In the same year, he became script editor of the BBC television anthology drama series, Play for Today. A play that year, The Soul of the White Ant, starring Simon Callow, was first produced at the Soho Poly. It is a dramatic treatment of a racial murder in South Africa and the ensuing cover-up by the police and the press. A white woman has an affair with a Black lover and then shoots him. It is \\"possibly [Wilson's] masterpiece\\".Norman, Neil. Obituaries: Snoo Wilson, The Stage, July 2013 In 1978, The Glad Hand, in which a South African tycoon employs a troupe of actors and sails an oil tanker through the Bermuda Triangle, hoping to conjure up the Anti-Christ and kill him in a Wild West gunfight, premiered at the Royal Court Theatre and won the John Whiting Award. Cushman wrote, \\"Sceptics like me have sometimes fallen foul of Mr Wilson's concern with the occult; here he makes it easy for us. Like Tom Stoppard he sets up impossible situations and explains them; and his wit in this piece has a Stoppardian exhilaration.\\"Cushman, Robert. \\"Aboard the good ship Snoo\\", The Observer, 21 May 1978, p. 15 Later that year, Wilson was appointed Henfield Fellow at the University of East Anglia. Later years Wilson's style grew away from the overtly political manner of his contemporaries David Hare and Howard Brenton, and he often wrote about the arcane, the occult, and the irrational, whether in the Gothic intrigues of Vampire (1973), the space aliens of Moonshine (1999), or the duelling wizards of The Number of the Beast (1982).Wardle, Irving. \\"The Number of the Beast\\", The Times, 11 February 1982, p. 15 Commenting on his interest in magical subjects, Wilson said, \\"It's only because people like to think that the material world is at base solid that they have to think of magic as a separate category of events. … The stage is very near magic in what it does and it's also composed of finally the same thing, which is sort of people and tinsel, which is all magic really is.\\"\\"Briefing\\", The Observer, 10 November 1974, p. 29 On another occasion, Wilson commented, \\"I prefer to write for theatre because it can create the oldest magic. The question of its relevance is only asked by passive incredulous individuals who cannot swallow the idea that perception is an act.\\" Nevertheless, while Wilson's \\"work is non-naturalistic and largely fantastical, it is based on concrete principals (sic) about the way we live.\\" Wilson often sought to fuse social criticism with a surrealistic, comic style. He said in 1978, \\"I think, well, you have to laugh, don't you? With all the dreadful, dreadful things going on I think of that as my way of keeping a grasp on my own sensibilities. In fact, it's the only way I have.\\"Chaillet, Ned. \\"The unpredictable Snoo Wilson\\", The Times, 10 May 1978, p. 14 He wrote some of his later plays for the Bush Theatre in Shepherd's Bush, including More Light (1987) and Darwin's Flood (1994). The first \\"convened Giordano Bruno with Elizabeth I, Doctor Dee and a female Shakespeare in heaven in 1600\\".Coveney, Michael. \\"Snoo Wilson: Playwright whose work was fuelled by his chaotic visions of the absurd and surreal\\", The Independent, 9 July 2013 In Darwin's Flood, Charles Darwin is visited on the eve of his death by his fascistic sister Elizabeth, her feckless husband Bernard, a dominatrix Mary Magdalene, the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and Jesus in the guise of a wisecracking Irish bicyclist who seduces Darwin's wife, Emma.

C7; and Billington, Michael, \\"Short on theory\\", The Guardian, 10 May 1994, p. A7 The director Simon Stokes commented that there is a serious message behind such extravagances: \\"In a very humorous way the play is also asking: What if God does exist, and put the fossils in the rocks?\\"O'Mahony, John. \\"Snoo's ark lands\\", The Observer, 1 May 1994, p. C7 A departure from Wilson's usual theatrical genres was in 1986, when he wrote a new libretto for Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld for the English National Opera. The reviews concentrated on the production designs, which strongly divided opinion; Wilson's work escaped the sharp censure directed at his colleagues, and his device of turning the bossy character \\"Public Opinion\\" into a parody of the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was favourably remarked upon.Griffiths, Paul. \\"Flamboyant underworld of a cartoonist's vision – Orpheus in the Underworld\\", The Times, 11 September 1985, p. 15; and Heyworth, Peter. \\"Orpheus in the Undergrowth, The Observer, 15 September 1985, p. 21 Wilson's only play to have a production in the West End was HRH, concerning the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in exile. His television movies included Shadey, an ESP-themed piece for Channel 4 (1986) and Eichmann, about the interrogation of the eponymous character (2007). Two musicals, aimed at youth theatre, were Bedbug: The Musical, an adaptation of the 1929 play by Vladimir Mayakovsky, and a musical about the short and dramatic life of soldier- composer Felix Powell. Sabina (1998) \\"remains the best drama about Carl Jung's relationship with a young female mental patient, and later his student, Sabina Spielrein\\". In 2010, one of Wilson's last plays to be staged was Reclining Nude with Black Stockings, about the 1912 rape trial of Austrian painter Egon Schiele. Wilson taught literature and theatre at various institutions both in Britain and America later in life. His academic posts included those of US Bicentennial Fellow in Playwriting (1981–82) and Associate Professor of Theatre at the University of California at San Diego (1987). He taught scriptwriting at the National Film School and returned to UEA as writer in residence. Of his non-theatre works, his 1984 novel, Spaceache, was described by Margaret Drabble and Jenny Stringer as \\"a dystopian fantasy of a grim and ruthless high-technology low-competence future\\".Drabble, Margaret and Jenny Stringer. \\"Wilson, Snoo\\", The Concise Oxford Companion to English Literature,Oxford University Press, 2007, Oxford Reference Online, accessed 29 November 2011 John Melmoth, the reviewer in The Times Literary Supplement, wrote that Wilson scored in his \\"nearness to the knuckle … a quirky, unpleasant and emetic sense of humour.\\"Melmoth, John. \\"A nice class of enemy\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 16 March 1984, p. 267 Wilson also reviewed plays under the pseudonym Andy Boyle.

In the context Smart uses it, he is criticising dualism and epiphenomenalism as philosophies of mind, and the concerns over physical and causal laws they raise.

He appeared in films throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and had a significant television career in the 1950s. He often appeared with his wife Mary Healy. During World War II Hayes enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and appeared in both the play and Winged Victory film of Winged Victory. In 1946, Hayes opened at the Copacabana in New York. This led to an engagement with the Dinah Shore radio show. Hayes and Healy were the original singers of the Chevrolet jingle \\"See The U.S.A. In Your Chevrolet\\" in 1950. (Dinah Shore later sang the song for Chevrolet starting in 1952.) The couple starred in Zis Boom Bah (1941) along with Grace Hayes and were top-billed in the cult fantasy musical film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T. (1953). He also had a considerable reputation as a singer of comic songs, several of which made their way onto record, including \\"Life Gets Tee-Jus, Don't It\\". Hayes may best be remembered for being designated substitute for Arthur Godfrey on both his CBS-TV and radio programs as well as several short-lived television series in which he and Healy co- hosted or co-starred, such as The Peter Lind Hayes Show (1950–51), Star of the Family (1950-1952), and Peter Loves Mary (1960–61).

He is considered one of the greatest rikishi in history, although he was never promoted to yokozuna. To date, he holds the record for best top division win ratio of all time. Early life Raiden was born to a farming family in a village in rural Shinano Province. He is said to have possessed great physical strength even in childhood. His father Hanemon, who enjoyed sumo as much as sake, allowed 14-year-old Raiden to attend sumo classes at Nagaze (today called Murokocho), the neighbouring village. When Raiden was 17, the Urakaze- beya stablemaster noticed him when he came through the area while on jungyō (regional tour) with his wrestlers. He was especially impressed with the young man's physique, which was extraordinary at the time. Young Raiden was tall, which was three head lengths taller than most of his contemporaries. He also had matching long arms and large hands; a handprint at the Shofukuji temple near Okayama, which is said to be of Raiden's hand, measures from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger. When Raiden trained as a wrestler, he developed a weight of . When Urakaze Kazuki invited him to Edo and started training him, it turned out that Raiden possessed not only the body of a giant (by 18th- century Japanese standards), but also a talent for sumo wrestling. He was especially talented in oshi-sumo techniques and was able to move at a high speed considering his size. Soon Raiden left his stable and unofficially joined Isenoumi-beya, where yokozuna Tanikaze became his coach.  Professional sumo career  In 1789, the shikona (wrestler name) \\"Raiden\\", which means \\"thunder bolt\\", appeared in the banzuke ranking, although Raiden did not have his debut until fall 1790. Raiden was ranked as a sekiwake, as was common practice then. He had the best record in the basho (tournament) without a defeat. After Tanikaze's death, Raiden was promoted to ōzeki in March 1795, a rank he retained for nearly 17 years. Between November 1793 and April 1800, Raiden finished with the best record in all tournaments he participated in, ahead of the other great fighters of his time, Tanikaze and Onogawa. After 1800, he remained dominant, and sumo officials even disallowed him to use his favourite techniques in order to keep his matches interesting. Of the 35 tournaments in which he participated (there were only two basho a year at the time), Raiden had the best record in no fewer than 28. In seven of those, he won without suffering a single defeat or draw. In total, he achieved 254 victories and only ten defeats, a winning percentage of 96.2, an all-time record. His longest winning streaks were eleven consecutive tournaments, or 44 bouts. Raiden's championships are, however, regarded as unofficial by the Japan Sumo Association, as before the current yūshō system was established in 1909, there was no prize given for individual performances in tournaments.  Retirement from sumo  Finally, in spring 1811, Raiden retired from sumo at the age of 43. He became chairman of the sumo association of Izumo Province (in today's Shimane Prefecture), where his sponsor daimyō resided. In 1816, he moved to Edo and finished his diary Shokoku Sumo Hikae-cho (\\"journal of sumo in various regions\\"), which describes his time as an active wrestler since 1789. After his death, he was buried in Akasaka in Edo. Two locks of his hair are buried in other graves which are located in his home village and in Matsue in Shimane. When Raiden was still an active wrestler, his home village's residents built monuments honoring his parents. Raiden himself contributed a sake barrel made of stone in memory of his father. Since his death, Raiden has appeared not only as subject of a number of statues, but also on postage stamps and beer labels. Lack of yokozuna promotion Despite his dominance at the time, Raiden never was promoted to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo. The exact reason for this remains a mystery in the history of the sport. Journalist Masahiko Nomi theorized that the 19th Yoshida Oikaze granted yokozuna licences to only two wrestlers, Tanikaze and Onogawa, and had not intended to honour any more in the future. Decades later, the 20th Yoshida Oikaze attempted to defeat the Gojo family, which wanted to promote Kashiwado and Tamagaki to yokozuna, by awarding a yokozuna licence to Ōnomatsu Midorinosuke. Ōnomatsu became the first new yokozuna in nearly 40 years. Another theory has suggested that the reason for the snub may have been due to clan politics. Raiden's sponsor, Daimyo Matsudaira Harusato, was a descendant of Yūki Hideyasu, a son of Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Yoshida family, who held the privilege of awarding the yokozuna licenses, supported the Hosokawa clan, who had a history of supporting Ishida Mitsunari. Yokozuna was not formally recognized as rank on the banzuke until the beginning of the 20th century. When Jinmaku Kyūgorō erected the yokozuna memorial monument at Tomioka Hachiman Shrine in 1900, he included Raiden's name as a \\"peerless rikishi\\", in spite of his never having been officially promoted.  Top division record  *The actual time the tournaments were held during the year in this period often varied. *Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament and the above unofficial championships are historically conferred.

A longa rest (modern form) worth two breves A longa (pl. longe or longae), long, quadruple note (Am.), or quadruple whole note is a musical note that could be either twice or three times as long as a breve (Am.: double whole note, or double note), four or six times as long as a semibreve (Am.: whole note), that appears in early music. The number of breves in a long was determined by the \\"modus\\" or \\"mode\\" of a passage. Sections in perfect mode used three breves to the long while sections in imperfect mode used two breves to the long. Imperfect longs, worth two breves, existed in perfect mode from the earliest sources (late 12th century), while the fourteenth century saw the introduction of perfect longs, worth three breves, in imperfect mode through the use of dots of addition (puncti additiones). Prior to the innovations of Franco of Cologne in the mid- thirteenth century, the value of the longa was in common usage in both theoretical and practical sources but appeared primarily in pre-mensural notation ligatures, symbols representing two or more notes joined together. A ligature that began with a longa was said to lack \\"propriety\\", while ligatures ending with a longa possessed \\"perfection\\", since in the view of that era a \\"proper and perfect\\" rhythmic sequence was the succession of a brevis followed by a longa, justified by the fact that the ligature representing this rhythm is written the same way as a plainchant ligature (a different usage of the term from above). As a result, there were four possible ligature types: those beginning with a brevis and ending with a longa, which had both propriety and perfection; the reverse, which had neither; those both beginning and ending with a longa, which lacked propriety but had perfection; and those beginning and ending with a brevis, which were proper but not perfect (; ). Two longae, rarely three, had the combined value of a maxima. The theoretical value of a maximodus perfectus could only be written with three longae or a maxima plus a longa . Prior to 1450, the longa was typically written with a filled notehead with void (unfilled) and red noteheads used only to indicate an imperfect longa where perfect longae would otherwise be expected. Over the course of the fifteenth century, the void notehead (shown in the image above) became the norm . Unlike other rests used in [mensural notation] which, like the notes, took the same form whether perfect or imperfect, longa rests often had different forms when the rest was imperfect—filling two spaces—or perfect—filling three spaces . Although it is described as late as 1667, by this date the note symbol was of purely theoretical interest, since changes in notational practice had rendered it too extended a value for practical use . While the longa note has not been used for more than three centuries, the longa rest still appears as a way of writing rests that last exactly four measures . When the longa note occurs in modern notation (since it is supported by some scorewriters), it is often given the rounded notehead shape of the double whole note, looking like 15px. In this context it is sometimes called a quadruple whole note (; ). In LilyPond, the longa stem appears similarly to that of a half note, instead of always appearing on the right of the notehead as it does in mensural notation: this can be seen below.

History  The \\"Rats Dungeon\\", or \\"Dungeon of the Rats\\", was a feature of the Tower of London alleged by Roman Catholic writers from the Elizabethan era. \\"A cell below high-water mark and totally dark\\" would draw in rats from the River Thames as the tide flowed in. Prisoners would have their \\"alarm excited\\", and in some instances have \\"flesh ... torn from the arms and legs\\". During the Dutch Revolt, Diederik Sonoy, an ally of William the Silent, is documented to have used a method where a pottery bowl filled with rats was placed open side down on the naked body of a prisoner. When hot charcoal was piled on the bowl, the rats would \\"gnaw into the very bowels of the victim\\" in an attempt to escape the heat. Rat torture appears in the famous case study of a patient of Sigmund Freud. The Rat Man obsessed that his father and lady friend would be subjected to this torture. Rat torture was used by several South American military dictatorships: in Brazil during the military regime of 1964–1985,(December 10, 2014) \\"Brazil president weeps as she unveils report on military dictatorship’s abuses\\", The Guardian in Uruguay during the civic-military dictatorship of 1973–1985,Grupo de denuncia de la violencia sexual sufrida durante el terrorismo de Estado (2014).

Irrendentos Libros in Chile during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973–1990), and in Argentina during the period of the National Reorganization Process (1976–1983). The report of CONADEP in Argentina detailed the use of a torture method known as \\"the recto-scope\\" (reserved primarily for Jewish prisoners) which consisted of inserting living rats into a victim's rectum or vagina through a tube. Amnesty International documented the case of a woman tortured by the Chilean CNI (National Information Center, successor to the DINA) in 1981, who described being kept in a room full of live rats during interrogation.Chile: Evidence of torture: an Amnesty International Report. London (Amnesty International Publications) 1983, pp. 35–37 On October 16, 2010 in Lakewood, New Jersey, David Wax was alleged to have threatened kidnap victim Yisrael Bryskman with rat torture unless he agreed to give his wife a get (Jewish divorce document).Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) \\"Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad\\", GQ He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for assisting in a kidnapping.(January 13, 2016) \\"NJ Couple Sentenced For Helping Jewish Divorce Ring\\", The Times of Israel  In fiction  An erotic comic by Eric Stanton depicting rat torture Rats are featured in the Edgar Allan Poe story The Pit and the Pendulum. The narrator lies on the rack, and can only watch as a scythe swings back and forth, approaching closer each time, as rats swarm over his body. The narrator later manages to make the rats eat through the straps. An account similar to the Sonoy torture appears in the 1899 Octave Mirbeau novel The Torture Garden, and psychologist Leonard Shengold has identified this as the possible source of the story that the Rat Man told Freud. Part of the book, an imaginary dialog between a torturer and a beautiful woman who is sexually excited by the accounts, is set in China. The threat of rat torture occurs in Nineteen Eighty-Four. The central character, Winston Smith, is arrested by the Ministry of Love, and undergoes a process of mental reprogramming. The ministry imprisons him in Room 101 to finalize the reprogramming. Here Winston must face his greatest fear: rats. A cage filled with hungry rats is placed over his head, their only source of food or escape being by eating their way through Winston's face. At this point Winston breaks and begs that the method actually be used on his lover Julia, a sign that he has finally been broken.

Restless Development currently works in India, Nepal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe and has offices in London and New York. Restless Development works to bring young people to the decision- making table across three areas: civic participation, livelihoods and employment, and sexual and reproductive health and rights.  History  Restless Development was founded as Students Partnership Worldwide in 1985 by Jim Cogan, the Deputy Head of Westminster School. It was originally a gap year programme for school leavers from Westminster School to work as supply teachers in India or Zimbabwe. In 1992 SPW started recruiting local volunteers to make programmes more sustainable. This proved to be extremely effective and became a hallmark of SPW's work. Between 1991-2000 new country programmes in Nepal, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa were launched and there was an increasing focus on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. From 2000 onwards SPW began to purely use local volunteers to deliver programmes. Between 2000-2006 new country programmes in Zambia and Sierra Leone were launched. In 2010 SPW re- branded and became Restless Development.  Restless Development today  Restless Development is driven forward by young people and young professionals around the world. More than 1,000 young men and women, with an average age of 21 years, lead the direct delivery of the programmes in communities across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Around 87% of Restless Development's volunteers are national volunteers volunteering in their own countries. Restless Development sends volunteers from the UK abroad to work alongside national volunteers through its flagship International Citizen Service (ICS) programme.

It is the most used pass in the U.S. state of Oregon. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) made the Siskiyou Trail over the pass before pioneers traversed it with their wagons, while still later it evolved into a stage road, a railroad line, and a highway route. The name Siskiyou is believed to be derived from Cree, meaning \\"bob-tailed horse\\". Siskiyou Pass is west of the summit (high point) of Interstate 5, which is known as Siskiyou Summit (though sometimes it is referred to as \\"Siskiyou Pass\\"). Geography The pass is situated in Jackson County on the road and rail transport link between Oregon and California. It measures above MSL. Situated along Oregon Route 273 (also known as Old Highway 99), it is north of California state boundary, and west of the I-5 summit feature, Siskiyou Summit. To the west, there is a mountain with a \\"rounded-top\\" known as the Ogden Hill, which rises to an elevation of . Pilot Rock is nearby, named for its use as a visual guide for traversing across the pass. Tunnel 13 on the Oregon and California Railroad line, which is now operated by the Central Oregon and Pacific Railroad, summits at Siskiyou Pass. History Its historic use as a pass is traced to Euro Americans who ventured into this region during the late 1820s. The first person noted with crossing this pass was Peter Skene Ogden, an HBC fur trader, who led his group of trappers traveling from south to north in February 1827. The hazards and extreme winter climate was experienced in 1829 when Alexander Roderick McLeod encountered a severe blizzard while traveling from Fort Vancouver via the Rogue Valley. It forced him to turn back from the pass. HBC started using the pass as a trial for wagons in the later part of the nineteenth century and then converted it into a stage road, and eventually to a railroad line. The pass was beset with security issues as local Indian tribes attacked the foreign agencies operating on the route including robbing rail cars. Between the 1890s through 1910s, the motivating force changed to locomotive driven snow plowers to push the ice packs and pave way for traffic to pass that could reduce the time of travel which otherwise used to take months in the initial years of travel. By the 1940s, a guardrail system was implemented along the highway, using short, white posts. It is the most used pass in the state. Road The pass contains a hazardous stretch of the road starting from Milepost 18 of northbound I-5, which has a steep slope of 6%, negotiating a height of in a short road length of . The descent along this highway is considered the most dangerous, particularly on foggy nights when visibility is almost next to nothing. In spite of the hazards involved, 13,000 trucks ply this route every day. To address emergency situations for drivers, escape ramps have been provided at Mileposts 6.3 and 9.5. An extensive warning system has been devised and put into effect to make truckers be aware of what they are likely to face on this pass. The precautionary measures including chaining truck tires along road shoulders, providing designated inspection sites, as well as avoiding travel during night and early morning hours in winter months. It is also recommended that drivers listen to updated weather information and road conditions on the radio before and during the entire journey through the pass. Rail The Oregon & California Railroad proposed an alternate route for the Oregon and California rail connection, which would have avoided Siskiyou Pass. However, Oregon politicians decided in favor of the present rail route. When Tunnel 13 was completed in 1887, beneath the Siskiyou Pass, there was finally a rail link between Oregon and California.

He lives in Camden, Central London. While studying at Cambridge University, Roy started playing the computer game Quake online against other players, and found that he had quite an aptitude for the game. Through an online server, he found that he was one of the best players in Europe. He spent many hours online, making full use of the high-speed 'JANET' connection Universities were graced with (offering a stable ~20 ping), and competed with clan Demonic Core. He is also credited with discovering how to rocketjump out of deep lava on the Quake 1 level DM4, a demo of him performing this move spread quickly around the Quake community and is now a common move in many FPS games. In the days before broadband Internet was available, he installed an ISDN line in his bedroom to improve his online performance. Roy graduated from Cambridge University with an M.A. in Natural Sciences. After graduating from Cambridge, he took up a job at the merchant bank, JP Morgan, working on New York City's Wall Street, and regularly being shuttled between London and New York City. Sujoy has appeared on many TV programmes on the main United Kingdom networks and satellite channels. He has also been interviewed by major newspapers and magazines, including the Financial Times and Sunday Times, as well as many computer magazines. Sponsorships and endorsements included the Razer Boomslang mouse, probably the first mouse designed for online gamers. Sujoy had this mouse custom painted with the Union Jack by a motorcycle helmet artist, and it was a signature item at tournaments in which he competed. Sujoy's custom painted Razer gaming mouse Sujoy retired from online gaming in 2001/2002 following the dotcom crash and set about organising multiplayer tournaments in the UK. Along with business partner, Dominic Mulroy, Sujoy helped found the VGA (Virtual Gaming Alliance), an organisation of internet gaming centres throughout the United Kingdom. Sujoy founded two Multiplayer Lan Gaming Centres named after his community website ESReality, one in Harrow, West London and the other in Maidenhead, Berks. In 2006, with the release of Quake 4 Sujoy briefly returned to compete at several competitions. However, success proved elusive and he slipped back into retirement shortly after. In 2008 Sujoy was involved in launching Omega Sektor and managed the London Mint professional gaming team that competed in the Championship Gaming Series. In December 2007 Sujoy launched Gamerbase, a gaming centre located within the HMV store at the London Trocadero in Piccadilly Circus. Gamerbase was acquired by the high street entertainment chain, HMV, in October 2008 and Sujoy subsequently joined HMV in a managerial capacity to oversee the technical aspects of Gamerbase. Gamerbase won the Retail Innovation award in 2009 from MCV, the leading UK video games trade magazine. Sujoy has opened three further Gamerbase stores in the UK inside HMV stores in Manchester, Glasgow and Reading.

In the Soviet Union  The phrase was apparently coined by Yury Olesha.

And therefore I raise my glass to you, writers, the engineers of the human soul\\" (Joseph Stalin, \\"Speech at home of Maxim Gorky\\", 26 October 1932).

Founded as a used bookstore specializing in manga in 1980, Mandarake incorporated in 1987 and presently operates 11 retail locations and one fulfillment center. The company focuses on the purchase and sale of a wide range of collectables and otaku-related goods, including anime- and manga- related items, DVDs, CDs, toys, figurines, trading cards, video games, cosplay items, animation cels, and dōjinshi (self-published works). Overview=History The entrance to Nakano Broadway in Nakano, Tokyo. The complex houses Mandarake's first store and corporate offices. Mandarake was established by manga artist . A member of the Garo Trio (ガロ三羽烏) along with and , Furukawa and the group became known in the 1970s for their work in the alternative manga magazine Garo. Initially established as a used manga store, Mandarake opened its first location at a seven-square meter storefront in the Nakano Broadway shopping complex in Nakano, Tokyo in 1980. Furukawa developed a public profile and promoted Mandarake through his appearances on ', a variety series on TV Tokyo in which he appeared as an appraiser for rare and vintage manga. The store was formally incorporated in February 1987, with Furukawa's father appointed as president. The company subsequently began a process of expansion, acquiring multiple stores in Nakano Broadway and widening its scope to sell a broader range of otaku-related goods. Mandarake opened its second store in Shibuya in 1994, and began to steadily expand its number of stores thereafter. In 1995, the company established a publishing department that publishes Mandarake Manga List, a mail order catalog, and Mandarake Zenbu, a premium hobby magazine for collectors. Mandarake was listed on Mothers and became a public company on July 26, 2000, and moved to the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on February 1, 2015. In 2001, Mandarake launched , an internet streaming television channel, in partnership with Activision. The channel, which aired a variety of otaku-related content, suspended service in 2008. Operations toy robots such as Ultraman and Transformers. As of September 2018, toy sales make up the majority of Mandarake's business, composing 48 percent of all non-consolidated sales. Books compose 14 percent of all sales, doujinshi compose 13 percent, and other publications that are not books or doujinshi compose 1 percent; the remaining 24 percent of sales are composed of miscellaneous items. Exports compose 17 percent of Mandarake's non-consolidated sales. Locations In Kantō, Mandarake operates six locations: four stores located in Tokyo, one store located in Utsunomiya, and a warehouse fulfillment center located in Chiba. In Tokyo, Mandarake's first store in Nakano has operated continuously out of the Nakano Broadway shopping complex since 1980, which also houses the company's corporate offices. Nakano Broadway houses twenty-seven individual shops (also known as annexes or kan) operating under the Mandarake brand. Each shop is focused on a single category of item, such as cosplay costumes or doujinshi. Several Mandarake annexes in Nakano Broadway were once independent stores that were acquired by the company. Additional stores in Tokyo include Mandarake Complex, an eight-story store in Akihabara opened in April 2008; Mandarake Shibuya, which features a karaoke stage; and Mandarake Ikebukuro, a store located near Otome Road that specializes in boys' love and shōjo manga. Outside of Tokyo, Mandarake Utsunomiya is located in Mageshichō, Utsunomiya, while in rural Katori, Chiba, the company operates Mandarake Sahra, a storage and fulfillment center. Mandarake Sahra is open to the public for buyback only, and not sales. In Hokkaido, Mandarake Sapporo moved to its current location at from its former space at on March 17, 2012, tripling the size of the store. In Tōkai, Mandarake Nagoya moved to its current location in Naka-ku in 2007 due to insufficient floor space at its previous location; the move saw Mandarake Nagoya expand the size of the store from 266 square meters to 578 square meters. In Kansai, Mandarake operates two locations located in Osaka. Mandarake's first store in Osaka, Mandarake Umeda, is located in Doyama. Its second location in Osaka, Mandarake Grandchaos, is located in Amerikamura. Two shop locations operate in Kyushu: Mandarake Fukuoka is located in Tenjin, and Mandarake Kokura is located in Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyūshū. Mandarake also operates an online storefront in both Japanese and English. The store ships items both domestically within Japan, and internationally to 83 countries. Internationally, Mandarake operated a store in California from 1999 to 2003; initially located in Torrance, the store later relocated to Santa Monica before ultimately closing. The company also formerly operated a store in Bologna in 2001, and a store in Beijing. File:Mandarake Complex, Akihabara.jpgExterior of Mandarake Complex in Akihabara, Tokyo.

Impact Mandarake is the largest secondhand comics retailer in the world, with the company's financial success cited by Philomena Keet in Tokyo Fashion City as \\"a testament to the fervor of Japanese fanatics, the dedication of Japanese collectors, and the richness of Japan's material culture.\\" The company sells and purchases roughly ten thousand items per day, and has a point of sale system that includes over 20 million items. Its original pricing and appraisal operations are recognized as having a major impact on the secondhand book market. The company maintains a policy of purchasing items at roughly half the cost it plans to resell the item, which was noted by The New York Times as bringing transparency to the often opaque appraisal market. The company actively seeks foreign customers, offering an English-language online store and sales staff fluent in foreign languages. The company also promotes itself as a tourist attraction in Japan, and is marketed as a major destination for foreign otaku. Controversies=Inventory-related controversies In 2003, Mandarake was accused of selling improperly-acquired manuscripts by Kenshi Hirokane and Yayoi Watanabe. The items in question were sold to Mandarake by Hirokane and Watanabe's publisher Sakura Comics, rather than returned to the artists, in an unsuccessful attempt by the publisher to stave off bankruptcy. Mandarake contended that it had no way of knowing that Sakura Publishing was not permitted to sell the manuscripts; the manuscripts were ultimately returned to the artists in a subsequent lawsuit. In 2016, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department cited Mandarake under the for insufficiently verifying the identities of individuals who purchased items from Mandarake in online auctions. Under that law, individuals purchasing secondhand goods must identify themselves with photo identification, in order for police to track the movement of secondhand goods that may have been stolen. In response, the Tokyo District Court suspended Mandarake Complex's online sales license for one month, and fined the company ¥300,000. In 2018, an original illustration from Ai to Makoto, one of a series of fifteen believed lost in 1974, was listed for sale in an online auction by Mandarake. Ai to Makoto publisher Kodansha requested that the illustration be returned to the company, and issued a statement asking the public to not bid in the auction. The illustration ultimately sold at auction to a private buyer for ¥4 million. 2012 unpaid overtime lawsuit On November 16, 2012, a former Mandarake employee petitioned the Tokyo District Court for the payment of unpaid overtime from the company, claiming that he was not compensated for time spent at work before and after store opening hours. The plaintiff sought ¥2,292,246 in unpaid wages and additional damages of ¥2,194,046. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, and ordered Mandarake to pay ¥2,233,606 in unpaid wages and additional damages of ¥2,108,165. 2014 shoplifting incident On August 4, 2014, a vintage Tetsujin 28-go tin toy worth ¥250,000 was shoplifted from Mandarake Nakano. Mandarake posted an image of the shoplifter taken from security camera footage on their website with the subject's face obscured using mosaic censorship, alongside a statement that the image would be posted with the pixelation removed if the item was not returned within a week. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police requested that Mandarake not publish the uncensored image; though Manadarake initially stated that it would not comply with the request, the company ultimately elected not to publish the uncensored image. The incident prompted a public debate over the ethics of Mandarake's actions, and whether they constituted an illegal threat of intimidation. In an interview with Weekly Toyo Keizai, Mandarake president Masuzo Furukawa stated that decision to post the image was motivated by a desire to have the item returned, and to deter future shoplifters. Shoko Nakagawa was among the public figures who voiced support for Mandarake's actions. On August 19, 2014, the shoplifter was identified as Kazutoshi Iwama and arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police after he attempted to sell the toy to another secondhand store. Iwama stated that he was unaware that Mandarake posted his image until after he was arrested. He was later sentenced in court to one year of imprisonment and three years of probation.

After a hiatus from the show that stretched from 2003 to 2010, he served as executive producer of the franchise from 2011 to 2014. Tzachor's tenure Tzachor's time spent as producer brought many firsts to the world of Power Rangers in terms of storywriting and character development. Dark themes were used (particularly in Power Rangers in Space and Power Rangers Time Force) instead of the usual comedic tone, and actual casualties of good characters, which had been occurring in Tokusatsu for years, began to be implemented. It would also mark the first time that Power Rangers started fresh every season after Power Rangers: In Space. Furthermore, under Tzachor, much of Power Rangers would draw more material from their Super Sentai counterpart this is also supported by every season's plot being similar to its Sentai counterpart and very little of the plot is changed. Fans of the show have criticized Tzachor for what is viewed as an \\"overdependence\\" on the source material, and opinion is divided on his contributions to the series. Disney era/departure After Disney's acquisition of the franchise, Tzachor's final series, Power Rangers Wild Force, would be a split season. Because of Disney's recently completed acquisition of Fox Family Worldwide (and therefore Saban), the first half aired on Fox Kids, while the second half aired on ABC Kids. Ironically, Tzachor was succeeded as producer by the person from whom he took the reins in 1997, Douglas Sloan. MMPR Productions was shut down, and production of the show was transferred to Village Roadshow KP Productions in Auckland, New Zealand (now known as Power Rangers Productions). The Wild Force finale, The End of the Power Rangers, which was Tzachor's final episode with the franchise until Power Rangers Samurai, was directed by him. Saban Brands era After Disney sold the Power Rangers Brand back to Saban in the form of Saban Brands, Jonathan Tzachor was hired to produce the eighteenth season of Power Rangers in New Zealand, known as Power Rangers Samurai and Power Rangers Super Samurai. He returned to the directors chair for the Samurai/RPM crossover special \\"Clash of the Red Rangers: The Movie\\" and the 2012 Halloween special \\"Trickster Treat\\", as well as several episodes of the series that would succeed Samurai, Power Rangers Megaforce and its follow-up Power Rangers Super Megaforce, before being succeeded as executive producer by Judd Lynn in 2015.

It moved to the United Kingdom in 1926 but returned to India in 1936 and was based there when the Second World War started. The regiment returned to the United Kingdom in 1940, becoming part of 26th Armoured Brigade in the 6th Armoured Division. As part of this formation, the regiment fought at the Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943 and the Siege of Tunis in May 1943, before landing in Naples in January 1944 and taking part in the Battle of Monte Cassino in May 1944. Post-war The regiment was posted to Flug Marine Barracks in Schleswig at the end of the war but moved to Lulworth Camp in late 1946.

The brand was manufactured and designed by Elgato Systems, founded in 1992 by Markus Fest and is headquartered in Munich, Germany, until 2018 when the brand was sold to Corsair.  History  The brand, Elgato, was formerly a brand of Elgato Systems. The Elgato brand was used to refer to the company gaming and thunderbolt devices and was commonly called Elgato Gaming. On June 28th, 2018, Corsair acquired the Elgato brand from Elgato Systems, while Elgato Systems kept their smart home division and renamed the company to Eve Systems.  Products  A rear view of the Elgato Thunderbolt dock showing the available ports alt= Thunderbolt dock Elgato introduced a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is plugged into the dock using a Thunderbolt port in order to gain access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports not available in the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Thunderbolt SSD Elgato introduced two firewire external hard drives in September 2012 called Thunderbolt Drive. Benchmark tests by MacWorld and Tom's Hardware said that the hard drive was slower than other products they tested, despite being connected through a faster Thunderbolt port, rather than Firewire. The following year, in 2013, Elgato replaced them with similar drives identified as \\"Thunderbolt Drive +\\", which added USB 3.0 support and was claimed to be faster than the previous iteration. A CNET review of a Thunderbolt Drive+ drive gave it a 4.5 out of 5 star rating. It said the drive was \\"blazing fast\\" and \\"the most portable drive to date\\" but was also expensive. An article in The Register explained that the original drives introduced in 2012 didn't perform well in benchmark tests, but the newer \\"plus\\" version had impressive speed results during testing. Game Capturing Game Capture HD, which connects to gaming consoles to record gameplay, was introduced in 2012. It was created in response to gamers that were hacking EyeTV products for gameplay recording. The device connects between a gaming console and the TV and is powered by a USB connection. It captures video as the console sends it to the television, compresses and stores it. A review in iPhone Life gave it 4 out of 5 stars and noted that it could also be used to record iPad games with the right setup. In October 2014 Elgato released a new version called HD 60. It recorded in 60 frames per second and 1080p high definition video (compared to the previous Game Capture HD's 1080p30 or 720p60), whereas typical low-end video game recording devices capture in 720p and 30 frames per second. The Telegraph gave it four out of five stars. A review in Gizmodo said that it captured extremely high-quality footage, but it may be higher-end than needed for many gamers that would be satisfied with the recording features built into the console.

It depends on the local workweek which is dictated by local customs, religions, and business operations. For example, in the United States and much of the Western world, they are typically Monday through Friday from 9a.m. to 5p.m. Whereas within eastern countries such as Japan the normal business day is Monday through Friday from 8:30a.m. to 7p.m. The length of a business day varies by era, by region, by industry, and by company. Prevalent norms have included the 8-hour day and the 10-hour day, but various lengths, from 4 to 16 hours, have been normal in certain times and places. Business days are commonly used by couriers when determining the arrival date of a package. If a courier ships a parcel on a Thursday that will be delivered in \\"two business days\\", it will arrive on the following Monday if neither Friday nor Monday are holidays. In finance, how business days are defined are called business day conventions and determine how payments are settled on contracts such as interest rate swaps. Shifts and trends The introduction of flex time introduces the internet as a more easily globalized and offshored workforce. The notion of a business day has come under a certain degree of challenge. Information-based companies with a limited dependence on physical goods have less of a need to distinguish a weekend day from a weekday. Indeed, to many, there is no difference at all. These companies construe a business day to be any day on which they provide service. Some businesses conduct business transactions and operations on a 24/7 basis due to the nature of the field. Such businesses include hotels, hospitals, police and fire departments, gas stations, and airports. With the introduction of flex time, the significance of the traditional business day is declining. Although the 8-hour work day still remains as a standard for many industries, this trend is expected to decline further during the coming years. German- speaking countries In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, two German words of somewhat different meaning are used to describe business or working days. One is Werktag, a legal term applied to all calendar days except Sundays and public holidays; it includes most Saturdays. Werktage are days on which businesses such as retail shops and institutions such as schools are generally allowed to operate (see also Ladenschlussgesetz). In contrast, Arbeitstag refers to a day on which someone actually works. For most employees, these are Monday to Friday. However, for example, a firefighter might have an Arbeitstag on Sunday even though it is legally not a Werktag.

For the first 100 years or so of its existence it was the home of the Luc family. In the 13th century it became the property of other regional seigneurs. During the Hundred Years' War it withstood a number of sieges. During the 16th century Wars of Religion the state of Gévaudan garrisoned the castle. Around 1630 the castle was dismantled under orders of Richelieu. During the period surrounding the French Revolution it continued to fall apart from neglect.

It is endemic to the eastern United States where it is only known from the Black Warrior River drainage basin near Birmingham, Alabama. Description This species can reach a length of TL though most only reach a length of around . Distribution and habitat The watercress darter is only known to exist in four specific bodies of water, two in the Watercress Darter National Wildlife Refuge and two at the Seven Springs in the Powderly neighborhood of Birmingham. The Seven Springs populations were discovered in 2003. The species can be found in the watercress zone of springs where the water is slow-moving. They are usually found in dense mats of watercress or other aquatic vegetation, where they rest on the leaves and stems well above the stream bed. They feed on snails, crustaceans, and insect larvae in slow-moving water. Conservation and status The species is endangered and is protected in areas such as the Watercress Darter National Wildlife Refuge in Jefferson County. The IUCN lists it as being \\"Endangered\\" due to its small range, small total population size and vulnerability to deterioration in the quality of the water in the springs in which it occurs. On September 22, 2008, more than 12,000 watercress darters were killed when workers from the city of Birmingham removed a beaver dam at Roebuck Springs, emptying a pond that was the darters' habitat. An alternative solution would have been to install a flow device in the dam to regulate the pond height. The pond was emptied because it often flooded a nearby tennis court. The city emptied the beaver pond without the permission of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The FWS has ordered the dam to be restored and the pond refilled in an effort to save the remaining darters. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources is suing the City of Birmingham for destroying endangered species and their wetland habitat.

Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . black python. Simalia boeleni is a species of python, a nonvenomous snake in the family Pythonidae. The species is endemic to the mountains of New Guinea. No subspecies are currently recognized. Two coiled-up Boelen's pythons in captivity at San Diego Zoo. Etymology The specific name, boeleni, is in honor of K.W.J. Boelen, M.D., who collected the holotype specimen.Brongersma, 1953. p. 317.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Morelia boeleni, p. 29). Description In S. boeleni adults, the upperside color pattern is dark bluish-black or purplish-black, and the anterior part of the underside is white to pale yellow. The white extends up the flanks as a series of streaks. The upper and lower lips are also patterned with pale or whitish labial scales. The black portions are commonly iridescent with an oil-slick- like sheen. The body is stocky and the head large. Neonates are predominantly red upon emerging from the egg. Gradual black pigmentation presents itself as the neonate grows and sheds. Ontogenetic color charge begins as the juvenile snake approaches in length, usually around 2 years of age. Adults may be up to in total length (including tail). Conservation status The unmistakable and famed Boelen's python receives the highest legal protection possible in Papua New Guinea. It is currently listed on CITES Appendix II. It is difficult to truly assess the conservation status of these snakes, as they are incredibly secretive and difficult to find in the wild. Common names Locally, S. boeleni is also known as the blu moran or papa graun. Within Indonesia, it has several names depending on which language is used. The common Indonesian names of this snake are sanca hitam, sanca bulan, piton hitam, and ular buleni. Distribution and habitat S. boeleni is found in Indonesia (Western New Guinea in the Paniai Lakes region) and Papua New Guinea (the provinces of Eastern Highlands, Central and Morobe, and Goodenough Island). The type locality given is \\"Dimija (3[°] 56' S, 136[°] 18' E), Wissel Lakes, Dutch New Guinea, about 1750 m (5700 feet) above sea-level\\" [Western New Guinea, Indonesia]. The species inhabits forested montane regions of over elevation. It is generally encountered on the forest floor, but is also reckoned to be an able climber. Diet The diet of S. boeleni consists of mammals, lizards, and birds. Captivity S. boeleni is considered to be highly desirable by private keepers due to its beauty, but is also exceptionally rare in collections. Although captive-born snakes are fairly hardy in captivity, wild- caught individuals are considerably more difficult to keep successfully. Captive breeding is exceedingly rare, and the conditions necessary are still unclear. Many specific strategies have been employed to attempt to get these rare snakes to breed.

The library contains the complete record of American law as well as materials from over 240 other global legal jurisdictions. Established in 1832, its collections are currently housed in the James Madison Memorial Building of the Library of Congress. With over 2.8 million volumes, it is the largest law library in the world. Mission statement From the Law Library of Congress website: > The mission of the Law Library of Congress is to provide research and legal > information to the U.S. Congress as well as to U.S. Federal Courts and > Executive Agencies, and to offer reference services to the public ... To > accomplish this mission, it has created the world's largest collection of > law books and other legal resources from all countries, and now moves into > the age of digitized information with online databases and guides to legal > information worldwide. History=Early years The Library of Congress was established as an in-house reference library for Congress in 1800, the year the government moved from Philadelphia to the new city of Washington, D.C. Law books made up nearly 20% of the initial collection. These were for the most part publications in English and International law. The first Library of Congress was destroyed when the British burned the Capitol Building in 1814. It was replaced by the purchase of the library of Thomas Jefferson in 1815. This brought 475 law titles, 318 of which were published in England. It included Virginia laws and court decisions, but material from other states (which Jefferson had classified as \\"foreign law\\") remained limited. Although the Library received copies of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions, obtaining state laws and decisions of state courts remained a problem for decades. The Supreme Court There were repeated efforts to extend the use of what was generally called \\"The Congress Library\\" to other government officials and especially to the federal judiciary. The United States Supreme Court sat in the United States Capitol Building from 1801 to 1935. For the first decade of the nineteenth century its Justices could not formally use the Library of Congress, although they may have been able to consult the books with a letter of introduction from a Member of Congress. On March 2, 1812, a Joint Resolution of both Houses of Congresses authorized use of the Library by the justices of the Supreme Court, on whose behalf Chief Justice John Marshall (served 1801–1835) wrote a polite letter thanking Congress for the favor. Establishment of the Law Library in 1832 The first three decades of the nineteenth century saw repeated unsuccessful attempts to establish a separate Law Library to serve both Congress and the Supreme Court. The initiative came from those members of Congress who had had distinguished legal or judicial careers. On January 20, 1832, New York Senator William L. Marcy, a sometime Associate Judge of the Supreme Court of New York, introduced a bill to \\"Increase and Improve the Law Department of the Library of Congress\\". This time, the Bill passed both Houses of Congress and was signed by President Andrew Jackson on July 14, 1832. (The Statute remains in force, now listed as , , , and .) The Act directed the Librarian to prepare an \\"apartment\\" for the purpose of a law library and to remove the law books from the library into the apartment. The Justices of the Supreme Court were authorized to make rules and regulations for the use of the Law Library during the sitting of the court. The Law Library, however, remained a part of the Library of Congress which was responsible for its incidental expenses. A sum of $5,000 was appropriated \\"for the present year\\" to purchase law books, with $1,000 for each of the next five years. The books would be selected by the Chief Justice. Some 2,011 law books (693 of which had belonged to Thomas Jefferson) were transferred from the general collection, and became the nucleus of a collection that now exceeds 2 million volumes. The Law Library thus acquired its own appropriation and budget line, as well as a statutory relationship with the Supreme Court that would endure until 1935. Providing legal information to Congress and the Supreme Court Law Library from in the former Supreme Court Chamber From 1860 to 1897, the Law Library was housed in the former Supreme Court Chamber in the Capitol Building. A spiral staircase connected this with the Court in the room above, and the Custodian of Law (the early title of the official later called the Law Librarian, the first of whom would be Charles Henry Wharton Meehan) climbed the stair to deliver materials requested by the Justices. The rules of the Law Library, set down by the Chief Justice, permitted the Justices of the Supreme Court, Members of Congress, and some \\"gentlemen of the bar having a case on the docket\\" to sign out up to three books from the collection. The Custodian of Law helped patrons to find the law by physically locating a book and putting it in their hands. A special collection of major texts and court decisions was reserved for the exclusive use of the Justices. The acquisition of the Louisiana Territory (1803) and of Florida (1819), which brought property and inheritance systems based on French and Spanish law, provided some incentive for the acquisition of books from the civil law tradition. The first systematic effort to collect foreign law came in 1848 soon after the conclusion of the Mexican War, when Congress directed the Library to obtain all available laws of Mexico. In the second half of the nineteenth century collections of laws of the major European nations were added. Public service circa 1898 Although the Library of Congress was founded and funded to serve Congress, from the earliest years there was pressure to make its collections available to the public as well as to government officials. By the end of the nineteenth century members of the public were free to consult the collections, although only Members of Congress and a few other officials could borrow books. The Law Library had a few tables, which were usually occupied by students from local law schools. The Law Librarian's Annual Report for 1898 described a room \\"about 50 feet square. This cockpit, dim-lighted and inconvenient, ... is expected to accommodate the justices, lawyers engaged in cases, the members of the bar in search of light, as well as law students.\\" Service was limited by crowding, short hours, and a small staff who were obligated to serve Congress and the Supreme Court before anyone else. A law reading room with a limited collection was set up in the newly opened Library of Congress Building in 1897, and eventually the entire collection and staff moved to less crowded quarters in the new building. Expansion The 20th century saw a major expansion of the scope of all Law Library activities. Reference service to the public benefited from a larger and, equally important, a well-catalogued collection. In the first decade of the 20th century the Law Library began a program of publication of authoritative reference works on the laws of the United States and of major foreign nations. After the early 1900s the Law Library was led by a series of Law Librarians with high professional qualifications and previous experience in the practice of law, the foreign service, or academic law schools. They oversaw what became a major on-going program of legal indexing, first for the laws of the United States and then for those of foreign nations. In 1899 the law collection consisted of 103,000 volumes (including 15,000 duplicates), of which about 10,000 were in foreign languages. By 1950, 150,000 of 750,000 volumes were in foreign languages. The major acquisition of foreign language material came after the Second World War, and reflected the great increase in the absolute number of jurisdictions in the world, the changing position of the United States in world affairs and the deliberate policy of attempting to collect legal material from all jurisdictions. The 1909 publication of the index to the United States federal statutes, which immediately became a standard reference work for law libraries, marked the beginning of the Law Library's transition from a purely local reference library to a major center for legal research. Law Librarian Dr. Edwin Borchard began the production of bibliographic guides to the law of foreign countries with the 1912 publication of a guide to the law of Germany, followed in 1913 by his own Bibliography of International Law and Continental Law. For the next several decades major publications on the laws of Spain, France, the larger Latin American countries, Eastern Europe and East Asia were produced, usually with support from various foundations or government agencies. Initially the work was done by temporary staff or outside experts, but after the mid-1930s the Law Library gradually began adding permanent staff whose primary qualifications were in foreign rather than United States law. The permanent staff of the Law Library grew from 5 in 1901 to 6 in 1910, stayed at 7 from 1911 through 1921, and numbered 10 in 1924. Their numbers were augmented by sets of temporary workers employed on specific projects and funded either by grants from foundations or by one-time Congressional appropriations. By 1946 the total had increased to 30, and the Law Library requested 30 additional positions to relieve the overburdened staff. Funding from outside bodies supported the expansion of the Law Library's foreign research capabilities after the Second World War. From 1949 to 1960 the National Committee for a Free Europe supported a staff of 12 lawyers from Eastern European and Baltic countries then under Communist rule. In 1951 the Department of State began a Far Eastern Law Project, under which refugee scholars from China collected and translated legal material from the newly established People's Republic of China. By the 1950s the Law Library responded to the manifold problems of trying to find, much less interpret, foreign legal information by striving to, whenever possible, employ individuals trained in the law of the country in question and able to provide authoritative answers in English. The staff of foreign-trained attorneys has, over the years since the late 1940s, included former judges, private practitioners, diplomats and legislative drafters. In fact, the foreign attorneys play a significant role in developing the collection, selecting the most relevant texts and serials for the jurisdictions they cover. By 1960 the pattern of a Reading Room providing reference service in United States federal and state law and a foreign legal research and reference wing staffed by specialists with expertise in the laws of particular foreign countries was set. Move to Madison Building In 1981, the library's collections were moved across Independence Avenue to the sub-basement of the recently constructed James Madison Memorial Building. Moving the library's 1.6 million volumes took four months, and a new reading room opened in April 1981 on the second floor of the Madison building. The new stacks occupied 81,000 square feet, totaling 59.5 linear miles of mobile shelving. By 2002, the Madison building stacks were full, and additional materials were sent to the Library of Congress' High Density Storage Facility in Fort Meade, Maryland. Institutional differentiation After about 1900, as the volume of acquisitions and the percentage of foreign language materials both increased and the workload of the Supreme Court also increased, the Justices played a diminishing role in the selection of books for the Law Library. The move of the Supreme Court to its own building in 1935, and the establishment of a separate Supreme Court Library of American and British law brought the close institutional relations between the Law Library and the Court to an end. The Law Library continues to support the Supreme Court's needs for information on foreign and international law. Congress established the Legislative Reference Service (the organizational ancestor of the present Congressional Research Service) in 1914, but for its first decade the LRS was headed by the Law Librarian and much of its work consisted of legal indexing, for both American and foreign law, and responses to Congressional requests about American, International and foreign law. By the late 1920s the division of labor that endures to the present was established. The RS (later CRS) contains an American Law Section (now Division) working exclusively for Congress and depending on the collection maintained by the Law Library. The Law Library operates the Reading Room, provides reference service in U.S. law to Congress on a priority basis, and is responsible for all reference and research service in foreign, comparative and international law. Indexing foreign law Indexes and other finding aids are indispensable tools for legal research, but the laws of many countries are not well-indexed or available in authoritative or up-to-date codes or collections. The first major project of the Law Library was the 1907–1910 preparation of an index to United States federal statutes, an endeavor funded by a special Congressional appropriation. In 1902 the Librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, proposed a comprehensive index to current legislation from all the countries of the world. He noted that \\"If accompanied by a reference to preceding statutes or by brief abstracts ... it may become an instrument of the highest value not merely to the theoretic investigator, but to the practical legislator\\". Although there were far fewer sovereign countries in 1902 than today, Congress's practical legislators refused to fund so ambitious a project. The idea did not die though, and various guides to the legislation of foreign countries were produced as funding permitted. Legislative indexing was a major activity of the Legislative Reference Service during its first ten years (1916–1924), and the staff of the Law library began keeping a card index to Latin American laws in the late 1920s. This was eventually published as the Index to Latin American Legislation in a two volume set in 1961, with two supplements - in 1973 and 1978 - covering the years from 1961 through 1975. The indexing of Latin American legislation continued, being adapted to existing information- processing technology as it developed from the 1970s through the 1990s. By the 1990s, indexes and guides to the laws of many developed nations had become available, often on a commercial basis, as electronic files accessible through the Internet. Although not usually available to the general public, the Law Library's legal specialists used these for their research. But, control of a rapidly expanding body of legal information from a growing number of jurisdictions remained a major challenge to legal researchers. One institutional solution arrived at was an international, cooperative network that makes indexes, abstracts and the complete text of new laws available over the Internet. This is the Global Legal Information Network (GLIN), which is coordinated by the Law Library of Congress. The Library's foreign law efforts are via its Directorate of Legal Research, which has a staff of foreign–trained lawyers from around the world along with research specialists. Notable reports issued In August 2009, the Law Library of Congress issued a controversial and disputed legal opinion report titled Honduras: Constitutional Law Issues. The report was originally commissioned by Congressman Aaron Schock (R., Ill.), prepared by Senior Foreign Law Specialist Norma Gutiérrez, and published by the Law Library of Congress. It features a legal analysis of the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis with a specific examination of the legality of President Manuel Zelaya's 28 June 2009 removal from office and expatriation.

It was initially assigned to the 4th Indian Armoured Brigade (which later became 254th Indian Armoured Brigade and, still later, the 254th Indian Tank Brigade). In 1943, it was reassigned to the Indian XV Corps and transported in great secrecy to Arakan prior to taking part in the Battle of the Admin Box, in which its M3 Lee tanks proved decisive. It spent the remainder of the war in India and Burma. It was part of the 50th Indian Tank Brigade and based in Madras and Bangalore prior to being disbanded in 1947.

In 1977 Gromov became commander of a squadron of surface ships in the Baltic Fleet and was transferred to the Soviet Northern Fleet in 1982. In 1984 he became deputy commander of the Soviet Northern Fleet and was promoted to its commander in 1988. In 1992 Gromov was given command of the Russian Navy following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet by Boris Yeltsin in 1996 and retired in 1997 at age 60, the mandated retirement age for Admirals and Fleet Admirals. The Jamestown Foundation speculated that Gromov was dismissed because of a Russian Pacific Fleet ammunition explosion which seems to have attracted wide attention.

It was first formulated by William Molyneux, and notably referred to in John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689). The problem can be stated in brief, \\"if a man born blind can feel the differences between shapes such as spheres and cubes, could he, if given the ability to see, distinguish those objects by sight alone, in reference to the tactile schemata he already possessed?\\" Original correspondence The question was originally posed to Locke by philosopher William Molyneux, whose wife was blind: To which John Locke responds in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (emphasis added):John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, book 2, chapter 9 Responses In 1709, in An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision, George Berkeley also concluded that there was no necessary connection between a tactile world and a sight world—that a connection between them could be established only on the basis of experience. He speculated: In 1749, Denis Diderot wrote Letter on the blind for the benefit of those who see as a criticism of our knowledge of ultimate reality. A similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), in his philosophical novel, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with colors rather than shapesMuhammad ibn Abd al-Malik Ibn Tufayl and Léon Gauthier (1981), Risalat Hayy ibn Yaqzan, p. 5, Editions de la Méditerranée: Diana Lobel (2006), A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Baḥya Ibn Paqūda's Duties of the Heart, p. 24, University of Pennsylvania Press, .: Regarding Molyneux's problem, the authors Asif A. Ghazanfar & Hjalmar K. Turesson (2008) have recently noted: One reason that Molyneux's Problem could be posed in the first place is the extreme dearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness. Alberto Valvo estimated that fewer than twenty cases have been known in the last 1000 years.Valvo, A. (1971). Sight restoration after long-term blindness: The problems and behavior patterns of visual rehabilitation. New York: American Foundation for the Blind. Ostrovsky, et al.,Ostrovsky, et al., \\"Vision following extended congenital blindness\\", Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Technology studied a woman who gained sight at the age of 12 when she underwent surgery for dense bilateral congenital cataracts. They report that the subject could recognize family members by sight six months after surgery, but took up to a year to recognize most household objects purely by sight. In 2003, Pawan Sinha, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, set up a program in the framework of the Project Prakash and eventually had the opportunity to find five individuals who satisfied the requirements for an experiment aimed at answering Molyneux's question experimentally. Prior to treatment, the subjects (aged 8 to 17) were only able to discriminate between light and dark, with two of them also being able to determine the direction of a bright light. The surgical treatments took place between 2007 and 2010, and quickly brought the relevant subject from total congenital blindness to fully seeing. A carefully designed test was submitted to each subject within the next 48 hours. Based on its result, the experimenters concluded that the answer to Molyneux's problem is, in short, \\"no\\". Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually almost as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between an object perceived using the two different senses. The correlation was barely better than if the subjects had guessed. They had no innate ability to transfer their tactile shape knowledge to the visual domain. However, the experimenters could test three of the five subjects on later dates (5 days, 7 days, and 5 months after, respectively) and found that the performance in the touch-to-vision case improved significantly, reaching 80–90%.

Geography Agios Nikolaos Vourvourou beach in Sithonia. The village Agios Nikolaos itself is 2 km inland from the Singitic Gulf. However, its territory is quite extensive. To the north-east it borders the village of Pyrgadikia at Salonikiou Beach (8 km from Agios Nikolaos). To the north it borders the village of Metangitsi. In the west and south-west it is neighboring the village of Nikiti (9 km from Agios Nikolaos). To the south it borders the village of Sarti at Armenistis Beach (28 km from Agios Nikolaos). Landscapes Agios Nikolaos' landscapes show a substantial variability. In the plains east and south-east of the village agriculture predominates with olive trees as the main cultivated plant. Toward the south, rises the Itamos mountain range of Sithonia and is completely covered with pine forest. Towards its northeastern extension (Salonikiou Beach) significant parts of the village territory are covered with forests. In all parts of the village territory plains or smooth hill segments are devoted to agriculture. On the beaches there are hotels and pensions as well as individual homes that have been built since the 1980s. The highest point within Agios Nikolaos territory is mount Karvounas (height approx. 550 m) in the south-west (Vourvourvou). Settlements A couple of coastal settlements belong to Agios Nikolaos, these are: * Vourvourou – located 10 km south-east. Vourvourou is a village near Agios Nikolaos, in the Chalkidiki peninsula of northern Greece. It is best known as a holiday destination. Close to Vourvourou are the beaches of Karidi and Fteroti. Diasporos island is very close to Vourvourou. * Salonikiou Beach – located 8 km north-east. Salonikiou is the area around the beach of Salonikiou on the northeast coast of Sithonia, between Ormos Panagias and Pyrgadikia. The closest village is Metangitsi (4 km inland). Most of the buildings in the region are private villas but there are some studios and apartments to rent. The beach is more than 1 km long. * Ormos Panagias – located 4 km east/south-east, serves as the village port. Ormos Panagias is an important port for Sithonia, Halkidiki. Considered as being a part of Agios Nikolaos, the port of Ormos Panagias is located just a few kilometres to the south. The amount of accommodation and restaurants that have been built around this harbour has made it grow into somewhat of a village on its own, built around an existing old church. Even though it is not officially recognized as a village, Ormos Panagias is considered a Halkidiki resort in its own right that attracts many people. Tourist boat tours of Mount Athos and it's monasteries leave from this port. Population Traditional kafeneion in Agios Nikolaos. Agios Nikolaos has 1,714 inhabitants (based on the core village of Agios Nikolaos). Including the settlements of Vourvourou, Salonikiou Beach, and Ormos Panagias, the population is 2,141 (2011 census). Almost all inhabitants are indigenous Greeks. After the rise of tourism, some non-Greeks have settled permanently in Agios Nikolaos, for example, Germans, Dutch, and Austrians. During the summer holiday period, the population may rise to 10,000. Economy Traditionally, inhabitants of Agios Nikolaos had two economic mainstays: agriculture and fishery. Agriculture was mostly devoted to olive trees (and olive oil production), wheat, and winery. Fishery was limited to the waters of the Singitic Gulf. Since the 1980s, tourism replaced fishery and agriculture as economic mainstay. Inhabitants have built own hotels, homes, and pensions or sold-off their agricultural land for real estate purposes. Concomitantly, living standards have risen significantly. History Ruins of a watchtower (possibly of Byzantine origin) at Pirgos beach, Agios Nikolaos. The ancient Greek city of Singos, which gave its name to the Singitic Gulf, was located within Agios Nikolaos' territory and dates back to 454 BCE. It was probably near the Vourvourou bay on Livari peninsula, where an ancient wall of large stones is still visible (Mega Teichos). Individual reports even mention remains of an ancient port at the very same location. No excavation was performed to confirm position and location of ancient Singos and significant remains of buildings are not evident. The village's history dates back to the 14th century when inhabitants moved inland from the sea because of repeated attacks by pirates. A likely position of a previous settlement can be found 2 km away on the coast at Pyrgos Beach, where remains of a watchtower presumably of Byzantine Greek origin can be found. Agios Nikolaos fell under Ottoman Turkish rule from the 15th century until liberation in the Balkan Wars of 1912. The town suffered further in the 1940s during World War Two and fighting in the Greek Civil War. After the 1950s, peaceful times returned and the Agios Nikolaos area saw a tourism boom from the 1980s onwards which increased prosperity in the region. Many villagers built summer homes in the coastal areas of Ormos Panagias and Vourvourou. Infrastructure=Public facilities Agios Nikolaos has following public facilities: * police station * health center (equal to a very small hospital) * pharmacies * post office * ATM * radio station * volunteer firefighters station Agios Nikolaos does not have a bank. The nearest bank is located in Nikiti (9 km away). Transportation Agios Nikolaos lies adjacent to the road leading from Nikiti to Sarti (Sithonia west ring) and from Nikiti to Pyrgadikia (semicircular road around Singitikos bay leading east). All roads are covered with concrete or asphalt. There is no link to a railroad. (Chalkidiki has no railroad at all). Ormos Panagias serves as port of Agios Nikolaos. Daily cruises to Mount Athos' west coast take off from that port. It serves also as home port of the village's fishery boats. Air traffic is managed by the international airport of Thessaloniki. Bus traffic is the mainstay of public transport in Agios Nikolaos, as in Chalkidiki as a whole. Daily connections to Thessaloniki, Sarti, Polygyros, and Nea Moudania exist. In the summer, at least 3 buses a day do provide transportation, whereas in the winter bus frequency is lower. Architecture Agios Nikolaos is primarily a traditionally built village with characteristic Macedonian architecture. However, a lot of traditional homes and houses have been replaced with modern ones. This is partially due to a higher standard of living as well as to stricter building standard because of earthquake concerns. Sightseeing Pirgos Beach, Agios Nikolaos. Ancient remains worth sightseeing in a strict sense are not existent. However, one may want to take a look at: *Byzantine watch tower at Pyrgos Beach (only ruins visible) *Ancient Mega Teichos at Vourvourou (Livari) *The village of Agios Nikolaos has traditional architecturethumb Agios Nikolaos is full of noteworthy beaches, as there are: * Salonikiou Beach * Pyrgos Beach * Livrochio Beach * Latoura Beach * Lagonisi Beach * Livari Beach * Vourvourou Beach * Karidi Beach * Zografou Beach * Galana Nera, a beach located between Diaporos and Agios Isidoros. Beside the beaches, the bay of Vourvourou has approx. 9 islands giving it a lagoon appearance. * Diaporos Island, largest island, partially inhabited * Agios Isidoros, the most eastern island All islands and islands' beaches can only be reached by boat.

Plot Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, and Scrappy-Doo are on their way to Miss Grimwood's Finishing School for Girls, where they have been hired as gym teachers. Once there however, they find that it is actually a school for girl ghouls. The pupils include Sibella, the daughter of Count Dracula; Elsa Frankenteen, the daughter of Frankenstein's monster; Winnie, daughter of the Wolfman; Phantasma (usually called Phanty for short), the ghostly daughter of a phantom; and Tanis, the daughter of the Mummy – all parodies/tributes to the Universal Monsters of the 1930s–40s. Other residents of the school are a floating white hand; an octopus who is the school's butler; Legs, a spider that helps with the upcoming volleyball match; Miss Grimwood, the headmistress; and her diminutive pet dragon Matches. Frightened by this, Shaggy and Scooby are initially hesitant, but eventually they agree to stay as gym teachers. The following morning begins with the class and the new teachers taking ballet lessons. Gym class soon starts, to train the girls for their upcoming volleyball match against the boys of the neighboring Calloway Military Academy. The boys rig the volleyball with a remote control, but because of an accidental squirt of ketchup, the boys lose the remote, Scooby accidentally swallows the remote and it allows the girls to win instead. The girls' fathers come for Open House on Halloween night. As they leave due to various reasons, they warn a fearful Shaggy and Scooby not to let any harm come to their daughters or they'll be in big trouble. The power- hungry witch, Revolta, the self-styled Witch of the Web, and her minion the Grim Creeper plan to kidnap the girls and make them her slaves. She starts by hypnotizing Shaggy into taking the girls on a field trip to the Barren Bog. That same day, the Calloway Cadets are at the bog. With the help of Revolta's spider bats, Revolta and the Grim Creeper capture the girls and Revolta makes a potion that will turn them evil forever at the stroke of midnight. Scooby, Scrappy, Shaggy and Matches, along with the Calloway cadets, manage to save the girls and Revolta's plan is foiled. Despite being well liked by all their students, Shaggy and Scooby run away in terror when new monsters such as an alien, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Godzilla Kaiju enroll their own daughters at the school for the following year. As they leave, they see the girls and Matches wave them goodbye. Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy then give them a last werewolf howl before driving off into the night. Characters=Grimwood residents A group of girls who are the offspring of famous horror monsters, who unlike them are not wholly villainous. * Miss Grimwood - The middle-aged headmistress of the school. She wears a red cape over a pink dress, a red headband, red shoes, and has short black hair. She has a pet dragon named Matches. * Matches - A small, light-green dragon who serves as Miss Grimwoods's pet guard dog. He often gets duties like heating food in the kitchen or warming up items with his fire breath in which his body will turn a dark red color. However, he is not able to breathe fire when his body is wet. Matches often shows a bad temper. At first, he shows a strong dislike towards Scooby—a recurring gag throughout the film is that Scooby would make Matches angry and get his tail set on fire as punishment. Matches later warms up to Scooby after the dog saves him from the Grim Creeper and helps rescue the girls from Revolta. * Sibella - Count Dracula's daughter. She has green eyes, light purple skin, purple hair, red shoes, and a dark purple dress with a red belt. Sibella can turn into a bat at will, which she uses for a variety of different reasons such as rescuing or looking for people, or for simple things such as delivering a pizza. Unlike traditional vampires like her father, she is immune to sunlight and can go out during the day. She is also shown to be the most strongly willed of the five Grimwood girls—she is the last to undergo Revolta's hypnosis spell and tries to fight back. She often uses phrases with vampire-related puns such as \\"fangtastic\\" and \\"You bat\\" (you bet). She is talented at making bat-robes (bathrobes) and dragon fire-proof robes as seen when she gives her father and Matches each one. * Elsa Frankenteen - The daughter of Frankenstein's monster. Elsa has platform-like brown sandals and a green dress with a light green T-shirt underneath. She can endure electric shocks and her black hair is standing up above her head thus resembling the Bride of Frankenstein. She presents her father with a portable shockman that has a rechargeable battery-pack that lasts for weeks, showing that her father can also endure electric shocks. She is the tallest and the strongest of the girls. She has a deeper voice which is more masculine-sounding than the other four girl ghouls. * Winnie - The daughter of the Wolfman. Quite often Winnie howls before making a statement and unlike common stereotypical werewolves like her father, she does not turn back into a human during daylight hours. She wears a blue dress and a light blue bow-tie, and has light brown fur, yellow eyes and orange, curly hair. Winnie makes a juicer as her father's Halloween gift, which makes bitter lemonade, something her father enjoys. Out of the rest of the girls, she is the most talkative and can also be very loud and somewhat competitive. * Phantasma - The Phantom's ghostly daughter. Everyone calls her \\"Phanty\\" for short. With a shrill, high laugh, she has short white hair with a blue streak and pale blue skin. She wears a blue dress and white boots. Being intangible, she can float through walls and doors. She has a good sense of humor and is musically gifted, also displaying a great love and appreciation for music. Phanty's gift to her father is her latest composition which was called \\"Duet For Three Hands and Six Tentacles\\". * Tanis - The Mummy's daughter, Tanis is the smallest and youngest of the girls. She has big, blue eyes and a bandage ponytail embellished with a dark pink bow. She usually gets tangled in her bandages and the others have to untangle her and re-wrap her. She calls her daddy \\"Mummy Daddy.\\" Tanis has an Egyptian trophy case in which to store trophies, but she often gets worried when it looks like they are going to lose a game. Tanis gave her father a fright-light to brighten the darkest mummy case for a present. She is a shy sweetheart, and is the most nervous out of the group of girls. Even Scooby warms up to her immediately, mostly because of her innocence. She often sucks on her thumb to show her innocence. In the final scene of the film, the daughters of an alien, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Godzilla come to attend but Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy drive off before meeting them. Calloway cadets A group of boys of Colonel Calloway's Military School, located next to Grimwood. They often use the terms \\"affirmative\\" or \\"negative\\" when agreeing or disagreeing with particular happenings. * Colonel Calloway - The head of Calloway Military School. Fair yet very stern, Calloway seems to have a reciprocated attraction to Miss Grimwood. * Tug Roper - The leader of the cadets. He often tries to maintain his dignity and even resorts to cheating during the volleyball game against the Grimwood Girls, but he and his team still lose. He does what he can to impress the colonel, but often disappoints him with his clumsiness. * Miguel - The inventor of the group, most of the time his inventions are messed up by the others. * Jamal Williams - The tallest and most skilled of the cadets, despite not being the leader, Col. Calloway seems to admire him more than Roper; he always answers to every positive sentence with \\"affirmative\\". * Grunt - The largest member of the cadets; despite being overweight, he is very athletic and very strong. * Baxter - The smallest member of the group. He seems to be the most obedient of the cadets; following the colonel's every word and acknowledging him at almost every time. Villains * Revolta - The Witch of the Web. She plans to make the students at the ghoul school part of her evil squad permanently as part of her plans to take over the world. In addition, she claims that their parents have \\"gone soft.\\" Her main magic is mind control via spider bats who put web- like hypnosis headphones on the victim and Revolta issues commands through that headphone which hypnotizes the victims. She is also a good potions maker and can brew potions that make others evil permanently. * Grim Creeper - Revolta's assistant. He looks like a green, overgrown pumpkin with long vines for limbs and one eye in the middle of his head. He unsuccessfully tried to get the wand for Revolta when Matches came near him. * Mirror Monster - A monster who lives in one of Revolta's mirrors and can change into anyone that looks into it. In the movie, the monster traps Shaggy inside the mirror and replaces him. He chases after Scooby, who eventually fools him into thinking he is one of Revolta's slaves. In the end, Matches burns his backside, and he jumps back into the mirror, setting Shaggy free.

He served under the Jiajing, the Longqing, and the Wanli emperors for a total of 63 years and eventually rose to a high position in the court, overseeing the Directorate of Ceremonies (\\"Master of the Seal in charge of rituals ) which ranked first among the twelve eunuch directorates. By the time of this death, he had become the favorite eunuch of the Wanli emperor. Tian Yi was born in Shaanxi Province and was castrated at age 9. He entered the imperial court immediately afterwards. When he died in 1605, the Wanli Emperor ordered three days of mourning and the construction of a tomb with many features of an imperial mausoleum to commemorate him. Tomb Tian Yi's tomb () has a traditional layout in which a spirit way serves as a central axis and a division between a front portion used by visitors to pay their respects and a closed off back portion. Four eunuchs, who lived at the tomb as monks during the Qing dynasty are buried next to Tian Yi. The tomb is particularly rich in stone carvings. The masonry artworks include three gates (front gate, Lingxing gate, and the graveyard gate), sculptures that line the spirit way, steles, ceremonial vessels, and stone altars for sacrifices.

Numbering about 31,000, the Tampuan people live in the mountainous Southern and Western portions of the Cambodian province of Ratanakiri. They have their own language of the Mon–Khmer language family. Tampuans, along with the other Mon-Khmer groups of the mountains, are referred to as Khmer Loeu (\\"Upper Khmer\\") by the Khmer majority. In English, montagnards, a designation given to all hill tribes in the former French Indochina is often used. Though historically their language has been without a writing system, in the last ten years an NGO has overseen the creation of a writing system, based on the Cambodian alphabet. However, fewer than 80% of Tampuans are literate. Tampuan Children, from Ratanakiri, Cambodia Culture The Tampuan people are a mountain people, living in communal villages that range from 100 to 400 inhabitants. The villages are often laid out in a square, with a communal house (Tampuan: ), in the center. Today many Tampuan villages have a communal well, volleyball court, or rice mill in the center as well. In addition to a village home, most Tampuans have a second residence on their farm. Houses are built on three- to 6-foot-tall () stilts to catch cool breezes. The walls, floor, roof and doors are made of split woven bamboo. Normally, houses are rectangular in shape, averaging five meters by three meters. Today, many rich Tampuans build wooden houses with corrugated steel roofs, a mark of luxury. In some areas, Tampuans live in communal longhouses that can be up to in length. Family structure Tampuans have a matrilineal system of marriage, with the family name and inheritance passing through the mother’s side of the family. Normally, Tampuans marry between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. In accordance with tradition, the young couple lives with and serves the family of the bride for three years, and then moves to serve the grooms family for an additional three years. At this point, the young couple is considered to be of age, capable of starting their own farm. Bigamy is tolerated but not common. The average married Tampuan woman bears six to eight children in her lifetime, but due to high infant mortality rates and poor medical care, fewer than six usually survive to adulthood. Diet The Tampuan diet consists almost entirely of rice, supplemented by fish or stewed vegetables. Though Tampuans may raise chickens, pigs, dogs, cows, and water buffalo for food, the meat is rarely eaten apart from an animistic religious sacrifice. Tampuans also use crossbows or guns to hunt wild boars, pheasants, deer and small rodents. Bugs and ants are often consumed as snacks. Tampuans hold a number of foods to be taboo, according to the clan into which one is born. Agriculture Nearly all Tampuans are subsistence farmers, practicing a form of rotational slash and burn agriculture. The land surrounding the village is communally owned, with each village member planting on his designated section. When the nutrients on a particular plot of land are depleted, usually after two or three years, a new plot is cleared, burned, and prepared for planting. The previous plot is left to lie fallow for a period of years. The vast majority of Tampuans plant dry-land rice. Religion Tampuans are animists, believing that spirits inhabit all things. Spirits, and especially evil spirits, must be appeased through animal sacrifices. Violating the evil spirit’s commands causes sickness. Mediums and sorcerers are common, and are paid to speak the will of the spirits. Arts The Tampuans are a very musical people. They learn from a young age to play fiddles, stringed banjos, drums, flutes, and gongs. Gongs are their most important instruments. The gongs are made of hammered bronze, and consist of a set of five for rhythm and another set of eight for the melody. Playing gongs is a communal affair; thirteen men play gongs and two play percussion. Often the gongs are accompanied by dancing. Traditionally, men play instruments and women sing.

Usque was born in Portugal to a Jewish family and fled the Portuguese Inquisition for Ferrara, Italy, around 1543. In Ferrara, Usque worked with Yom-Tob ben Levi Athias (the Marrano Jerónimo de Vargas), a Spanish typographer. Drawing on various earlier translations, Usque produced a new translation of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) into Spanish. It was entitled \\"Biblia en Lengua Española Traducida Palabra por Palabra de la Verdad Hebrayca por Muy Excelentes Letrados, Vista y Examinada por el Oficio de la Inquisicion. Con Privilegio del Ylustrissimo Señor Duque de Ferrara.\\" Usque intended the book for sale both to the Sephardic diaspora and to Christian Spaniards. For this purpose, he submitted a copy to the Inquisition, hoping to receive an imprimatur, and printed some books with a dedication to the Duke of Ferrara. Copies intended for sale to Jews were dedicated to Dona Gracia Nasi. It was published in folio at Ferrara in 1553 and known as the Ferrara Bible. This edition has become scarce, but a second was published in Holland in 1630. In this translation, the Hebrew text is rendered verbatim. Other books published by Usque included the Portuguese classic Menina e Moça by Bernardim Ribeiro, and Consolação às Tribulações de Israel by Samuel Usque, whose kinship with Abraham has not yet been clarified.

He was known for being one of the most prominent vallenato music composers and troubadours of the genre and for being the co- founder of the Vallenato Legend Festival, along with Consuelo Araújo and Alfonso López Michelsen. He was also a long-time friend of Gabriel García Márquez, who included him in his stories and once told him that his own masterpiece novel, 100 years of solitude, was just a 350-page Vallenato. Escalona's songs compile the history and stories of the Magdalena Department of the past 20th century. Escalona was an atypical music composer: he does not play any instruments or sing so his songs can in some ways be difficult to analyze. His songs constitute a legacy of a past generation of Colombians in his memory, a pictorial collage, full of grace, that narrates stories, customs and gossips from his region. He also left a legacy of his loves and pains, humour and poetry. In 1991 Caracol TV produced a television series named Escalona, after him. Early life He was born on May 26, 1926 to Colonel Clemente Escalona Labarces, veteran of Thousand Days War and Margarita Martinez Celedon in Patillal. Because Patillal was a village in a rural area surrounded by farms, it was relatively small and there wasn't that much to do after school, other than play with other kids and make up games; build miniature farms or build kites and fly them all day. He had a very happy childhood, and dreamed of becoming a painter or cartoonist, usually drawing funny depictions of classmates and teachers. But his all time friend and classmate, Jaime Molina was better at drawing than him, something that drove him instead, to read poetry and songs. He grew up listening to peasants and troubadours of the region that often passed by the village bringing news from Valledupar and other regions, since there was no post office or other source of news that arrived at this isolated place. Youth, the High School Dropout He moved to Valledupar to attend high school at The Loperena National High School where he composed his first song at the age of fifteen in 1943 called \\"El profe Castañeda\\". He wrote the song in honor and sadness of his favourite teacher being transferred to a school in Riohacha, his natural reaction was to dedicate a song to \\"el viejo Pedro\\" as he called him, since he grew up listening to local troubadours. His classmates, who were also saddened over the teacher's departure, embraced his song. From then on, he saw himself doing something that he was good at, and started writing songs whenever a situation merged; started composing about his love experiences, about the people that interacted with him or were known in the region and these people's stories of happenings, basically compilations of his everyday experiences and thoughts. In 1945, feeling bored and short of motivation for school, Escalona was transferred to a school in Barranquilla for a short period and then to the Celedon Lyceum High School in Santa Marta, where he composed \\"El Hambre del Liceo\\" (the lyceum Hunger), complaining about the poor food quality that the school offered. Tired of school he dropped out and went back to Valledupar. The Farmer In Valledupar he devoted his time to working at his parents’ farm and learning about agriculture. He started planting rice. Apparently he also tried to break into the illegal coffee trade by bringing contraband from Aruba with a friend named \\"Pipe\\" Socarras. He became a partygoing \\"parrandero\\" and a heavy drinker of whiskey and rum. He also started courting many women at once. On April 14, 1951 he finally married Marina Arzuaga Mejía, also known as \\"La Maye\\", who would give him six of his presently suspected thirty-six children. (After many years, he would divorce her). An approach to Politicians By the 1950s he had become a renowned composer and usually befriended with local political leaders in \\"parrandas\\". He always departed with people from Patillal including Hernando Molina, husband of Consuelo Araújo. By the 1960s, when former President of Colombia Alfonso López Michelsen became governor of the newly created Department of Cesar, Lopez was invited to live in Hernando Molina's house. In this \\"vallenato parrandas\\" or parties, Escalona, Consuelo Araújo and Lopez decided to create a Vallenato Festival. López also invited them in many occasions to Bogotá, where he organized vallenato parrandas and introduced them to Colombia's political leaders. In 1968 the first Vallenato Legend Festival took place. Death He died on the afternoon May 13, 2009 in Bogotá, Colombia due to heart failure. He had been interned for almost two weeks in the Santa Fe Clinic in Bogotá and had been on a medical ventilator and unconscious earlier that day. Before he died Escalona received a visit from the Colombian Ex-President Ernesto Samper Pizano.El Espectador, Se apagó la 'voz' de Escalona, 13 de mayo de 2009 The President Alvaro Uribe Velez honored with his presence the ceremony at the Palace of Congress in the memory of the composer.

The association provides certifications in industries such as basic electronics, fiber optics and data cabling, renewable energy, information technology, photonics and precision optics, customer service, biomedical, avionics, wireless communications, radar, and smart home. ETA is also one of the 13 COLEMs (Commercial Operator License Examination Manager) for U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) testing. ETA works with technicians, educators, and military personnel. ETA also partners with companies such as Motorola Solutions to provide certification to their employees. History In 1965 the U.S. Labor Department, Bureau of Apprenticeship & Training (BAT) instigated a jobs program in cooperation with NEA (National Electronics Association). Local school systems, local TV association members and USDL worked together on an 8,000 hour apprenticeship program aimed at solving the labor shortage problem while finding new vocations for those put out of work by modern technology. This new program would reward trainees, but would not cover experienced technicians. Because of this, the Certified Electronics Technician (CET) program was created. In 1970 a group of technicians decided to form an organization to promote the CET program and the electronics industry as a whole. This organization would be called the International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET). It became a subdivision of NEA. In the mid-1970s NEA and NATESA merged to form the National Electronic Service Dealers Association (NESDA) with ISCET remaining as a subdivision. Due to a power struggle within the organization, ETA was formed in 1978 by a group of former NESDA members and officers. Among those were Richard \\"Dick\\" Glass and Ron Crow, two of the original founders of the CET program and only administrators at that time. This made it easy to continue the CET program with the new organization. In 1993 ETA became a COLEM for the FCC Commercial Radio License program and offers professionals the chance to sit for seven different FCC commercial licenses at ETA test sites. From the 1980s to the present, ETA has continued to expand their certification offerings to fill knowledge and skills assessment gaps in technology. ETA works with many different educators, businesses, and trainers to create vendor-neutral accredited certifications. ETA certifications are used by many different sectors including secondary and post-secondary schools, training businesses, corporations, government agencies, and the U.S. military. Certifications ETA offers certifications in various knowledge areas, but does not offer courses or training in these areas. ETA does, however, offer endorsements of courses offered through educational institutions through their Course Approval program.

Early life Reichardt was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, to lutenist and Stadtmusiker Johann Reichardt (1720–1780). Johann Friedrich began his musical training, in violin, keyboard, and lute, as a child. He was a student of Timofey Belogradsky, who in turn was a student of Sylvius Leopold Weiss. When Reichardt was ten years old, his father took the choir in which he sang, the \\"Wunderknaben\\", on a concert tour in East Prussia. After being encouraged by Immanuel Kant, Reichardt later studied Jurisprudence and Philosophy in his hometown and in Leipzig from 1769 to 1771. In 1771, he escaped civil service by embarking on a Sturm-und-Drang tour as a virtuoso. He returned to Königsberg in 1774 and became the Kammersekretär (Chamber Secretary) in Ragnit. After Reichardt sent his opera Le feste galanti as a sample piece to Friedrich II, he was appointed to the position of the Royal Prussian Court Kapellmeister, a position previously held by Carl Heinrich Graun. Two years later he already withdrew from the job and married the singer, pianist and Lieder composer Juliane Benda, a daughter of Frantisek Benda. Of their progeny was one daughter, Louise Reichardt (11 April 1779, Berlin – 17 November 1826, Hamburg), who became a noted songwriter, and a son, Wilhelm (1777–1782). Later career On the return from his first trip to Italy in 1783, Reichardt stopped in Vienna, where he met Kaiser Joseph II and Christoph Willibald Gluck. Further musical trips to France and England did not produce anticipated success; he therefore returned reluctantly to Berlin. In 1786, he developed close friendships with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried Herder, Friedrich Schiller and Johann Georg Hamann. Further attempts to gain new ground in Paris failed, yet he had become zealous with revolutionary ideas. After the appearance of his Vertrauten Briefe (Intimate Letters) in 1792, he was released in 1794 without pay from his position as Court Kapellmeister for being sympathetic to the French Revolution. He lived first in Hamburg, where he released the journal Frankreich, but from 1794, he lived in Giebichenstein near Halle. In 1796, he was pardoned for his support of the revolution and appointed to the post of the director of the saline (salt mine) in Halle. From there, he often traveled to Berlin to lead the premieres of his compositions. Another trip to Paris in 1802 lessened his fascination for the French and French politics considerably: he became an opponent of Napoleon. Four years later, when his manor was plundered by French troops, he fled to Danzig where he was active as a patriot and freedom fighter. Napoleon's brother Jérôme, located in Kassel, allowed Reichardt to return and named him to Theater Director in 1807. This lasted only nine months. In November 1809, he traveled to Vienna looking for success. After experiencing the music of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, he became receptive to the Viennese Classic, although he was too late. However, he soon returned to Giebichenstein where he died alone, from a gastric illness. His stage works were quickly forgotten after his death but his strophic Lieder and Ballads im Volkston (in folk style) enjoyed considerable popularity throughout the 19th century, aided by the Wandervogel movement. Works Much of Reichardt's reputation as a composer rests on his Lieder that number about 1500, using texts by some 125 poets. Important among these are the settings of Goethe's texts, some of which were known to, and influenced, Schubert. He was also known by his Singspiele, a genre that he refined with Goethe's support. He also wrote 49 songs to Herder's texts. Aside from his music, his work as an essayist has maintained its value up to this day. The collection of poems Des Knaben Wunderhorn is, in the epilogue, dedicated to Reichardt. This was probably in the expectation that he would set the text to music. However, such a setting from Reichardt was never composed. Stage works See List of works for the stage by Johann Friedrich Reichardt.

It originates from the title of a speech by Mao Zedong, delivered on 8 September 1944. The slogan was very popular due to the strong Maoist influence on the New Left, considerably amongst the Red Guard Party, the Black Panther Party and the Yellow Brotherhood of West Los Angeles.  Origins  Mao Zedong wrote this speech to commemorate the death of a PLA soldier, Zhang Side, a participant in the Long March who died in the collapse of a kiln. In the speech, he quoted a phrase written by the famous Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian: \\"Though death befalls all men alike, it may be heavy as Mount Tai or light as a feather\\" (人固有一死，或轻于鸿毛，或重于泰山). Mao continued: \\"To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai, but to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters and oppressors is lighter than a feather. Comrade Zhang Side died for the people, and his death is indeed weightier than Mount Tai\\". The concept of \\"Serving the People\\", together with other slogans such as \\"Never benefit oneself, always benefit others\\" and \\"Tireless struggle\\" became core principles of the Communist Party of China.  Role during the Cultural Revolution  During the Cultural Revolution, the speech was widely read. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai was frequently seen wearing a pin emblazoned with the slogan \\"Serve the People\\" next to a portrait of Mao Zedong.  Roles in modern society = Ceremonial role  Although less often used in China today, the phrase still plays some important ceremonial roles. It is inscribed on the screen wall facing the front entrance of the Zhongnanhai compound, which houses the headquarters of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China. Since 1984, during inspections of troops in the People's Liberation Army, the following ceremonial exchange is carried out: :Inspecting official: \\"Greetings, Comrades!\\" ( tóng zhì men hǎo) :Troops: \\"Greetings, Leader [or Chairman]!\\" ( shǒu zhǎng [zhǔ xí] hǎo) :Inspecting official: \\"Comrades, you have worked hard.\\" ( tóng zhì men xīn kǔ le!) :Troops: \\"Serving the people!\\" ( wèi rén mín fú wù!)  Cultural role  In 2007, actress Cameron Diaz caused a minor controversy by carrying a bag with the \\"Serve the People\\" slogan in Chinese on a tour of Peru. Many Peruvians felt the bag to be a show of support for the Maoist movement Shining Path. Writer Yan Lianke wrote a satirical novel set during the Cultural Revolution titled Serve the People about an affair between the wife of a military officer and a peasant soldier.

Baumberg consists of an area of about 6 km², with about 13000 residents (2005).  History  Baumberg was first recorded in 1296 as \\"Boimberg\\", a village part of the Earldom of Berg. The tower of the Catholic Church St Dionysius was built in the 12th century. Until the 20th century Baumberg was a rural village, inhabited by mainly fishermen, (goat-)farmers and traditional craftsmen like basket-makers. At the end of the 19th century about 1000 people were living in Baumberg, at the end of World War II it were about 1,200 and 98 per cent of them were Catholics. In 1951 Baumberg became part of southern neighbouring Monheim. The federal social housing projects in the late 1960s boosted population from 5,000 residents in 1965 to 10,000 in 1969. In the eastern part of Baumberg a new quarter with block of flats and terraced houses, the so-called Austrian quarter, was created from the late 1970s t the 1990s.

It was known historically as Lincoln Square. From 1862 to 1865, it was the site of the largest hospital in Washington, DC: Lincoln Hospital. Location Situated one mile directly east of the United States Capitol, Lincoln Park is maintained by the National Park Service. The park is bounded by 11th Street NE and SE on the west, 13th Street NE and SE on the east, East Capitol Street NE on the North, and East Capitol Street SE on the south. It is four blocks northeast of Eastern Market, Washington, D.C. The eastern end of the park includes two separate, enclosed play areas for young children. The grassy perimeter and central turf area are popular with neighborhood dogs and their owners. History Pierre Charles L'Enfant included the park in his original 1791 plan for the District of Columbia, intending it for public use (see: L'Enfant Plan). Though it was originally planned as the point from which all distances in North America would be measured, it was not ultimately utilized for this purpose. Instead, the park was used as a dumping ground. During the Civil War, it became the site where Lincoln Hospital was built to take care of the wounded Union Army soldiers. While there were many others around the city, it was the largest in the area built by the Army. It included 20 pavilions arranged in a V formation. 25 tent wards provided beds for 2,575 wounded. Covered pathways connected the kitchen and dining rooms.NIH - Historic Medical Sites in the Washington, DC Area - Lincoln Hospital - The other buildings on site were: * the headquarters (marked by the flag) * the officers quarters * the quarters for the Sisters providing the nursing care * the barracks * a guard house * separate quarters for contraband * service facilities: a water tank, laundry, barber shop, carpenter shop, stables and a morgue (\\"Dead House\\"). Like many of the other hospitals in the area, Lincoln Hospital was visited by family members as well as well wishers. One such visitor was Vinnie Ream, a talented mezzo-soprano (who later gained fame as Lincoln's sculptor). She performed at the hospital in April 1864.Whitman Archive - https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00156.html It was also visited by Walt Whitman, who was visiting injured soldiers in the local hospitals. He mentions it in his writings: 2,012 beds were occupied as of December 17, 1864.Civil War Washington - Organization of the Hospitals in the Department of Washington - Table 6 - http://civilwardc.org/introductions/other/hospitals.php As with most hospitals in the area, with the end of the Civil War in 1865, it was taken down that year. In 1867, Congress authorized the grounds to be called Lincoln Square as a memorial to the former president; it was the first public site to bear his name. Statues The park features two important sculptures: * Thomas Ball's 1876 Freedman's Memorial to Abraham Lincoln (Emancipation Monument), one of the first memorials in Washington honoring Abraham Lincoln.

In the Falkland Islands, it is known as the Johnny rook, probably named after the Johnny penguin (gentoo penguin), one of its preys. Description The adults' plumage is almost black in colour, while the legs and lores are orange and the neck is flecked with grey. The first-year juveniles have an orange or light red down, which they lose after their first molt. Full adult plumage is acquired only in the fifth year. Distribution and habitat It breeds in several islands in Tierra del Fuego, but is more abundant in the Falklands. Though it was once considered common in the Falklands archipelago, it now only nests in the outlying islands where it breeds around penguin and albatross colonies. Behaviour=Feeding The striated caracara is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion, mainly dead seabirds and dead sheep, offal and food scraps. It occasionally takes insects and earthworms that it digs up with its claws. However it will also prey on weak or injured creatures, such as young seabirds. Its habit of attacking newborn lambs and weakened sheep has led it to be ruthlessly persecuted by sheep farmers. Often it is known to steal red objects such as clothing or handkerchiefs, possibly because red is the colour of meat. Like all falconiformes, it has excellent colour vision, which easily surpasses that of any known mammal.Understanding the Bird of Prey by Dr. Nick Fox Often it will also raid dustbins and move rocks to get food from underneath, thus proving themselves to be one of the most intelligent of the birds of prey. Breeding The nest is built on the ground or on a cliff ledge, where the female will lay up to 4 eggs. Their hatching is timed to coincide with the nesting season of seabirds, providing a constant food supply for the chicks. Once these have fledged, they gather into flocks and roam through the islands, often close to human settlements. Status and conservation The population in the Falklands is estimated at 500 breeding pairs. Juveniles and indeed, adults, are almost entirely fearless of humans and treat their approach with indifference. Over time, conflict with the sheep farmers has led to a great reduction in their numbers. This is now being corrected by the Falkland Islanders.

C. Williams High School football team to a 13–0 season, state championship, and national championship runner- up. That season was the basis for the 2000 film Remember the Titans, in which Boone was portrayed by Denzel Washington.  Early life and education  Boone attended Abraham Lincoln Elementary School, then the now-closed Booker T. Washington High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. While attending North Carolina Central University, Boone joined the Tau Psi chapter of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Boone graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Science degree.  Career  In 1958, Herman accepted his first teaching and coaching position at the Luther H. Foster High School in Blackstone, Virginia, where he coached football, basketball and baseball. His teams recorded twenty- six wins, six losses and three district championships. In 1961, Herman returned to his home state of North Carolina to continue his coaching and teaching career. He accepted the head coaching position at E.J. Hayes High School in Williamston, North Carolina. His football teams amassed a record of 99 wins and 8 losses in a nine-year period. His 1966 football team was recognized by Scholastic Coach's Magazine as \\"The Number One Football Team in America\\". In 1969, Herman resigned from his position, having been informed by the Williamston school board that the town of Williamston \\"was not ready for a black head coach\\". Boone was hired as an assistant coach at T. C. Williams High School in 1969. Having integrated schools in 1965, the city of Alexandria, Virginia, consolidated students from three high schools into T. C. Williams in 1971, and Boone was named the head coach of the combined team. Boone took the team on a preseason training trip to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where the team members got to know each other, and President Richard Nixon sent an aide, Dr. Brown, to see this integrated football team that was beginning to catch national attention. In December 1971, Nixon was quoted as saying of the Titans that \\"the team saved the city of Alexandria\\". Boone was fired from his coaching position in 1979, after allegations of player abuse and related complaints by three assistant coaches. He subsequently retired from coaching and appeared as a public speaker at functions regarding his time as coach.Public speaker: In 2016, he was awarded the Living Legends of Alexandria award given to notable citizens of Alexandria, Virginia. Personal life In retirement, Boone lived with his wife, Carol, in Alexandria, Virginia. They had three daughters, Sharron, Donna, and Monica, and three grandchildren, Mackenzie, Myles, and Lauren. Boone was a friend of Willie Jeffries, dating back to when the two were assistant coaches in North Carolina. Boone wrote a letter of recommendation in support of Jeffries' induction into the College Football Hall of Fame. In it, Boone wrote, \\"Without his leadership and example, there would not have been Remember the Titans or the advancement in race relations in sports that we have witnessed.\\" Boone died at his home in Alexandria on December 18, 2019, at the age of 84. He had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Portrayal in film The 2000 film Remember the Titans, in which Denzel Washington portrays Boone, is loosely based on the 1971 T. C. Williams High School football season. Trophy  The Herman Boone Trophy is awarded to the winning team of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, a game between high school All-American seniors.

It lies between the ocean and sharply rising mountainous heights that are buttressed by crags of grey Table Mountain Sandstone.Compton, J.S. (2004).The Rocks and Mountains of Cape Town. p. 24-26, 44-70. Double Storey Books, Cape Town. . A literal translation from the Dutch/Afrikaans name \\"Kalkbaai\\" is \\"Lime Bay\\". This derives from the vast deposits of mussel shells found there, which early settlers burned to make lime for construction. Lime kilns to roast mussel shells are still found along the west coast. The railway from the central business district of Cape Town to Simon's Town passes through Kalk Bay and in some places the line is only metres from the water's edge. The foundation stone for the harbour was laid in 1913. Several famous caves (with names such as 'Boomslang Cave' named after the snake, 'Ronan's Well', after the Walter Scott novel Saint Ronan's Well, and 'Free Drinks Saloon') are located in the mountains above the village. They are of importance to speleologists because they have formed in sandstone. Large cave systems are not often found in this type of chemically unreactive rock. Kalk Bay is also home to the tiny but locally famous surf spot named \\"Kalk Bay Reef\\". This is renowned for heavy barrels and the associated shallow reef. It is best surfed on a big south-easterly swell or a north west wind. In smaller swells low tide makes for better barrels. Southern right whales come here during whale watching seasons, and are often seen playing or resting very close to surfers or piers. Whale activity can often be seen from Boyes Drive, a road that connects the southern suburbs of Cape Town to Kalk Bay and suburbs further south on the Peninsula. In 2018 Forbes Magazine voted the neighborhood one of the \\"coolest in the world\\". Coat of arms Kalk Bay (including Muizenberg and St James) was a municipality from 1895 to 1913. The town council assumed a coat of arms, designed by Frank Newnes, in July 1901.Western Cape Archives : Kalk Bay Municipal Minutes (23 July 1901). The shield was divided horizontally. The upper half was divided vertically, depicting a fishing boat (partly obscured by a small shield) and eight fleurs de lis, while the lower half depicted a bunch of grapes. A small shield displaying an arum lily was placed in the centre.

Description Smaller and less expensive (US$595 $525 in 1984 ≈ $990 in 2005 (see Inflation Conversion Factors for Dollars ) MSRP) than the preceding model HP-75, the 71B had a single-line 22-character liquid crystal display, 64K system ROM and 17.5K user memory. It operated on four AAA batteries. Four plug-in ports permitted ROM- based programs or additional user memory to be added. Separate compartments could accommodate an optional magnetic card reader and an optional HP-IL interface (HP 82401A) that could be used to connect printers, storage and electronic test equipment. The 71B was the first handheld to implement the IEEE _854-1987 radix-independent floating-point standard. Programming features included a real-time clock, programmable timers and subroutine calls with parameter passing and recursion. It was also HP's first calculator based on the Saturn processor, later versions of which are found in the popular HP-48 series calculators and most more recent HP calculator models. Since the hand- pulled magnetic cards (HP-75 compatible) could only store two tracks of 650 bytes each, the card reader (installed under the logo plate above the numeric keyboard) was not a very popular option. Larger storage capacities could be accommodated through HP-IL peripherals such as the 82161A cassette drive or 9114A diskette drive that were also battery-powered and portable, if rather bulky compared to the 71B. Subsequently, memory expansion modules to fit the card reader compartment became available from third-party vendors. Other third-party options included a bar code wand and application ROMs to plug into one of the four memory ports. A HP-71 configuration with bar code wand and a custom application was widely used for data collection in the British Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). Unlike HP-75 or HP-41, the 71B could also act as a device in a HP-IL loop controlled by another device, allowing several of them in the same loop, communicating with each other (or an HP-75 or HP-41) or sharing peripherals. Using an HP 82402 Dual HP-IL controller, it was even possible to connect one 71B to two HP-IL loops simultaneously, possibly as a controller in one and as a device in another. The HP-71B could optionally be made compatible with the large volume of programs written for the HP-41 series of calculators via a plug-in ROM that emulated the HP-41 at about 5x the original speed. Internal Design Specification Another notable \\"feature\\" of the 71B was that HP sold to the public a series of documents (IDS: Internal Design Specification) containing the nearly complete internal engineering details of the unit. A series of four IDSes were published about the software contained in the 71B's ROM; this included the complete source code (in assembly language) for the entire contents of ROM, and extensive additional design documentation of the ROM software. Other IDSes were released covering the 71B's hardware, the Forth/Assembler add-in ROM, and the add-in HP-IL controller.

Solvated electrons occur widely, although it is difficult to observe them directly because their lifetimes are so short. The deep color of solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia arises from the presence of solvated electrons: blue when dilute and copper-colored when more concentrated (> 3 molar). Classically, discussions of solvated electrons focus on their solutions in ammonia, which are stable for days, but solvated electrons also occur in water and other solvents in fact, in any solvent that mediates outer-sphere electron transfer. The real hydration energy of the solvated electron can be estimated by using the hydration energy of a proton in water combined with kinetic data from pulse radiolysis experiments. The solvated electron forms an acid–base pair with atomic hydrogen. The solvated electron is responsible for a great deal of radiation chemistry. Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia giving deep blue solutions, which conduct electricity. The blue colour of the solution is due to ammoniated electrons, which absorb energy in the visible region of light. Alkali metals also dissolve in some small primary amines, such as methylamine and ethylamine and hexamethylphosphoramide, forming blue solutions. Solvated electron solutions of the alkaline earth metals magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium in ethylenediamine have been used to intercalate graphite with these metalsW. Xu and M. M. Lerner, \\"A New and Facile Route Using Electride Solutions To Intercalate Alkaline Earth Ions into Graphite\\", Chem. Mater. 2018, 30, 19, 6930–6935. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.8b03421.  Properties  Focusing on solutions in ammonia, liquid ammonia will dissolve all of the alkali metals and other electropositive metals such as Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu, and Yb (also Mg using an electrolytic process), giving characteristic blue solutions. Solutions obtained by dissolution of alt=Photos of two solutions in round- bottom flasks surrounded by dry ice; one solution is dark blue, the other golden. A lithium–ammonia solution at −60 °C is saturated at about 15 mol% metal (MPM). When the concentration is increased in this range electrical conductivity increases from 10−2 to 104 ohm−1cm−1 (larger than liquid mercury). At around 8 MPM, a \\"transition to the metallic state\\" (TMS) takes place (also called a \\"metal-to-nonmetal transition\\" (MNMT)). At 4 MPM a liquid-liquid phase separation takes place: the less dense gold-color phase becomes immiscible from a more dense blue phase. Above 8 MPM the solution is bronze/gold-colored. In the same concentration range the overall density decreases by 30%. Dilute solutions are paramagnetic and at around 0.5 MPM all electrons are paired up and the solution becomes diamagnetic. Several models exist to describe the spin-paired species: as an ion trimer; as an ion- triple—a cluster of two single-electron solvated-electron species in association with a cation; or as a cluster of two solvated electrons and two solvated cations. Solvated electrons produced by dissolution of reducing metals in ammonia and amines are the anions of salts called electrides. Such salts can be isolated by the addition of macrocyclic ligands such as crown ether and cryptands. These ligands bind strongly the cations and prevent their re-reduction by the electron. Its standard electrode potential value is -2.77 V.Baxendale, J. H. (1964), Radiation Res. Suppl., 114 and 139 Equivalent conductivity 177 Mho cm2 is similar to that of hydroxide ion. This value of equivalent conductivity corresponds to a diffusivity of 4,75*10−5 cm2s−1. Some thermodynamic properties of the solvated electron have been investigated by Joshua Jortner and Richard M. Noyes (1966) Alkaline aqueous solutions above pH = 9.6 regenerate the hydrated electron through the reaction of hydrated atomic hydrogen with hydroxide ion giving water beside hydrated electrons. Below pH = 9.6 the hydrated electron reacts with the hydronium ion giving atomic hydrogen, which in turn can react with the hydrated electron giving hydroxide ion and usual molecular hydrogen H2. The properties of solvated electron can be investigated using the rotating ring-disk electrode.  Reactivity and applications  The solvated electron reacts with oxygen to form a superoxide radical (O2.−). With nitrous oxide, solvated electrons react to form hydroxyl radicals (HO.). The solvated electrons can be scavenged from both aqueous and organic systems with nitrobenzene or sulfur hexafluoride. A common use of sodium dissolved in liquid ammonia is the Birch reduction. Other reactions where sodium is used as a reducing agent also are assumed to involve solvated electrons, e.g. the use of sodium in ethanol as in the Bouveault–Blanc reduction. Solvated electrons are involved in the reaction of sodium metal with water. Two solvated electrons combine to form molecular hydrogen and hydroxide ion. Solvated electrons are also involved in electrode processes.B. E. Conway, D. J. MacKinnon, J. Phys. Chem., 74, 3663, 1970  Diffusion  The diffusivity of the solvated electron in liquid ammonia can be determined using potential-step chronoamperometry.  In gas phase and upper atmosphere of Earth  Solvated electrons can be found even in the gas phase. This implies their possible existence in the upper atmosphere of Earth and involvement in nucleation and aerosol formation.F. Arnold, Nature 294, 732-733, (1981)  Past  The observation of the color of metal-electride solutions is generally attributed to Humphry Davy. In 1807–1809, he examined the addition of grains of potassium to gaseous ammonia (liquefaction of ammonia was invented in 1823). James Ballantyne Hannay and J. Hogarth repeated the experiments with sodium in 1879–1880. W. Weyl in 1844 and C. A. Seely in 1871 used liquid ammonia while Hamilton Cady in 1897 related the ionizing properties of ammonia to that of water. Charles A. Kraus measured the electrical conductance of metal ammonia solutions and in 1907 attributed it to the electrons liberated from the metal. In 1918, G. E. Gibson and W. L. Argo introduced the solvated electron concept. They noted based on absorption spectra that different metals and different solvents (methylamine, ethylamine) produce the same blue color, attributed to a common species, the solvated electron. In the 1970s, solid salts containing electrons as the anion were characterized.  References  Further reading     The electrochemistry of the solvated electron.

Use Convergence in this topology is a crucial ingredient of hyperbolic Dehn surgery, a fundamental tool in the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Definition The following is a definition due to Troels Jorgensen: :A sequence {M_i} in H converges to M in H if there are :* a sequence of positive real numbers \\\\epsilon_i converging to 0, and :* a sequence of (1+\\\\epsilon_i)-bi-Lipschitz diffeomorphisms \\\\phi_i: M_{i, [\\\\epsilon_i, \\\\infty)} \\\\rightarrow M_{[\\\\epsilon_i, \\\\infty)}, :where the domains and ranges of the maps are the \\\\epsilon_i-thick parts of either the M_i's or M. Alternate definition There is an alternate definition due to Mikhail Gromov. Gromov's topology utilizes the Gromov-Hausdorff metric and is defined on pointed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One essentially considers better and better bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms on larger and larger balls. This results in the same notion of convergence as above as the thick part is always connected; thus, a large ball will eventually encompass all of the thick part. On framed manifolds As a further refinement, Gromov's metric can also be defined on framed hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This gives nothing new but this space can be explicitly identified with torsion-free Kleinian groups with the Chabauty topology.

His learned name plays on his family name of Bevilaqua (Drinkwater), and he was also known by the Italian name Lorenzo Astemio. A Neo-Latin writer of considerable talents at the time of the Humanist revival of letters, his first published works appeared in the 1470s and were distinguished by minute scholarship. During that decade he moved to Urbino and became ducal librarian, although he was to move between there and other parts of Italy thereafter as a teacher.“Lorenzo Astemio”, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 4 (1962) The work for which he is principally remembered now is Hecatomythium (1495), a collection of a hundred fables written in Latin and largely of his own invention. However, the inclusion together with this work of the thirty-three Aesopic fables translated from the Greek by Lorenzo Valla gave the impression that his own work was of the same kind. Several of the fables of Abstemius, it is true, relate to Aesop's in various ways, either as variations on his, as in the case of De culice cibum et hospitium ab appetente (94), which is told of a gnat and a bee but relates to The Ant and the Grasshopper; or in the case of De leone et mure (52) it provides a sequel to The Lion and the Mouse, in which the mouse asks for the lion's daughter as a reward for freeing him from the net and is stepped on accidentally by the bride. Still other fables, in the Aesopic manner, provide a frame for proverbs: for example 'Still waters run deep' (De rustico amnem transituro, 5) and 'The worse the wheel, the more it creaks' (De auriga et rota currus stridente, 84). But some quarter of Abstemius' stories belong to the genre of comic anecdotes associated with Poggio Bracciolini and known as Facetiae. One at least, De vidua virum petente (the widow seeking a husband, 31), borrows directly from the collection of Poggio.Tiphaine Rolland, «Le destin facétieux des fables, d’Abstemius à La Fontaine », in Itérances de la Fable, Le Fablier 2015, pp.57-8 A few of these sorts of fable particularly were condemned as ludicrous and licentiously critical of the clergyA citation of Desbillons' Fabulae Aesopiae is quoted online and the work was added to the Vatican index of forbidden books. Abstemius later wrote a further 97 fables in a less extreme vein, Hecatomythium Secundum, published in Fano in 1505.Sorbonne University The fables of Abstemius were frequently reprinted in their own right, as well as added to other collections of Aesopic material, during the 16th century. In particular they can be found annexed to an edition of Aesop's Fables, published in eight volumes at Frankfurt in 1580, and were later translated very idiomatically by Roger L'Estrange in his Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists (1692).Fables 255–351 Translated into French as Hécatomythium ou les fables de Laurent Abstemius traduit du latin (Orléans, 1572), they were the source for several in the later books of La Fontaine's Fables, including \\"The Vultures and the Pigeons” (VII.8), “Death and the Dying Man” (VIII.1) and “The Women and the Secret” (VIII.6).

The \\"Old Plaza Church\\" is to the left, the brick reservoir on the right, and in the center of the plaza, was the original terminus of the Zanja Madre. El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles (English: The town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels), shortened to Pueblo de los Ángeles, was the Spanish civilian pueblo settled in 1781, which by the 20th century became the American metropolis of Los Angeles. Official settlements in Alta California were of three types: presidio (military), mission (religious) and pueblo (civil). The Pueblo de los Ángeles was the second pueblo (town) created during the Spanish colonization of California (the first was San Jose, in 1777). —'The Town of the Queen of Angels'http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi03b.htm was founded twelve years after the first presidio and mission, the Presidio of San Diego and the Mission San Diego de Alcalá (1769). The original settlement consisted of forty-four people in eleven families, recruited mostly from Estado de Occidente. As new settlers arrived and soldiers retired to civilian life in Los Angeles, the town became the principal urban center of southern Alta California, whose social and economic life revolved around the raising of livestock on the expansive ranchos. Founding In 1542 Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, with a commission from Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza, was the first European to sail along and explore the California coast. Although he claimed all he saw as territory of the Spanish Empire, no efforts at colonization were made for over two hundred years. Concerned about colonizing efforts by the Russians and French, Spain set plans in motion in the 1760s to establish a presence and defend its claim to the territory. The Spanish settlement did not reach Alta California until 1769, when explorer Gaspar de Portolà reached the San Diego area via the first land route from Mexico. Accompanying him were two Franciscan Padres, Junípero Serra and Juan Crespí, who recorded the expedition. As they came through today's Elysian Park, they were awed by a river that flowed from the northwest, past their point and on southward. Crespí named the river El Río de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula, meaning, in Spanish, \\"the River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula\\".http://www.laalmanac.com/history/hi03a.htm . accessed 7/21/2010 The name derives from Santa Maria degli Angeli (Italian: \\"St. Mary of the Angels\\") which is the name of the small town in Italy housing the Porciuncula, the church where St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order, carried out his religious life. The river that was called the Porciuncula is today's Los Angeles River. Because the future town's name was a take on this \\"Queen of Heaven\\" Marian title, various versions of Crespí's formula would be used for the town, including the exceedingly long El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles sobre el Río Porciúncula.Historian Doyce B. Nunis, Jr., has traced the longer name to the histories written by the Franciscan missionaries, especially Francisco Palóu, who wished to play up the region's connections to their Roman Catholic religious order. Pool, Bob, \\"City of Angels' First Name Still Bedevils Historians.\\" Los Angeles Times (March 26, 2005), Sec. A-1. During the expedition, Father Crespí observed a location along the river that would be good for a settlement or mission. However, in 1771, Father Serra instead commissioned two missionaries to establish the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel-San Gabriel Mission near the present day Whittier Narrows section of the San Gabriel River. The missionaries encountered resistance from the Tongva to their attempts to resettle the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in San Gabriel. The first Spanish governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve had, as well, recommended to Viceroy Bucareli Father Crespí's location on the Río Porciúncula (Los Angeles River) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, King Charles III mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after San José de Guadalupe in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \\"Nueva California.\\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures. Settlement Governor de Neve took his assignment seriously and had a complete set of maps and plans drawn up by May 1780 for the layout and settlement of the new pueblo, including the placement of government houses, town houses, the church, the fields, the farms, and access to the river – the Instrucción and the Reglamento para el gobierno de la Provincia de Californias.Nunis, Doyce B., Jr. The Founding Documents of Los Angeles: A Bilingual Edition.

After failing to recruit the target number of families in Sonora, he had to go as far as Sinaloa to finally end up with 11 families, that is, 11 men, 11 women, and 22 children of various Spanish American castes: Criollo, Mulatto and Negro.The California Reglamento here was following Book 4, Title 5, Law X of the Recompilación de las Leyes de Indias and the 101st Ordinance of Philip II's Ordinances Concerning Discoveries. Monument commemorating origin of Pueblo de Los Angeles As local lore tells it, on September 4, 1781 the 44 pobladores gathered at San Gabriel Mission and, escorted by a military detachment and two priests from the Mission, set out for the site that Crespí had chosen. In reality, several of the families were probably already working on their plots of land as early as late July.The families arrived at San Gabriel Mission in two groups. The first in early June and the second in mid August. The second group had to be quarantined for a few days due to an outbreak of smallpox among it. The September 4 date seems to reflect the day the formal foundation documents were drawn up. Ríos-Bustamante, Mexican Los Ángeles, 50–53. Governor de Neve gave the new town the name El Pueblo de la Reina de los Ángeles-The Town of the Queen of the Angels. Per the Laws of the Indies and Reglamento the new towns in Alta California were to have four square leagues of land; that is a distance marked by one league in each cardinal direction from the town center.Guinn, J.

The streets, however, were laid out at forty-five degrees from the cardinal directions, a plan which is still preserved in Downtown Los Angeles.See Map Of The City Of Los Angeles Showing the Confirmed Limits… below in External_Links. The old town limits are still marked by Hoover and Indiana Streets in the west and east respectively. In 1784 an asistencia or sub-mission of the San Gabriel Mission was established on the central plaza, to provide religious services to the settlers. Government Old Plaza Church\\", circa 1890-1900. The pueblo came under the jurisdiction of the Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. As a pueblo, Los Angeles was granted a cabildo (town council). The first municipal officers, the regidores (council members) and alcalde (municipal magistrate), were appointed by Governor de Neve. Subsequent ones were elected annually by the settlers, the vecinos pobladores. Since the government of Las Californias had a strong military orientation in this early phase of colonization, the civilian cabildo was originally supervised by a commisionado (commissioner) appointed by the comandante (commander) of the Presidio of Santa Barbara, who was charged with making sure the alcalde and regidores carried out their duties correctly. The first commisionado was José Vicente Feliz, one of the soldiers who accompanied the original 44 settlers to the pueblo. The first recorded alcalde was José Vanegas, who served in 1786 and 1796. Vanegas was first listed as an Indian in the original 1781 padrón (register) but then as a Mestizo in the 1790 census.Unfortunately the records of the Spanish-era cabildo were lost and the relevant parts of the Provincial archives were burned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, so the surviving list of alcaldes is incomplete. Caughey, John and LaRee Caughey. Los Angeles: Biography of a City. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), 74–75. . The next few alcaldes reflected the mixed population of the small settlement: José Sinova, a Criollo, 1789; Mariano de la Luz Verdugo, a Criollo, 1790; and Juan Francisco Reyes, a Mulatto, 1793. Among the first regidores were Felipe Santiago García (a Criollo) and Manuel Camero (a Mulatto in the 1781 padrón, and a Mestizo in 1790 census). In judicial affairs, both military and civil cases were appealed to the Audiencia of Guadalajara.Bancroft, Hubert Howe. The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft. Vol. XVIII (The History of California, vol. 1, 1542–1800) (San Francisco: The History Company Publishers, 1886), 337 and 461–462. La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles On 18 August 1814 Father Luis Gíl y Taboada placed the cornerstone of a new Franciscan church amidst the ruins of the original asistencia. The completed structure was dedicated on 8 December 1822.Ruscin, p. 49. A replacement chapel, named La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles (The Church of Our Lady of the Angels) was rebuilt utilizing materials of the original church in 1861. The term Reina (queen) was added later to reconcile the church's name with that of the town.Ruscin, p. 50. The small chapel, also called \\"La Placita\\" and \\"the Plaza Church,\\" served the total Californio and immigrant Roman Catholic community as the only church in the vicinity of the City of Los Angeles until the 1876 construction of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana. Saint Vibiana Cathedral became the English- speaking parish and La Placita became the Spanish-speaking parish.Poole and Ball. El Pueblo: The Historic Heart of Los Angeles, 111. \\"The Plaza Church\\" still stands today, exhibiting Spanish Colonial and Carpenter Gothic architectural styles. The Los Angeles parish was under the Diocese of Sonora until 1840, when a new Diocese of the Two Californias was established to serve the Baja California Peninsula and Alta California. Both the dioceses of Sonora and the Two Californias were suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mexico. Mexican independence and era After Mexico's War of Independence (1810–1821) from Spain, life began to change in Los Angeles and Alta California . With the secularization of the missions, their land was distributed for the establishment of many more ranchos. The Native population was displaced or absorbed into the Hispanic population. Beginning about 1827, Los Angeles, now the largest pueblo of the territory, became a rival of Monterey for the honor of being the capital of California; was the seat of conspiracies to overthrow the Mexican authority; and the stronghold of the South California party in the bickering and struggles that lasted down to the American occupation. In about 1834, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. visited San Pedro Harbor as a sailor. His book, Two Years Before the Mast, includes a brief depiction of the pueblo and area, then dependent on the export of cattle hides and tallow. In 1835 it was made a city by the Mexican Congress, and declared the capital, but the last provision was not enforced and was soon recalled. In 1836–1838, it was the headquarters of Carlos Antonio Carrillo, a legally named but never de facto governor of California, whose jurisdiction was never recognized in the north; and, in 1845–1847, it was the actual capital. In 1842, a sheep rancher, pausing under an oak tree, discovered gold in Placerita Canyon in Rancho San Francisco, just north of the city sparking a minor gold rush. In subsequent decades local mining employed hard rock and placer techniques. Land however turned out to be the more \\"profitable gold\\", as ranching and development expanded as the town and region grew. Mexican–American War Manifest Destiny reached California at the time of the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). On June 18, 1846 a small group of Yankees raised the California Bear Flag and declared independence from Mexico in the Bear Flag Revolt in Northern California. United States troops then took control of the presidios at Monterey and San Francisco, and proclaimed the invading \\"conquest\\" complete. In Southern California, the Mexican citizens repelled American troops for five months, utilizing about 160 vaqueros, or cowboys, against about 700 American forces. Los Angeles initially surrendered to the surprise invasion by United States forces. The small Mexican forces of Los Angeles fled at the approach of US troops, and August 13, 1846 the American flag was raised over the city. A garrison of fifty US Marines under Archibald Gillespie was left in control. The city's population had been rent by factional quarrels when war broke out between Mexico and the United States, but the occupation caused both factions to unite against the invading Americans. Gillespie's garrison was compelled to withdraw in October when the residents, Californio Lancers, vaqueros on horseback without firearms, only lances, revolted and chased the US occupying force back to the San Pedro Harbor. Los Angeles was not retaken until Commodore Stockton again captured the city on January 10, 1847, after the battles at the Siege of Los Angeles, Battle of Dominguez Rancho, Battle of San Pasqual, Battle of Rio San Gabriel and the Battle of La Mesa. These battles, in which the Californios were greatly outmanned and outgunned, represented the important overt resistance to the establishment of the American regime in the Los Angeles Basin. Lieutenant-Colonel Frémont and Governor of Alta California Andrés Pico signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, an informal agreement to cease fighting in California at the Campo de Cahuenga in the San Fernando Valley in January 1847. Under the later comprehensive 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico formally ceded nearly half its nation's total territory, including Alta California, to the United States. Modern state park Historical monument marker A 1920s restoration drive led by Christine Sterling began a restoration of the historic area, starting with Olvera Street. Today the Pueblo's original outline is preserved by the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument. Among its saved and restored buildings is the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles City, the 1818 Avila Adobe built by Francisco Avila who owned Rancho Las Cienegas -\\"mid Wishire area\\" and a successful cattle enterprise.Note: The oldest house in Los Angeles County is the Henry Gage Mansion, built in 1795 on the Rancho San Antonio site, presently Bell Gardens. Across Olvera Street stands the 1887 Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda House, that now is the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District Visitors Center. The 1939 construction of the significant transit hub and architectural landmark, the Los Angeles Union Station east of the old Plaza, added to the Pueblo area's reinvigoration. Of archaeological interest is the discovery of sections of the original brick lined Zanja Madre-the Mother Ditch, which was a \\"surface and underground\\" gravity fed canal and aqueduct, that brought water from the Rio Porciuncula- Los Angeles River near the Arroyo Seco confluence, to the colonial pueblo and later the American city into the latter 19th century.

All ten on board were killed in the accident, which was the first fatal crash of a Northwest Airlines aircraft or a Lockheed Super Electra. Flight 2 was en route from Seattle, Washington to Chicago, Illinois, with intermediate stops at Spokane, Washington, Butte, Montana, and Billings, Montana. The flight had just left Butte and was flying over Belgrade, Montana when it diverted to the north to avoid a dust storm over Bozeman Pass. The first officer contacted the Northwest Airlines radio operatorAt the time, en route aircraft were not normally in contact with air traffic control due to a lack of transmitter facilities on the ground and the limitations of aircraft transmitters and receivers. at 3:05 PM Mountain Standard Time to advise that Flight 2 had reached the cruising altitude of 9,000 feet at 2:53 PM. Ground witnesses reported that as it passed over the Bridger Mountain range (which at the point the aircraft passed over reaches a height of approximately 8,500 feet MSL) the aircraft immediately dropped, went into a stall, glided for a short time, then spun into the ground. The wreckage burst into flames. All aboard died immediately. The Jan. 11, 1938 edition of \\"The New York Times\\" carried the story on the top of its front page and reported in part: \\"BOZEMAN, Mont., Jan. 10 — A Northwest Airlines transport plane crashed on a snow-covered peak high in the Bridger Mountains fourteen miles northeast of here late today, carrying to their deaths ten persons listed as being aboard. Sheriff Lovitt I. Westlake of Bozeman, who led a party on bobsleds to the crash scene, said he counted nine bodies. He said they were charred beyond recognition. Northwest Airlines officials reported eight passengers and a crew of two were aboard. The fuselage of the plane was burned into a twisted mass of steel. Sheriff Westlake said that the plane appeared to have plunged nose first into the mountainside in a small clearing. Two ranchers, cutting wood on the rugged mountain slope, said they saw the plane burst into flames as it hit the ground.\\" Investigators with the Civil Aeronautics Authority, a predecessor organization of both the FAA and the NTSB, determined that both vertical fins and both rudders were missing from the twin-tailed aircraft. They believed that the empennage had failed due to flutter. Weather reports from surrounding communities as well as the existence of the dust storm in Bozeman Pass led investigators to believe that the aircraft likely encountered severe to extreme turbulence which may have initiated the flutter.At the time, the existence of the phenomenon known as mountain waves was unknown. Within 24 hours of the accident, the United States Department of Commerce (the governing authority of the CAA) ordered that all Lockheed Super Electras be immediately grounded and that tests be performed to confirm that the figures obtained in the aircraft's original vibration tests were accurate. It was discovered that the machine used by Lockheed (and authorized by the Department of Commerce) to measure the natural vibration periods of the component parts of the aircraft had given Lockheed engineers misleading results. The Department ordered that the rudders of all Super Electras be modified so as to eliminate the possibility that flutter would cause an in-flight break-up. Northwest had been the first United States airline to take delivery of the Super Electra, but sold most of its remaining Electra fleet in 1939 after three subsequent accidents called the airworthiness and commercial potential of the aircraft into question. One Electra crashed in California while in the process of being delivered to the airline. The second, Flight 4, crashed in Billings, Montana after the pilot stalled the aircraft on takeoff. The third, Flight 1, crashed near Miles City, Montana after a design and manufacturing error allowed an intense fire to develop in the cockpit. Flight 2 was piloted by Nick Mamer, a well-known aviation pioneer in the Pacific Northwest. In 1939, a large Moderne clock tower was erected at Felts Field airport in Spokane, Washington as a memorial to the victims of the Flight 2 crash in Bozeman.

Such dispensers are common in North America and other western countries. They are either used to replace hand dryers or used in tandem to offer users alternatives to drying their hands. Some areas opt not to use them as towels create litter and are less environmentally friendly. Replacing hand dryers with towels is seen as a way to reduce the further dispersal of toilet aerosols in public washrooms known as toilet plume.

It can be manually operated by means of a handle, or can be automatic. Soap dispensers are often found in public toilets. Design=Manual soap dispensers The design of a manual soap dispenser is generally determined by whether the soap comes in liquid, powder, or foam form. =Liquid soap= When soap is dispensed in liquid form, it is generally in a squeeze bottle or pump. The most popular soap dispensers of this type are plastic pump bottles, many of which are disposable. William Shepphard patented liquid soap on August 22, 1865. Minnetonka Corporation introduced the first modern liquid soap and cornered the market by buying up the entire supply of the plastic pumps needed for the liquid soap dispensers. =Dry soap= Some soap dispensers take solid bars of soap, and grate, plane, or grind them to flakes or powder as they are dispensed. About 40g fresh weight of soap is equivalent to 1 liter of liquid soap, providing soap for up to 400 handwashings. Soap mills are common in public washrooms in Germany. Soap graters made specifically for home use also exist; they can be wall-mounted, or free-standing (like a peppergrinder) and waterproof for use in a shower. Some graters take specially-dimensioned soap bars, others will take a range of ordinary soap bar sizes. Dispensers of pre-powdered soaps, such as borax, often take the form of a metal box with a weighted lever; when the lever is pressed, a handful of soap is released. Ground soap is also used to wash laundry. =Foam soap= Foam soap dispensers have dual foam pumps that when used move both air and soap, injecting both together through small openings to create a lather. They can be found in both manual and automatic varieties. Manual dispensers of foam soap often consist of a large button which squeezes the foam out of a tube. Many liquid soap dispensers operate in this way as well. A few dispensers operate with a lever that pulls forward and squeezes the soap out. The majority of manual foam soap dispensers have the soap in a bladder in the dispenser in liquid form, as the pump is pressed the liquid soap is pushed through a small foaming nozzle which foams the soap. Automatic soap dispensers Automatic soap dispenser An automatic soap dispenser is specifically a hands-free dispenser of soap (both liquid soap and foaming soap), but generally can be used for other liquids such as hand sanitizers, shampoos, or hand lotions. Automatic dispensers are often battery- powered. The touch-free design dispenses the liquid when a sensor detects motion under the nozzle. The electronic components of an automatic soap dispenser allow for a timing device or signal (sound, lights, etc.) which can indicate to the user whether they have washed their hands for the correct amount of time or not. Hands-free dispensers for water and soap/hand sanitizer have particular virtues for operating theatres and treatment rooms.

It is developed by Illumination Research. It is a photorealistic, offline renderer that has been used to render VFX for numerous feature films, including Chappie. History Work on 3Delight started in 1999. The renderer became first publicly available in 2000. 3Delight was the first RenderMan- compliant renderer combining the REYES algorithm with on-demand ray tracing. The only other RenderMan-compliant renderer capable of ray tracing at the time was BMRT. BMRT was not a REYES renderer though. 3Delight was meant to be a commercial product from the beginning. However, the 3Delight team decided to make it available free of charge from August 2000 to March 2005 in order to build a user base. During this time, customers using a large number of licenses on their sites or requiring extensive support were asked to kindly work out an agreement that specified some form of fiscal compensation for this. In March 2005, the license was changed. The first license was still free. From the second license onwards, the renderer used to be 1,000 USD per two thread node resp. US$1,500 per four thread node. The first company that licenses 3Delight commercially, in early 2005, was Rising Sun Pictures. The licensing scheme was originally based on number of threads or cores. Since 2018, all purchased licenses are unlimited multi-core. The first license is free; initially limited to four cores and later increased to eight and now 12. Features Until version 10 (2013), 3Delight primarily used the REYES algorithm but was also well capable of doing ray tracing and global illumination. As of version 11 (2014) 3Delight primarily uses Path Tracing, with the option to use the REYES + RayTracing when needed. The renderer is fully multi-threaded, supports RenderMan Shading Language (RSL) 1.0/2.0 with optimising compiler and last stage JIT compilation. 3Delight also supports distributed rendering. This allows for accelerated rendering on multi-CPU hosts or environments where a large number of computers are joined into a grid / cloud. It implements all required capabilities for a RenderMan-compliant renderer and also the following optional ones:3Delight Technical Specifications *Area light sources *Depth of field *Displacement mapping *Environment mapping *Global illumination *Level of detail *Motion blur *Programmable shading *Special camera projections (through the \\"ray trace hider\\") *Ray tracing *Shadow depth mapping *Solid modeling *Texture mapping *Volume shading 3Delight also supports the following capabilities, which are not part of any capabilities list: *Photon mapping *Point clouds *Hierarchical subdivision surfaces *NURB curves *Brick maps (three-dimensional, mip-mapped textures) *(RIB) Conditionals *Class-based shaders *Co-shaders Other features include: *Extended display subset functionality to allow rendering of geometric primitives, writing to the same display variable, to different images. For example, display subsets could be used to render the skin and fur of a creature to two separate images at once without the fur matting the skin passes. *Memory efficient point clouds. Like brick maps, point clouds are organized in a spatial data structure and are loaded lazily, keeping the memory requirements as low as possible. *Procedural geometry is instanced lazily even during ray tracing, keeping the memory requirements as low as possible. *Displacement shaders can be stacked. *Displacement shaders can (additionally) be run on the vertices of a geometric primitive, before that primitive is even shaded. *The gather() shadeop can be used on point clouds and to generate sample distributions from (high dynamic range) images, e.g. for easily combining photon mapping with image based lighting. *First order ray differentials on any ray fired from within a shader. *A read/write disk cache that allows the renderer to take strain off the network, when heavy scene data needs to be repeatedly distributed to clients on a render farm or image data sent back from such clients to a central storage server. *A C API that allows running RenderMan Shading Language (RSL) code on arbitrary data, e.g. inside a modelling application.

Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that found an electoral district with boundaries created to disenfranchise African Americans violated the Fifteenth Amendment.. Background After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, activists in the city of Tuskegee, Alabama had been slowly making progress in registering African-American voters, whose numbers on the rolls began to approach those of registered white voters. The city was the location of the Tuskegee Institute, a historically black college, and a large Veterans Administration hospital, both staffed entirely by African Americans. In terms of total population, African Americans outnumbered whites in the city by a four-to-one margin, and whites wanted to block the likelihood of being governed by the black majority. Local white residents lobbied the Alabama legislature to redefine the boundaries of the city. In 1957, without debate, and ignoring African-American protests, the legislature enacted Local Law 140, which created a 28-sided city boundary. That excluded nearly all black voters from the redefined city, but no whites. The act was written by state senator Samuel Martin Engelhardt Jr., who was executive secretary of the White Citizens' Council of Alabama and an advocate of white supremacy.Allen Mendenhall, \\"Gomillion v. Lightfoot\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, 2011/2014 African Americans protested, led by Charles G. Gomillion, a professor at Tuskegee, and community activists mounted a boycott against white-owned businesses in the city.Samuel A. Stern, \\"Reviewed Work: Gomillion versus Lightfoot: The Tuskegee Gerrymander Case by Bernard Taper\\", The Journal of Southern History Vol. 29, No. 1 (Feb., 1963), pp. 141-143 Gomillion and others filed suit against the city mayor and other officials, claiming that the act was discriminatory in purpose under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clause. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, located in the capital of Montgomery and headed by Judge Frank M. Johnson, dismissed the case, ruling that the state had the right to draw boundaries of election districts and jurisdictions. That ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans. As head of Tuskegee, Booker T. Washington had promoted blacks advancing by education and self-improvement, with the expectation of being accepted by whites when they showed they were \\"deserving.\\" At the time of the U.S. Supreme Court hearing of this case, journalist Bernard Taper wrote, > Since the gerrymander was designed to defeat municipal suffrage rights of > the highly \\"deserving\\" members of the Institute and the hospital staff, > Session Law 140 has demonstrated, perhaps more than other symbols of > Southern prejudice, the invalidity of Booker T. Washington's advice.Richard > B. Sobol, \\"Reviewed Work: Gomillion versus Lightfoot: The Tuskegee > Gerrymander Case by Bernard Taper\\", Columbia Law Review Vol. 62, No. 4 > (Apr., 1962), pp. 748-751 The redrawing of the city boundaries had the \\"unintended effect of uniting Tuskegee Institute's African-American intellectuals with the less educated blacks living outside the sphere of the school. Some members of the school's faculty realized that possessing advanced degrees ultimately provided them no different status among the city's white establishment\\". Gomillion and his attorneys appealed the case to the US Supreme Court. The case was argued by Fred Gray, an experienced Alabama civil rights attorney, and Robert L. Carter, lead counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), with assistance from Arthur D. Shores, who provided additional legal counsel. The defendant team was led by James J. Carter (no relation).  Decision  In this landmark voting rights case, the Supreme Court ruled on whether Act 140 of the Alabama legislature violated the Fifteenth Amendment. Alabama passed Act 140 in 1957, which changed the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee, Alabama. It had previously been a square but the legislature redrew it as a 28-sided figure, excluding all but a handful of potential African- American voters and no white voters. Among those excluded were the entire educated, professional faculty of the Tuskegee University and doctors and staff of the Tuskegee Veterans Administration Hospital. Justice Frankfurter issued the opinion of the Court, which held that the Act did violate the provision of the 15th Amendment prohibiting states from denying anyone their right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Justice Whittaker concurred but he said in his opinion that he believed the law should have been struck down under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This case was cited in the Court's ruling in the Tennessee malapportionment case of Baker v. Carr (1962), which required state legislatures (including both houses of bicameral legislatures) to redistrict based on population, in order to reflect demographic changes and enable representation of urban populations. It established the principle of \\"one man, one vote\\" under the Equal Protection Clause. Whittaker's Concurrence This case should be examined under the Equal Protection Clause, not the 15th Amendment. Just because someone has been redistricted to vote in another district does not automatically mean his rights have been denied. It is not a right to vote in a particular jurisdiction. But in this case, completely fencing African-American citizens out of a district is an unlawful segregation of black citizens and a clear violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Subsequent history \\"The case showed that all state powers were subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Constitution; therefore, states were not insulated from federal judicial review when they jeopardized federally protected rights.\\" The case was returned to the lower court; in 1961, under the direction of Judge Johnson, the gerrymandering was reversed and the original map of the city was reinstituted. In the 1980 case Mobile v. Bolden, the court limited its holding in Gomillion, ruling that racially discriminatory effect and intent would be necessary to prompt intervention by federal courts for violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Congress effectively negated Bolden in 1982 when it amended Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1973. Congress' amendments returned the law to the pre-Bolden interpretation, under which violations of Section 2 did not require a showing of racially discriminatory intent, but it was sufficient to show discriminatory effect. This legislation was important for the many subsequent cases challenging political and electoral systems that resulted in dilution of voting or other effects that deprived citizens of their ability to elect a candidate of their choice.

Second Edition. First published in 1956, 1972. Berkeley: University of California Press. . more Crotalus basiliscus is a venomous pit viper species in the family Viperidae. The species is endemic to western Mexico. The specific name, basiliscus, is derived from the Greek word for king, βασιλισκος (), and alludes to this snake's large size and potent venom. There are no subspecies which are recognized as being valid. Description C. basiliscus at Wilmington Serpentarium in North Carolina, United States C. basiliscus is one of the largest rattlesnake species. Specimens exceeding are not uncommon, while the maximum size reported is (Klauber, 1972). The body is moderately stout and rather rectangular in cross section.United States Navy (1991). Poisonous Snakes of the World. New York: US Government / Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . At midbody, 25-29 rows of strongly keeled dorsal scales occur. The ventral scales number 174-206 and the subcaudals 18-36. The color pattern consists of brown or grayish ground color overlaid with 26-41 dark, rhombus- shaped (diamond) blotches with light edges. The head is a uniform grayish- brown except for its lighter labial scales and dark postorbital bar. No distinct pattern is found on the crown or neck areas. The tail may be gray, with darker bands, or almost uniform in color without any distinct markings. The belly is white or cream-colored. The young are mostly red, but adults eventually become an olive green. Within its range, this is the only rattlesnake with diamond-shaped dorsal markings. This snake often occurs in the same areas as C. molossus, where the two appear to hybridize freely. While these two species are easily distinguished, identifying the hybrid specimens is problematic. Common names Common names for C. basiliscus include Mexican west coast rattlesnake, Mexican green rattler, Mexican west coast green rattlesnake,Mehrtens JM (1987). Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . and in Spanish cascabel verde mexicana. Geographic range This rattler, C. basiliscus, is found in western Mexico from southern Sonora to Michoacán, where it is mostly restricted to the coastal plain. The type locality given is \\"Near Colima, Mexico\\". Habitat Around Colima, where C. basiliscus is (or was at one point) particularly plentiful, the area has been described as mostly treeless and covered with short grass with scattered clumps of mesquite, acacias, and other thorny bushes, as well as plenty of large cacti. The habitat of C. basiliscus is mostly tropical thorn forest, with an extension into tropical deciduous forest. Conservation status The species C. basiliscus is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2001). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The trend for this species was stable when assessed in 2007. Behavior In the lowlands, C. basiliscus is primarily active during the rainy summer months, and most specimens are found crossing the roads at night. However, a few have been seen basking early in the morning. It has been reported to tame quickly in captivity. Feeding Klauber reported that the stomachs of seven specimens of C. basiliscus contained mammal hair, probably belonging to rodents. Venom Crotalus basilicus is known to produce large amounts of highly toxic venom, and large specimens should be regarded as very dangerous. Brown (1973) mentioned an average venom yield of 297 mg (dried venom), as well as values of 11.1 mg/kg IV and 4.0 and 12.9 mg/kg IP.Brown JH (1973). Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73-229. . In some populations, the venom may contain a component structurally related to Mojave toxin. The venom also contains proteases.Norris R (2004). \\"Venom Poisoning in North American Reptiles\\".

Accessed 4 February 2007. Taxonomy Before 1989, two subspecies were recognized: C. b. basiliscus and C. b. oaxacus. In that year, the latter was transfererred to C. molossus by Campbell and Lamar. Occasionally, one may also encounter references to another subspecies, C. b. totonacus (Gloyd & Kauffeld, 1940), found in northeastern Mexico. It was more commonly considered to be a subspecies of C. durissus, until it was elevated to a full species by Campbell and Lamar (2004): Crotalus totonacus.

It is located near the Ashida River in present-day Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture. Investigators believe that Kusado Sengen was a minor commercial port town on the Seto Inland Sea during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Exhibits and a reconstruction may be found at the Hiroshima Prefectural Museum of History.  Discovery  Kusado Sengen was discovered in 1961 when a large quantity of pottery, porcelain and gravestones were discovered while attempting to re-route the Ashida River. Many historians believed that it was the site of a medieval town named Kusado Sengen. Excavation was not carried out, and the site was buried by a sandbank in the re-routed river.  Excavation  Excavation of the site was started in 1961 by the Fukuyama Municipal Board of Education. Several items dating back to the Kamakura and Muromachi Periods were found, and it became obvious that the site was indeed Kusado Sengen. The Ministry of Construction planned river improvements and the construction of a dam. These plans caused the possibility that the sandbank on which the site was located might be destroyed or completely submerged. Serious and long-term investigations therefore became urgently necessary. Accordingly, the Hiroshima Prefectural Institute for the Kusado Sengen-cho Site Investigations was founded in 1973 as a research unit within the Hiroshima Prefectural Board of Education. Many of the finds from the site that have been excavated are waterlogged and reasonably well preserved. Finds include wells, pits for garbage dumping, ditches, ponds, graves, and a wide range of objects such as pottery, wooden objects, stone objects, metal objects, bone tools, fabrics, and organic remains. Pottery was very common amongst the finds at the site, the most common being earthenware. A great deal of imported pottery from Vietnam, Korea and China was found with it. Many kinds of wooden objects were discovered. The majority of them were for daily activities such as eating and storage. Lacquer ware bowls and dishes are regarded as common tableware in the town. These are believed to have been produced in the town, since a lot of lacquering tools were excavated from the site. On many of the lacquer vessels there are designs of living things such as birds and plants. Other finds include coins and carpenters' tools.

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1943. He attended Princeton University and Columbia Law School. His most noted works include Justice Accused: Antislavery and the Judicial Process, \\"Violence and the Word,\\" and \\"Nomos and Narrative.\\" He lent his strong support to the campaign to divest Yale of apartheid South African financial holdings. He was also interested in Jewish social and legal history, and was translating a renaissance Hebrew text on the law of jurisdiction at the time of his death. Prior to his death from heart problems, many friends and colleagues speculated that, given his extraordinary success at such a young age, he would one day be considered for the Supreme Court. In \\"Nomos and Narrative\\", he tells that \\"we inhabit a 'nomos' - a normative universe. We constantly create and maintain a world of right and wrong, of lawful and unlawful, of valid and void\\". He explains that the normative universe is held together by the force of interpretive commitments - some small and private, others immense and public. These commitments - of officials and of others - do determine what law means and what law shall be. If there existed two legal orders with identical legal precepts and identical, predictable patterns of public force, they would nonetheless differ essentially in meaning if, in one of the orders, the precepts were universally venerated while in the other they were regarded by many as fundamentally unjust. Therefore \\"the rules and principles of justice, the formal institutions of the law, and the conventions of a social order are, indeed, important to that world; they are, however, but a small part of the normative universe that ought to claim our attention. No set of legal institutions or prescriptions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning. For every constitution there is an epic, for each decalogue a scripture. Once understood in the context of the narratives that give it meaning, law becomes not merely a system of rules to be observed, but a world in which we live\\". In his most famous article, \\"Violence and the Word\\", he writes that \\"Legal interpretation takes place in a field of pain and death. This is true in several senses. Legal interpretive acts signal and occasion the imposition of violence upon others: A judge articulates her understanding of a text, and as a result, somebody loses his freedom, his property, his children, even his life. Interpretations in law also constitute justifications for violence which has already occurred or which is about to occur. When interpreters have finished their work, they frequently leave behind victims whose lives have been torn apart by these organized, social practices of violence. Neither legal interpretation nor the violence it occasions may be properly understood apart from one another\\", and concludes \\"The perpetrator and victim of organized violence will undergo achingly disparate significant experiences. For the perpetrator, the pain and fear are remote, unreal, and largely unshared. They are, therefore, almost never made a part of the interpretive artifact, such as the judicial opinion. On the other hand, for those who impose the violence the justification is important, real and carefully cultivated. Conversely, for the victim, the justification for the violence recedes in reality and significance in proportion to the overwhelming reality of the pain and fear that is suffered. Between the idea and the reality of common meaning falls the shadow of the violence of law, itself\\".Yale Law Journal, Vol. 95, No. 8, July 1986 at p. 1601 This article has inspired many discussions on the relationship between law, language and violence. He also published the brief \\"Your Law Baseball Quiz\\" on the editorial page of The New York Times on April 5, 1979, amusingly and insightfully comparing Supreme Court Justices to baseball players. It spawned an underground cottage industry of law-baseball and law-other metaphorical devices that still persists.

It is found in the region known as La Mancha. History=Historical development The area surrounding Campo de Criptana has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Prehistoric implements of hunting, gathering, and agriculture have been found in various locations, as have ceramics, particularly from the Bronze Age. From historic times, the most plentiful remnants have been Ibero-Roman. Settlement of the present city center of Campo de Criptana dates from the 13th century, though the municipal area was occupied by human beings much earlier. Numerous archaeological remains and historical documents attest to the existence of inhabited centers since the Bronze Age. There is evidence of settlements of some importance--at least since the Middle Ages--named Criptana, Villajos, Posadas Viejas and El Campo, as well as others of lesser significance, such as Villagordo, El Pico de la Solana, etc. Criptana, located about two kilometers east of the present city center, was granted, under the name of Chitrana, by the Order of St. John in 1162 to the Toledo Mozarab nobleman Miguel Assaraff in order that it be resettled. Later it passed to the Order of Santiago, forming the center of an estate that also had property in Villajos and Pedro Muñoz. By the 14th century it was again depopulated. Villajos, some four kilometers to the north of the current city center, had been peopled since prehistoric times. It appears in a citation from 1162, together with Chitrana, Spain, and Attires, as property of the Order of St. John. In various medieval documents it is mentioned under other names such as Villa de Alios and Villa de Ajos. It was depopulated from the 12th century, and the current hermitage was built over the original church of its city center. Hardly any documented information exists about Posadas Viejas, except that it was situated near Camino de la Puente, south of the present railway line, and that it was depopulated around 1300. El Campo grew up in the current location of the city center, around a fortified position of the Cerro (hill) de la Paz, which served as an outpost of the Castillo (Castle) de Criptana. Despite being at the time the newest center, arising with the repopulation in the 13th century, it attracted people from the surrounding centers, perhaps on account of the quality of its water and air. The towns referred to above disappeared, giving way to the new community. Named Campo de Criptana, it is first referred to in documents from the early 14th century. Throughout the Middle Ages, the population of the town center grew, helped along by the facilities provided by the various maestres (\\"masters\\") of the Order of Santiago. The survey records of Philip II (1575) report some 1,000 households (between four and five thousand inhabitants), which by the first decade of the 17th century had risen to 1,300–1,500 households. From this time its population shows the unfortunate state of a rural society affected very severely by climate, epidemics of disease, poor harvests, and excessive taxation. The recovery was very slow until well into the 19th century. Until the beginning of the 19th century, the local economy was based on traditional Mediterranean agriculture—grains, olives, and grapes—with the addition of wool. In the early 19th century there began to be a certain amount of industrialization related to the primary economy, in particular the manufacture of flour, and most of all, wine-making. The railway arrived in the second half of the 19th century and had a significant effect on this process of industrialization. In the second half of the 20th century tourism became a catalyzing new element of the local economy. Until 1999 the municipal area also included Arenales de San Gregorio, which was situated 13 kilometers southeast of the main core, and had 700 inhabitants. After that date San Gregorio constituted an independent municipality. Formation of the urban center The 13th century beginnings of the urban center were situated around a fortified position in the Cerro de La Paz, which served as a defensive outpost of the Castillo de Criptana. The topographical features of the area determined the formation of the city and its subsequent expansion into the plain to the south. In the 16th century the city experienced a period of prosperity that manifested itself in numerous construction projects, both civil (the Granary, Casa de la Tercia) and religious (Hermitages of the Virgen de la Paz, Veracruz, Santa Ana, and Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; Convento de las Carmelitas). However, the national crisis of the 17th century affected the city, which, once having reached the plain, halted its expansion. In the initial third of the 19th century, having recovered from the effects of the Peninsular War (also known as the War of Spanish Independence), the municipality became an important agricultural center with a gradually rising population. This gave rise to a local bourgeoisie, which, benefitting from the confiscation of church property, strengthened its economic power in the second half of the 19th century and made possible the emergence of a historic, regionalist, and modern architecture which characterizes this period of city-building. These well-off families built their residences in the center of the city, leading to an urban renewal that manifested itself in particular in the change from the agrarian pattern in which large open fields predominated, to one in which the dominant areas were those that accommodated residential uses and the land was related to residential activity rather than agriculture. The arrival of the railway in the second half of the 19th century led to the placement of the new industrial facilities in the southeast part of the core, near the train station. During the first third of the 20th century the growth of the city continued inhabitation of the flatter areas and movement toward the south. The municipal population reached its high point in the middle of the 20th century (15,659 inhabitants in 1950), with economic growth then coming to a halt as a consequence of emigration to the large cities (the municipality lost 2,369 inhabitants between 1950 and 1980). Expansion of the city ended; growth was limited to small developments along the southern border. The last quarter of the 20th century saw a renewed, major expansion of the city, which in just over 20 years almost doubled the area that was occupied in the 1970s. The resulting growth of residences (almost all single-family homes), industrial installations (in the extreme southeast area and in isolated pockets), and office buildings produced a mostly unplanned urban area with overall deficiencies in infrastructure. Since the approval of the first municipal planning regulations in 1981 (which involved the formal adoption of the decision to manage the city's development at the municipal level) the situation has been gradually improved. Monuments and places of interest=Windmills Group of windmills in Campo de Criptana \\"At this point they caught sight of thirty or forty windmills which were standing on the plain...\\" Thus begins chapter VIII of Don Quixote. In Cervantes's time windmills were quite common. This view is undoubtedly the characteristic landscape of Campo de Criptana, presenting its silhouette from the Sierra de los Molinos and the Cerro de la Paz. A 19th century land registry drawn up at the behest of the Marqués de la Ensenada shows 34 windmills in existence at that time, each clearly marked with the name of the mill and that of its owner. Through archaeological remnants, we know that they had once been far more numerous. Today, ten windmills can be seen from afar, with their original structure and machinery preserved. Visitors can tour the inside of the mills and listen to a presentation about their function. Other mills have been converted into museums: the Inca Garcilaso is a museum celebrating the working of the land, the Pilón is a museum of wine, the Quimera is dedicated to Vicente Huidobro, the Culebro to the actress Sara Montiel, and the Lagarto to poetry. The Poyatos windmill houses the Office of Tourism. Every Saturday one of the restored mills is put into operation. In 1978, the entire group of windmills was declared a Monument of Historical-Artistic Interest, which today is referred to as a Cultural Heritage Site. Pósito (Granary) A pósito is a building for storing grain (especially wheat), that is, a granary. The granary as an institution is quite old, and was run by the local government. Its purpose was to provide grain to farm workers in difficult times, on terms favourable to the recipients, and furthermore to regulate the market for wheat whenever its price (and therefore that of bread) was increasing at an alarming rate. The granary of Campo de Criptana is from the 16th century, and was renovated and enlarged by Charles III. The access door is on the main facade, which looks out over the plaza that carries the name of the building, Plaza del Pósito. At the midpoint it has an arch, decorated with a three-sided frame known as an alfiz, and above that three coats of arms, two of them of the Order of Santiago. The granary was in use up to the Peninsular War (1808-1814), at which point it began to fall into disuse. The granary was auctioned off in 1914 and passed into private hands. In 1991 the local government re-acquired it and had it restored for use as a town museum, where expositions and cultural activities could take place. The restoration was carried out by a teaching workshop, which for its fine work received a diploma awarded by Europa Nostra in 1997. Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción A modern church, opened in 1958. The building was erected on the site of the 16th century church, which burned in 1936, during the Spanish Civil War. Convent Church A possession of the convent of the Barefoot Carmelites, which was confiscated in the 19th century through the law of Mendizábal. Its current appearance is a result of the renovations done in the 18th century according to the Jesuit church model. The transept has a cupola crowned by a lantern. A shrine to the Thousand and One Virgins, donated by the archbishop of Colonia in 1612, is still preserved. Hermitage of the Virgen de la Paz Found near the Cerro de la Paz, from where one can view a magnificent countryside. For several centuries it was dedicated to St. Christopher, who was the protector from the plagues. It is surrounded by a neighbourhood consisting of small white dwellings with a similar appearance to the hermitage. It has a rectangular layout with a single nave, and a ceiling with a groin vault. Besides this building, there are nine more hermitages surrounding Criptana: *Hermitage of Veracruz *Hermitage of Santa Ana *Hermitage of la Madre de Dios *Hermitage of San Cristóbal *Hermitage of the Concepción *Hermitage de San Sebastián *Hermitage de San Pedro *Hermitage of Cristo de Villajos *Hermitage of the Virgen de Criptana Streets and neighbourhoods All of the streets that encircle Cerro de la Paz follow the shape of the old town and are on a hillside, which makes Criptana different from other towns of La Mancha, all of which are on the plain. At the end of the 16th century many Moorish families from Granada took refuge in the eastern part of the town and from that time the new neighbourhood has been known as the Albaicín, referring to the ancient neighbourhood of the same name in Granada. The houses still have their Arabic tiles, painted in white and indigo, and wrought iron grilles in the windows.

Biography Governor Blackall, . Sir Peter Scratchley's Camp, Aroa River, Redscar Bay (1885) J. W. Lindt State Library Victoria H42424 Scratchley was born in Paris, thirteenth child of Dr James Scratchley, Royal Artillery, and his wife Maria, née Roberts. He was educated in Paris and at the Woolwich academy and then began a career as an Officer of Engineers in the British Army. Scratchley served in the Crimea and Indian Mutiny and in October 1859 was made a captain. He then had several tours of duty in the Australian colonies advising on defence. In 1860 he was sent to Victoria to plan a system of defence for that colony, but after working on this for over three years his plan was not adopted as a whole. Scratchley had, however, constructed batteries around the coast of Port Phillip by expending a comparatively small sum. Following the withdrawal in 1870 of British garrison troops from Australia, Major General Sir William Jervois and then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley were commissioned by a group of colonies to advise on defence matters. They inspected each colony's defences and produced the Jervois-Scratchley reports of 1877. Not surprisingly given their engineering backgrounds and the fear in the colonies of potential enemy fleets, the reports emphasised fortifications against naval attack. The Jervois-Scratchley reports formed the basis of defence planning in Australia and New Zealand for the next 30 years. Among his achievements in Australia were: * Founding of the Corps of Engineers in Victoria in 1860 * The fort on Bare Island, Botany Bay, New South Wales * Fort Scratchley, Newcastle, New South Wales * Fort Lytton, Brisbane, Queensland * Fort Glanville, South Australia — assisted by Alexander Bain Moncrieff * Fort Queenscliff, Queenscliff, Victoria Scratchley retired with the honorary rank of Major-General on 1 October 1882, but was still employed as defence adviser for Australia by the Colonial Office. He was appointed special commissioner for Great Britain in New Guinea in 1884, and arrived there in August 1885. Port Moresby was made the seat of government, questions of land tenure and the cultivation of the land were examined, and good relations were established with many of the natives and with the missionaries. Scratchley soon contracted malaria and died at sea on aboard the Governor Blackall on 2 December 1885. He was buried in Melbourne and then reinterred to the Old Charlton cemetery in England. He left a widow, two daughters and a son. Honours Scratchley was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in June 1885. Scratchley Road in Port Moresby, Mount Scratchley in the Owen Stanley Range near Kokoda in Papua New Guinea, and Fort Scratchley in Newcastle are named in his honour.

He was the last of his dynasty, with his death the line of Ekkeharding margraves descending from Eckard I of Meissen (d. 1002) became extinct. Life He was a younger son of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen and his wife Swanehilde. Eckard was a count in the Gau Chutizi east of Merseburg as well as in the burgward of Teuchern. Upon the assassination of his father in 1002, Eckard II and his elder brother Herman I ruled over the Ekkeharding allodial lands, while the Meissen margravial title first passed to their uncle Gunzelin feuding with his nephews until his deposition in 1009. During the German–Polish War around the Lusatian and Milceni lands, the brothers were able to maintain the rule over the Meissen lands until fighting ended with the 1018 Peace of Bautzen. About 1026, Eckard married Uta von Ballenstedt, sister of the Saxon count Esico of Ballenstedt, progenitor of the noble House of Ascania. The marriage remained childless. With the consent of Emperor Conrad II, he and his brother Herman had the seat of the Bishopric of Zeitz relocated to Naumburg Cathedral in 1028/29. In 1034 Eckard II became Margrave of Lusatia (Lower Lusatia) after his followers had slain the Wettin margrave Theoderic II, husband of Eckard's sister Matilda. Four years later he succeeded his brother Herman as Margrave of Meissen. As guardian of the German eastern frontiers against Poland and Bohemia, he was often serving Emperor Conrad II and his successor King Henry III against these menaces, including the \\"Bohemian Achilles\\", Duke Bretislaus I. In 1039 Bretislaus, allied with King Peter of Hungary, who was at the same time raiding the Bavarian Avar March, made great gains in Poland, plundering Kraków and Gniezno, where he took along the relics of Saint Adalbert of Prague. In turn, King Henry III launched a campaign against him, together with his loyalest and most trusted allies, Archbishop Bardo of Mainz and Margrave Eckard. The Saxon forces led by the Meissen margrave took part in both of the king's expedition's, in 1040 and 1041: the first unsuccessful, the latter a victory which forced Duke Bretislaus to submit and conclude a peace treaty. Margrave Eckard remained one of Henry's closest advisors until his death during a Saxon epidemic of 1046. He bequeathed his exceptional wealth and his margravial titles and lands to King Henry, who bestowed the margraviate on the Thuringian count William IV of Weimar. He and his wife Uta von Ballenstedt were immortalized by their famous donor portraits by the Naumburg Master in the Naumburg Cathedral. Sources *Gwatkin, H.M., Whitney, J. P. (ed) et al.

Further, it was discovered that Kōno had twenty chemicals stored at his residence, which he had purchased for photo processing and pottery, along with pesticides. Despite the fact that sarin could not be synthesised from any combination of these chemicals, and Kōno lacked any of the qualifications or considerable knowledge of and experience in chemistry necessary to produce it, historian Keiichi Tsuneishi erroneously claimed in The Asahi Shimbun (the second most circulated newspaper out of the five national newspapers in Japan) that it was possible to synthesise the nerve agent from organophosphorus pesticides.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/06/21/national/history/man- accused-poisoning-matsumotos-civilians/#.XbJLeZJKjIU Due to a deliberate leak from the local Nagano police force, he was subjected to a \\"trial by media\\" where the Japanese media treated Kōno as the perpetrator, dubbing him the \\"Poison Gas Man\\", causing him to receive hate mail and death threats.https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180727/p2a/00m/0na/031000c After the much larger attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995, Kōno was cleared of blame and Aum Shinrikyo was deemed responsible. The head of National Public Safety Commission Hiromu Nonaka and media publicly apologised to Kōno. However, Nagano police did not directly apologise to Kōno until 2002. Kōno later participated in many media events in defence of Aum, arguing that since the time he was wrongly accused in connection to the incident, he realised how vulnerable innocent victims are to media hate campaigns. Pointing to his own personal experience with the media industry and police, he drew parallels to innocent Aum members who suffered public alienation and unceremonious intrusion into their private life justified mostly by fears generated by the sensationalistic media rather than any proof of actual guilt. Together with Yoshihiro Yasuda, a veteran attorney arrested during his defence of Aum's founder Shoko Asahara, he also campaigned against the death penalty and delivered speeches and lectures explaining the impact of Japan's judicial system on suspects and wrongly accused, as well as the social impact on relatives and associates.

Plot The film follows two young friends, Kiran, a Hindu, and Delilah, a Catholic, from their first meeting as young children to young adulthood, when they realize their love for each other. A student in their same class, Rajan, has a crush on Delilah and he asks Kiran to pen love letters to her on his behalf. Kiran does so as it allows her to express her love to Delilah without having to be ostracized by her family and society. Eventually Delilah discovers the truth behind the letters and poetry, and admits her mutual love to Kiran. This begins a delicate love affair, despite social taboos against homosexuality. Their love affair is severely impeded when Rajan discovers Kiran and Delilah stealing a moment of intimacy in the woods. He informs Amma, Delilah's mother, of what he witnessed. Amma confronts Delilah, who reveals her love for Kiran. To save the family from disgrace, Amma arranges a marriage for Delilah with a suitor who had recently visited with intent on finding a bride. Delilah reluctantly consents to the marriage. Kiran tries to convince Delilah to run away with her after gaining support from her uncle who lived in a distant place, but Delilah tells Kiran that it's not possible and tells her that what had existed between them was over.

Founded June 30, 1886, it has been operating continuously since. This date also marks the completion of the last leg of the first transcontinental rail line of the Canadian Pacific Railway from Montreal to Vancouver. In response to booming demand for beef in rapidly growing Vancouver, the Interior stock industry went into high gear in the wake of the railway's opening, spurring on something of a golden age in BC ranching. In 1907 the Nicola branch line of the CPR was built into the Nicola Valley to serve the booming stock operation at Douglas Lake, which was already one of the country's largest and for many years second only to the sprawling Gang Ranch on the west side of the Fraser, which has since shrunk in scale, leaving the Douglas Lake as the largest. The ranch includes leased grazing land as well as directly leased or titled lands, and extends to the edge of metropolitan Kamloops and towards Shuswap Lake, spanning most of the high country of the northeastern Thompson Plateau. The Douglas Lake Cattle Company has faced many controversies. It has been claimed that early on, the ranch's land holdings were expanded by pressing large amounts of cattle into the pastures of smaller neighbours. While the cattle would later be removed the damage was done. With their feed for the year consumed by Douglas Lake's herd, the homesteaders would be forced to sell. Douglas Lake Cattle Company has also aggressively restricted access to both private and public lands. By buying up thin strips of land along major arteries they are able to control wide tracts of public range. In many cases locked gates were placed where Douglas Lake has no legal claim to the property. While this is claimed to preserve grasslands, some say it appears to be a business maneuver. Douglas Lake Cattle Company charges up to $100.00 a day to fly fish their private lakes (that they maintain by stocking, cleaning, aerating, etc.). There are public lakes that you can access for free (Douglas Lake is public) or pay an access fee (Salmon Lake).

The novel follows Bertrand Caillet, the eponymous werewolf, throughout the tumultuous events of the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune of 1870–71. Plot summary Like much Gothic fiction, The Werewolf of Paris opens with a frame story in which the author explains his struggle with the fantastic elements of his tale. Here the narrator, an anonymous American working on his doctoral research in Paris, discovers a manuscript in the hands of some trash-pickers. He describes it as \\"the Galliez report: thirty four sheets of closely written French, an unsolicited defense of Sergeant Bertrand Caillet at the latter's court-martial in 1871.\\" A descendant of the cursed Pitamont clan, which destroyed itself in a long feud with the neighboring Pitavals, Bertrand is born one Christmas Eve to an adolescent girl who had been raped by a priest, Father Pitamont. Bertrand grows up with strange sadistic and sexual desires which are usually expressed as dreams. Sometimes the dreams are memories of actual experiences in which he had transformed into a wolf. His step-uncle, Aymar Galliez, who raises the boy (along with his mother Josephine and a servant Françoise), soon learns of Bertrand's affliction. Bertrand flees to Paris after his assault on a prostitute, his incestuous union with his mother, and his murder of a friend in their home village. Aymar tries to find Bertrand by studying the details of local crimes, such as the mutilation of corpses and various murders. Bertrand joins the National Guard during the Franco-Prussian War, doing little fighting and finding love from a girl who volunteers at a canteen, the beautiful and wealthy Sophie de Blumenberg. Sophie, a masochistic and obsessed with death, helps Bertrand avoid the violent effects of his transformation by allowing him to cut into her flesh in order to suck her blood. Aymar finds Bertrand in Paris during the Paris Commune, but thinking that love has cured Bertrand, he decides not to take action. Fearing that he'll accidentally kill Sophie, Bertrand goes out one night to feed on someone else. He is caught attacking a fellow soldier and arrested. Aymar supports burning Bertrand at the stake, and provides the court with a summary of Bertrand's crimes, but the court sentences him to treatment at the infirmary of La Santé prison. Aymar transfers Bertrand to an asylum after the reactionary Versaillists have retaken Paris, with great loss of life among the Communards, who are executed en masse. Unbeknownst to Aymar, Bertrand suffers in a small cell, drugged when he is visited by his uncle. Bertrand eventually commits suicide by jumping from the building with another inmate whom he delusively believes is Sophie. Their deaths are similar to a suicide fantasy that Bertrand and Sophie enjoyed; the real Sophie had previously committed suicide on her own, unable to deal with her separation from Bertrand. The narrative proper is followed by a grisly appendix citing a municipal report on the cemeteries of Paris. The report indicates that the grave of one \\"Sieur C ... (Bertrand)\\" contained the body \\"of a dog, which despite 8 years in the ground was still incompletely destroyed.\\" Historical content The Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune of 1870–71 provide the immediate backdrop to The Werewolf of Paris, although Endore also makes many references to the Revolutions of 1848, when Aymar was physically disabled and traumatized amid the intense street fighting in Paris. The novel is filled with allusions to notable historical figures including Bismarck, Blanqui, Courbet, Dumas, Haussmann, and Thiers. Endore uses the werewolf narrative to depict and comment on the fervid political climate of France in the nineteenth century. More specifically, his narrator comments cynically on the confusions and mistakes of the Commune, but always in the context of the unsurpassed brutality of the capitalist system. In a characteristic passage referring to the bloody suppression of the Commune by the combined forces of capital and aristocracy, Endore's narrator points out that the \\"Commune shot fifty-seven from the prison of La Roquette. Versailles retaliated with nineteen hundred. To that comparison add this one. The whole famous Reign of Terror in fifteen months guillotined 2,596 aristos. The Versaillists executed 20,000 commoners before the firing squads in one week.\\" Reception The Werewolf of Paris was a #1 New York Times bestseller upon publication. The thriller went through numerous printings of the clothbound first edition (pictured above right), now increasingly rare. It is rumored that Endore, suffering under the impact of the Great Depression, sold the manuscript outright to Farrar & Rinehart for a flat fee, thus receiving no additional royalties from its subsequent success. Given that Endore's next novel, Babouk (1934), was published by the leftist Vanguard Press, this story could have merit, although that work's revolutionary Haitian subject matter might simply have proven too controversial for Farrar & Rinehart. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas, notable sci-fi and mystery writers in the 1940s and 1950s, described Werewolf as a \\"superb blend of fantasy and psycho- pathology and history.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, June 1952, p.88 Robert Bloch included The Werewolf of Paris on his list of favourite horror novels.Robert Bloch, \\"Robert Bloch’s Ten Favorite Horror-Fantasy Novels\\" in The Book of Lists : horror. Amy Wallace, Scott Bradley, and Del Howison, New York : Harper, 2008. (p. 253) More recently, Brian Stableford praised the book as \\"entitled to be considered the werewolf novel.\\" Film adaptations Despite the fact that Endore worked for Universal Studios, The Werewolf of Paris served as the basis for neither Werewolf of London (1935) nor The Wolf Man (1941). Hammer Film Productions' The Curse of the Werewolf (1961) was the first adaptation of the story, although now set in nineteenth-century Spain, with little of the novel's political content.

The two tracks are played together as one song, both on the album and during live performances. Track lengths On European pressings of Boy, \\"\\" runs at a track length of 4:47, and \\"Into the Heart\\" runs at 3:28. On North American pressings of the album, \\"\\" runs at 6:21, and \\"Into the Heart\\" runs at 1:58. This can be easily noted by the visible difference between the two records. However, the tracks together sound identical on both pressings, and also both have a total run time of 8:14. Early compact disc releases combined the two songs into a single track. Due to the track time differences, it is difficult to make an official determination of where one song begins and where one ends (although the band's digital box set The Complete U2 and the 2008 remastered version of Boy standardized the original European pressings' running times). Because of this, the songs are usually considered to be one track. The 1998 single \\"Sweetest Thing\\" features a live performance of both songs from the War Tour, but only \\"An Cat Dubh\\" is listed. An Cat Dubh The title \\"\\" means \\"The Black Cat\\" in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, although its lyrics are in English. The song was written about a short relationship Bono had with a woman while split from his girlfriend (now wife) Ali Hewson. Gavin Friday, a very close friend of Bono, claims that the song is undoubtedly about sex. Bono agrees it is about sex and says that the song conjures the image of a cat and a bird, where the cat kills the bird and then plays with it before sleeping next to it. The song is layered with several guitar parts, a vibraphone and a sustained guitar sound. Into the Heart \\"Into the Heart\\" focuses on the theme of childhood and maturity and the loss of innocence. The beginning of the song is instrumental until Bono starts to sing with the melody. It is always played after \\"An Cat Dubh\\". Live performances The songs were played at most shows on the Boy, October, and War Tours, as well as the first leg of The Unforgettable Fire Tour. Following that, neither song was played until the Vertigo Tour in 2005, where it appeared at just over half of the concerts on the first leg of the tour. It was played on one occasion on the second leg, but was subsequently dropped. \\"An Cat Dubh\\" made an appearance in the War Tour as a snippet in \\"I Fall Down\\". \\"Into the Heart\\" was snippeted in three Elevation Tour shows, twice in \\"I Will Follow\\" and once in \\"Out of Control\\". Live performances of \\"An Cat Dubh\\"/\\"Into the Heart\\" have been released on \\"Sweetest Thing\\", digital album Live from Boston 1981, Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago, and the remastered DVD release of Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky. In 2010, U2 manager Paul McGuinness said that \\"An Cat Dubh\\" remained one of his favourite live tracks, describing it as \\"symphonic\\", adding that it had \\"very big musical ambitions.\\" He stated that the later compositions \\"Bad\\" and \\"One\\" were \\"the songs in line of descent from [An Cat Dubh]\\" because of their ability to continually grow in the live setting.Note: Content available only to subscribers.

A right-handed relief pitcher, Brea is tall, and he weighed 170 pounds during his playing career. Some records list his year of birth as 1978, but this figure was subsequently found to be inaccurate. Baseball career=Minor leagues In 1996, Brea began his professional career by signing with the Seattle Mariners as an undrafted free agent. He was 22 years old, but represented himself as a 17-year-old in order to secure a more favorable response from Mariners scouts. Baseball scouts are sometimes reluctant to sign older international players, since younger players are generally farther from their physical peak, and thus are perceived as having a comparatively higher ceiling to their future performance. Brea established himself as a prospect in 1998, when he saved 12 games as the closer for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers of the Midwest League. He compiled a 2.76 ERA and struck out 86 batters in only innings pitched, but also struggled to control his pitches, walking 40 batters and throwing five wild pitches. This type of performance would continue to be the norm as Brea advanced through the minors; he finished his professional career with more than a strikeout per inning pitched, but also walked almost five batters per nine innings. Trades Brea was involved in two noteworthy trades before reaching the major leagues. On December 14, 1998, the Mariners traded Brea to the New York Mets, in exchange for outfielder Butch Huskey. Huskey played well as a regular for the Mariners in 1999, before being traded to the Boston Red Sox at midseason. Two years later, Brea was one of six players involved in a trade deadline deal between the Mets and the Baltimore Orioles. The Mets sent Brea, Melvin Mora, Mike Kinkade, and pitching prospect Pat Gorman to the Orioles, receiving All-Star shortstop Mike Bordick. Bordick helped the Mets reach the 2000 World Series, but the deal was costly for the Mets, as Mora developed into a star and Bordick returned to the Orioles as a free agent that off-season. Questions about Brea's actual age surfaced after the deal, embarrassing Orioles' General Manager Syd Thrift. Major leagues Brea made his major league debut on August 13, 2000, starting against the Kansas City Royals. In his only major league start, he surrendered six runs in innings, and the Orioles lost 10–5. Over the next two years, he pitched in eight major league games, surrendering 15 earned runs in 11 innings, for an ERA of 12.27. Control continued to be a problem, as he walked 13 batters and struck out only five, also hitting one batter and throwing one wild pitch. The loss on August 13 was his only decision. Brea left the Orioles as a minor league free agent after the 2002 season. He signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays but did not make the team out of spring training and was released on March 10, 2003. Brea spent the remainder of that year, his last as a professional, with the Somerset Patriots of the Atlantic League.

The band with the single In 1964, a single credited to The Buggs was released on Soma Records. This group, actually a band called Andy & the Manhattans, hailed from Omaha, Nebraska, and the single was recorded at Amos Heilicher's Kay Bank Studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The single, \\"Buggs Vs. Beetles (I Want To Hold Your Hand)\\", is not a straight cover, but is instead a parody mocking the Beatles.

It consisted of covers of Beatles songs (\\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", \\"She Loves You\\") with some originals, many written by Lor Crane & Joan Kingsbury (\\"Big Ben Hop (Sassy Sue)\\", \\"Liverpool Drag (Why Won't You Leave That Man?)\\", \\"Teddy Boy Stomp (\\"I'll Never Never Never Leave You)\\", \\"Mersey Mercy (You Got Me Bugged)\\", \\"Swingin' Thames (That's For Sure)\\", \\"London Town Swing 9Why Can't You Love the Boy Who Loves You0\\", \\"East End (Since You Broke My Heart)\\", and a cover version of \\"Just One Look\\" (as \\"Soho Mash\\"). Fraudulent assertions of English origins featured prominently on the album cover, while the harsh unidirectional lighting on a black-and-white image mimicked the cover of With the Beatles. Models shown are not the band members. Despite the cover displaying \\"The original Liverpool sound\\", and claiming to have been \\"Recorded in England,\\" The Buggs hailed from New Jersey and the album was actually recorded in the New York/New Jersey area. The Buggs were never a real band; rather, the album was recorded by a group named the Coachmen V from Bergen County, New Jersey, under the impression that it would be released under that name. The album was produced by Goldie Goldman, who hired a songwriter to write the original tracks. Some rehearsing of the material was done in Nyack, New York at Scotty's Bar, after which the album was recorded. Band personnel included Bill Omolski on bass, Gary Wright (later to have a successful solo career with hits such as \\"Dream Weaver\\") on organ and vocals, Frank Zillitto (1942 - Dec. 2017) on guitar, Steve Bogue on drums, and either Eddie Brick or Jimmy Carrol on lead vocals. Brick and Carrol both worked as lead vocalist for the Coachman V at different times, and it is not known which one sang on the Buggs album. Studio musician Trade Martin also played on album. Band members were surprised (and unhappy) when they discovered that album had been released under a different band name, under false pretenses, and with models representing the band members. No royalties were ever paid, and The Buggs ceased to exist. In 1966, Coronet released Boots a Go-Go (Coronet, CX-212-A: 1966) repackaging the same Beetle Beat album from two years earlier, now with a go-go music storyline on the back cover and a picture of a go-go dancer on the front and back covers. According to the back cover, the Buggs' \\"go go sound\\" was \\"grown up rock 'n' roll\\" played at discotheques and on Hullaballoo. Cleverly, no song titles were featured on the album's front or back cover so that unaware buyers would not know that this was exactly the same Buggs' music from their previous and, technically, only release. As a result, the record's label did not reference the \\"Boots a Go-Go\\" title as the original unsold Beetle Beat vinyl was simply repurposed inside. Their influence may have been limited, but Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh said that Beetle Beat was his first album purchase, thinking it was a Beatles album. Mothersbaugh said, \\"One track pissed me off so much it eventually inspired the nasty Devo song, 'U Got Me Bugged'.\\" In 2009, reissue label Master Classics brought Beetle Beat to iTunes Store and other online music services including Spotify.

History In Kyrgyz, the archa, which gives the park its name, is a bright or many-colored juniper which the Kyrgyz people have traditionally held in special esteem, using smoke from its burning wood to chase away evil spirits. However, the archa is not supposed to be planted near the home, because it is believed gradually to sap the energy from human beings living close-by. Geography The park covers about 200 square kilometers, and its altitude ranges from about 1,500 meters at the entrance to a maximum of 4,895 meters at Semenov- Tian-Shansky Peak, the highest peak in the Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range of the Tian Shan. There are more than 20 small and large glaciers and some 50 mountain peaks within the park. Two smaller rivers, the Adygene and the Ak-Sai, originate from these glaciers' melting waters. The Adygene gorge is a wooded valley with waterfalls, springs and abundant trout. The park includes the gorge of the Ala-Archa River and the mountains surrounding it. Mountains Mountain climbing is a popular activity within the park, which offers several peaks in the 4000m class: * Semenov-Tian-Shansky Peak (4895m) * Korona Peak (4860m) * Free Korea Peak (4740m) Biosphere A small reservoir on the Kargay-Bulak river was built to study the Amu Darya trout. Other wildlife includes the very rare snow leopard (in Kyrgyz: \\"ilbirs\\") on the alpine meadows and snowfields above 2,500 m elevation, wild goats, roe deer and marmots. The snow leopard has been photographed by the park's camera for the first time in May 2017.Camera traps in Ala-Archa national park record snow leopard for first time, Akipress.com, 6 May 2017 Many plants can be found in the park, including the Crocus alatavicus.

The park is open year round, although the most popular season is late summer and early fall. Every May 1, hundreds of people camp out in the valley and climb Mount Komsomolets for the Alpinada festival. There is a nominal fee for entering the park. Past the gate, the road continues 12 km to a small collection of buildings, including one newly renovated lodge. At the end of the road, up a trail to the left (East), lies the Ak-Sai Glacier, where remains of a Soviet climbing base indicate the high quality mountaineering within the park. The region's most famous peaks rise from the Ak-Sai glacier, including Korona Peak (4860m) and Free Korea Peak (4740m). To the west of Ala Archa Valley is a trail to the Adygene valley where a climbers' cemetery is located. A third main trail continues down the center of the Ala-Archa valley for 10 km to an old, now abandoned, ski area and numerous other 4000m peaks.

In 1952 he inherited the Scottish shipbuilding company, Lithgows, which was established by his grandfather, William Lithgow. At the time, it was the largest private shipbuilding concern in the world. Economic and political changes, especially the nationalisation of British shipbuilding in the 1970s, prevented Sir William from simply continuing the family business, and he therefore led it in new directions, including engineering, salmon farming and other marine and agricultural matters. He describes himself as an \\"industrialist and farmer\\". Since 1999 his son James has been chairman of the Lithgow Group, with Sir William as vice-chairman. Early life Sir William is the son of Sir James Lithgow, 1st Baronet, and Lady Lithgow, whose family homes were Gleddoch House, at Langbank on the Clyde, a few miles from their shipyards at Port Glasgow, and Ormsary, their country estate in Knapdale. He was educated at Winchester College, and is a Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. His father died when he was eighteen, and his mother acted as chairman of the family company until 1959.The Scotsman, 4 July 1999 In 1967 he married Mary Claire Hill and they have a daughter and two sons. Change of direction In the 1960s British shipbuilding was facing serious competition from the Far East, as well as other challenges. In the late 1960s a government enquiry into the UK shipbuilding industry led to a merger between Lithgows Ltd. and Scotts Shipbuilding & Engineering Co Ltd. of Greenock. This became Scott Lithgow Ltd. in 1970, but in 1977 the government nationalised the company under the control of the British Shipbuilders Corporation by the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977. Sir William and others involved challenged the amount of compensation they were offered and ended up taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights. The press reported his views about the wider implications of his experience, which he related to the Thatcher government's privatisation policies,\\"Lithgow warned that new shareholders might lose money in a future wave of re-nationalisation\\", The Financial Times, 9 July 1986 and the forthcoming expiry of the British lease on Hong Kong.\\"You can hardly expect Marxists in Peking to pay decent compensation for property rights, when the Government has pleaded that no such rights exist in Britain\\" (Lithgow quoted in The Financial Times, 9 July 1986) When he finally lost his legal battle in 1986 he told The Times that his claim had started as a \\"squalid argument about money\\" but had come to be about \\"fundamental property rights which are part of the basis of the free world\\".The Times, 9 July 1986 On other occasions he has expressed strong views publicly on subjects ranging from the importance of wealth creation to weaknesses in ferry services to the Scottish islands. After nationalisation Meanwhile, Lithgows was diversifying. In 1980 they moved into salmon farming through their subsidiary Landcatch. Their Campbeltown boatyard producing fishing vessels closed in 1997, but they still build fishing boats at Buckie in Moray. Engineering interests include firms producing off-road vehicles and rifles. Many of the conglomerate's interests are related to rural and coastal life, not least their land management and agricultural activities on the Ormsary estate and on the nearby Isle of Jura. Sir William says his hobbies are \\"rural life, invention and photography\\". The many public bodies on which he has served include some connected with shipbuilding and agriculture, and he also has links with Strathclyde University which made him an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) in 1979. He is a member of the Royal Company of Archers. In 1999, Sir William passed on the chairmanship to his son James, around the time of his 65th birthday. At the time, the press reported his belief that many of British shipbuilding's problems in the 1960s and 1970s could be attributed to government policies stemming from the Treasury.

The Mad Peck (born c. 1942 in New York City) is an American underground cartoonist, rock poster artist, and disc jockey. His most famous poster is a 1978 comic book-style poster that starts with the line, \\"Providence, Rhode Island, where it rains two days out of three except during the rainy season when it snows like a bitch.\\" The poster has been reprinted many times and is widely available for purchase throughout Rhode Island.  Biography  Raised in New York City, Peck attended Brown University beginning in 1960. Graduating from Brown in 1967, in the intervening years he also attended New York University and the Rhode Island School of Design. The Mad Peck created silkscreen concert posters for Rhode Island concerts from 1966 to 1971, for acts including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Band, and Cream. His \\"Final Appearance\\" Cream poster has been widely bootlegged. His comix work first appeared in 1969 in underground newspapers like the East Village Other and the Chicago Seed. Consisting mostly of manipulated clip art from old advertisements, his strips advertised items like \\"GIANT INHALER\\" and \\"FREE CIGARETTE PAPERS\\". Hippies and yippies would send five cents for one of his minicomic catalogs. This led to the weekly comic Burn of the Week, which was distributed by the Underground Press Syndicate and offered phoney endorsements of Wayne Newton albums next to bong-building tips. In the late 1960s/early 1970s Peck fell in with other Providence countercultural types, including writer Les Daniels and comedian Martin Mull. 1971, Peck illustrated Daniel's Comix: A History of Comic Books in America (Dutton), one of the first academic histories of the medium. By the mid 1970s, The Mad Peck was creating a regular comic which ran monthly in Creem, and also plugged products in a bizarre pop culture mish-mash similar to some of Bill Griffith's Zippy the Pinhead work. Averse to publicity or being photographed, the Mad Peck has also been known to DJ under the name \\"Dr. Oldie.\\" He is based in Providence, Rhode Island.

Yellowlees Douglas; June 25, 1962) is a pioneer author and scholar of hypertext fiction. She began writing about hypermedia in the late 1980s, very early in the development of the medium. Her 1993 fiction I Have Said Nothing, was one of the first published works of hypertext fiction. Early life and education Douglas was born June 25, 1962 in Detroit, Michigan. She did not have a first name apart from the initial 'J.' but found that it was misstated so often that she adopted \\"Jane' as her first name. She completed her undergraduate studies in English language and literature at the University of Michigan in 1982, where she went on to get an M.A in cinema and literary theory. She received her Ph.D. in English and education from New York University in 1992. Her Ph.D. dissertation, \\"Print pathways and interactive labyrinths: How hypertext narratives affect the act of reading,\\" was supervised by Gordon M. Pradl. She spent a year as a research fellow at Brunel University in London examining the ways in which hypertext affects the construction of digital technologies. Career In academia, Douglas has been the director of the program in professional writing and an assistant professor of English at Lehman College. She is presently Associate Professor of Management Communication in the Warrington College of Business Administration at the University of Florida. Douglas was a contestant on Jeopardy! on March 8, 2013. In interviews and forum postings about this experience, Douglas revealed that her godmother is the actress Maggie Smith. Writings Douglas has written over two dozen articles, short stories, and a book about the development, structure, and uses of hypertext. In a 1991 article—quite early in the development of hypertext as a new literary medium—she argued for hypertext as offering an alternative to an \\"either/or\\" view of reality in the form of an \\"and/and/and\\" structure. In her 2000 book, The End of Books or Books Without End, she examines how interactive fiction works and discusses the current state of hypertext criticism, arguing that hyptertext authors are the natural heirs of early 20th century experimental modernists like James Joyce. In \\"What Hypertexts Can Do That Print Narratives Cannot\\", Douglas goes into more detail about how hypertext fiction works as a literary form. Critics have noted acerbity as a characteristic of Douglas's writing as she \\"makes plain her frustration that hyperfiction works and their writers are still not considered part of the canon.\\" Douglas is recognized for having discovered a node in Michael Joyce's hypertext novel Afternoon: a story that had no inbound links. In discussions about the novel, the node became known as \\"Jane's space\\" because she was the first to remark on its orphan status. She became implicated in revisions to this node, which originally (1987 edition) featured only a single phrase from Jung, \\"Man... never perceives anything\\", but later (1990 edition) included a second line: \\"and only Jane Yellowlees Douglas has read this line\\". Douglas's hypertext fiction I Have Said Nothing is book-ended by two car crashes and the resulting deaths. Douglas's goal was to use the fragmentations of hypertext to explore both causality and the enormous gulfs that separate people from one another. Designed in Storyspace, the work offers readers a variety of strategies for navigation: a cognitive map, links in the text, a default narrative line, and a navigation menu of available paths.

The name of Siam Nakhon was later changed to Siem Reap in Cambodian. The capital city of the Khmer Empire in ancient times was declining in the 17th century. In the mid-fourteenth century, the Siamese or Thai speaking people, from Chao Phraya River plain, rose to power. The new Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya was founded and started expanding eastwards, towards Angkor. After years of internal strife in Angkor, Angkor was slowly in decline and there was in- fighting between the Khmers for the Angkorian throne. Eventually Angkor Thom was sacked and abandoned until the nineteenth century. Prior to the Franco- Thai Treaty of 1867, Siem Reap and Battambang provinces were ceded to Siam in 1795 by the Cambodian king, Ang Eng which in return was able to rule Cambodia without interference with Thai-backed Khmer officer, Aphaiphubet. The treaty only further verify the two provinces were part of Siam's proper in return for Siam renouncing suzerainty over the rest of Cambodia. Siem Reap city was under total Siamese control through a local Khmer family. The Siamese then called this province Siam Nakhon, (later known as Siemmarat), meaning \\"Siamese town.\\" At the beginning of the 20th century the province (along with Battambang) was in turn ceded back to Cambodia (now part of French Indochina) in the Franco- Siamese Treaty of 1907, due to the failure of 1904 version of treaty which the French accidentally annexed Thai speaking city of Trat. The French position being the former relationships of the court of Angkor to the Vietnamese (also a part of French Indochina), the history of Angkor as the capital of the Khmer empire and the French desire for the complete territorial integrity of French Indochina. For this reason, the French was able to exchange lands with Siam which the French squired the provinces of Siem Reap and Battambang while Siam gained both Trat and the district of Dan Sai. The province was renamed Siem Reap, which in Khmer means \\"Defeat of Siam\\", referring to the fact that the Siamese were no longer in control of the ancient Khmer capital of Angkor Thom and its temples, particularly Angkor Wat.

While the purpose of the festival remains a point of contention among both historians of religion and Assyriologists, it is certain to have played a pivotal role in the regular setting of an agenda, priorities, and in the overall advancement of western civilization as being one of the first regularly occurring forums where proposals for social maintenance or change could consistently be made and crucial issues readily addressed.The Babylonian Akitu Festival: Rectifying the King or Renewing the Cosmos? (n.d.): n. pag. Web.Einführung in die Altorientalistik The name is from the Sumerian for \\"barley\\", originally marking two festivals celebrating the beginning of each of the two half-years of the Sumerian calendar, marking the sowing of barley in autumn and the cutting of barley in spring. In Babylonian religion it came to be dedicated to Marduk's victory over Tiamat. Babylonian Akitu The Babylonian festival traditionally started on 4 Nisannu.https://www.livius.org/articles/religion/akitu/ All the people in the city would celebrate, including the awilu (upper class), muskena (middle class), wardu (lower class), High Priest, and the King.The Babylonian Akitu Festival by Svend Aage Pallis Review by: S. S.The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland , No. 4 (Oct., 1927) , pp. 895-897. First to Third Day  The priest of Ésagila (Marduk's house) would recite sad prayers with the other priests and the people would answer with equally sad prayers which expressed humanity's fear of the unknown. This fear of the unknown explains why the high priest would head to the Ésagila every day asking for Marduk's forgiveness, begging him to protect Babylon, his holy city, and asking him to have favor on the city. This prayer was called \\"The Secret Of Ésagila\\". It reads as followed: On the third day special craftsmen would create two puppets made of wood, gold, and precious stones and dress them in red. These puppets were set aside and would be used on the sixth day.Gard, Carolyn. \\"Akitu The Babylonian New Year's Festival.\\" Calliope 11.3 (2000): 36. MAS Ultra - School Edition. Fourth Day The same rituals would be followed as in the previous three days. Before the sunrise the priests looked for the sacred star group IKU (“Field”). During the day the Epic of Creation Enuma Elish would be recited. The Enuma Elish is most likely the oldest story concerning the birth of the gods and the creation of the universe and human beings. It then explains how all the gods united in the god Marduk, following his victory over Tiamat. The recitation of this Epic was considered the beginning of preparations for the submission of the King of Babylon before Marduk on the fifth day of Akitu. During the night a drama was performed that praised Marduk as well. Fifth Day The submission of the king of Babylon before Marduk. The king would enter to the Esagila accompanied by the priests, they would approach all together the altar where the high priest of the Esagila impersonates Marduk then he approaches the king, begins to strip him of his jewelry, scepter and even his crown then he would slap him hard while the altar would kneel and begins to pray asking for Marduk's forgiveness and submitting to him saying: Then the priest in the role of Marduk says: The removal of all worldly possessions is a symbol of the submission the king gives to Marduk. After this the king would stand up and the priest would give him back his jewelry, scepter and crown then slaps him hard again hoping for the king to shed tears, because that would express more the submission to Marduk and respect to his power. When the priest returns the crown to the king that means his power was renewed by Marduk, thus April would be considered not only the revival of nature and life but also to the State as well. Thus, these ceremonies would make the greatest and most feared personalities of that time submit to the greatest god, and live a humbling moment with all the population, sharing prayers to prove their faith before the might of God. Following his presence in his earthly home Babylon and renewing its king's power, god Marduk stays in the Etemenanki (a ziggurat or tower composed of seven floors was Marduk's dwelling or in the temple Esagila. During this day according to the tradition of Akitu, Marduk would enter his dwelling and is surprised by the evil gods who will fight him, then he's taken prisoner by Tiamat, the chaos monster and goddess of the ocean, and awaits for arrival of his son god Nabu who would save him from \\"Nought\\" and restore his glory. Sixth Day Before the gods arrived, the day would be filled with commotion. The puppets that were made on the third day would be burned and mock battle would be taking place as well. This commotion signified that without Marduk, the city would be in constant chaos.\\"Middle Eastern religion\\". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2014. Web. The arrival of God Nabu in boats accompanied by his assistants of brave Gods coming from Nippur, Uruk, Kish, and Eridu (cities ancient Babylonia). The Gods accompanying Nabu would be represented by statues which would be mounted on boats made especially for the occasion. Here the people in huge numbers would begin their walk behind their king towards the Esagila where Marduk is held prisoner, chanting the following : Seventh Day On the third day of his imprisonment Nabu frees Marduk. The evil gods had closed a huge gate behind him when he entered his dwelling. Marduk would be fighting till Nabu's arrival, when he would break in the huge gate and a battle would go on between the two groups, until Nabu comes out victorious and frees Marduk. Eighth Day When Marduk is set free, the statues of the gods are gathered in the Destinies Hall \\"Ubshu-Ukkina\\", to deliberate his destiny, there it is decided to join all the forces of the gods and bestow them upon Marduk. Here, the king implores all the gods to support and honor Marduk, and this tradition was an indication that Marduk received submission from all the gods and was unique in his position. Ninth Day The victory procession to the \\"House of Akitu\\" where Marduk's victory in the beginning of Creation over the dragon Tiamat (goddess of the nether waters) is celebrated. The House of Akitu which the Assyrians of Nineveh called \\"Bet Ekribi\\" (“House of Prayers” in old Assyrian language), was about 200 meters outside the city's walls, where there were wonderful trees decorated and watered carefully out of respect to the god who's considered the one to grant nature its life. The victory procession was the population's way to express its joy at Marduk's (Ashur) renewal of power and the destruction of evil forces which almost controlled life in the beginning. Tenth Day Arriving at \\"Bet Akitu\\", god Marduk begins to celebrate with both the upper and nether world gods (the statues of gods were arranged around a huge table such as in a feast) then Marduk returns to the city at night celebrating his marriage to goddess \\"Ishtar\\" where earth and heaven are united, and as the gods unite so is this union arranged on earth. Thus the king personifies this union by playing the role of marrying the highest priestess of the Esagila where they would both sit at the throne before the population and they recite special poems for the occasion. This love is going to bring forth life in spring. Eleventh Day The gods return accompanied by their Lord Marduk to meet again in the Destinies Hall \\"Upshu Ukkina\\", where they met for the first time on the eighth day, this time they will decide the fate of the people of Marduk. In ancient Assyrian philosophy Creation in general was considered as a covenant between heaven and earth as long as a human serves the gods till his death, therefore, gods' happiness isn't complete except if humans are happy as well, thus a human's destiny will be to be given happiness on the condition that he serves the gods. So Marduk and the gods renew their covenant with Babylon, by promising the city another cycle of seasons. After the fate of mankind is decided, Marduk returns to the heavens. Twelfth Day The last day of Akitu. The gods return to Marduk's temple (the statues are returned to the temple) and daily life resumes in Babylon, Nineveh, and the rest of the Assyrian cities. The people begin to plow and prepare for another cycle of seasons. Legacy The festival was also adopted in the Neo-Assyrian Empire following the destruction of Babylon. King Sennacherib in 683 BC built an \\"Akitu house\\" outside the walls of Assur. Another Akitu house was built outside Nineveh.Ali Yaseen Ahmad and A.

At the beginning of the 3rd century, it was still celebrated in Emessa, Syria, in honour of the god Elagabal. The Roman emperor Elagabalus (r. 218-222), who was of Syrian origin, even introduced the festival in Italy (Herodian, Roman History, 5.6).

Sibongiseni was born in Ladysmith (eMnambithi district) to Joseph and his late wife Nellie, just shortly after the release of the group's first album Amabutho. In 1976, Joseph brought together his six sons to form Mshengu White Mambazo, Ladysmith's 'junior choir'. After the murder of his uncle Headman Shabalala in December 1991 and the retirement of several other members (Inos Phungula, Geophrey Mdletshe and Ben Shabalala), Joseph later recruited Sibongiseni and his brothers Thamsanqa, Thulani and Msizi. Sibongiseni began singing with Mambazo as a bass voice and has remained in the line-up since 1993. Together with his brother Thamsanqa and a well-known South African guitarist Maqhinga Radebe, Sibongiseni formed the maskandi-mbaqanga- isicathamiya crossover band Shabalala Rhythm in 1998, which has released successful releases to date including Ubuhle Bakho (2003) and Vuma (2005).

The Popular center of remembrance (Centro Popular de la Memoria) is a former illegal detention center in Rosario, . It was used by the provincial police between 1976 and 1979, during the Dirty War, to hold people with no formal charges and torture them, under the pretense of fighting radical left-wing political subversion and terrorism. Most of the detainees were in fact social activists, political dissidents, or merely relatives or acquaintances of people that were ideologically suspect in the eyes of the military junta of the self-styled National Reorganization Process. The CPM occupies a corner of a large building that takes up a whole block in the city center, between Dorrego and Moreno and between Santa Fe and Córdoba St. It used to be the police headquarters, and during the Dirty War it was formally the home of an intelligence division of the provincial police (Servicio de Informaciones de la Unidad Regional II). There is evidence of its use as a detention center since 1976 and until 1979. It was informally termed El Pozo (\\"The Pit\\") and La Favela (\\"The Favela\\"). The head of the Intelligence Service at the time was Gendarmería Commander Agustín Feced, who sometimes took part personally in kidnappings, torture sessions and executions. Two of his foremost collaborators were José Rubén Lo Fiego, who are being investigated since 2004. After the fall of the last military junta and the return to democracy in 1983, the building continued to serve its official functions, until 2001, when human rights organizations demanded that it be preserved. On 2001-03-22 the Ministry of Government of the province of Santa Fe dictated Resolution No. 0060 to fulfill this request. The official facilities were dismantled and the police headquarters were moved elsewhere. A part of the building was given to municipal control, another one was turned into a delegation of the provincial government, and the central courtyard became an open public square. The relevant sections were granted to a group of human rights organizations by Decree No. 0717 of 2002-05-09 with the name of Centro Popular de la Memoria. It now hosts a memorial exhibition managed by relatives of victims of forced disappearance. A documentary film about the CPM was released, with the support of a local producer (Calanda Producciones). It includes the story of the investigation and recovery of the detention center as a memorial, and testimonies of the research team and some survivors.

There is also near St Sauveur's church, dating from the 15th century. In 768, the French king Pepin the Short offered the village of Maurepas (formerly spelled Malrepast) and its wooden keep to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. Facing the Normans' invasions, they left the domain to the Lords of Chevreuse. The castle and village were given to the family of Malrepast, a vassal of the Lords of Chevreuse, which gave its name to the village. In 1432, during the Hundred Years' War, the English conquered the village and destroyed the keep. After the war, the domain of Maurepas returned to the family of Chevreuse, but the castle remained a ruin. Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux from the Phélypeaux family, was Count of Maurepas.

If a person has borrowed from the same bank a home loan secured by the house, a car loan secured by the car, and so on, these assets can be used as cross-collaterals for all the loans. If the person pays off the car loan and wants to sell the car, the bank may veto the deal because the car is still used to secure the home loan and other loans. Technically, cross-collateralization expires when the borrower has no outstanding loans with the bank. In the context of bankruptcy, cross- collateralization also means the collateralization of general unsecured prepetition debt by collateral securing postpetition loans. Another example of cross-collateralization occurs when an individual may have a checking account and a loan at the same bank. If the individual becomes past due on the loan, the financial institution may take money out of the bank account or freeze the account until the loan becomes current. Because cross-collateralization reduces the lender's risk, credit unions often offer cross-collateralized loans as a way to give borrowers lower interest rates. Royalty advances paid by a publisher to authors of multiple books or to creators of multiple video games are often cross-collateralized; in book publishing this is sometimes called \\"basketing\\". In this scheme, the publisher pays no royalty checks to the creator until all of the books (or video games, or other works of authorship) have \\"earned out\\" their advances.Royalties, Joe Konrath. \\"A Newbie's Guide to Publishing\\".

Her coach, Liz Kincaid, said, \\"Imogen was vaulting with a wrist support on and noticed during her hurdle step that the support had come undone. She tried to pull up and crashed into the vault and broke her ankle.\\" These injuries caused Cairns to miss the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.  2008  In April, Cairns placed fifth on vault at the World Cup event in Maribor, Slovenia, with a score of 13.775. After the event, she said, \\"I know internationally most people thought I had retired. Sorry, got me for a little while longer! Even in Great Britain, people thought I had finished.

She said, \\"I rolled both my ankles—the bones weren't snapped, but everything else was. I was out for at least eighteen months with that injury. I had drilling of the bone, two operations on each ankle, and I couldn't walk properly for six months. Ever since, they've been good, but they will never be great. Every now and then they are too painful and I can't train. I have to have injections to numb my ankles, and I've been told I'll have arthritis in them by the time I'm 30.\\"  2009  Cairns decided to return to training in 2009. She said, \\"I thought about quitting because I was out for so long. I put on a bit of weight and got my social life back and I thought, 'This is it.'

Having been through the highs of the Olympics and lows of injury, I can honestly say I now take things step by step. I learn from successes and setbacks, and put these to good use. I think I've matured, and I set myself personal goals.\\" At the beginning of October, Cairns competed for England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. She contributed an all-around score of 53.500 towards the English team's second-place finish. In the all- around final, she placed fourth with a score of 54.650. \\"One year ago, I didn't think I'd be able to train again,\\" she said. \\"I think I was only just getting back to walking.

Founded in the 11th century by the Khmer Empire, Battambang is the leading rice-producing province of the country. For nearly 100 years it was a major commercial hub and provincial capital of Siamese province of Inner Cambodia (1795-1907), though it was always populated by Khmer, with some ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. Battambang remains the hub of Cambodia's northwest, connecting the region with Phnom Penh and Thailand. The city is situated on the Sangkae River, a tranquil, small body of water that winds its way picturesquely through Battambang Province. As with much of Cambodia, French Colonial architecture is a notable aspect of the city, with some of the best- preserved examples in the country. Now the government and Ministry of Culture and Fine Art are preparing documents to nominate The Old Town of Battambang in the list of UNESCO world heritage site along with The Old Town of Kampot and The Old Town of Kratie since 2017. History Battambang was established as an important trading city with around 2,500 residents in the 18th century. The population was centred along a single road parallel to the Sangkae River (Stung Sangkae). In 1795 Siam (modern-day Thailand) annexed much of north western Cambodia including the current provinces of Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Oddar Meanchey, Pailin, and Siem Reap into the province of Inner Cambodia. The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer Abhaiwongse family, a branch of the Khmer royal family, which governed for six generations until 1907 when the province was ceded to the French to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the French Indochina colony. Following colonization by the French, an urban layout was developed which resulted in an enlarged French colonial town. This first attempt at modernization resulted in well-defined streets laid in a grid pattern, building of urban structures and three main streets parallel to the Sangkae River, and the linking of both banks by the construction of two bridges in 1917. Military and prison facilities were also erected. Nineteen years later, a second urban development plan was implemented with a newly constructed railway linking Battambang to Phnom Penh. The urban structures were extended to the west of the town creating urban hubs oriented around the railway station. The large residential villas and public buildings built during this period of French development significantly changed the landscape of the previously remote city. A subsequent third urban development plan for Battambang involved the north, east and south of the city. This vast undertaking, which required long-term planning to integrate all of the previous work, resulted in a modern provincial capital that was by far the most developed region of Cambodia outside of Phnom Penh. Much later, more infrastructure and public facilities were built under the modernization program of the Cambodian government led by Prince Sihanouk. Several provincial departments, a court house and other public buildings were added on both sides of the river. Textile and garment factories were built by French and Chinese investors, the Battambang Airport was constructed, and the railway line was extended to the Thai border at Poipet. To serve the cultural needs of the population, numerous schools and a university were built as well as a sports centre, museum and an exhibition hall.

It can be reached by traveling from the provincial town by the provincial road No 155, which runs parallel to the Sangker River. In the valley, there is Ku Teuk and two main natural wells, namely: Bit Meas and Chhung or Chhung Achey. Norry (Bamboo Train) The Norry, or bamboo train, runs from Prasat Banan to Chhoeuteal commune. Previously located on actual railway tracks outside the city, the bamboo train was relocated in 2017 to make way for the resumption of railway traffic. Prasat Snung Characterized by three separated stupas made of brick, located on a hill long and wide, in Snung pagoda's area, Snung commune, Banan District from the provincial town. According to the style at the gate, the temple is similar to other temples in 12th century. Behind the temple, there is another new temple being built. Phnom Sampov Is a natural resort located along the National Road No 57 (the former National Road No10) at Sam Puoy commune (the high land more than high) and from the provincial town of Battambang. On the top of Sam Puoy mountain, there is a temple and three natural wells, namely Pkar Slar, Lo Khuon and Ak Sopheak. Next to Sam Puoy mountain, there are some mountains, and natural sites like Phnom Trung Moan, Phnom Trung Tea and Phnom Neang Rum Say Sork. These mountains relate to the Cambodia folk legend of Reach Kol Neang Rum Say Sork. Sek Sak Resort A natural resort which has been popular since before the civil war, Sek Sak stretches along the river bank with plants, trees and bamboo stretching in length. Tourists can also visit other attractive sites like Po Pus Pich Chen Da Dong Tong and Sa Ang speak, the pre-history site five kilometers (3.1 mi) to six kilometers (3.75 mi) away. Sek Sak located Treng commune, Rotanak Mondul District from the provincial town of Battambang along the National Road No 57, the former National Road No 10. Battambang Circus (Phare Ponleu Selpak) The shows include a range of circus disciplines including acrobatics, juggling, aerial work, clowning, tightrope walking and aqua-balance. It gives performances every Monday and Thursday evening. The shows are put on by students from the NGO arts school, Phare Ponleu Selpak that helps disadvantaged children and young people escape from situations connected with poverty such as begging or trafficking and to get an education, both in normal public school and in the arts. Bahá'í House of Worship Around south of Battambang, in Odambang commune, stands the city's Bahá'í House of Worship. Inaugurated in 2017, it is notable for being one of the first Bahá'í temples to be built to serve a single locality, and the first local Bahá'í house of worship to be constructed. The round, nine-sided edifice features a central dome and spire, and winged parapets that have been called reminiscent of Phnom Penh's Chaktomuk Conference Hall. Transportation The main means of reaching the city is via buses from Bangkok, Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. The airport has been used as a public park, but in 2018 it was decided to use it as an airport again for small airplanes and helicopters. The passenger rail service has been recently restored. There is also (except during the lowest water levels of the dry season) a daily boat connection between Battambang and Siem Reap via the Sangkae River. Since the buses are faster and cheaper, the scenic trip is nowadays used mainly by tourists and some locals who live along the river.

He replaced Joseph as the group's lead singer after his father's retirement in 2014 (see main article for more information). Thamsanqa was born in Ladysmith (eMnambithi district) to Joseph and his late wife Nellie. In 1976, Joseph brought together his six sons to form Mshengu White Mambazo, Ladysmith's 'junior choir'. After the murder of his uncle Headman Shabalala in December 1991 and the retirement of several other members (Inos Phungula, Geophrey Mdletshe and Ben Shabalala), Joseph later recruited Thamsanqa and his brothers Sibongiseni, Thulani and Msizi. Thamsanqa began singing with the group as an alto voice (alongside Albert Mazibuko, who is a tenor voice) and has remained in the line-up since 1993. Together with his brother Sibongiseni and a well- known South African guitarist, Maqhinga Radebe, Thamsanqa formed the maskandi- mbaqanga-isicathamiya crossover band Shabalala Rhythm in 1998, which has released successful releases to date including Ubuhle Bakho (2003), Vuma (2005), and Izingqaku (2007). It was announced by Joseph Shabalala in January 2008 that when he retires, Thamsanqa will take over as leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Joseph Shabalala retired in 2014.

Early life and education Gunn was born at 19 Kelvinside Gardens East, Glasgow, the son of Richard Robertson Gunn, a tailor and clothier, and his wife, Jane Blair, née Currie. Gunn attended Glasgow Academy school and subsequently studied at Glasgow University where he was awarded the Logan Prize as Best Arts Student of the Year in 1937. He graduated with a degree in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Gunn went on to further study at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he conducted research in theoretical physics. His research led him to the development of counter and firing systems for mines, which were used during World War II. As a scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge, he completed Parts II and III of the Mathematics Tripos examinations. Career Just before World War II began, Gunn worked for three months with the thermodynamicist R.H. Fowler. He worked in the Admiralty scientific service from 1940 to 1945. He was part of a team of scientists and engineers led by Harrie Massey based first at Teddington, and then at the Admiralty Mining Establishment attached to HMS Vernon at Portsmouth. He was involved in researching countermeasures against German magnetic mines and in the development of a range of British non-contact mines. The team included many young physicists who would go on to make major scientific contributions, among them Francis Crick. In 1943, while still working at the Admiralty, Gunn was elected to a Research Fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge, but after the war he chose instead to accept a Lectureship in Applied Mathematics at Manchester University. There he worked with Professor Sydney Goldstein, a mathematician noted for his contribution to fluid dynamics, and wrote papers on supersonic flow and turbulence. In 1946, Gunn became a Lecturer in Professor Harrie Massey's department in University College London, where he carried out research in nuclear and particle physics. During his three years at University College London, his focus shifted from classical applied mathematics to the quantum mechanical subjects of nuclear physics and particle physics. Gunn then went to work at Glasgow University, where the Natural Philosophy Department, under its new chairman, Philip Dee, was branching out into nuclear physics. (The name \\"Natural Philosophy\\" was later retired, and Gunn became a Professor of Physics and Astronomy.) Dee wished to turn Glasgow University into a leading centre of expertise in nuclear and particle physics. This development provided Gunn with an opportunity to explore his newfound interest in those subjects. He was appointed to the Cargill Chair in Applied Physics in 1949. The Chair had been founded in 1920 and endowed by Sir John Traill Cargill of the Burmah Oil Co. Gunn would hold the Chair until 1982. During his time at Glasgow University, Gunn collaborated with Edwin Power, who had been his student at University College, and Bruno Touschek, a physicist from Germany, to produce mesons in proton collisions. This work helped marked the establishment of the field of particle physics. With Professor Philip Dee, Gunn received funding for nuclear physics research, which allowed him and his colleagues to build a linear electron accelerator. After Touschek moved to Rome, Italy, in 1953, Gunn collaborated with John Irving on the photodisintegration of light nuclei, which later became known as \\"Gunn-Irving wave functions\\". Later, Gunn played a notable part in the development of the electron accelerator at Daresbury in northern England, and helped arrange for the construction of a linear electron accelerator near Glasgow. Radiation from accelerating electrons at Daresbury proved to have a multitude of practical applications. He also actively supported the Glasgow Project, which sought to detect cosmic gravity waves. This project has been described as giving \\"much of the early impetus to international work in this field.” He also was active in recruiting members of \\"three distinct theoretical research groups\\" at Glasgow University, \\"one of which remained active into the twenty-first century.\\" Gunn retired from his position as Professor of Natural Philosophy and Cargill chairman in 1982. Gunn died of pneumonia and heart failure at Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, on 26 July 2002, and his funeral service was held at the University Chapel, Glasgow University, on 2 August. Other professional activities In 1968, Gunn became a member of the Science Research Council, and was its chairman from 1970 to 1972. It was during his period as chairman that the British government agreed to take part in the CERN project in Geneva, which proved critical to the development of European particle physics. He became a member of Glasgow University's Grants Committee in 1973 and was Chairman of its Equipment Sub-committee until 1976. From 1976 to 1981, he was Chairman of the university's Physical Sciences sub-committee. He was Vice-Principal of Glasgow University from 1972 till 1977 and Dean of Faculties from 1988 to 1992. Honors and awards Upon graduation from Cambridge, Gunn was awarded the Mayhew Prize in applied mathematics. Gunn was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1959. In the Queen's Birthday Honours 1976 Gunn was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and in the New Year Honours 1982 was appointed a Knight Bachelor. In 1985 he was awarded the Glazebrook Medal by the Institute of Physics. Gunn was awarded an honorary D.Sc. (Doctor of Science) by Glasgow in 2001. He also had honorary D.Sc. degrees from Heriot-Watt and Loughborough, and an honorary D. Univ. from Oxford. Personal life and attributes On 30 September 1944, he married Betty Russum (1919/20–2002), a secretary, who was the daughter of Roger Russum, a brush manufacturer. She predeceased him by only six months. They had one son, Michael, born 1954, who became a theoretical physicist and a professor at Birmingham University, a daughter-in-law, Nicola, and a granddaughter, Eva. Gunn was an avid lunchtime chess player and a lifelong cello player and concertgoer, He is described as having \\"a great love of music\\" and as being \\"a keen golfer\\" who \\"displayed little interest in other sports.\\" \\"In personal interaction, alertly clever, he had a comprehension of others,\\" according to one colleague. \\"Mingling in the Department and University he had humour and lively and persistent conversation. From 1972 to 1982 he was the benevolent Head of a remarkably happy Department.\\"  References  * * Moorhouse, Gordon (2002). Sir John Currie Gunn (Obituary). The Royal Society of Edinburgh.

He was the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes in 2002. Background War Emblem was bred by Charles Nuckols Jr. & Sons in Kentucky. His sire was Our Emblem, a stakes placed son of leading sire Mr. Prospector and the undefeated mare Personal Ensign. War Emblem's dam was Sweetest Lady by Lord At War. Often described as nearly black, he was registered as dark bay or brown colt with a white star. In the 2000 Keeneland September Yearling Sale, he failed to meet his reserve of $20,000 so raced under the colors of Russell Reineman, who had owned the colt's dam. Initially, he was trained by Frank Springer. Described as narcissistic, War Emblem was a temperamental horse who did not like people nor other horses: Bob Baffert nicknamed the colt 'Hannibal Lecter' for his habit of biting. He had a history of bone chips in his knees and ankles, which discouraged several potential buyers. He liked to race at the front of the field, but sometimes compromised his own chances by acting up in the starting gate. Racing career As a two- year-old, War Emblem won his first start, but then finished seventh when entered in the Manila Stakes. He rebounded with a win in an allowance race to finish 2001 with a record of two wins from three starts. His three-year-old campaign started poorly, with a fifth place in the Lecomte Stakes and a sixth- place finish in the Risen Star, both at Fair Grounds Race Course. He returned to form with a length win in an allowance race at Sportsman's Park, then won the Illinois Derby by lengths in wire-to-wire fashion. Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia bought a ninety percent interest in War Emblem for a reported $1 million just three weeks before the Kentucky Derby. Victor Espinoza was his jockey for the 2002 Kentucky Derby, never having seen the horse until the morning of the race. War Emblem, who went off at 21-to-1 odds, took the early lead and sent sensible early fractions, then kicked away from the field in the stretch. He won the race in a fast time of 2:01.13. It was the first Kentucky Derby win for new owner Salman and the third for new trainer Bob Baffert. War Emblem beat the likes of Medaglia d'Oro (winner of the Travers Stakes, Jim Dandy Stakes, and Whitney Handicap, among others); Perfect Drift (winner of the Stephen Foster, the Indiana Derby, and the Washington Park Handicap twice, among others); and Harlan's Holiday (winner of the Florida Derby, the Pennsylvania Derby, and the Donn Handicap among others). In the 2002 Preakness Stakes, War Emblem rated just behind the leaders who set a fast pace, went to the lead on the far turn and held off a late rally by Magic Weisner. With a Triple Crown at stake, the Belmont Stakes on June 8 attracted the biggest crowd in the track's history with 103,222 spectators. War Emblem stumbled and nearly fell to his knees coming out of the gate, then bumped into another horse, losing several lengths in the process. He then struggled with Espinoza who tried to rate the colt down the backstretch. War Emblem surged to the lead in the final turn before fading at the top of the stretch: The winner was 70-1 long-shot Sarava. It was the third time Baffert had lost the Belmont with a Triple Crown at stake: He had previously lost with Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998. Baffert later said, \\"He was so one-dimensional and such an irritable horse as it was, as soon as he was behind horses, I had to sit there for 2½ minutes waiting for the race to be over.\\" War Emblem returned to the track on August 4 as the favorite in the Haskell Invitational Handicap and won easily by lengths. Baffert said, \\"You forget how good this horse is. From now on we're just going to let him run the way he wants. If he were one of those wild horses in the herd, he'd be the top dog. Like 'The Black Stallion', you don't want to break that spirit.\\" He became the first horse to win the Kentucky Derby and Haskell. War Emblem then traveled to California for the Pacific Classic on August 25 at Del Mar against older horses. He broke poorly but quickly settled into second place and seemed to be running well. However, he tired coming into the stretch and finished sixth. In his final start at Arlington Park on October 26, he finished eighth in the Breeders' Cup Classic. War Emblem finished his career with seven wins from 13 starts and earnings of $3,491,000. In his six losses, he finished no better than fifth. He received the Eclipse Award for champion three-year-old colt of 2002 and was a distant runner-up to Azeri in the Horse of the Year voting. Career as a sire In September 2002, War Emblem was sold to the prominent Yoshida racing family of Japan for US$17.7 million to stand at stud at their renowned Shadai Stallion Station in Shiraoi, Hokkaido. Expected to follow in the footsteps of Shadai's great sires Northern Taste and Sunday Silence, War Emblem did not fulfill those expectations in the breeding shed. \\"We know he is fertile, but he has no interest in mares\\", said Dr. Nubuo Tsunoda, the farm's director. For his first year at stud in 2003, only four foals were produced in 2004. His second year was more successful, resulting in nineteen colts and fifteen fillies born in 2005. However, his third crop born in 2006 consisted of only four colts and one filly. In the next two years, War Emblem rejected nearly every mare presented to him so no foals were produced in 2007 and 2008. On June 8, 2008, War Emblem was evaluated by a stallion behavior team from the University of Pennsylvania. They suggested that he should be separated from other stallions to help improve his breeding behavior. The measures seemed to help War Emblem in the 2009 breeding season, with a career record of 43 foals born in 2010. However, War Emblem reverted to his old habits in 2010, only covering five of 300 mares presented to him in the season. In 2012, he covered only three mares, none of whom became pregnant. In total, he sired only 106 registered foals between 2004 and 2011. Although War Emblem only sired a total of 119 foals, his progeny proved quite successful on a percentage basis, with 80 winners from 111 starters and combined progeny earnings of $35,300,307. His last foal was born in 2012. He was represented by his first career stakes winner in 2008 when Shonan Alba (Xianlang (IRE), by Great Commotion) won the Kyodo News Service Hai, an 1,800 meter listed race on Tokyo Race Course's turf course. Nearly a month later, the filly Air Pascale (Raffica, by Sunday Silence) scored in the listed Tulip Sho at Hashin Race Course. On March 22, another filly, Black Emblem (Vin de Noir, by Hector Protector), became War Emblem's first classic winner with an odds-on victory in the Shuka Sho, the final leg of the Japanese Fillies' Triple Crown. Black Emblem later became dam of two stakes winners, Bright Emblem and Testament. War Emblem's most successful offspring was Robe Tissage, who was the champion two-year-old filly in Japan in 2012. He also sired Group 3 winners King's Emblem and War Tactics, and stakes winners Civil War, Danon Programmer, and Clan Emblem. His son, Civil War, was sent to stud. Due to initial fears he would exhibit his sire's habits in the breeding shed, a special \\"conception confirmation\\"-clause was issued. At first year, Civil War covered 62 mares. Retirement and death Fall 2015 saw War Emblem pensioned from stallion duty and repatriated to the United States, where he was sent to live at Old Friends Equine Retirement in Georgetown, Kentucky. Although he was not going to be used at stud, USDA regulations required that all stallions imported to the U.S. be tested for contagious equine metritis via test-breeding two mares. After a month in quarantine at the Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital, War Emblem declined breeding with any mares presented to him, and in order to keep him in the United States, the only remaining option was to geld him. The operation was a success with a full recovery by War Emblem at the age of 17 in 2016. War Emblem was found dead in his paddock at Old Friends Equine on March 11, 2020 at the age of 21. The cause of death was later found to be a ruptured small intestine.

Formed in 1994 as the Farum Lions, the team played their first season of DAFL Premier League 1995 finishing 2nd, after losing the grand final. The next year, the team, called Farum Lions at the time, won the DAFL Premier League. The team has won a total of 8 premierships, aside from 1996, they've also won 2005, 2006, 2007, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014. They are the only team to win four premierships in a row. The team changed names from the Farum Lions to the Farum Cats after an agreement with AFL club Geelong Cats. In 2015, the club changed name from Farum Cats Australsk Fodboldklub to Farum Australsk Fodbold to be more modern and to indicate that the club now runs two different teams. Participation The Farum Cats (and Lions) have competed in the DAFL Premier League every year since 1995. They have also hosted the Farum Local League (later North Zealand Australian Football League) and fielded two teams for the DAFL Sjælland 9's league every year. In 2004 the team fielded both Farum Cats and Farum Lions for the DAFL Premier League and in 2008, they fielded both Farum Cats and the majority of Værløse Bulldogs, a team meant for players playing the national team, but which was unsupported by most of the players from other clubs. The bulldogs folded halfway through the season. Lions (1995–2001) In 1994 Jim Campion played for the Copenhagen Crocs, but decided to start his own club in Farum where he lived. The club was named Farum Lions after the Fitzroy moniker Lions, as their guernseys spelled FFC on the front, matching Farum Football Club, as well as the jumpers matching the colors of Farum BK. The club played well in 1995 and reached the Grand Final, but lost the game to Amager Tigers. In 1996, the Lions won the Grand Final against Helsingborg. Cats (2002–2012) In 2002 the club changed their name to Farum Cats after reaching an agreement with the Geelong Cats, the favourite club of founder Jim Campion. On March 1, 2012 the club officially changed their name from Farum Australsk Fodboldklub (English: Farum Australian Football Club) to Farum Cats Australsk Fodboldklub, after using the name for several years. The club has won four premierships as the Cats, all of the times they've had exchange students from the Geelong College playing for them (usually two, but in 2011 only 1). The years as the Cats started out as the years of the Lions had ended, though they won the first game of the year, against the Aalborg Kangaroos, however this was one of only two games the club won that year, and they ended up second last, only better than wooden spooners Helsingborg Saints, who had an abysmal season, finishing with -4 point In 2003, Farum came out of their finals drought (the longest and only in the history of the club, 01-02) After being nearly unbeatable in the newly founded Sjælland Conference, but striking out in the semi final against later premiers Amager Tigers. In 2004, they split up, forming the Farum Cats, and reviving the Farum Lions. Many of the young players from the junior programme plays for both teams and Morten Engsbye plays his 50th game before he turns eighteen. Only the Cats reach the finals, and in the Grand Final against the NC Cudas, they manage to kick more goals than the opposition. However, they kick 10 behinds less, and finish up losers by just 4 points, after a 5-goal last quarter by Mikkel Norlander. In 2005 the team started an exchange programme with the Geelong College getting 2 players for the duration of the DAFL, these are Rhys Bennet and David Burns-Wallace. The year ends in triumph for the Cats, as they claim their second overall premiership, and David Burns-Wallace wins Best on Ground in the grand final, even though playing most of it with a broken wrist. This was the first of the Farum back to back to back premiership run. The year after, the team is joined by Scott Williams and Scott Witham and they continue the trend of only losing one game of the year. Again, the Beston Ground in the Grand Final is a Geelong boy, this time it's Scott Williams. In 2007, the names of the Geelong boys were John Bailey and Steen Balodis, and they continue the trend of dominating in the DAFL, as Farum claims their third premiership in a row. Mikkel Norlander is leading goalkicker in DAFL and Mikkel Højgård is best 1st year player. David O'Sullivan, another Australian of Farum, is crowned Best on Ground in the Grand Final, crowning of a great year for the Cats. In 2008, the Cats have to cancel the Geelong boys due to lack of funds, and furthermore, the team splits up in the younger Farum Cats, and the better Værløse Bulldogs, a team supposed to be used to bring together the boys for the National Team. However, this team is mostly unsupported by the national players of the other teams, and as a result, a lot of the newly promoted juniors has to play 2 games each weekend - for the second time in 5 years. Halfway through the season Værløse is doing great, while Farum is struggling in last position, and the club decides to fold the Værløse team. Amazingly, after winning the remainder of their games, the Cats goes to the Finals, and end up in the Grand final against Barracudas in Copenhagen. But that is where the fairy tale story ends, as the Cats go down to the Cudas, and finishes runners up. As a result of the split up, the 2 players to play the most DAFL games this year is Nathan Campion and Simon Malone. Cats and Giants (2013-present) Before the 2013 season, DAFL changed the format of the competition from 16 aside to 12 aside. For this reason, Farum Cats decided to split up in two teams; Farum Cats, consisting mostly of players residing in Farum and FC Demons, consisting mostly of players who had moved away from Farum. After a good inaugural home and away season, the Demons entered the finals series placed second, but went down to Port Malmö Maulers in the Qualifying Final. In the Preliminary Final, they again lost, this time to the Cats, who had beaten Helsingborg Saints away from home after finishing the home and away season fourth. The Cats went on to win the Grand Final at Limhamnsfältet in Malmö, bringing home the club's second triple premiership. In 2014 the Demons had none of their glory from 2013, forfeiting no less than half their games, and finishing 5th only above new club Odense. The Cats, however, went through to the Qualifying final by finishing second in the home and away season, again beaten only by Port Malmö. And again, the team from Farum went down in the QF meaning that the Grand Final would be played in Malmö again. The Cats beat Helsingborg in the Preliminary Final, and everything pointed towards another close GF between Port Malmö and Farum Cats. The Cats thought otherwise, and finished impressively, winning the GF 19.12 (126) to 5.11 (41). Before the 2015 season, FC Demons were close to folding. However, with the addition of Australian Sam Killworth and Aalborg ruckman Rene Pallsgaard, and the added support from Greater Western Sydney Giants who provided new playing kits to the team, they decided to give it a go. The club also changed name from Farum Cats Australsk Fodbold (English: Farum Cats Australian Football Club) to Farum Australsk Fodbold (English: Farum Australian Football). This was done to equalise the status of the two teams within the club more. It was an up and down season for both teams, especially for the Giants who in late June impressively beat the Cats, only to go down crashing against the Barracudas 5 days later. Both teams made it into the finals, however they did it as 3rd and 4th, meaning that with the new two week finals format, the Cats would travel to Aalborg to meet 2nd placed Aalborg, while the Giants would play the \\"Battle of Copenhagen\\" against Barracudas in Valby - the same match that they had lost 170-17 earlier on the season. While the Cats went down with two goals to Aalborg, the Giants created history as they beat the Barracudas by a single point in what might just be the biggest surprise in recent DAFL history. A week later, in Aalborg, the history repeated itself, as the Giants, led on by Tim Wilton, came from behind to deny Aalborg their first flag, and claim it for themselves instead. Kits and colours=Cats Farum Cats' current kit When the club was formed as the Lions in 1994, they decided to use the jumpers worn by Fitzroy Football Club in the AFL. This was for two reasons: firstly the colours more or less matched those of Farum BK, the local soccer club, and it was believed that that might have gotten them some financial help from the club later, and secondly, the Fitzroy jumpers had the lettering FFC on the front, matching the name Farum Football Club. Later, newer Lions jumpers were used, and these had a lion on the front, with the name Farum underneath. In 2002 Farum Cats changed their moniker from Lions to Cats, and got a shipment of jumpers from Geelong Cats. They were greyish silver with the GFC shield of the Geelong Football Club on Farum Cats lungs and on the stomach. These were used during Farum's greatest reign in the DAFL, Cats when they won back-to-back-to-back premierships. At the time, the club also used a modified version of the GFC shield, spelling out FFC instead. In the 2008 season, the team sold the old jumpers to the players, and started using a new shipment of jumpers from Geelong. These were mainly large to extra large-sized jumpers, with long sleeves in the 2006–07 style Cats clash jumper. Many of the players did not, however, like these jumpers, as sleeveless jumpers were preferred by many, and the few sleeveless jumpers were pretty much always used. These were older, homestyle Cats jumpers from Fila while the others were of the brand Slazenger. In the 2010 final series the team started using their new original Farum Cats jumpers, after wearing different Geelong Cats jumpers since 2002. Their kit is mainly dark blue, with two thick white hoops, and the old FFC shield on the front, with the new one on the upper left, and the old (then current) DAFL shield on the upper right. The only cooperate name visible is Sekem, the manufacturer. Giants In 2013 and 2014 the then FC Demons played in generic kits resembling those of Melbourne Demons in the AFL. In the 2015 season, they wore new kits gifted by Greater Western Sydney Giants. The new kits are an old clash kit of the Giants: white with orange and gray trims and a black Giants logo on the front. Honorary members and other significant personnel The club has three honorary members: Christian Birkholm Jacobsen, better known as Dumbo, founder Jim Campion and former player and long time treasurer Peter Malone. Other significant personnel include creator of The Footy Record Ian Hill, former coach Chris Little, power forward Mikkel Norlander and Mr. Football Morten Engsbye. The club has one Hall of Fame member: founder, long-time player and coach Jim Campion.

JPLDIS is important because it was the inspiration and precursor to dBASE, arguably one of the most influential DBMS programs for early microcomputers.  History  In the late 1960s, Fred Thompson at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) was using a Tymshare product named RETRIEVE to manage a database of electronic calculators. In 1971 Fred collaborated with Jack Hatfield, a programmer at JPL, to write an enhanced version of RETRIEVE which became the JPLDIS project. JPLDIS evolved into a file management program written in FORTRAN, running on a UNIVAC 1108 mainframe. Hatfield published two papers entitled \\"Jet Propulsion Laboratory Data Information System (JPLDIS)\\". The first paper was presented to the Univac Users Group in Dallas, TX (Feb. 1973) and the second paper was presented to the National Science Foundation conference on Data Storage and Retrieval Methods at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri (July 1973). Hatfield left JPL in 1974 and the JPLDIS project was assigned to Jeb Long, another programmer at JPL, who added many advanced features plus a programming language. In 1978, while at JPL, Wayne Ratliff wrote a database program in assembly language for CP/M based microcomputers to help him win the football pool at the office. He based it on Jeb Long's JPLDIS and called it Vulcan, after Mr. Spock of Star Trek. In late 1980, George Tate, of Ashton-Tate, entered into a marketing agreement with Wayne Ratliff. Vulcan was renamed to dBase, the price was raised from $50 to $695, and the software quickly became a huge success. When a number of \\"clones\\" of dBase appeared in the 1990s, Ashton-Tate sued one of them, FoxPro, over copyrights. On December 11, 1990, Judge Hatter issued an order invalidating Ashton-Tate's copyrights in its own dBASE products. That ruling was based on a legal doctrine known as \\"unclean hands\\". Judge Hatter explained that Ashton-Tate knew that the dBase program development was based on JPLDIS, and that fact was kept hidden from the Copyright Office.

In a racing career which lasted from July 2000 until January 2002 he ran ten times and won four races. He is best known for winning the 2001 Kentucky Derby in the second fastest winning time and overall third fastest time in the race's history. Background Monarchos was sired by Maria's Mon- from whom he inherited his gray coat- out of the mare Regal Band. He was bred by Jim Squires, who wrote an account of this \\"rags to riches\\" horse entitled \\"Horse of a Different Colour.\\" As a two-year-old in training, he was purchased for $170,000 by John C. Oxley on the advice of the colt's trainer, John Ward. Racing career Monarchos raced twice as a two-year-old, at Keeneland on October 7, when he finished eighth, beaten by 12½ lengths, and then at Churchill Downs on November 24, when he closed ground late to finish third, 5½ lengths behind the winner.http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&refno;=4475639&registry;=T He made a winning three-year-old debut when taking a minor race at Gulfstream Park in January 2001 and followed up with a win in an allowance race in February. He established himself as a contender for the Kentucky Derby with his run in the Florida Derby in March. Ridden by Jorge Chavez, he won by four and a half lengths from Outofthebox and Invisible Ink. Chavez was impressed by the performance, saying that \\"when I asked him, he just exploded.\\" Bill Nack, writing in Sports Illustrated, was equally enthusiastic, calling the win \\"electrifying\\" and drawing comparisons with other famous grays such as Spectacular Bid and Holy Bull. In his final race before the Derby, Monarchos finished second to Congaree in the Wood Memorial Stakes. However, Ward described the race as \\"a perfect prep.\\" At Churchill Downs on 5 May, Monarchos was the 10.5/1 fourth choice in the betting for the Derby. After being bumped at the start he made steady progress on the outside and turned into the straight in sixth place. Chavez sent the gray colt to the lead a furlong from the finish, and Monarchos pulled clear to win by almost five lengths from Invisible Ink, with Congaree third and the favored Point Given fifth. Monarchos' winning time was 1:59.97 for 1¼ miles, second only to 1973 Triple Crown winner Secretariat, who ran 1:59 (at that time, the Derby was timed to the fifth of a second rather than to the hundredth of a second). In the Preakness Stakes, Monarchos was outrun in the early stages and finished sixth of the eleven runners behind Point Given. In the Belmont Stakes, he finished third, more than thirteen lengths behind the winner, Point Given. Some time after the race, it was discovered that Monarchos had sustained a hairline fracture to his right knee, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Monarchos was scheduled to return as a four-year-old with the Donn Handicap as his first target, but after running third in a prep race he injured a tendon in training in January 2002 and was retired. Stud record Monarchos was retired to Claiborne Farm, where his initial stud fee was $25,000. His most successful foals are Informed Decision, a winner of the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Sprint and a multiple graded stakes winner of $2.2 million, and Win Willy, winner of the Rebel Stakes and one-time Kentucky Derby contender, winner of over $1 million. Other stakes winners include Japanese stakes winner Mr. Monarchos ($775k), multiple stakes winner Stormin Monarcho ($487k), multiple stakes winner Bingham, stakes winners Riley's Monarch and Stones River, Aces Star (Champion 2yo colt in Scandinavia) and others. Monarchos stood at Nuckols Farm in Midway, Kentucky, at a fee of $2,000 for 2016. In April 2011, Monarchos underwent surgery for colic at the Hagyard Equine Medical Institute. On October 22, 2016, Monarchos died after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured intestine. He went into surgery after showing signs of internal distress the night before. He was 18 years old at the time of his death.

She remains best known for her role as petty criminal Noeline Bourke in the soap opera Prisoner. Her film roles include The Singer and the Dancer, Journey Among Women, Newsfront, The Journalist, ...Maybe This Time and Prisoner Queen. Career Kuring joined the Australian Performing Group (APG) in Melbourne during the early 1970s and starred alongside Max Gillies, Graeme Blundell, Bruce Spence and others in a number of plays, variety shows and other stage productions written by David Williamson and Jack Hibberd. She continued performing with the APG and, in 1972, she became involved in an oppositional subgroup of the APG which also included, among others, Micky Allen, Claire Dobbin, Kerry Dwyer, Laurel Frank, Evelyn Krape and Yvonne Marini. The group held its first show, Betty Can Jump, later that year.Milne, Geoffrey. Theatre Australia (un)limited: Australian Theatre Since the 1950s. Amsterdam: Rodopi B.V., 2004 (pg. 281); Although making her first appearance on the police drama Homicide in 1971, Kuring would not begin television acting for another four years until being cast in a minor role in the 1975 television movie They Don't Clap Losers. During the next few years, she was seen on the television series Alvin Purple as well as playing various characters on comedy shows including Wollongong the Brave. In 1977, Kuring made her film debut in The Singer and the Dancer as Mrs Herbert, the nagging daughter of Mrs Bilson (Ruth Cracknell).Reade, Eric. History and Heartburn: The Saga of Australian Film, 1896–1978. Rutherford, New Jersey: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1979. (pg. 251); Later that year, she appeared in her breakout role as Grace in the cult film Journey Among Women. She had supporting roles in Newsfront and The Journalist before being cast as Noeline Bourke in the soap opera Prisoner. Largely portrayed as a lower class thief and the head of a small family of petty thieves, Noeline Bourke was introduced to the series as an inmate emerging to fight Monica Ferguson (Lesley Baker) for position of \\"top dog\\" while Bea Smith (Val Lehman) is recovering in hospital. One of the subplots during the first and second seasons of the series focused on her criminal family, and in one episode, her brother Col is killed by police during a hostage situation. Her character was released shortly after, however she was again caught breaking into a warehouse with her daughter Leanne and returned to Wentworth where she served another brief stint. Taking time off from the series, Kuring appeared in the 1980 film Maybe This Time for which she was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role by the Australian Film Institute. Kuring reappeared on the series, her character being reintroduced shortly after the death of her daughter Leanne, who had been killed during a protest at the prison. After being accepted into the prison's work release program, she is coerced to help one of the employees, Kay White (Sandy Gore), by using her family to steal fabric from the factory. She is set up by White however and, with the work release canceled, she is transferred to Barnhurst (another prison) for her own protection. In 1981, she and Chris Westwood formed a women's subgroup in the APG. The two had been discussing the lack of women's roles in Australian theater, often relegated to the stereotypical \\"hooker with a heart of gold\\", or as a mother, and began organizing members at Nimrod Theatre. They were also given a $110,000 Limited Life Project grant from the Theatre Board of the Australian Council, which they used for a variety of projects including two sets of play readings, a series of acting workshops and included hosting a seminar on women, comedy and music.Watson, Sophie. Playing the State: Australian Feminist Interventions. London: Verso, 1990. (pg. 219); After guest appearing on Waterloo Station in 1983, Kuring subsequently moved away from acting. However, she once more returned to her former career to play a prominent role in the movie Prisoner Queen, which centered on an obsessed fan of the Prisoner television series.

His name is a combination of his owner's name, \\"Fusao,\\" and the Japanese word for one, \\"ichi,\\" to mean #1 or the best. The second half is the winged horse of Greek mythology. \\"FuPeg\\", as the stallion is known by his fans, is a son of Mr. Prospector and out of Angel Fever, a mare by leading sire Danzig. Racing career In early 2000 Fusaichi Pegasus won the Grade 2 San Felipe Stakes and Jerome Handicap. Fusaichi Pegasus won the Kentucky Derby in 2000 in a time of 2:01.12 for the 1 mile distance. He was the first favorite to win the Kentucky Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979. He then lost to Red Bullet in the Preakness Stakes. After his loss in the Preakness Stakes, he did not race in the third leg of the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes. Retirement and stud record In 2000, he was sold to Irish breeder Coolmore Stud for a reported price of more than US$60 million (£35m). The previous record for a stallion prospect was US$40m (£24m), paid in 1983 for Shareef Dancer. For several years, Fusaichi Pegasus served as a \\"shuttle stallion\\" standing at Coolmore's Ashford Stud near Versailles, Kentucky, during the Northern Hemisphere breeding season and at Coolmore Australia near Jerrys Plains, New South Wales, during the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. Since the 2010 breeding season, he has stood exclusively in Kentucky. Among his progeny are Grade 1 winners Bandini, Roman Ruler and Haradasun. Fusaichi Pegasus is generally considered a disappointment as a stallion, especially considering the price for which Sekiguchi sold him. His son Roman Ruler produced Ruler on Ice, winner of the 2011 Belmont Stakes.

Tuominen was given his nickname, \\"Poika\\", in 1920 because of his boyish look; poika means \\"boy\\" in Finnish. Tuominen was born in 1894 in Kuotila (part of Hämeenkyrö) to the family of a rural carpenter. In 1912 he moved to Tampere to become a carpenter's apprentice and soon joined the Social Democratic Party of Finland. During the Finnish Civil War in early 1918, Tuominen sided with the Finnish Red Guards and edited Kansan lehti, a radical social democratic newspaper in Tampere. He was shortly arrested when the White Guards took the city in April, but he was soon released. After the Red Guards were defeated in May 1918 several Finnish radical social democratic leaders fled to Russia, where they split from the mainstream of Finnish Social Democratic Party and founded the Communist Party of Finland in Petrograd in August–September 1918. Tuominen became a supporter of Otto Wille Kuusinen's faction within the party. In 1921 he traveled to Petrograd, where Kuusinen's adherents, supported by the Comintern leadership, successfully challenged Kullervo Manner's supporters at the next party congress. Tuominen was elected to the party's Central Committee and was put in charge of its Finnish bureau. He returned to Finland, where he was arrested on January 26, 1922 and subsequently imprisoned for publishing a proclamation urging Finnish workers to fight on the Soviet side during the Soviet-Finnish conflict over Karelia. He was released from the Tammisaari prison camp in the spring of 1926 and was elected secretary of the Finnish Federation of Trade Unions. He was again arrested in April 1928 for maintaining contacts with the Soviet Union and the banned Communist Party. In late 1932 Tuominen was paroled and received a letter from Kuusinen, who was then one of the Comintern's secretaries, urging him to move to the Soviet Union. Tuominen secretly went to Sweden and then, in April 1933, to the Soviet Union, where he moved into Kuusinen's apartment. He was given a crash course at the International Lenin School and was appointed General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, also becoming a member of the Comintern Executive Committee Presidium. Tuominen witnessed the Great Purge firsthand until he was able to leave Moscow for Stockholm in early 1938. On November 13, 1939, he was ordered to return to Moscow. Tuominen later claimed that he was being recalled to become the head of the communist government of the Finnish Democratic Republic, which Stalin planned to install in Finland. However, according to Tuominen, he refused to obey the order, broke with the Soviet Union and ordered the Communist Party of Finland not to assist the Red Army during the Winter War and to fight for Finland instead. Research by the Finnish historian Kimmo Rentola has exposed a somewhat different story. When the Winter War started, Tuominen was initially enthusiastic of the war in expectation of a quick Soviet victory. However, as the Soviet advance halted and international opinion rallied to Finland's support, Tuominen's doubts started. He began to avoid contacting Moscow and sent feelers to Finnish Social Democrats. It was only after the end of the Winter War that Tuominen took the step of severing his ties with the Soviet Union and started writing anticommunist pamphlets, which were given widespread publicity in Finland. Tuominen had gone underground in Sweden, and it took some time for Moscow to find out what had happened. Within the Finnish communist movement, Tuominen became later known as the ultimate traitor. Tuominen remained in Sweden until 1956, when he returned to Finland and published three volumes of bestselling memoirs in 1956–1958. Especially the second volume, Kremlin kellot (\\"The Bells of Kremlin\\") had a great impact in Finland, being a critical description and an inside view of the Soviet Union under Stalin, written by a former leading Finnish communist who had met both Lenin and Stalin. Tuominen joined the Social Democratic Party, edited its newspaper Kansan Lehti in Tampere for five years and became a member of parliament for one term (1958–1962). He published four more books between years 1970 and 1976, continuing on with the anti-communist theme. Tuominen died in Tampere in 1981. He was the last surviving former member of the Comintern Presidium. References * Tuominen, Arvo (1983): The Bells of the Kremlin.

This appearance can be described as similar to a sea sponge, a brain, or a head of cauliflower, from which it has been given its popular name. They are increasingly cultivated and being sold in Korea, Japan, United States and Australia. The generic name comes from the Greek sparassein meaning to tear. Species Sparassis brevipes There are seven species in the genus: *Sparassis crispa (Wulfen) Fr. *Sparassis brevipes Krombh. *Sparassis cystidiosa Desjardin & Zheng Wang *Sparassis latifolia Y.C. Dai & Zheng Wang *Sparassis miniensis Blanco-Dios & Z. Wang *Sparassis radicata Weir *Sparassis spathulata (Schwein.) Fr. The best-known and most widely collected species of Sparassis are S. crispa (found in Europe and eastern North America) and S. radicata (found in western North America). These species have a very similar appearance and some authorities treat them as conspecific. Their color can range from light brown-yellow to yellow-grey or a creamy white cauliflower colour. They are normally 10 to 25 cm tall, but can grow to be quite large, with reported cases of fruiting bodies more than half a meter tall and 14 kg in weight. Because of their unique look and size, they are unlikely to be mistaken for any poisonous/inedible mushrooms. They grow as parasites or saprobes on the roots or bases of various species of hardwoods, especially oak, and conifers, and hence are most commonly found growing close to fir, pine, oak or spruce trees. Edibility Sparassis crispa can be very tasty, but should be thoroughly cleaned before use, as the folds can contain dirt and other material, as it grows and envelops objects around it such as pine needles. Antonio Carluccio reports that European Sparassis crispa should be picked when creamy white, and once yellow are too indigestible to eat. It is good for drying and reconstituting, as it retains its cartilaginous texture and hence is good for soups. S. spathulata, a cauliflower mushroom which looks similar to Grifola frondosa, is edible. Experiments suggest that S. crispa contains chemicals which may stimulate the immune system and have anti-tumor properties.

In English it is sometimes called cauliflower fungus. Description S. crispa grows in an entangled globe that is up to in diameter. The lobes, which carry the spore- bearing surface, are flat and wavy, resembling lasagna noodles, coloured white to creamy yellow. When young they are tough and rubbery but later they become soft (they are monomitic). The odour is pleasant and the taste of the flesh mild. The spore print is cream, the smooth oval spores measuring about 5 - 7 µm by 3.5 - 5 µm. The flesh contains clamp connections. Ecology, distribution and related species This species is a brown rot fungus, found growing at the base of conifer trunks, often pines, but also spruce, cedar, larch and others. It is fairly common in Great Britain and temperate Europe (but not in the boreal zone). In Europe there is also a less well-known species of the same genus, Sparassis brevipes, which can be distinguished by its less crinkled, zoned folds and lack of clamp connections. S. brevipes, a similar species Culinary use It is considered a good edible fungus when young and fresh, though it is difficult to clean (a toothbrush and lots of running water are recommended for that process). One French cookbook, which gives four recipes for this species, says that grubs and pine needles can get caught up in holes in the jumbled mass of flesh. The Sparassis should be blanched in boiling water for 2–3 minutes before being added to the rest of the dish.

Life and career Born in Kansas City, Kansas, Darby graduated from the University of Illinois, and served in the United States Army during the World War I, rising to the rank of captain. After the war he became successful in business ventures in several different fields including insurance, steel, railroads, utilities and banking. He served on the Kansas State Highway Commission from 1933 to 1937. In 1938 Darby, the owner of Darby Steel Company, purchased Kaw Steel Construction Company, in the West Bottoms at Kansas City, Kansas and formed The Darby Corporation from the two companies. The plant built most of the landing craft tanks (LCTs) that were used in various amphibious invasions. The plant built one craft a day and floated them more than 1,000 miles down the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, Louisiana, prompting their \\"Prairie Ships\\" nickname. Darby's plant at the mouth of Kansas River could hold 8 135í LCTs and 16 Landing Craft Mechanizeds (LCMs) in various stages of construction. Darby served as the Republican National Committeeman for Kansas from the 1940 National Convention to early 1964, when he resigned the position. Gertrude Laughlin McSorley was his personal secretary during his career. On December 2, 1949, he was appointed to fill a United States Senate seat to replace Clyde M. Reed (who had died on November 8) by Governor Frank Carlson, despite the fact that his only prior government experience was four years on the state highway commission. As a senator, Darby was a friend of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a fellow Kansan. He kept his seat until November 28, 1950, when he was succeeded by Frank Carlson, the very man who had appointed him to the seat. Darby returned to Kansas City and lived there until his death. He was buried in Highland Park Cemetery in Kansas City. Legacy Interstate 635 (Kansas–Missouri) is named the Harry Darby Memorial Highway for him in both Kansas and Missouri.

Early in his career, Charismatic was entered in claiming races but he improved rapidly during his three-year-old year. After winning the 1999 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, Charismatic had the lead in the stretch of the Belmont Stakes before suddenly falling back and finishing third. He was quickly pulled up by jockey Chris Antley, who dismounted and cradled the horse's fractured foreleg to prevent further injury. The aftermath of the Belmont was later named the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year. Charismatic never raced again, but was still voted 1999 Horse of the Year. He successfully recovered from his injuries to become a stallion, first in the United States and then in Japan. On October 26, 2016, it was announced that Charismatic was being retired from stud to live at Old Friends Equine near Lexington, Kentucky. He died just over two months after arriving. Background Charismatic was a chestnut horse with four white stockings on his legs and a white stripe on his forehead. He was bred under a foal-sharing arrangement between William S. Farish and the Parrish Hill Farm of Dr. Ben and Tom Roach. His sire was Summer Squall, who had won the 1990 Preakness Stakes. Summer Squall was a half-brother to leading sire A.P. Indy as both were out of the outstanding broodmare Weekend Surprise by Secretariat. Summer Squall's sire Storm Bird, by Northern Dancer, was also the sire of Storm Cat, another leading sire. Charismatic's dam was Bali Babe, by Drone. Bali Babe, winless in two starts, was 16 when she foaled Charismatic, a fairly advanced age for a broodmare. Charismatic was purchased as a weanling by Bob and Beverly Lewis for $200,000. He was trained by D. Wayne Lukas and ridden in the Triple Crown races by Chris Antley. Racing career Charismatic lost his first five starts as a two-year-old. Lukas then took a calculated risk by entering him in a maiden claiming race on November 21, 1998 with a \\"tag\\" of $62,500. Lukas later commented, \\"I don't think I've ever been fooled so much by a horse... I felt I wasn't pushing the right buttons. But I felt he hadn't won a race and needed some confidence.\\" The gamble paid off when the colt went unclaimed and then won the race. Charismatic raced once more as a two-year-old, losing in allowance company, and then started his three-year-old season the same way, finishing fifth in both an allowance race and the Santa Catalina Stakes. Lukas decided to again roll the dice, entering the colt in another claiming race on February 11, 1999. \\"Quite frankly I had given up on the horse,\\" said Bob Lewis. \\"I wanted to get back as much of that $200,000 (purchase price) as I could. The reason he was in that race was because Wayne wanted him to see what it was like on the front end instead of the back end.\\" Again unclaimed, Charismatic finished second but was given the win when the first-place finisher was disqualified. Lukas then put the colt on a demanding schedule, racing him eight days later on February 19 in an allowance race, followed by a start on March 6 in the El Camino Real Derby. Charismatic finished second in both those races, but could only manage a fourth in the Santa Anita Derby on April 6. Lukas shipped the horse to Keeneland for the Lexington Stakes on April 18, the last chance for a win on the Kentucky Derby trail. Charismatic responded with a record setting performance in his first stakes victory. Charismatic was a 31-1 longshot in the 125th Kentucky Derby on May 1, facing a field of 18 other horses. Valhol set a slow early pace tracked by Cat Thief, who took over the lead rounding the final turn. Charismatic raced in mid-pack for the first three-quarters of a mile, then started closing ground rapidly on the leaders. He passed Cat Thief in deep stretch, then withstood a late charge from Menifee to win by a head. Cat Thief, also trained by Lukas, was third. The time for miles was a slow 2:03.29 The win denied trainer Bob Baffert his third straight Derby victory. His three entries, two of which were co-favorites at 9-2 odds, failed to make the top three. Charismatic also won the 124th Preakness Stakes on May 15 with a time of 1:55.20 for the -mile distance. He was 1½ lengths ahead of Menifee, again second, with Badge finishing third. Despite the Kentucky Derby win, Charismatic was not the Preakness favorite, posting 8-1 odds. Menifee was the favorite at 5-2. At the 131st Belmont Stakes on June 5, Charismatic was a 2-1 favorite, with Menifee second in odds at 7-2. The rivalry between Charismatic and Menifee was compared to Affirmed and Alydar in 1978. Charismatic looked like he would become the first horse in 21 years to win the Triple Crown, taking the lead at the 3/16ths pole. However, the horse abruptly slowed down and lost the lead to eventual winner Lemon Drop Kid with 1/8 mile to go, ultimately finishing third behind second-place Vision and Verse. Sensing that something was wrong with the horse, jockey Chris Antley eased Charismatic up in the final furlong, jumped off right after the finish line and then held up the colt's left front leg. Charismatic's foreleg had fractured in multiple places involving the cannon bone and sesamoids, and Antley's actions probably saved his life by avoiding a more catastrophic injury. As it was, the horse was taken off the track in a van and underwent surgery the next day. His surgeon Stephen Selway said, \\"The fracture [of the cannon bone] happened first. As the horse went on, the damaged piece hit the sesamoids and caused them to fracture.\\" The damaged area of the cannon bone extended about six inches: four screws were inserted to provide stability. There was no sign of pre-existing injury. The footage of a tearful Antley holding Charismatic was selected by racing fans as the 1999 National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year. Charismatic finished his career with 5 wins, 2 places and 4 shows in 17 career starts, for total earnings of $2,038,064. He won the Eclipse Awards for 3-year-old Colt of the Year and Overall Horse of the Year for 1999. Retirement In 2000, Charismatic entered stud at Lane's End Farm in Kentucky. After the 2002 season, he was shipped to Japan, where he stood at the JBBA's Shizunai Stallion Station. His fee was ¥500,000 (about $5,000) for a live foal.JBIS Japan Bloodstock Information System At the time of his retirement from stud in October 2016, Charismatic had sired 371 starters from 424 foals of racing age and 263 winners who had combined earnings of more than $44.5 million. His best runner in the United States was Sun King, who won four graded stakes and earned more than $2.2 million. In Japan, his most successful offspring was Wonder Acute, a multiple group stakes winner. On October 26, 2016, it was announced that Charismatic would be retired from stud and would reside at Old Friends Equine near Lexington, Kentucky. The costs of transporting the horse were covered by a fund set up by his former owners and additional donations from Tito's Handmade Vodka. \\"We are ecstatic that we are able to participate in bringing horse racing stars like Charismatic back home, where they can be revered by the public and help raise awareness for the cause,\\" said Eric Barlund, Tito's vice president of sales. \\"Charismatic's star shone very brightly, though only for a few weeks in 1999,\\" said Beverly Lewis. \\"We are all looking forward to visiting him when he arrives.\\" Charismatic died on the morning of February 19, 2017 at Old Friends due to severe bleeding caused by a pelvic fracture. He was thought to have sustained the injury during the night without sounding alarm, and did not appear to have been in distress when he was found. The cause of the fracture was unknown. Shortly after his passing, Charismatic's best son, Sun King, arrived at Old Friends to live out his retirement. A film about Charismatic and Chris Antley was produced by Asylum Entertainment and directed by Steven Michaels, Joel Surnow, and Jonathan Kochas for ESPN's 30 for 30 series.

A c. 1817 ormolu French Empire mantel clock with a figure of Hannibal, by Denière et Matelin, sits on the mantel. The early 19th-century French chandelier is made of gilded wood and cut glass, encircled with acanthus leaves. Acquired during the Kennedy Administration, it previously hung in the President's Dining Room on the second floor. George Peter Alexander Healy's 1859 portrait of John Tyler hangs on the west wall above the Monroe sofa. The sapphire-blue silk fabric used for the draperies and furniture upholstery was chosen by Hillary Clinton. The silk lampas upholstery fabric retains the gold eagle medallion on the chair backs which was adapted from the depiction of one of the Monroe-era chairs in a portrait of James Monroe. The painting, however, depicts the chair upholstered in crimson, not blue, showing the original color used for the room. The design of the blue satin draperies is derived from early 19th-century French patterns. The present drapery design is similar to those installed during the administration of Richard Nixon. Clement Conger, White House Curator at that time, used archive materials from the Society for the Protection of New England Antiquities and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Department of Decorative Arts as patterns for the drapery. The walls are hung with a chamois-colored wallpaper imprinted with medallions of burnished gold. It is adapted from an early 19th-century American Empire wallpaper having French influences. The upper border is a faux printed blue fabric drapery swag. The faux fabric border is similar in effect to an actual fabric border installed during the administration of John F. Kennedy. The printed dado border along the chair rail is blue and gold with rosettes. Installation of a new oval carpet, based on early 19th-century designs, completed the renovation project. The design was adapted from an original design for a neoclassical English carpet from about 1815, the period of the furnishings acquired by Monroe for the Blue Room. History=The oval salon During the administration of John Adams, the Blue Room served as the south entrance hall, though it has always functioned as the principal reception room of the White House. During the administration of James Madison, architect Benjamin Latrobe designed a suite of classical-revival furniture for the room, but the furnishings were destroyed in the fire of 1814 (see War of 1812). When the White House was rebuilt, President James Monroe redecorated the room in the French Empire style. Martin Van Buren had the room carpeted and wallpapered in blue in 1837, and it has remained the tradition ever since, although many administrations have made changes to the decoration. During the administration of James Buchanan, the room was refurbished in a Victorian style called Rococo Revival. Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor. His niece, Harriet Lane, acted as hostess and de facto First Lady. Lane focused primarily on her hosting duties, rather than maintaining the White House. Although Congress allotted President Buchanan $20,000 ($ in dollars) to refurbish the White House when he moved in, Buchanan spent nearly all these funds building a glass conservatory adjacent to the mansion to replace an orangery on the east side of the White House (built during the Jackson administration but torn down to make way for an expansion of the Treasury Building). Rococo Revival furniture, a purchase of Harriet Lane's, financed by the auction of older White House furniture, arrived in December 1859. The centerpiece of this suite was a large circular settee with a central table for flowers. 1902 renovation A series of increasingly complex highly patterned styles followed until 1902 when the room was returned to an Empire style by the firm of McKim, Mead & White during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. The company fabricated a suite of chairs (painted white and gold) based on chairs made for Napoleon by François-Honoré- Georges Jacob-Desmalter. Two new doorways were also cut in the walls to provide more access to the room. Truman reconstruction The White House was completely gutted and rebuilt from 1950 to 1952 during the Harry S. Truman administration. When it came time to redecorate the Blue Room, Truman's designers selected for wall coverings a deep blue silk, which contained a pattern of gold urns draped with flowers. The addition of the Truman Balcony provided shade to the oval portico outside the Blue Room. Kennedy restoration In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy began a major refurbishment of the White House that included the Blue Room. Her renovation was technically overseen by an advisory Committee on Fine Arts made up of museum professionals as well as wealthy individuals interested in antiques. American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont (an expert in Federal furniture) led this committee. Mrs. Kennedy also brought in French interior designer Stéphane Boudin (an advocate of French interior design) and his company, Maison Jansen, to oversee the refurbishment. Although du Pont and Boudin often competed with one another for control of redecoration of a space in the White House, the Blue Room was an area where Boudin had almost exclusive control. The style of the Blue Room was determined by Jacqueline Kennedy. While researching the history of the White House in early January 1961, she came across a 1946 French magazine article that mentioned a suite of French Empire-style gilt wood furniture made in 1817 by French furniture maker Pierre-Antoine Bellangé for use in the Yellow Oval Room. Kennedy asked the White House staff to locate any pieces from this suite, and one piece was found: a battered pier table. Kennedy then asked Maison Jansen if they would restore the table. Jansen agreed to do so and donate the work and materials for free. The pier table received a new white marble top and new giltwork. The pier table was placed opposite the fireplace, its historic location. Deciding where to place other furniture and what sort of colors, window treatments, and other design elements should be made, Maison Jansen created a maquette of the Blue Room. Tiny paintings, pieces of furniture, and window treatments in a wide range of colors and designs were manufactured and placed in the maquette to demonstrate to Jacqueline Kennedy how the room might be put together. The French Empire pier table dictated the style of the room. Boudin initially retained the 1902 suite of chairs for the room. When one of the original 1817 armchairs was found in Pennsylvania, it was donated to the White House and added to the Blue Room. Two side chairs from the suite were located at the Adams National Historic Site in Massachusetts. Charles Francis Adams IV declined to donate these chairs, but agreed to pay for seven reproduction armchairs and six reproduction side chairs. After extensive research into designs, the American fabrics firm Scalamandré discovered a historic painting of the original Monroe-era upholstery for the furniture. Scalamandré was unable to produce a fabric of high enough quality to satisfy Mrs. Kennedy, so Boudin selected the French firm of Tassinari et Châtel to manufacture the coverings. The Blue Room had long been decorated with a table in the center and other furniture around the edge. Boudin continued this historic decorative scheme, but this required him to find a new centerpiece. Although he was able to locate a mahogany round table with white marble top purchased during the Monroe administration, he disliked its heavy look and asked that it be covered. Sister Parish, an interior decorator and Kennedy friend who had refurbished the private rooms of the White House, designed a gold-colored silk damask cloth with tassels to cover the table. Mrs. Kennedy was unhappy that the Monroe table was concealed, and Boudin soon swapped it out for a modern table (retaining the Parish covering). Replacing the Truman-era wall covering, Boudin selected a silk upholstery with cream stripes, plain alternating with satin. To soften the cornice line of the room, Boudin chose a blue silk taffeta with black and gold trim in a Baroque Revival design which he formed into a continuous valance hung just below the cornice molding. For the drapes in the room, Boudin chose straight panels of blue silk taffeta. He then replaced Parish's gold cloth on the table with a blue velvet covering with long gold fringe. The fabrics for the walls, valance, drapes, and tablecloth were all produced by Scalamandré. To finish unifying the scheme of the Blue Room, Boudin had the dado rail and the cornice molding painted gold and white. Painter and craftsman Peter H. Guertler, widely known as an expert on restoration of historic interior paintwork, repainted these parts of the room for free. Life-size portraits of George Washington, John Adams, James Madison, and John Quincy Adams had long hung in the Blue Room. Boudin retained these works of art, adding to them three new works (of Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and Andrew Jackson) purchased by the White House. Boudin purchased and installed black and gilt French Empire sconces on the piers, and hung four of the paintings beneath them. A French Empire gilt bronze and crystal chandelier was mounted in the center of the ceiling. Additional lighting was provided by a pair of caryatid torchères. An early 19th-century rectangular blue, gold, and pink French Empire carpet manufactured at Savonnerie in France was chosen for the floor, and a pair of French Empire gilt bronze andirons for the fireplace. Redecoration of the Blue Room was funded by oil company executive Charles Bierer Wrightsman and his wife, Jayne (a close friend of Mrs. Kennedy's). The Blue Room was chosen as the subject of a 1964 print that the Kennedys intended to present to White House staff for Christmas. Edward Lehman was commissioned to do the painting. (Lehman had also been commissioned to paint the Red Room and the Green Room for 1962 and 1963 perspective gift prints.) In August 1963, Lehman visited the White House to show the Kennedys his painting. The Kennedys approved of the work, and President Kennedy told Lehman at that time that the Blue Room was his favorite. Because President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, the Blue Room print was never distributed. About 1,000 prints were made, numbered, and signed, however, and some of these were obtained by collectors. Nixon and Clinton refurbishment When the completed Blue Room was opened to the public in January 1963, there was little criticism of Boudin's efforts. In 1973, First Lady Pat Nixon again refurbished the room. At that time, a number of critics were very vocal about Boudin's choices for the room. In 1985, White House Curator Clement Conger, in declaring Boudin's Blue Room a failure, said Boudin demonstrated no expertise in period American houses. It followed a complete redecoration by First Lady Pat Nixon in 1971 which retained the Bellange pieces of Monroe but saw the walls covered with wallpaper for the first time since the early 19th century. The current appearance of the Blue Room is the result of a renovation and refurbishing completed in 1995 by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, the White House Office of the Curator, and funded by the White House Endowment Trust. Obama second inaugural As January 20, 2013 fell on a Sunday, President Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term by Chief Justice of the United States John G.

The centerpiece is a replica of the log cabin built and occupied by Thomas Lincoln, father of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln never lived here and only occasionally visited, but he provided financial help to the household and, after Thomas died in 1851, Abraham owned and maintained the farm for his stepmother, Sarah Bush Lincoln. The farmstead is operated by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. History Abraham Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks Lincoln, died in 1818 while the family lived in a log cabin in the Little Pigeon Creek Community in southern Indiana. In 1819, Lincoln's father Thomas Lincoln married the widowed Sarah Johnston of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. In 1830, Thomas and Sarah followed their daughter and son-in-law and other family members as they migrated west from Indiana into Central Illinois; Abraham, though now a legal adult, opted to follow his step- mother and father.https://www.amazon.com/Lincolns-Youth-Indiana- Years-1816-1830/dp/0871950626/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0/143-6306449-8662929?_encoding=UTF8&pd;_rd_i=0871950626&pd;_rd_r=cc9a247a-bebb-45f4-8586-495ee3e05f09&pd;_rd_w=HaK7X&pd;_rd_wg=Ra2OW&pf;_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf;_rd_r=7BVEV5G7QRJ6E27HBY3Y&psc;=1&refRID;=7BVEV5G7QRJ6E27HBY3Y After a wretched winter in 1830–1831 at a campsite west of Decatur, young Abraham left the family to start his own homestead and seek his fortune in Sangamon County. Wandering generally southeastward, Thomas and Sarah eventually settled in Coles County. After living unsuccessfully on three separate farmsteads within the county, Thomas bought a small plot near the Embarras River in 1840, part of what was then called Goosenest Prairie, now within Pleasant Grove Township on the southern edge of Coles County. At some point soon after that purchase, Thomas and Sarah built what was to be their final home, a saddlebag style log cabin with two main rooms and additional sleeping and storage space in a loft or attic accessed by a ladder. By 1845, the cabin was home to as many as 18 members of the Lincoln and Johnston families, living together in an extended-family arrangement common in Appalachian Southern culture. Abraham Lincoln, now a rising state legislator and lawyer, provided financial help to his parents but did not visit them as often as he could. As a lawyer, he was in Charleston, site of the Coles County courthouse, quite frequently, but only visited \\"every year or two.\\" Though he remembered his stepmother fondly, Lincoln was not very close to his father; he did not visit even when Thomas Lincoln was terminally ill in 1851. At the end of January 1861, Abraham Lincoln, the President-elect, traveled by newly laid railroad tracks from Springfield to Farmington, a few miles north of the cabin, to visit his widowed stepmother (Farmington is now the unincorporated hamlet of Campbell, Illinois and not to be confused with Farmington, Illinois). Their meeting occurred at the middle-class frame house of prominent Farmington citizen (Sarah's son-in-law and Abraham's step-brother-in-law) Reuben Moore. They also visited Thomas Lincoln's grave at nearby Shiloh Cemetery.\\"Illinois State Historical Markers: Shiloh Cemetery.\\" Historyillinois.org Sarah was fond of her stepson and had always believed he would be successful. This was to be their last visit; Lincoln never returned to Illinois alive. Sarah Bush Lincoln lived in the Goosenest Prairie cabin until her death in 1869. Sarah Lincoln was buried with Thomas in Shiloh Cemetery. The site today A participant at the Lincoln Log Cabin Harvest FrolicIn 1893, the original Thomas Lincoln log cabin was disassembled and shipped northward to serve as an exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. The original cabin was lost after the Exposition, and may have been used as firewood. However, the cabin had been photographed many times, and an exact replica was built from the photographs and from contemporary descriptions. The current Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site includes three houses on two sites: *A reconstruction of the Thomas Lincoln log cabin, completed in 1934 as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps. It is surrounded by a subsistence farmstead similar to the senior Lincoln's actual farm, is the central feature of the main site. The farm includes heirloom crops and cattle breeds similar or identical to those used at the time. *The Stephen Sargent home, built on a site 10 miles to the east starting in 1843 and moved to Lincoln Log Cabin in 1987, reflects successful cash crop farming practices of the 1840s, and is meant to contrast with the Lincoln farm. *The Reuben Moore Home, occupied by a branch of the family starting in 1856, was the place of Abraham and Sarah Bush Lincoln's final meeting. It is located about 1 mile (2 km) north of the main Goosenest Prairie site in what is now the former village of Farmington. The Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site is interpreted to the mid-1840s, the time of its occupation by many members of the extended Lincoln family. The main site also includes the cornfields, gardens, small orchards, livestock, and outbuildings that would be found on a farm of the period. The crops and livestock are all of historic heirloom varieties. A great many additional activities occur during the annual Fall Harvest Frolic. In response to budget cuts, the state of Illinois temporarily closed the Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site from December 2008 until April 2009. On January 22, 2014, part of the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20140131.htm The former location of the CCC's \\"Camp Shiloh\\", it qualified as a historical archaeological site, not because of the current buildings or because of any connection to Lincoln.

In Bodina’s funeral inscription, Bodina ascribes Urania as Queen Julia Urania. She was ascribed as Queen as a local courtesy or probably a posthumous honor as a dedication to the memory of the former ruling monarch. The inscription reveals that Bodina was a loyal former slave to Urania. Modern historians have created two theories on the origins on the wife of Ptolemy of Mauretania. Urania may have been a mistress from the lower class. Urania was a nickname given to a favorite mistress of a harem. The nickname derived from the Muses.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Cleopatra Selene, Footnote 10 She was probably a member of the Royal Court in Mauretania.

Biography She was born in Bognor Regis, Sussex, England. Her parents were actors and director managers, although she was also cared for by other relatives. Her grandfather was the actor manager playwright E Hill Mitchelson. As a young actress, she joined the Windmill Girls (evoked in the film Mrs Henderson Presents) who performed non-stop revues and nude tableaux at the Windmill Theatre in the West End. Several years later, she married her first husband and emigrated to Australia, but the marriage did not endure so she returned to Britain in 1957. While in Australia, Redmond became a successful radio actress. She played in the major radio features, Caltex Theatre and General Motors' Hour as well as plays for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Her best remembered radio drama was Linday Hardy's Stranger in Paradise alongside Guy Doleman, a New Zealand actor who later had a movie career both in the US and Britain. She made her stage debut as an understudy to Vivien Leigh in Peter Brook's revival of Titus Andronicus with Laurence Olivier. In July of that year, she made her London debut at the Stoll in the same production. In 1958, she made her film debut in a thriller, entitled Violent Moment (1958), which was followed by several more roles in the films Doctor in Love (1960), \\"Jigsaw\\" (1962), A Shot in the Dark (1964) and several B-film thrillers. Meanwhile, her theatrical career had taken off with roles in Verdict (Strand), in which she played Helen Rollander; Detour After Dark (Fortune Theatre), Horizontal Hold (Comedy Theatre); Patrick Peace Hotel (Queen's); The Winter's Tale (Cambridge Theatre) and Flint (Comedy Theatre). She was also a founder member of the Actors' Company with Ian McKellen. Redmond appeared as a page in Iris Murdoch's The Three Arrows (17 October – 11 November 1972) along with McKellen.

In the 400 m freestyle she narrowly shaded a 3-way sprint for the line, winning in a time of 4:07.69. Also in 2006, she won a European Championship bronze medal in the 400 m freestyle. McClatchey competed in the 2007 World Championships, but did not win a medal, placing 7th in the final of the 200 m freestyle and failing to reach the final in the 400 m freestyle. She swam in the British team that came 5th in the 4×200 m freestyle final, setting a new British record. McClatchey was disappointed in her results and said that she needed to revise her training schedule to build up muscle. Selected for the 2008 Olympic Games she finished sixth in the 200m freestyle being the only Briton to reach the final. She was also selected for the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay team that was widely tipped for a chance of winning a medal, but a gamble to rest top swimmers; including McClatchey in the heats backfired and the team failed to qualify. This was particularly disappointing as McClatchey had already pulled out of the 100m freestyle individual event to concentrate on this. In 2009, she was a member of the British teams that set the UK records in the 4 × 100 metres and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays. As of 2014, both records still stand. She is also a former UK record holder in the 100, 200 and 400 m freestyle. McClatchey competed for Scotland in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, reaching the semi-finals of the 100-metre freestyle, finishing fifth in the 4 × 200-metre freestyle relay, fifth in the 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay, and fifth in the 4 × 100-metre medley relay. At the 2012 Olympics in London, McClatchey reached the 200 m freestyle final, finishing seventh. She was also a member of the British teams that finished fifth in both the 4 × 100 m freestyle and 4 × 200 m freestyle relays. In late 2012 McClatchey moved from Loughborough University, where she had been based for the previous eight years, to Edinburgh, after her coach Ian Armiger became head coach for the Cayman Islands. In Edinburgh she was coached by the head of performance swimming at the University of Edinburgh, Chris Jones. McClatchey announced her retirement from competitive swimming in June 2015.  Honours  McClatchey was inducted into the Scottish Swimming Hall of Fame in 2018.

It opened its doors the following year as the Isidore Newman Manual Training School (the name was changed in 1931), and it was initially intended for Jewish children who no longer had their parents or guardians alive. Historically Jewish charities supported the school.Evans, Eli N. The Provincials: A Personal History of Jews in the South. University of North Carolina Press, 1997. , 9780807876343. // Cited: p. 211. The school buildings suffered damage due to wind and flooding caused by 2005's Hurricane Katrina and was closed for two months. It reopened in January 2006, and by October 2006 enrollment fully recovered. Academics Newman offers comprehensive education for students in grades pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, organized into Lower, Middle and Upper schools. Eli N. Evans wrote in the 2005 book The Provincials: A Personal History of Jews in the South that Newman is \\"highly oriented to college admission\\". The school is a member of the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest and the National Association of Independent Schools. The school also offers four foreign languages, including Honors and/or AP classes in each language: French I-VII, Spanish I-VII, Latin I-VII, and Chinese I-IV In order to be on the honor roll, students must maintain a 3.67 GPA. This includes a one GPA point addition for both honors and AP courses. Athletics Newman's athletic teams compete in the Louisiana High School Athletic Association. The school fields teams on a number of sports, including baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and volleyball. Newman held 89 State Championships as of April 2016. The largest building on campus is the Cotonio Palaestra. Peyton Manning, who later played 18 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), attended the high school, and led their football team to a 34–5 record during his three seasons as its starter. He was named Gatorade Circle of Champions National Player-of-the-Year and Columbus (Ohio) Touchdown Club National Offensive Player-of-the-Year in 1993. While at Newman, he began wearing the #18 jersey in honor of his older brother Cooper, who was forced to give up football due to spinal stenosis. Younger brother Eli also wore the number when he became starting quarterback. Newman has since retired the #18 jersey and it can be seen hanging in the school gym. Manning was among the most sought after high school players in the country and was recruited by 60 colleges. Billy Fitzgerald, veteran science teacher and baseball and basketball coach at Newman and the school's athletic director, was the subject of a profile by alumnus Michael Lewis entitled Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life (2005; ). Jeremy Bleich, later selected in the First Round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft by the New York Yankees, played baseball for the school, graduating in 2005. In high school by his junior year he had what author Michael Lewis described as \\"a decent fastball, great command, a big-league change-up and charm to burn\\", and had over 40 colleges recruiting him.Michael Lewis, \\"Coach Fitz's Management Theory,\\" The New York Times, March 28, 2004 Bleich was named a 2005 first-team All-American by Collegiate Baseball (Louisville Slugger), a third-team All American by Baseball America, and the 2005 All-Metro Player of the Year.

It is on the Praek Tuek Chhu River southeast of the Elephant Mountains and around from the Gulf of Thailand. Kampot was the capital of the Circonscription Résidentielle de Kampot under French rule and Cambodia's most important seaport after the loss of the Mekong Delta and before the establishment of Sihanoukville. Its center is, unlike most Cambodian provincial capitals, composed of 19th century French colonial architecture. The region and town are known for high quality pepper, which is exported worldwide. It is also known for its Kampot fish sauce, and durian. Now the government and Ministry of Culture and Fine Art are preparing documents to nominate The Old Town of Kampot in the list of UNESCO world heritage site along with The Old Town of Battambang and The Old Town of Kratie since 2017. History= A Khmer breach between Siam and Ha-Tien since 1771  The first description of Kampot in the Cambodian Royal Chronicles refers to an event that took place from 1771 to 1775. In 1771, King Taksin of Siam attacked Ha-Tien and destroyed it completely before marching on the Cambodian capital Oudong. In an effort to overthrow the Khmer King Outey II who was allied with Vietnamese Mac Thien Tu based in Ha-Tien, the young Khmer prince and future king Ang Non II gathered with Siamese soldiers in Kampot which he used as a base for his hostilities until obtaining the throne 1775. The uprising of Oknha Mau in 1841 In 1841, Oknha-Mau, who was a Cambodian governor, refused the Vietnamese yoke which had gradually been imposed once more on Kampot. Supported by Siam, he gathered a military contingent of about 3,000 Cambodians. The Vietnamese ran away to Ha-Tien again.  The first international seaport of Cambodia (1841-1860)  Upon his arrival on the throne in 1840, Khmer King Ang Duong constructed a road from his capital of Oudong, to Kampot, and opened Kampot as the only international seaport of Cambodia. Import and exports grew fastly in the hands of the Anglo-Chinese merchants of Singapore turning a neighborhood of the city into the Chinese Kampot. French missionary Father Hestret founded the first Catholic Church in Kampot at that time, and received the visit of French explorer Henri Mouhot.  From the French protectorate to the insurrection (1863-1886)  Cambodia became a protectorate of France in 1863. King Norodom appointed a Vietnamese as chief of the canton and let him control the village and all Vietnamese in this province. After this period, Kampot began to decline. The main reason for this decline was because Saigon Port was opened and navigation along the Mekong River began to be exploited in the interests of French colonialism. Ressentment grew among the population. The insurrection began on March 17, 1885 at noon, when a band of 50 men sacked the opium entrepôt held by the French colonialists. Another band of 50 men attacked the telegraph office. The customhouse at the entrance of the river became a fort of insurgents. At the beginning of April, an French aviso à vapeur “Le Sagittaire” and two junks appeared at the anchorage of Kampot. Tensions escalated as violence broke out throughout the province with a complex play of alliances and betrayals as well as interference from Chinese pirates. On the 8th of May 1886, a column of 100 soldiers under Lieutenant de Vaubert departed Kampot. Résident Santenoy also marched with 30 militiamen. After an hour’s battle, a Cambodian militiaman of the Résident succeeded in penetrating into the fort of the insurgents, and French troops broke the fort in five minutes officially ending the insurrection of Kampot. At the end of 1886, an interview between the King Sisowath and the insurgents was held at Thnol Bek Kus, half-way between Phnom Penh and Kampot and peace was accomplished.  Kampot of the Belle Epoque (1889-1940)  Under 19th century French colonial administration Kampot became a regional administrative centre with the status of a state border district as a result of the delimitation of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Circonscription Résidentielle de Kampot contained the arrondissements of Kampot, Kompong-Som, Trang, and Kong-Pisey. In 1889 French colonial census reports a multi-ethnic community: Kampot town consisted of \\"Cambodian Kampot\\" on the Prek-Kampot River and \\"Chinese Kampot\\" on the right riverbank of the west branch of the Prek-Thom River. Nearby was also a Vietnamese village, called Tien-Thanh and another Vietnamese village on Traeuy Koh Island. A Malay enclave also existed on Traeuy Koh Island. Additional villages of mixed ethnicity are listed. The Chinese population grew steadily, benefited well from pepper cultivation and benefiting the economy of Kampot. Yet quarrels between Chinese groups were reported too. For example, Hainam Chinese and Trieu-Châu Chinese quarreled in October 1908, and Inspecteur Durand, had to sent in guards to reach pacify the situation.  Kampot during the War  Kampot during the Khmers Rouges  Kampot become the stage to a major battle of the Vietnam War, also a part of the Cambodian Civil War. From February 26 to April 2, 1974, Cambodian government troops battled Khmer Rouge guerillas for the control of Kampot city. Despite the Cambodian Army's heavy resistance, the Khmer Rouge eventually captured the city of Kampot on April 2. Both sides suffered heavy casualties during the fighting but many more civilians were rendered homeless.  Kampot contemporary history = Demographics  According to the 2012 census, the population of the municipality of Kampot is 49, 597. Historically, there has been an important presence of Khmers of Chinese descent in Kampot. Recent years have seen an important inflow of foreigners, European, Vietnamese, and Chinese. A significant part of the population is Cham, a majority muslim group. The Sa'och tribe, an ancient population group in the province, is on the brink of extinction however.  Administration  The municipality of Kampot is located in Kampot province and is divided into 15 villages and 5 Sangkats which are: * Kampong Kandal Sangkat * Krang Ampil * Kampong Bay * Andong Khmer * Traeuy Kaoh  Crime and security  Whilst Kampot is considered largely safe, the city has seen a rise in crime against tourists and foreign residents. Despite some efforts to provide better security and policing, local authorities have been criticized in recent years for their response to a number of high-profile serious crimes, including rapes and murders, that were dealt with poorly. As in neighbouring Sihanoukville, police in Kampot have been accused of corruption, drug trafficking and drug use, and links to organized crime. Some members of Kampot's expatriate community have also faced criticism for alleged attempts to censor, cover up, and control any negative news or reviews about the city, its businesses, and inhabitants, especially on social media groups and pages.

She was the eldest daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, and Sarah Anne Child. Her mother was the only child of Robert Child, the principal shareholder in the banking firm Child & Co. Under the terms of his will, the Countess of Jersey was the primary legatee, and she not only inherited Osterley Park but became senior partner of the bank after the death of her grandmother Sarah Child. Her husband, George Villiers, added the surname Child by royal licence. The inheritance made her one of the richest women in England: in 1805 she was able to give £20000 each to four family members without impairing her own income. Lady Jersey married George Child Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey, on 23 May 1804, in the drawing room of her house in Berkeley Square. Her husband's mother, Frances Villiers, Countess of Jersey (also Lady Jersey), was one of the more notorious mistresses of King George IV when he was Prince of Wales. Her sister Maria married John Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon, later the 4th Earl of Bessborough, a brother of Lady Caroline Lamb. Her own affairs, though conducted discreetly, were said to be numerous: Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, was thought to be one of her lovers. When asked why he had never fought a duel to preserve his wife's reputation, Lord Jersey drily replied that this would require him to fight every man in London.Ridley, Jasper Lord Palmerston London: Constable, 1970; p. 42 Lady Jersey was one of the patronesses of Almack's, the most exclusive social club in London, and a leader of the ton during the Regency era. She was immortalized as Zenobia in Disraeli's novel Endymion. Caroline Lamb ridiculed her in Glenarvon; in revenge Lady Jersey had her barred from Almack's, the ultimate social disgrace.Lord David Cecil Melbourne Pan Books Edition, 1965; p. 122 This, however, was unusual since she was notable for acts of kindness and generosity; and she was eventually persuaded to remove the ban.Ridley, p. 42 In politics she was a Tory, although she lacked the passionate interest in politics shown by her cousin Harriet Arbuthnot. On hearing that the Duke of Wellington had fallen from power in 1830, she burst into tears in public. She reportedly \\"moved heaven and earth\\" against the Reform Act 1832.Fraser, Antonia Perilous Question: the Drama of the Great Reform Bill 1832 Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2013; p. 91 Lady Jersey was known by the nickname Silence; the nickname was ironic since, famously, she almost never stopped talking.cf Georgette Heyer The Grand Sophy \\"Dreadful woman-she never stops talking! ...She is known as Silence in London\\". The memoirist Captain Gronow, who disliked her, called her \\"a theatrical tragedy queen\\", and considered her \\"ill-bred and inconceivably rude\\". She is a recurring character in the Regency novels of Georgette Heyer, where she is presented as eccentric and unpredictable, but highly intelligent and observant, and capable of kindness and generosity. She died at No. 38, Berkeley Square, Middlesex (now London).  Issue  Lady Jersey had seven children: * George Child Villiers, 6th Earl of Jersey (1808–1859) * The Honourable Augustus John Villiers (1810–1847), married Georgiana Elphinstone, daughter of George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith. * The Honourable Frederick William Child Villiers (1815–1871), married Elizabeth Maria van Reede, daughter of the 7th or 8th Earl of Athlone. * The Honourable Francis John Robert Child Villiers (1819–1862). * Lady Sarah Frederica Caroline Child Villiers (1822–1853), married Nicholas Paul (Miklós Pál), 9th Prince Esterházy (1817–1894). His mother, Princess Maria Theresia of Thurn and Taxis was a friend of Lady Jersey and a fellow patroness of Almack's. * Lady Clementina Augusta Wellington Child Villiers (1824–1858). * Lady Adela Corisande Maria Child Villiers (1828–1860), married Lt.-Col. Charles Parke Ibbetson, and had one daughter Adele. Lady Adela's scandalous elopement to Gretna Green with Captain Ibbetson increased the circulation of all the London newspapers in November 1845.

On account of its Romanesque and early Gothic buildings it is considered one of the most significant architectural heritage sites in Hesse. In the winter of 1985/86 some of the interior scenes of The Name of the Rose were filmed here. The abbey is a main venue of the annual Rheingau Musik Festival. History Abbey church Abbey The first monastic house at the site was founded in 1116 by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, as a house of Augustinian canons. It was then bestowed by him in 1131 upon the Benedictines. This foundation failed to establish itself, and the successor, Kloster Eberbach, was founded in 1136 by Bernard of Clairvaux as the first Cistercian monastery on the east bank of the Rhine. Eberbach soon became one of the largest and most active monasteries of Germany. From it a number of other foundations were made: Schönau Abbey near Heidelberg in 1142; Otterberg Abbey in the Palatinate in 1144; Gottesthal Abbey near Liege in 1155; and Arnsburg Abbey in the Wetterau in 1174. At its height in the 12th and 13th centuries, the population is estimated to have been about 100 monks and over 200 lay brothers. The lay brothers' refectory, home to 12 historic wine presses Eberbach Abbey was also very successful economically, principally as a result of profits from the cultivation of vineyards and the production of wine. At least 14 members of the family of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen were buried in the church. Among them was Count Johann IV of Katzenelnbogen, who was the first to plant Riesling vines, in a new vineyard in the nearby village of Rüsselsheim, when the monks of Eberbach were still growing red grapes such as Grobrot, the earliest grape variety recorded in Eberbach. In about 1525 it is said that in the abbey there was an enormous wine barrel with a volume of between c. 50,000 and 100,000 litres, which in the German Peasants' War of 1525 was heavily used by rebels from the Rheingau, who were encamped just below the monastery. During the Thirty Years' War, the abbey was severely damaged, beginning with an attack by the Swedish army in 1631. Many valuable items from the church and the library were looted, and the monks were forced to flee. Only 20 of them returned in 1635 to begin a laborious reconstruction. The 18th century was a period of great economic success: surviving accounts show that the abbey profits were regularly invested on the Frankfurt money market. The final decline set in with the French Revolution. After the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss the abbey was dissolved on 18 September 1803 and with its assets and territory became the property of Prince Friedrich Augustus of Nassau-Usingen.  After secularisation  Dormitory The lands passed from Nassau-Usingen in 1866 to Prussia, and from 1945 have formed part of the State of Hesse. The premises were put to a variety of uses. An asylum was accommodated here until 1873 (the forerunner of the Zentrum für Soziale Psychiatrie Rheinblick) and until 1912 a prison. Management of the vineyards and wine production has continued in state hands. After considerable structural work Eberbach serves inter alia as a venue for cultural events and displays, and as a film location, as for example for Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose (1985). Eberbach Abbey Foundation Abbey church With effect from 1 January 1998 the State of Hesse transferred the entire abbey complex into the ownership of a publicly owned charitable foundation, the Stiftung Kloster Eberbach (\\"Eberbach Abbey Foundation\\"), which has the goal of conserving the architectural and cultural monument by overseeing its appropriate, controlled and sustainable use as well as of maintaining the historical tradition of wine production. Description Cloisters The buildings date from the Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque periods. A list of goods, the Oculus Memoriae, survives from as early as the year 1211, giving information on the possessions and premises of the abbey complex. The buildings include: * The abbey church, a three-aisled Romanesque basilica with transept, containing the tombs of some of the Archbishops of Mainz * The cloisters, the south side of which is Gothic, the north side partly Gothic and partly Romanesque, and the remainder a 19th-century restoration * The chapter room, a late Gothic square room with a central pillar, restored with ceiling and wall paintings * The Fraternei, an early Gothic room with heavy vaulting, used since the Middle Ages as a wine cellar. It is also known as the Cabinetkeller, which is the origin of the use of the term Kabinett as a quality description of German wine. * The Dormitorium (dormitory), an early Gothic room about 70 metres long containing vaulting and short columns with sculptured capitals, and one of the few such rooms of this size and quality remaining in Europe * The north wing, refurbished in the 18th century and containing the refectory, with a Baroque stucco ceiling by Daniel Schenk. It replaced the earlier Gothic refectory to the north * The west wing, accommodating the library, where the abbey museum was set up in 1995. This contains inter alia the oldest surviving Cistercian glass window in Germany (of about 1180), the original capitals from the cloisters, now replaced by modern replicas, various sculptures, portraits of Bernard of Clairvaux and Baroque furnishings * In a separate building to the west of the monastic quarters, the \\"converts' building\\" or \\"lay-brothers' building\\", containing the lay-brothers' refectory (45 metres long) and the Laiendormitorium (lay-brothers' dormitory) (at over 80 metres long, the largest surviving Romanesque secular room in Europe), and attached to it a Romanesque wine-cellar and various small domestic buildings from the 17th century * Outside of the inner monastic precinct to the east, the hospital, service buildings and 18th and 19th century wine cellars Wine production Historic wine cellar The vineyards of Eberbach Abbey were, at 300 hectares, the largest in medieval Europe. Most of them are now the property of the state of Hesse and are run by the Hessische Staatsweingüter GmbH Kloster Eberbach, which manages the largest connected area of wine production in Germany, comprising vineyards on the slopes of the Rhine Valley and on the Hessische Bergstrasse. Of the 200 hectares which are under cultivation, three-quarters are planted with Riesling, but Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris, Pinot noir and Dornfelder are also grown. Burials The church contains numerous interesting monuments and tombs, notable among them being those of: * Gerlach von Nassau, Archbishop of Mainz (died 1371) * Adolph II of Nassau (died 1475). Today The abbey has been the principal venue for the concerts of the Rheingau Musik Festival since 1988, with concerts in the Basilika (church), the Dormitorium, the Laiendormitorium and the Kreuzgang (cloisters). It has also been used for other concerts. The public areas can be viewed daily, either with or without guided tours. Rooms can be booked for conferences and events. Wine tastings for groups can also be booked, and twice a year there are wine auctions. On the night of 26 April 2005 the abbey suffered severe damage from flooding. This was due to heavy rain, which caused the Kisselbach river to overflow its banks, and the increased volume of water brought about the collapse of the 18th century storm drain under the abbey.  Restoration  Major restoration of the complex began in 1986, financed by the State of Hesse. Restoration of the interior of the basilica began in March 2018. The project is estimated to cost 130 Million Euro and planned to be completed in 2024. During restoration, new archeological finds have been made, which need to be preserved and documented. For example, parts of the Gothic floor and graves were found in the southern nave of the basilica.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Bothrops pradoi, p. 210).  Description and Behavior  The color varies from tan to reddish-brown, the pattern varies, from darker and lighter spots, similar to light diagonal dorsolateral lines. It has 23 to 31 rows of dorsal scale of the medium body, the belly is yellowish or whitish in color with dark, brown or gray spots, and irregular spots on the sides.https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf It is a snake with terrestrial behavior, growing on average in 250-1840 mm, mainly found in forests, arid, semi-arid, dry, humid and sub-humid regions. Geographic range Bothrops leucurus is found in eastern Brazil along the Atlantic coast from northern Espírito Santo north to Alagoas and Ceará. It occurs more inland in several parts of Bahia. The identity of disjunct populations west of the Rio São Francisco is uncertain. The type locality is listed as \\"provinciae Bahiae\\". It inhabits both urban and rural areas. Reproduction Bothrops leucurus is viviparous. The gestation period is four months, and a medium-sized litter is 19 young, birth occurs between winter and summer.  Diet  It feeds on rodents, lizards, amphibians, snakes and birds (Martins et al., 2002). with adults feeding on rodents, and juveniles feeding on frogs and lizards.  Venom  It is the snake responsible for more bites in the state of Bahia, the venom contains high fibrinolytic, proteolytic, hemorrhagic and edematogenic activity, and low coagulant activity, which can cause myonecrosis in humans. Symptoms include local pain, edema, erythema and ecchymosis (local symptoms) , hemorrhagic and coagulation symptoms, digestive disorders (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea), urinary disorders (oliguria, anuria, hematuria) with headaches, dizziness, hypotension, bradycardia, visual disturbances and tremors.

No subspecies are currently recognized. Description Deinagkistrodon acutus is light brown or greyish brown dorsally, with a series of dark brown lateral triangles on each side. The two pointed tops of the two opposite triangles meet each other at the mid-line, forming a series of about 20 light brown, squarish blotches on the back. A row of large black spots extends along each side near the belly. The top and upper sides of the head are uniformly black, with a black streak from the eye to the angle of the mouth. D. acutus is yellowish ventrally, spotted with dark brown. The young are much lighter than the adults with essentially the same pattern. The head is large, triangular, with an upturned snout. The body is very stout. The tail is short, ending in a compressed, pointed slightly curved cornified scale. The top of the head is covered with nine large shields. The dorsal scales are strongly and tubercularly keeled. The subcaudals are mostly in pairs, some of the anterior ones are single.

Geographic range Deinagkistrodon acutus is found in southern China (Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong), Taiwan, northern Vietnam, and possibly Laos. The type locality was not included in the original description. It was later given as \\"Wusueh [Wu-hsueh], Hupeh Province, China\\" by Pratt (1892) and Pope (1935). Listed as \\"Mountains N. of Kiu Kiang\\" in the catalogue of the British Museum of Natural History. Habitat The species D. acutus inhabits high, forested mountains up to , but has also been found in low coastal regions (). It prefers lower mountain slopes or rocky hills with small valleys. Behavior Deinagkistrodon acutus is a nocturnal species. It is generally discovered by day on rocks or among vegetation along banks of streams, or in firewood near houses, or even in houses. When encountered it may appear sluggish at first, but it is capable of striking vigorously when threatened. Diet The diet of D. acutus consists of small mammals such as rats and mice, birds, toads, frogs and lizards. Chinese herpetologist Er-mi Zhao reported a specimen of a total length of and weighing having eaten a specimen of Rattus rattus of a total length of and a weight of . Reproduction As one of the few oviparous pit vipers, D. acutus can lay up to 24 eggs, which may be retained during initial incubation, an adaptation that shortens post-deposition incubation time. However, it generally only deposits 11 or 12 eggs from June to August. Egg size is 40–56 x 20–31 mm (about 2 × 1 in). Hatchlings are lighter and more vividly patterned than the adults, but this darkens considerably with age. Venom Dangerous animals often have exaggerated reputations and the species D. acutus is no exception. The popular name \\"hundred pacer\\" refers to a local belief that, after being bitten, the victim will only be able to walk 100 steps before dying. In some areas, it has even been called the \\"fifty pacer\\" or, in extreme examples, the \\"five-step snake.\\" This often causes bite victims to needlessly amputate or burn bitten fingers or limbs, resulting in further complications like the loss of the amputated body part or gangrene. Nevertheless, this species is considered dangerous, and fatalities are not unusual. An antivenom is produced in Taiwan. Brown (1973) mentions a venom yield of up to 214 mg (dried) and (toxicity) values of 0.04 mg/kg IV, 4.0 mg/kg IP and 9.2–10.0 mg/kg SC.Brown JH (1973). Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73–229. . The venom contains at least four hemorrhagins Acutolysin A, B, C and D. According to the US Armed Forces Pest Management Board, the venom is a potent hemotoxin that is strongly hemorrhagic. Bite symptoms include severe local pain and bleeding that may begin almost immediately. This is followed by considerable swelling, blistering, necrosis, and ulceration. Systemic symptoms, which often include heart palpitations, may occur suddenly and relatively soon after the bite. Because of its body size and large hinged fangs which permit effective delivery of large quantities of venom, victims bitten by this snake should be treated accordingly. Venom use in research and medicine The venom of this species is commonly used for research purposes. Researchers have found that this venom contains protease activity, meaning it attacks and degrades intra- and extracellular proteins. If injected into mice, within 2 hours the venom begins a process known as mesangiolysis (the degeneration and death of cells that line the inner layer of the glomerulus and regulate glomerular filtration in the kidney). Eventually, the kidneys no longer function and the mouse dies. When controlled, the venom has some clinical application. D. acutus snake venom contains a protein called ACTX-6. This protein was shown to induce apoptosis (cell death) in isolated cancer cells through Fas pathway activation. Fas is a protein that becomes a death receptor in the cellular membrane. When activated, Fas turns on what is called a \\"caspase cascade\\".Weinberg, Robert A. The Biology of Cancer. Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group.(2007);343–350. . This pathway is made up of a series of proteins called initiator and executioner caspases. Initiator caspases help form an apoptosis initiation factor that eventually activates executioner caspases (see figure 3). Executioner caspases go on to \\"digest\\" the cell from the inside out. They cleave cytoskeleton filaments and DNA until the cell completely implodes. Venom and traditional Chinese medicine Deinagkistrodon acutus venom has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to extract antivenin that is successfully used to treat snakebites. Different parts of the snake are also prescribed to help alleviate ailments known as \\"wind diseases\\". Because these snakes move so quickly, substances from their bodies are thought to easily treat these fast-moving \\"wind\\" syndromes.

She appears as a ghost-like, hill-shaped body with two cold staring eyes and a wide row of white shiny teeth. In the book Who Will Comfort Toffle?, it is mentioned that she has a tail, but it has never been seen. Wherever she stands, the ground below her freezes and plants and grass die. She leaves a trace of ice and snow when she walks the ground. Anything that she touches will freeze. On one occasion, she froze a campfire by sitting down on it. She seeks friendship and warmth, but she is declined by everyone and everything, leaving her in her cold cavern on top of the Lonely Mountains. On one occasion in a comic, however, she was hailed as a heroine when she, in her constant search for warmth, extinguished a forest wildfire by sitting on it. In another comic, Sniff has made a magical potion with seemingly random effects. In curiosity, he drips a few drops on an ant which then transforms into the Groke. It is never made clear if this is how the Groke came to be, or if the ant transformed to another creature of the same type. The ant was never seen again after this.  Books she appears in  *3. Finn Family Moomintroll - This is the first appearance of the Groke, and she is generally played as a frightening villain, though Sniff expresses a bit of sympathy for her, at one point moving himself to tears with a speech on how awful it must be to be so alone. *4. The Exploits of Moominpappa - Here, several characters refer to the Groke eating people: the Joxter claims to have a cousin who was eaten by the Groke, and the young Moominpappa saves the Hemulen's Aunt from being eaten by the Groke. She is never actually seen to eat anyone, though, and since the book is written as Moominpappa's memoirs, it's quite possible (and quite in character) that he exaggerated things a little in order to make himself look more heroic. *6. Moominland Midwinter - The Groke makes a couple of cameo appearances, though she comes across as far less villainous and more to be pitied than feared. Too-Ticky even expresses sympathy for her when she wants to warm herself by the fire at the celebration for the sun, and ends up not only scaring everyone away but inadvertently putting out the fire with her own coldness. *8. Moominpappa at Sea - In this work, the Groke keeps on going to Moominpappa's island to beg Moomintroll to show her his lantern flame. This story builds on the new angle of the Groke that Too-Ticky offered in Moominland Midwinter, and is generally seen as the most sympathetic portrayal of her in the books, even containing short passages written from her point of view: constantly craving warmth and light but unable to get either. *Who Will Comfort Toffle? - Toffle bites her as he is saving Miffle, though it is not known whether she was holding Miffle hostage or not.  Adaptations  There have been various adaptations of the Moomin books on television. The Groke appears differently in the 1969 anime version of the Moomins, where she is depicted as white and depressed. In the Polish Moomin TV series, she is more like the character in the novels, but darker and bestial. The Japanese anime series Moomin includes her as the main antagonist. In the Japanese dub, she is referred to as Morran. She is distinctive from her first appearance in the series for her intimidating appearance and the loud growling sounds that she utters. Dubs in other languages use different growls, as well as different malevolent theme music, which begins to play every time she appears. The Groke's primary introductions were in episode 6, 7 and 22 of the series. It was not until episode 37 that she was presented more sympathetically. She also appears in the episode \\"Night of the Groke\\" in the 2019 series, in which she make a ghostly moaning sound as she slowly slides along, leaving an ice trail behind her as she searches for fire.

The capacity is 9,900 seats.http://www.gambrinusliga.cz/klub/2014/stadion/7-fc-slovan- liberec.html#tables History The stadium was built in 1933 and used for football matches of several Liberec sport clubs, the forerunners of today's Slovan Liberec. The field had a small wooden stand that time. Slovan did not use the stadium until 1978, before the club played on Městský (Municipal) stadium on the other side of Liberec. The original capacity was 5,000 spectators but after renovation work in 1995, capacity was increased to 7,000. In 1998, a lawn heating system was installed and a couple of months later, construction began on the North Stand. In 2000, Slovan Liberec installed floodlights due to a UEFA Cup match scheduled against Liverpool. Construction on the North Stand was completed in 2001.

Doctors explain that the gunshot has caused several injuries, and encourage Carmela and others to talk to him and play him music in hope of a recovery. However, they also warn that he could die or be left with brain damage. Carmela, Christopher, Meadow and Barbara keep a vigil over Tony, while Janice sobs uncontrollably whenever she sees him. A confused Junior is held in custody and denies that he shot his nephew. During Eugene's funeral, an impromptu meeting of the DiMeo family is held and Silvio assumes Tony's responsibilities as acting boss. They decide to cut Junior off from the family, making Tony the official boss. Chris, Paulie, and Vito vie for small opportunities to assist Tony's family during the crisis, such as sending presents to his room and bickering over giving a ride home to A.J. Alone with Tony, Carmela passionately expresses her love for him. Meadow reads him a translation of the poem Pater Noster by Jacques Prévert. Meanwhile, A.J. becomes increasingly withdrawn and avoids Tony's hospital room, claiming to have a stomach flu. He admits to Meadow that he is embarrassed and angered by the actions of his family. He finally gathers enough courage to talk to his comatose father when they are alone. Before leaving, A.J. vows to kill Junior. Afterwards, he admits to Carmela that he flunked junior college. She looks at him in stunned disbelief but holds in her anger and sends him away. Chris is now driving Johnny's Maserati Coupé. At Satriale's he happens to meet FBI Agents Harris and Goddard again. They sound him out about passing on any information he might hear about terrorist activities. At the Bada Bing, he talks briefly with two Middle Eastern men, who are now regulars there. While he is in a coma, Tony has a long dream-like experience which is woven through the episode. Tony awakens as a precision optics salesman inside a hotel room in Costa Mesa, California, missing his New Jersey accent. That night, he notices a strange light glowing on the horizon as he looks out the window, and on the TV in the hotel bar he sees a brush fire in Costa Mesa. The next morning he goes to a convention and is asked for ID to gain admittance. Unfortunately, Tony has someone else's wallet and briefcase: one belonging to a man named Kevin Finnerty from Kingman, Arizona, to whom he bears a resemblance. Tony says that he must have unintentionally picked up these items the previous evening at a bar across the street from his hotel. He returns to the bar, where a group of business travelers overhear him telling his story to the bartender who, when asked what Costa Mesa is like, replies, \\"Around here, it's dead.\\" The group invites Tony to join them for dinner, during which he discusses his 'life' in more detail, alluding to a midlife crisis by saying, \\"I mean, who am I? Where am I going?\\" As he and his group leave, Tony notices a commercial on TV, which shows the question, \\"Are sin, disease and death real?\\", followed by the Cross. After dinner, outside the hotel, Tony makes a pass at a woman from the group. She responds at first but then cuts him off. She tells him she saw his face when he got off the phone with his wife (whose voice is not Carmela's). Suddenly, a helicopter spotlight shines on the pair, to which the woman says, \\"They must be looking for a perp.\\" Here Tony awakens from his original coma, and rips out his breathing tube. He is moaning, \\"Who am I? Where am I going?\\" The dream resumes when he is placed in another coma. He checks into a different hotel, the Omni, under Finnerty's name. Two Buddhist monks overhear him checking in and, thinking he is Finnerty, accost him saying they had a horrible winter at the monastery because of Finnerty's faulty heating system. Tony tells them that he's not Finnerty, which angers the monks; they scuffle briefly and the monks flee, leaving Tony shocked at the violence. The next morning, the hotel elevator is out of order, so Tony takes the stairs. As he is walking down, he slips and falls; when brought to an emergency room, he is told by the doctor that aside from having a minor concussion, his CT scan shows some dark spots on his brain, caused by lack of oxygen. The doctor states that this indicates early stages of Alzheimer's disease. When the doctor leaves him, Tony says \\"I'm lost\\" to himself. After he returns to his hotel room, he picks up the phone, but hangs up before dialing, while the beacon of light flashes on the horizon.

Designed by Frank Spring with input from Carlo Felice Bianchi Anderloni of Carrozzeria Touring, and introduced 14 January 1954, the Italia was based on the Hudson Jet platform and running gear, but with a unique body and interior. Development During the early-1950s, Hudson began several product development programs that included the Hornet, a six-cylinder engine, the Jet, and the project that became the Italia. The management at Hudson Motors sought the publicity that Chrysler received from their work with Ghia and the resulting show cars. The Hudson Italia concept was to replicate the notoriety of concept cars such as the Chrysler Ghia Specials (1951–1953). The original idea \\"was to create a fast, sporty car, based on the hotfooted Hudson Hornet\\" and also for competition in the Carrera Panamericana. A flagship European-inspired experimental sports coupe that might rival Corvette, Nash Healey, Kaiser Darrin or the Ford Thunderbird, which was then just a rumor. The objective was to increase the Hudson's brand recognition and gauge public reaction styling ideas. During the development of the Hudson Jet line, chief designer Frank Spring wanted to bring a low-slung stylish car to Hudson's model range. Hudson's management \\"demanded ill-advised changes\\" that made the Jet look \\"dowdier\\" than Frank Spring had intended. To compensate, they \\"gave the unhappy Spring permission to build an 'experimental' sports car based on Jet mechanicals.\\" Spring was contemplating seeking employment at other design studios. He wanted to design a sports coupe that might rival the first six- cylinder Chevrolet Corvette, but with European inspired flair and grand touring luxury. Lacking sufficient capital to develop a new model, Hudson reached an agreement for a prototype to be built in Milan by Carrozzeria Touring. A complete Hudson Jet was shipped to Italy. A new body design, based on sketches by Frank Spring, was formed over a steel tubular frame. This unibody system of aluminum panels was known as superleggera (equivalent to “very lightweight” in Italian), and \\"was expensive and fairly revolutionary in its day.\\" The work done by Carrozzeria Touring was under the supervision of Spring and Hudson's vice-president, Stuart Baits.Flory, p. 1025. The Italia was the only project that Carrozzeria Touring undertook for a U.S. automaker. The price paid by Hudson for this concept car was reported to be only $28,000. It was a curious mix of Italian flair with American flash. After the prototype was completed in September 1953, Spring and his wife drove it around Italy. The car was shipped to the U.S. to be displayed at numerous Hudson dealerships across the country by late 1953, and it received positive customer reaction. It was on exhibited at automobile shows in the U.S. and some in Europe, as well as at the International Sports Car Show held in January 1954. This car first appeared under the \\"Super Jet\\" name and featured numerous advancements including its aluminum body, wraparound windshield (reminiscent of the 1953 Corvette),Flory, pp. 482 & 1025. doors that cut into the roof (also called aircraft doors) for easier entry and exit. Flory, pp.126 & 1025. the Italia was lower than the Jet, and rode on a wheelbase.Flory, pp. 579 & 581. The prototype also featured Borrani chrome wire wheels and its column mounted three-speed transmission included an overdrive unit. Design Carrozzeria Touring's construction technique of a thin wall tubing superstructure covered by hand-formed aluminum panels was used by several European automakers for their lightweight racing models; however, the Hudson's Jet unit construction required using the regular car's production floorpan and cowl, thus effectively negating any weight savings for the Italia. While styling for the Jet was conservative, the Italia was anything but. The Italia was lower than a Jet. Over the headlights, the front fenders featured \\"V\\" shaped scoops, ducting cooling air to the front brakes, but they really only vent \\"the underside of the fender and the top of the tire.\\" The front bumper sported a large inverted \\"V\\" (the trademark Hudson triangle, inverted) in the center that angled up and overlapped the grille work. Rear quarter scoops cooled the rear brakes. In the back of the car, the tail, directional, and back-up lamps tipped the ends of three stacked chrome tubes per side, emerging from scalloped cut-outs in the rear quarter panels. The production models did not receive overdrive, the instrument panel was different, and a combination of leather-and-vinyl upholstery was used. The Italia featured a radio (not yet standard equipment even on Cadillacs),Flory, p.550. form-fitting bucket seats made from foam rubber three different densities for maximum comfort covered in red and white leather, featuring reclining backrests made up of two contoured bolsters, one for the shoulders and one for the lower back. The seats were firmer at the lower back than the upper and between the two cushions was air space so \\"the seats actually 'breathed' through the motion of the passengers.\\" A non-reflecting dash was finished in red, with bright red deep-pile Italian carpet, all contrasting with the \\"Italian Cream\\" exterior color. Even red leather seat belts were incorporated as they were just beginning to appear as standard equipment that was pioneered by NashFlory, pp. 296 & 1025. but attached only to the seats themselves. Flow-through ventilation, usually credited as a General Motors innovation, feeding through a cowl vent (just becoming usual in 1950s U.S. cars),Flory, pp. 469-580 passim. was also standard. The Italia was powered by Hudson's \\"Twin H\\" L-head straight 6, with higher (8:1) compression and dual one-barrel (single choke) downdraft carburetors, producing and all were equipped with a 3-speed manual transmission with a column-mounted gear shift lever. The cars featured drum brakes front and rear. The trunk was accessible only from inside the car as part of a large luggage platform behind the seats with straps to hold cargo and lockable storage compartments on either side of the platform. Production Hudson Italia at the 2016 Techno-Classica show in Essen Hudson commissioned Carrozzeria Touring to build what is believed to have been a total of 50 cars and sent the needed \\"Super Jet\\" components to Italy. Despite lower labor costs in Italy, the hand-built car's price tag was US$4,350 at the New York port of entry (POE) according to an AMC press release (undated) or $4,800 FOB Detroit, per a September 23, 1953, Hudson letter to dealers and as listed in the Motor Trend October 1954 issue. This was more than the a price of a Cadillac at that time (the Sixty-Two Coupe de Ville started at $3,995). Hudson dealers began taking orders on September 23, 1953, but the response was lukewarm with only 18 or 19 firm orders. The Italia's price was high and dealers were disappointed that the more powerful Hornet engine was not offered. Less expensive were the $4,721 Nash-Healey, the $3,668 Kaiser Darrin, and the $3,523 Chevrolet Corvette. On January 14, 1954, Hudson Motors and Nash-Kelvinator Corporation announced a merger to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Hudson's prospects as a stand-alone independent marque ended with full consolidation under AMC by May 1954. The newly formed automaker sent letters to all Hudson dealers announcing a deadline for pre- paid orders from customers for the cars assembled in Italy. However, \\"orphan\\" branded cars, such as the Nash and Hudson, were shunned by customers and depreciated quickly. Orders for the Italia were almost nonexistent and AMC committed to have only another 15 Italias built. The managers of the newly merged automakers at AMC had no intentions for the Italia to expand and further problems were encountered when Carrozzeria Touring refused to supply spare body and trim parts. Roy D. Chapin, Jr. \\"was the sales manager for the Italia program and was ordered to get rid of those cars.\\" Most of the Italias were sold to the eccentric customers in Southern California. Twenty-one of the 26 Italias have been accounted for. The missing five cars carry serial numbers 5 through 10, with two in this group located in Europe, thus leading to speculation that these early cars were never delivered to the U.S. Contemporary reports indicated that the cars were sold in Europe.Kraus & Elton, p. 88. X-161 prototype A single four-door sedan prototype (dubbed X-161 for Spring's 161st experimental prototype) powered with the Hornet engine was also constructed. This was a much larger car based not on the compact Jet, but on the full sized Hornet. It delivered good performance and employed many of the features of the Italia, though its ornamentation was somewhat more subdued. It was also built in Italy by Carrozzeria Touring as a working prototype for Hudson's replacement of its step-down models. The X-161 is also described to be the last \\"real\\" Hudson. Legacy The Hudson Italia gained international recognition, but only 25 of these stylish models were produced, in addition to the single prototype. The automobile was Hudson's \\"last gasp for an image-building smash hit.\\" The authors of the book 365 Cars You Must Drive wrote that the decision represented \\"going for broke\\" in that it would bring benefits if the car was successful in the marketplace and would help lift sales for the company. In retrospect, the Italia was one of the \\"disasters\\" for the automaker, but represented \\"typical product development in the automobile industry\\" at the time. The Italia's massive grille design was later adapted on the 1956 Hudson that introduced after the merger of the two companies. Automobile collector, Gordon Apker, described the Italia’s looks: \\"it's the 50s; it's Flash Gordon, it's Italian drama on an American platform.\\" The Hudson Italia was similar to the concept developed by Ford for its original Mustang, as it was \\"a small, sporty, eye-catching coupe that fairly bristled with styling innovations. The Italia was about the same size as the Mustang, and like Ford's \\"pony car\\" it borrowed its mechanical components from the company's existing compact sedan. However, it pre-dated the Mustang by a full 10 years.\\" Collectibility Hudson Italias are invited to numerous prestigious car shows including Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and regularly earn special awards. A Hudson Italia with chassis number 11 was formerly part of the Harrah Collection, which acquired in 1971, reportedly from Liberace, finished in silver with red and black leather upholstery. The market value of the Hudson Italia is increasing as evidenced by a \\"no reserve\\" sale of car number 21 for $396,000 at the 2013 Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale. This car was of such quality that Sports Car Market magazine's analysis was that \\"the buyer went home with a screaming deal.\\" Other cars on the market in 2009 and 2012 have also resulted in sales above $250,000. A Hudson Italia with serial number 003 that underwent a ground-up concours level restoration that took from September 2009 to December 2010, was a class award winner at Pebble Beach in 2011, was priced at $500,000 in 2013. A Hudson Italia that was recognized as the \\"Best Preserved Post-War Car\\" at the 2014 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este was priced at €575,000.

In 1977 Holland moved to Los Angeles to pursue her career. In 1996 she became the first student to earn a master's degree in Commercial Music from California State University, Los Angeles and in 1997 joined the faculty; running the Master's in Commercial Music from 1998-2010. Music career=Animal Logic (1987-1991) In 1987, Holland won the audition to be the lead singer and songwriter of Animal Logic, after a two-song demo tape was forwarded to Police drummer Stewart Copeland by publisher Dan Howell. She was selected over hundreds of other singers who auditioned for the band. Holland is credited with writing nearly all the songs recorded by the group. Animal Logic released their debut album Animal Logic in 1989, peaking at No. 106 on the Billboard 200. A second album, Animal Logic II was released in 1991. Both albums featured guest appearances from well-known musicians, including: Jackson Browne, David Lindley, George Duke, Steve Howe and Freddie Hubbard. The band toured and appeared on The David Letterman Show, The Tonight Show, and had videos on MTV and VH1. In a March 2020 interview with sterwartcopeland.com, Deborah confirmed that Animal Logic has been working on material for a new EP: “We’re in the process of finishing up five songs though the bulk of the work is now on Stanley’s shoulders and he has a crazy schedule so it may take a while.” Solo recordings (1988-2007) In the years following the demise of Animal Logic, Holland released five solo albums, and has recorded and performed music for movies, television and commercials. In 1988 Deborah recorded \\"Come To Me\\" from the movie Fright Night Part 2. She also contributed to the I.R.S. Records compilation Just In Time For Christmas (1990), providing the song “It Only Comes Once a Year”. She has scored five films, including Circuitry Man, and has had two collaborations with Stewart Copeland used in films; “Heaven is a Place” in the 1991 movie Highlander II: The Quickening, and “For One Moment” in the 1992 television movie Afterburn. More recently, Holland's songs have appeared in the television shows Keeping Up with the Kardashians, My Name Is Earl, and Longmire. The Refugees (2007-2012) In 2007 Holland formed a folk supergroup called The Refugees, with Wendy Waldman and Cidny Bullens. The group released their first album Unbound in 2009, which won the International Acoustic Music Award for Best Album. The Refugees' second album, Three, was released in 2012 and made the Folk DJs' Top 20 charts as well as charting on Roots Music Report's TOP 50 Folk charts. The trio toured extensively throughout the U.S. and in Canada appearing at venues, arts centers, folk clubs, and festivals, including the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Wheatland Music Festival, Canmore Folk Festival, the Iowa Women's Music Festival and more. Vancouver (2013) Holland's most recent album, Vancouver, was released June 2013. The album is her first CanCon recording and received international radio play. The record charted for over nine months on Roots Music Report's Top 50 Americana/Roots chart and Galaxie Music's Canadian Folk charts. The song “Home” made the finals of the International Acoustic Music Awards. Fine, Thank You! (2020) On March 23, 2019 Deborah made the announcement on her official Facebook page that she was working on 2 new EPs - a solo release for 2020, and one with Animal Logic with no set release date. On Feb 25, 2020 it was announced that Deborah would release her sixth solo album, Fine, Thank You on March 27. The six song offering was produced by Winston Hauschild and features performances by Stewart Copeland (on four tracks), JUNO-winning backup vocalist Shari Ulrich, and Patterson Barrett on pedal steel. Personal life After receiving a master's degree from California State University, Los Angeles, Holland joined the faculty, running the Master's in Commercial Music program from 1998 to 2010. In 2010, Holland relocated from Los Angeles to Vancouver, BC. In 2011, Holland began teaching songwriting at Langara College in Vancouver.

Biography Born in Champaign County, Illinois, Reed moved to Kansas with his family when he was four years old. After completing a basic education, he taught school for a single year then began work as a federal employee. He served in different capacities for the next thirty years. He first worked for the railroad mail carrier service, rising to be superintendent of several areas throughout the Midwest and then to the Railway Adjustment Division, Post Office Department superintendent. He married Minnie E. Hart in 1891 and they had ten children. Career In 1919, Reed became personal secretary to Governor Henry J. Allen in Topeka, who was also owner and publisher of the \\"Wichita Beacon\\". Four years later, he purchased controlling interest in the \\"Parsons Sun\\" newspaper of Parsons, Kansas and continued as publisher until his death in 1949. He served on the Kansas Industrial Court from 1920 to 1921, and was a member of the Public Utilities Commission from 1921 to 1924. Reed was elected Governor of Kansas in 1929, after becoming known as a candidate for being extremely progressive. Shortly after he moved into the governor's mansion, the Great Depression began. Reed called an extra session of the state legislature to combat the troubles faced by Kansans dealing with the depression. Reed was defeated in his bid for renomination in 1930, and returned to newspaper editing. When the anti-Semitic preacher Gerald B. Winrod ran for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in 1938 and seemed likely to win it, Reed was recruited by the mainstream political establishment as a popular figure who could prevent Winrod's nomination. Reed won the nomination and the general election, unseating incumbent Democrat George McGill, and was re-elected in 1944, and served in that office until his death. While in the Senate, his fellow Kansas Senator was also a former governor, Arthur Capper. Reed attempted to obtain the 1942 Republican nomination for governor of Kansas but failed. Death Reed died in 1949 while on a visit home from the Senate. He in interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Parsons.

The cemetery inters members of all religious groups: Catholic, Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, Protestant, Latter Day Saints; irreligious graves can all be found. In the arcades are the last resting places of many famous Croatians. History The Mirogoj Cemetery was built on a plot of land owned by the linguist Ljudevit Gaj, purchased by the city in 1872, after his death. Architect Hermann Bollé designed the main building. The new cemetery was inaugurated on 6 November 1876. The construction of the arcades, the cupolas, and the church in the entryway was begun in 1879. Due to lack of funding, work was finished only in 1929. Unlike the older cemeteries, which were church- owned, Mirogoj was owned by the city, and accepted burials from all religious backgrounds. On March 22nd 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zagreb was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake that caused significant damage across the city, including the damage on the famous arcades of the Mirogoj cemetery.https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/zagreb/foto-nadrealni-prizori-s- mirogoja-potres-je-izazvao-milijunsku-stetu-ugrozene-su-cuvene-bollove-arkade- a-crkvi-krista-kralja-prijeti-urusavanje/10127125/ Notable interments *Zlatko Baloković - violinist *Hermann Bollé - architect *Ivana Brlić- Mažuranić - writer *Ferdinand Budicki - automotive and air travel pioneer of Zagreb, introduced cars to the city *Krešimir Ćosić - member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and FIBA Hall of Fame *Tošo Dabac - renown photographer *Arsen Dedić - singer-songwriter and composer *Dimitrija Demeter - a Greek Croatian, who played a major role in the movement for the national awakening of the Croatian nation *Filip Deutsch - nobleman and industrialist *Julio Deutsch - architect and co-owner of the architecture studio Hönigsberg & Deutsch *Janko Drašković \\\\- Croatian noble, national reformer, politician and poet *Hugo Ehrlich - known architect *Aleksandar Ehrmann - known industrialist, philanthropist and diplomat *Ljudevit Gaj, cited in \\\\- co-founder of the Illyrian movement *Leo Hönigsberg - Croatian architect and co-owner of the architecture studio Hönigsberg & Deutsch *Hosea Jacobi - Chief Rabbi of Zagreb *Miroslav Krleža - writer *Oton Kučera - astronomer *Zinka Kunc (Milanov), famous soprano *Svetozar Kurepa - mathematician *Ante Kovačić - writer from Hrvatsko Zagorje *Vatroslav Lisinski - composer *Vladko Maček - politician, co-signatory of the Cvetković-Maček Agreement *Savić Marković Štedimlija - Montenegrin-Croat publicist. *Antun Gustav Matoš - writer *Andrija Mohorovičić - sismologist *Edo Murtić - painter *Vladimir Nazor - writer and first President of People's Republic/Socialist Republic of Croatia *Maximilian Njegovan - Commander-in-chief and admiral of the Austro-Hungarian NavyMaximilian Njegovan *Slavoljub Eduard Penkala - Inventor *Dražen Petrović - member of both the Naismith and FIBA Halls of Fame *Milka Planinc - first and only female prime minister of Yugoslavia *Vladimir Prelog - Nobel prize-winning chemist *Petar Preradović - poet *Stjepan Radić - leader of the Croatian Peasants Party *August Šenoa \\\\- writer *Ivica Šerfezi - singer and politician supporter of HSS *Ivan Šubašić - last Ban of Croatia *Milka Ternina, famous soprano *Franjo Tuđman - the first president of Republic of Croatia *Vice Vukov - singer and politician *Tin Ujević - poet *Emil Uzelac - head of the Austro-Hungarian air force *Ivan Zajc - composer Memorials *Monument to Fallen Croatian Soldiers in World War I (1919) *Monument to the children from the Kozara mountain *Tomb of the People's Heroes (1968) *Memorial Cross to Croatian Home Guard Soldiers (1993) *Monument to the Victims of Bleiburg and the Way of the Cross (1994) *German military cemetery (1996) *Monument of the \\"Voice of Croatian Victims - Wall of Pain\\" (to Croatian victims of the Croatian War of Independence) Location and access It is located today in the Gornji Grad - Medveščak city district, on Mirogojska Road and Hermann Bollé Street.

Paxton and Sadler star as two firemen who decide to search an abandoned building for a hidden treasure but wind up being targeted by a street gang. Trespass was written years earlier by a pre-Back to the Future Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. Plot Two Arkansas firemen, Vince (Bill Paxton) and Don (William Sadler), meet a hysterical old man in a burning building. The old man hands them a map, prays for forgiveness, then allows himself to be engulfed in flames. Outside the fire and away from everyone else, Don does a little research and finds out that the man was a thief who stole a large amount of gold valuables from a church and hid them in a building in East St. Louis. The two decide to drive there, thinking they can get there, get the gold, and get back in one day. While looking around in the abandoned building, they are spotted by a gang, led by King James (Ice-T), who is there to execute an enemy. Vince and Don witness the murder, but give themselves away and only manage to force a stalemate when they grab Lucky (De'voreaux White), King James' half-brother. Barricading themselves behind a door, they continue trying to find where the gold is at. Adding to their troubles is an old homeless man, Bradlee (Art Evans), who had stumbled in on them while they were trying to find the gold. King James eventually calls in some reinforcements. While doing some reconnaissance, Raymond (Bruce A. Young), the man who supplies guns to King James, finds Don and Vince's car and the news of the gold, and figures out why \\"two white boys\\" would be in their neighborhood. Raymond manipulates Savon (Ice Cube), one of James' men (who would rather just kill Don and Vince than follow James' approach of trying to talk to them) into shooting at Don and Vince, which eventually leads to Lucky's being shot himself. (Savon: \\"I guess he wasn't too lucky, huh?\\") King James is now furious and runs after Don and Vince, who have now found the stash of gold (having determined the map was drawn with the intention of looking UP at the ceiling, instead of down at the floor) and are trying to get out with it while avoiding King James. The gold changes hands several times, once with Savon, then again with Bradlee, while people are shooting everywhere. Eventually, Don and King James meet and end up killing each other. Savon and Raymond also kill each other. The building they were in gets burned to the ground. Vince encounters Bradlee outside the building, and Bradlee tells Vince to run. (Vince cannot drive away, since Raymond ripped out the wires in his engine, gave him four flat tires, and cut the line to his CB radio). Once Vince is out of the way, Bradlee picks up the haul of gold that was left behind and walks away, laughing.

Young as Raymond * Tommy Lister, Jr. as Cletus * Stoney Jackson as Wickey Production=Development The script was originally called The Looters and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote it in the 1970s. Years later, Neil Canton showed it to director Walter Hill. Hill says he liked the script \\"enormously\\": > I was quite surprised because it's certainly not the kind of story that > Zemeckis and Gale identified with... but I thought it was enormously primal, > elemental, brutal, and a great confrontation. It was totally dependent upon > the narrative circumstances to reveal character and of course it took place > in a time compression—both are things I'm very fond of.\\"Walter Hill\\" by > Larry Gross Bomb Winter 1993 accessed 7 February 2015 W Hill was a writer and tended to work on the scripts of all his films: > I don't think the script changed all that much, to tell you the truth. > Although there's certainly no scene in the movie that wasn't rewritten many > times. The script evolved because of certain location problems and we worked > out a new ending. The only thing that is significantly different from the > script is that the film gives a lot more screen time to King James and his > gang and the ending is quite a bit different from the original. \\"I wanted to make a down-and-dirty thriller\\", said Hill. \\"I wanted to shoot it in a fast, hard style. I wanted to work off the cuff, making it all happen right there.\\" Hill says the film was not intentionally political. > It is an adventure story that harkens back to a Jack London tradition. And > what makes that striking, is that it is so much more real than what we > presume action adventure movies to be—what they have evolved to be in the > last 20 years. When I was a kid, they were all about very real people in > tough circumstances, now the action movie is half science fiction movie. > This movie is very much a throwback in that sense—with the permanently > strained relations between blacks and whites and browns and orientals in our > ghettos, our inner cities... But... just because the films intentions are > not political, doesn't mean it's not political. Movies take on their own > life. This is not a movie about racial confrontation in the sense that the > confrontation had nothing to do with race... Inevitably, white and black > attitudes spill into the movie because of the attempt to create some kind of > social reality out of the situation. Casting Hill says Ice T and Ice Cube were hired on their strength as actors. \\"I'm a rhythm-and-blues man, myself\\", he said. \\"I'm not particularly a rap fan and (before production began) I'd never heard any of their records.\\" \\"This is the first film where I'm the point blank star, where I'm carrying the movie\\", said Ice T. \\"I think it's good for the kids to see black faces on the screen in all kinds of movies\\", said Ice Cube. \\"Every movie doesn't have to be about the black families in the ghetto. This one is about money and how it can make people turn evil.\\" Shooting Hill says the idea to have so much of the movie shot through video tape came as they were getting ready to make the movie. He read an article in the Washington Post about street gangs who would film a lot of their own activities. Hill: > I simply saw it as a visual opportunity to play a lot of the movie through a > viewfinder. I thought it might get you inside the gang better... I wanted > everything to be rough around the edge. We shot most of the movie hand > held... I wanted it to be herky-jerky. We Dutched a lot of the angles, > especially as the story unfolds because the story gets crazier and crazier. > We went from a less elegant—the early parts of the movie, there are no hand > helds at all—but as the story gets more nervous and crazy, we go more and > more to a hand held thing until, finally, the end of the movie is all > entirely hand held. Filming began on November 4, 1991. The film was mostly shot at the vacant Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill, formerly an operating mill complex located in the Cabbagetown neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. Construction of the complex began in 1881 on the south side of the Georgia Railroad line, east of downtown Atlanta, on the site of the Atlanta Rolling Mill. The site now includes separate phases of multi-family dwellings including for-rent apartments (called The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts) and for-sale condominiums (The Stacks). Filming was completed on February 5, 1992. Hill allowed Ice T and Ice Cube input into the dialogue. \\"They certainly had a lot of input in terms of, \\"What my guy would say is this. He wouldn't say it that way; he'd say it this way.\\" And I gave them a very free on all that.\\" Music A musical score had been written by another composer but Hill was dissatisfied with it and he brought in Ry Cooder to do a new score. Cooder says Hill \\"wanted something that was spooky and weird, and I got some experimental instruments together and improvised in the studio with Jim Keltner and Jon Hassell\\" Cooder said it was \\"difficult for me to musically relate to a film that mostly took place indoors. Trespass's environment hardly changed, and it was interesting for me to solve the problems that brought up.\\" Release The film was meant to be released on 3 July but this date was delayed due to the 1992 Los Angeles riots; the film was retitled and a new marketing campaign devised. \\"The movie tested great\\", said Universal chairman Tom Pollock. \\"Unfortunately, it can't work now on its own terms. Attention would focus on black guys with machine guns going after white guys. It would be irresponsible to release it now, even under a different title.\\" Ice T said, \\"When we were shooting the movie, you'd say 'Looters' and everybody'd go 'Loo-loo-what?' You'd have to spell it. After the riots, everybody's like, oh, you doin' a movie called 'Looters' – about the riots?\\" The movie was also given a new ending after test screenings wherein black audiences expressed dissatisfaction with the end, when both Ice-T and Ice Cube died. \\"The message of the movie got lost in the gunfire\\", said Bob Gale. This is why in the movie death scene of Ice Cube's character Savon is not shown. Alternate ending was also filmed during production in which Raymond is not killed by Savon but instead he gets shot in the leg by Vince who along with Bradlee escapes in Raymond's Jaguar and they turn the gold to the police. Jazz musician John Zorn originally scored the entire film, complete with multiple cues and even scored both the original and alternate endings. As with Elmer Bernstein on his 1996 film Last Man Standing, Hill fired Zorn because he was unhappy with his score and hired his old friend Ry Cooder to rescore the whole film.http://monoskop.org/John_Zorn \\"Somehow, the riots tainted the movie\\", said Hill, and when the picture's release was pushed back, \\"inevitably, a lot of people came to the conclusion that you have something to hide, something to be ashamed of... If the movie is successful on the terms I call successful, it should be disturbing . . . which it is to some degree. It's not a social statement and does not offer a cure-the action, the characters are fictional-but like any good story there's a certain amount of social truth to it.\\" The film was also retitled as it was felt Looters was too inflammatory. The studio came up with 50 alternatives and the filmmakers at least another 20, including \\"Point of No Return\\", \\"The Intruders\\", \\"Burning Gold\\", \\"Greed\\", \\"Fire Trap\\" and \\"Blood and Gold\\", among others. Hill did not like Trespass because it reminded him of a title to a 1950s era RKO movie starring Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell. \\"Psychologically, changing the name was more devastating than moving the movie because it was like changing the name of one of your children\\", he said. \\"But with the two Ices and the title 'Looters,' I had to see (Universal's) point.\\" Eventually he settled on Trespass. The film was also affected by controversy when Ice T asked Warner Bros to remove the song \\"Cop Killer\\" from his album Body Count. \\"Our chance lies in counter programming\\", said Bob Gale. \\"There's so much sweetness and light this time of year, why not an action picture? 'Trespass,' unlike so many other current releases, delivers what it sets out to deliver in 101 minutes. For my money, that's holiday enough.\\" Reception The film gained mixed to positive reviews from critics. As of November 2, 2018, Trespass holds a 69% critics' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. Box office The film debuted poorly. It went on to gross just $13.7 million in North America.

More abstractly, the field of additive number theory includes the study of abelian groups and commutative semigroups with an operation of addition. Additive number theory has close ties to combinatorial number theory and the geometry of numbers. Two principal objects of study are the sumset of two subsets A and B of elements from an abelian group G, :A + B = {a+b : a \\\\in A, b \\\\in B}, and the h-fold sumset of A, :hA = \\\\underset{h}{\\\\underbrace{A + \\\\cdots + A}}\\\\,. Additive number theory The field is principally devoted to consideration of direct problems over (typically) the integers, that is, determining the structure of hA from the structure of A: for example, determining which elements can be represented as a sum from hA, where A is a fixed subset.Nathanson (1996) II:1 Two classical problems of this type are the Goldbach conjecture (which is the conjecture that 2P contains all even numbers greater than two, where P is the set of primes) and Waring's problem (which asks how large must h be to guarantee that hAk contains all positive integers, where :A_k={0^k,1^k,2^k,3^k,\\\\ldots} is the set of k-th powers). Many of these problems are studied using the tools from the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and from sieve methods. For example, Vinogradov proved that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes, and so every sufficiently large even integer is the sum of four primes. Hilbert proved that, for every integer k > 1, every non-negative integer is the sum of a bounded number of k-th powers. In general, a set A of nonnegative integers is called a basis of order h if hA contains all positive integers, and it is called an asymptotic basis if hA contains all sufficiently large integers. Much current research in this area concerns properties of general asymptotic bases of finite order. For example, a set A is called a minimal asymptotic basis of order h if A is an asymptotic basis of order h but no proper subset of A is an asymptotic basis of order h. It has been proved that minimal asymptotic bases of order h exist for all h, and that there also exist asymptotic bases of order h that contain no minimal asymptotic bases of order h. Another question to be considered is how small can the number of representations of n as a sum of h elements in an asymptotic basis can be. This is the content of the Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases.

Political career Manning first stood for election in 1979 as a Fine Gael candidate for the Dublin constituency at the first European Parliament election, when he did not win a seat. He was unsuccessful again when he stood at the 1981 general election in the Dublin North-East constituency, but was then elected on the Cultural and Educational Panel to the 15th Seanad. At the February 1982 Dáil election he stood again in Dublin North-East, winning a seat in the 23rd Dáil Éireann. He retained his seat at the November 1982 general election, but was defeated at the 1987 general election. He stood again in Dublin North-East at the 1989 general election, and in Dublin South at the 1992 general election but never returned to the Dáil. After his 1987 defeat he was elected to the 18th Seanad, again on the Cultural and Educational Panel, and was re-elected three more times until he did not contest the 2002 election to the 22nd Seanad, when Fine Gael chose not to nominate him. After the 2002 general election Manning had initially announced his intention to stand down, but when Enda Kenny was elected as party leader, he stayed on. However following the loss of 20 Dáil seats in 2002, the party's nominating committee chose to prioritise candidates who could challenge for Dáil seats at the next election, and he was not nominated. It was reported that this may have been related to a dispute with the Fine Gael Chairman, Senator Pádraic McCormack, whom Manning had threatened to challenge for the chairmanship. In the early 1980s Manning was a member of the New Ireland Forum and later of the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly. He served as Leader of the Seanad from 1995 to 1997 and as Leader of the Opposition in the Seanad from 1997 to 2002. Human Rights Commission As president of the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC), he has represented it since October 2006 in two successive two-year terms when the IHRC has chaired the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions. The IHRC has also represented the European Group within the Bureau of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions (ICC), the global network of NHRIs closely associated with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In 2012, with plans announced to merge the IHRC with the Equality Authority, it was expected that Manning would be appointed as the first head of the merged entity.

Frederick Piesse was born at Northam, Western Australia, on 6 December 1853. The son of policeman and magistrate William Roper Piesse and Elizabeth Ellen née Oxley, among his brothers were Alfred Napoleon Piesse, Arnold Piesse and Charles Austin Piesse, all of whom would follow Frederick into politics. Piesse was educated at state schools at Guildford and Northam, and began his working life at the Northam general store. Later he went pearl fishing at Shark Bay between 1872 and 1875. He was postmaster and telegraphist at Williams between 1875 and 1880. On 18 October 1877 he married Mary Jane Elizabeth Chipper, with whom he would have four sons and a daughter. In 1880, Piesse partnered with his brother Charles to launch the general produce firm of F. & C. Piesse at Williams. He set up a portable store in 1886, and followed the progress of the Great southern railway, finishing up at Katanning. He then bought agricultural land near the railway and in 1891 built a flour mill in Katanning. He established a wine industry, making wines that won awards in Perth, London and Paris. An 1892 newspaper article described in detail a orchard Piesse had created near to the township of Katanning which contained 2300 trees. From 1880 onwards, Piesse became increasingly involved in public affairs. He was a member of the Williams Road Board from 1880 to 1889, and its chairman from 1886. In 1889 he became a Justice of the Peace, and from 1889 to 1896 he was on the Katanning Road Board. From January 1894 to June 1896 he was also a member of the Board of Agriculture. At the 1890 election, Piesse was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Williams, becoming a member of the first Parliament of Western Australia under responsible government. From 1 April 1896 to 23 August 1900, he was Commissioner for Railways and Director of Public Works in the Forrest Ministry. He was a Western Australian delegate to the Federal Convention of 1897, and for a period in 1900 he was Acting Premier of Western Australia. During George Leake's first premiership from June to November 1901, Piesse was Leader of the Opposition. In the 1904 election, Piesse stood for and won the new seat of Katanning. He would hold the seat until his resignation on 26 October 1909. For his last four years in parliament he was Father of the House. Piesse was made a CMG in 1908. He died at Katanning on 29 June 1912, and was buried in Katanning Cemetery. References * Bignell, Merle. (1988) F.H.Piesse - biography of merchant, agriculturalist and politician.

It aims to give some of the benefits of multilevel security without needing special changes to the OS or applications, but at the cost of needing extra hardware. The drive to develop MLS operating systems was severely hampered by the dramatic fall in data processing costs in the early 1990s. Before the advent of desktop computing, users with classified processing requirements had to either spend a lot of money for a dedicated computer or use one that hosted an MLS operating system. Throughout the 1990s, however, many offices in the defense and intelligence communities took advantage of falling computing costs to deploy desktop systems classified to operate only at the highest classification level used in their organization. These desktop computers operated in system high mode and were connected with LANs that carried traffic at the same level as the computers. MSL implementations such as these neatly avoided the complexities of MLS but traded off technical simplicity for inefficient use of space. Because most users in classified environments also needed unclassified systems, users often had at least two computers and sometimes more (one for unclassified processing and one for each classification level processed). In addition, each computer was connected to its own LAN at the appropriate classification level, meaning that multiple dedicated cabling plants were incorporated (at considerable cost in terms of both installation and maintenance). Limits of MSL versus MLS The obvious shortcoming of MSL (as compared to MLS) is that it does not support immixture of various classification levels in any manner. For example, the notion of concatenating a SECRET data stream (taken from a SECRET file) with a TOP SECRET data stream (read from a TOP SECRET file) and directing the resultant TOP SECRET data stream into a TOP SECRET file is unsupported. In essence, an MSL system can be thought of as a set of parallel (and collocated) computer systems, each restricted to operation at one, and only one, security level. Indeed, the individual MSL operating systems may not even understand the concept of security levels, since they operate as single-level systems. For example, while one of a set of collocated MSL OS may be configured to affix the character string \\"SECRET\\" to all output, that OS has no understanding of how the data compares in sensitivity and criticality to the data processed by its peer OS that affixes the string \\"UNCLASSIFIED\\" to all of its output. Operating across two or more security levels then, must use methods extraneous to the purview of the MSL \\"operating systems\\" per se, and needing human intervention, termed \\"manual review\\". For example, an independent monitor (not in Brinch Hansen's sense of the term) may be provided to support migration of data among multiple MSL peers (e.g., copying a data file from the UNCLASSIFIED peer to the SECRET peer). Although no strict requirements by way of federal legislation specifically address the concern, it would be appropriate for such a monitor to be quite small, purpose-built, and supportive of only a small number of very rigidly defined operations, such as importing and exporting files, configuring output labels, and other maintenance/administration tasks that require handling all the collocated MSL peers as a unit rather than as individual, single-level systems. It may also be appropriate to utilize a hypervisor software architecture, such as VMware, to provide a set of peer MSL \\"OS\\" in the form of distinct, virtualized environments supported by an underlying OS that is only accessible to administrators cleared for all of the data managed by any of the peers. From the users' perspectives, each peer would present a login or X display manager session logically indistinguishable from the underlying \\"maintenance OS\\" user environment. Advances in MSL The cost and complexity involved in maintaining distinct networks for each level of classification led the National Security Agency (NSA) to begin research into ways in which the MSL concept of dedicated system high systems could be preserved while reducing the physical investment demanded by multiple networks and computers. Periods processing was the first advance in this area, establishing protocols by which agencies could connect a computer to a network at one classification, process information, sanitize the system, and connect it to a different network with another classification. The periods processing model offered the promise of a single computer but did nothing to reduce multiple cabling plants and proved enormously inconvenient to users; accordingly, its adoption was limited. In the 1990s, the rise of virtualization technology changed the playing field for MSL systems. Suddenly, it was possible to create virtual machines (VMs) that behaved as independent computers but ran on a common hardware platform. With virtualization, NSA saw a way to preserve periods processing on a virtual level, no longer needing the physical system to be sanitized by performing all processing within dedicated, system-high VMs. To make MSL work in a virtual environment, however, it was necessary to find a way to securely control the virtual session manager and ensure that no compromising activity directed at one VM could compromise another. MSL solutions NSA pursued multiple programs aimed at creating viable, secure MSL technologies leveraging virtualization. To date, three major solutions have materialized. * \\"Multiple Independent Levels of Security\\" or MILS, an architectural concept developed by Dr. John Rushby that combines high-assurance security separation with high- assurance safety separation. Subsequent refinement by NSA and Naval Postgraduate School in collaboration with Air Force Research Laboratory, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, Objective Interface Systems, University of Idaho, Boeing, Raytheon, and MITRE resulted in a Common Criteria EAL-6+ Protection Profile for a high-assurance separation kernel. * \\"NetTop\\", developed by NSA in partnership with VMWare, Inc., uses security-enhanced Linux (SELinux) as the base operating system for its technology. The SELinux OS securely holds the virtual session manager, which in turn creates virtual machines to perform processing and support functions. * The \\"Trusted Multi- Net\\", a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system based on a thin client model, was developed jointly by an industry coalition including Microsoft Corporation, Citrix Systems, NYTOR Technologies, VMWare, Inc., and MITRE Corporation to offer users access to classified and unclassified networks. Its architecture eliminates the need for multiple cabling plants, leveraging encryption to transmit all traffic over a cable approved for the highest level accessed. Both the NetTop and Trusted Multi-Net solutions have been approved for use. In addition, Trusted Computer Solutions has developed a thin-client product, originally based on the NetTop technology concepts through a licensing agreement with NSA. This product is called SecureOffice(r) Trusted Thin Client(tm), and runs on the LSPP configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHEL5). Three competing companies have implemented MILS separation kernels: * Green Hills Software * LynuxWorks * Wind River Systems In addition, there have been advances in the development of non-virtualization MSL systems through the use of specialized hardware, resulting in at least one viable solution: * The Starlight Technology (now marketed as the Interactive Link System), developed by the Australian Defence Science Technology Organisation (DSTO) and Tenix Pty Ltd, uses specialized hardware to allow users to interact with a \\"Low\\" network from a \\"High\\" network session within a window, without any data flowing from the \\"High\\" to the \\"Low\\" network. Philosophical aspects, ease of use, flexibility It is interesting to consider the philosophical implications of the MSL \\"solution path.\\" Rather than providing MLS abilities within a classical OS, the chosen direction is to build a set of \\"virtual OS\\" peers that can be managed, individually and as a collective, by an underlying real OS. If the underlying OS (let us introduce the term maintenance operating system, or MOS) is to have sufficient understanding of MLS semantics to prevent grievous errors, such as copying data from a TOP SECRET MSL peer to an UNCLASSIFIED MSL peer, then the MOS must have the ability to: represent labels; associate labels with entities (here we rigorously avoid the terms \\"subject\\" and \\"object\\"); compare labels (rigorously avoiding the term \\"reference monitor\\"); distinguish between those contexts where labels are meaningful and those where they are not (rigorously avoiding the term \\"trusted computing base\\" [TCB]); the list goes on. One readily perceives that the MLS architecture and design issues have not been eliminated, merely deferred to a separate stratum of software that invisibly manages mandatory access control concerns so that superjacent strata need not. This concept is none other than the geminal architectural concept (taken from the Anderson Report) underlying DoD-style trusted systems in the first place. What has been positively achieved by the set-of-MSL-peers abstraction, albeit, is radical restriction of the scope of MAC-cognizant software mechanisms to the small, subjacent MOS. This has been accomplished, however, at the cost of eliminating any practical MLS abilities, even the most elementary ones, as when a SECRET-cleared user appends an UNCLASSIFIED paragraph, taken from an UNCLASSIFIED file, to his SECRET report. The MSL implementation would obviously require every \\"reusable\\" resource (in this example, the UNCLASSIFIED file) to be replicated across every MSL peer that might find it useful—meaning either much secondary storage needlessly expended or intolerable burden on the cleared administrator able to effect such replications in response to users' requests therefor. (Of course, since the SECRET user cannot \\"browse\\" the system's UNCLASSIFIED offerings other than by logging out and beginning an UNCLASSIFIED system afresh, one evidences yet another severe limitation on functionality and flexibility.) Alternatively, less sensitive file systems could be NFS-mounted read-only so that more trustworthy users could browse, but not modify, their content. Albeit, the MLS OS peer would have no actual means for distinguishing (via a directory listing command, e.g.) that the NFS- mounted resources are at a different level of sensitivity than the local resources, and no strict means for preventing illegal uphill flow of sensitive information other than the brute-force, all-or-nothing mechanism of read-only NFS mounting. To demonstrate just what a handicap this drastic effectuation of \\"cross-level file sharing\\" actually is, consider the case of an MLS system that supports UNCLASSIFIED, SECRET, and TOP SECRET data, and a TOP SECRET cleared user who logs into the system at that level. MLS directory structures are built around the containment principle, which, loosely speaking, dictates that higher sensitivity levels reside deeper in the tree: commonly, the level of a directory must match or dominate that of its parent, while the level of a file (more specifically, of any link thereto) must match that of the directory that catalogs it. (This is strictly true of MLS UNIX: alternatives that support different conceptions of directories, directory entries, i-nodes, etc.—such as Multics, which adds the \\"branch\\" abstraction to its directory paradigm—tolerate a broader set of alternative implementations.) Orthogonal mechanisms are provided for publicly shared and spool directories, such as /tmp or C:\\\\TEMP, which are automatically—and invisibly—partitioned by the OS, with users' file access requests automatically \\"deflected\\" to the appropriately labeled directory partition. The TOP SECRET user is free to browse the entire system, his only restriction being that—while logged in at that level—he is only allowed to create fresh TOP SECRET files within specific directories or their descendants. In the MSL alternative, where any browsable content must be specifically, laboriously replicated across all applicable levels by a fully cleared administrator—meaning, in this case, that all SECRET data must be replicated to the TOP SECRET MSL peer OS, while all UNCLASSIFIED data must be replicated to both the SECRET and TOP SECRET peers—one can readily perceive that, the more highly cleared the user, the more frustrating his timesharing computing experience will be. In a classical trusted systems- theoretic sense—relying upon terminology and concepts taken from the Orange Book, the foundation of trusted computing—a system that supports MSL peers could not achieve a level of assurance beyond (B1). This is because the (B2) criteria require, among other things, both clear identification of a TCB perimeter and the existence of a single, identifiable entity that has the ability and authority to adjudicate access to all data represented throughout all accessible resources of the ADP system. In a very real sense, then, the application of the term \\"high assurance\\" as a descriptor of MSL implementations is nonsensical, since the term \\"high assurance\\" is properly limited to (B3) and (A1) systems—and, with some laxity albeit, to (B2) systems. Cross-domain solutions MSL systems, whether virtual or physical in nature, are designed to preserve isolation between different classification levels. Consequently, (unlike MLS systems), an MSL environment has no innate abilities to move data from one level to another. To permit data sharing between computers working at different classification levels, such sites deploy cross-domain solutions (CDS), which are commonly referred to as gatekeepers or guards. Guards, which often leverage MLS technologies themselves, filter traffic flowing between networks; unlike a commercial Internet firewall, however, a guard is built to much more stringent assurance requirements and its filtering is carefully designed to try to prevent any improper leakage of classified information between LANs operating at different security levels. Data diode technologies are used extensively where data flows are required to be restricted to one direction between levels, with a high level of assurance that data will not flow in the opposite direction. In general, these are subject to the same restrictions that have imposed challenges on other MLS solutions: strict security assessment and the need to provide an electronic equivalent of stated policy for moving information between classifications. (Moving information down in classification level is particularly challenging and typically requires approval from several different people.) As of late 2005, numerous high-assurance platforms and guard applications have been approved for use in classified environments. N.b. that the term \\"high-assurance\\" as employed here is to be evaluated in the context of DCID 6/3 (read \\"dee skid six three\\"), a quasi-technical guide to the construction and deployment of various systems for processing classified information, lacking both the precise legal rigidity of the Orange Book criteria and the underlying mathematical rigor. (The Orange Book is motivated by, and derived from, a logical \\"chain of reasoning\\" constructed as follows: [a] a \\"secure\\" state is mathematically defined, and a mathematical model is constructed, the operations upon which preserve secure state so that any conceivable sequence of operations starting from a secure state yields a secure state; [b] a mapping of judiciously chosen primitives to sequences of operations upon the model; and [c] a \\"descriptive top-level specification\\" that maps actions that can be transacted at the user interface (such as system calls) into sequences of primitives; but stopping short of either [d] formally demonstrating that a live software implementation correctly implements said sequences of actions; or [e] formally arguing that the executable, now \\"trusted,\\" system is generated by correct, reliable tools [e.g., compilers, librarians, linkers].)

The band recruit new members, revolutionise their sound, acquire management, arrange a showcase gig, get signed, record a hopelessly over-budget album and cut a chaotic swathe through the cut-throat world of marketing and promotions, finally resting at the dizzy heights of a top ten single and a massive £3 million debt. Along the way they encounter Slick Sloan (Keith Allen), the disingenuous A&R; man; Derek Trout (Fish), record producer; and their cheesy manager Art Stilton (Forbes Masson) who also manages supergroup 'Bonk, Bonk, Bonk'. The series also includes cameo appearances from Noel Gallagher, Chrissie Hynde, Jay Kay, 'Big' John Duncan, Denise van Outen, Sara Cox, Kirsty Wark, Samantha Fox, Edward Tudor-Pole, Keith Chegwin and Timmy Mallett. The series inspired an American version in 2002, My Guide to Becoming a Rock Star.

This gene encodes a cell surface glycoprotein which is typically expressed on endothelial cells and cells of the immune system. It binds to integrins of type CD11a / CD18, or CD11b / CD18 and is also exploited by rhinovirus as a receptor for entry into respiratory epithelium.  Structure  ICAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the superfamily of proteins including antibodies and T-cell receptors. ICAM-1 is a transmembrane protein possessing an amino-terminus extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a carboxy-terminus cytoplasmic domain. The structure of ICAM-1 is characterized by heavy glycosylation, and the protein’s extracellular domain is composed of multiple loops created by disulfide bridges within the protein. The dominant secondary structure of the protein is the beta sheet, leading researchers to hypothesize the presence of dimerization domains within ICAM-1.  Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a type of intercellular adhesion molecule continuously present in low concentrations in the membranes of leukocytes and endothelial cells. Upon cytokine stimulation, the concentrations greatly increase. ICAM-1 can be induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and is expressed by the vascular endothelium, macrophages, and lymphocytes. ICAM-1 is a ligand for LFA-1 (integrin), a receptor found on leukocytes. When activated, leukocytes bind to endothelial cells via ICAM-1/LFA-1 and then transmigrate into tissues. LFA-1 has also been found in a soluble form, which seems to bind and block ICAM-1.  Role in cell signaling  ICAM-1 is an endothelial- and leukocyte-associated transmembrane protein long known for its importance in stabilizing cell-cell interactions and facilitating leukocyte endothelial transmigration. More recently, ICAM-1 has been characterized as a site for the cellular entry of human rhinovirus. Because of these associations with immune responses, it has been hypothesized that ICAM-1 could function in signal transduction. ICAM-1 ligation produces proinflammatory effects such as inflammatory leukocyte recruitment by signaling through cascades involving a number of kinases, including the kinase p56lyn.  Other functions  ICAM-1 and soluble ICAM-1 have antagonistic effects on the tight junctions forming the blood-testis barrier, thus playing a major role in spermatogenesis. The presence of heavy glycosylation and other structural characteristics of ICAM-1 lend the protein binding sites for numerous ligands. ICAM-1 possesses binding sites for a number of immune-associated ligands. Notably, ICAM-1 binds to _mac_ rophage adhesion ligand- _1_ (Mac-1; ITGB2 / ITGAM), _l_ eukocyte _f_ unction associated _a_ ntigen- _1_ (LFA-1), and fibrinogen. These three proteins are generally expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes, and they bind to ICAM-1 to facilitate transmigration of leukocytes across vascular endothelia in processes such as extravasation and the inflammatory response. As a result of these binding characteristics, ICAM-1 has classically been assigned the function of intercellular adhesion. Researchers began to question the role of ICAM-1 as a simple adhesion molecule upon discovering that ICAM-1 serves as the binding site for entry of the major group of human rhinovirus (HRV) into various cell types. ICAM-1 also became known for its affinity for plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (PFIE), providing more of a role for ICAM-1 in infectious disease. With the roles of ICAM-1 in cell-cell adhesion, extravasation, and infection more fully understood, a potential role for ICAM-1 in signal transduction was hypothesized. Most of the work involving ICAM-1 in recent years has focused on this central question as well as related questions. Researchers reasoned that, should ICAM-1 signal transduction prove to occur, it would be necessary to identify the mechanism of that signaling, the conditions and environment in which the signaling would occur, and the biological endpoints of any signaling cascades involved. Beyond its classically described functions as an adhesion and viral entry molecule, ICAM-1 has now been characterized convincingly as possessing a role in signal transduction. Furthermore, the signal-transducing functions of ICAM-1 seem to be associated primarily with proinflammatory pathways. In particular, ICAM-1 signaling seems to produce a recruitment of inflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and granulocytes. ICAM-1 may also participate in a positive feedback loop and compete with ICAM-2 to maintain a proinflammatory environment conducive to leukocyte endothelial transmigration. At both the mRNA and protein levels of expression, ICAM-1 ligation was found to upregulate ICAM-1’s own expression in a positive-feedback loop. In addition, the expression of RANTES mRNA and protein was also found to be upregulated by ICAM-1 ligation. RANTES, or Regulated upon Activation Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted, is a cytokine that is an inflammatory mediator chemotactic for a variety of inflammatory immune cells such as granulocytes and macrophages. However, much work remains to be done in fully characterizing the signaling of ICAM-1. The relationship between ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 signaling environments has not been established beyond mere correlation; a study linking ICAM signaling to actual modulation of an inflammatory environment in vivo has yet to be conducted. The reticular nature of signaling cascades necessitates that the downstream effectors of ICAM-1 mediated signaling through various kinases including p56lyn, Raf-1, and the MAPKs are largely unknown. A more thorough study of the cross-talk between these signaling molecules may shed further light onto the biological endpoints produced by ICAM-1 ligation and signal transduction.  Clinical significance  ICAM-1 has been implicated in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Levels of ICAM-1 are shown to be significantly elevated in patients with SAH over control subjects in many studies. While ICAM-1 has not been shown to be directly correlated with cerebral vasospasm, a secondary symptom that affects 70% of SAH patients, treatment with anti-ICAM-1 reduced the severity of vasospasm. ICAM-1 expressed by respiratory epithelial cells is also the binding site for rhinovirus, the causative agent of most common colds. ICAM-1 has an important role in ocular allergies recruiting pro- inflammatory lymphocytes and mast cells promoting a type I hypersensitivity reaction. ICAM-1 is the primary entry receptor for Coxsackievirus A21, an oncolytic virus (brand name Cavatak, being developed by Viralytics). Cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists have been found to decrease the induction of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression in human brain tissues and primary human brain endothelial cells (BMVEC) exposed to various pro-inflammatory mediators.  Interactions  ICAM-1 has been shown to interact with CD11a, EZR and CD18.

It is the third largest city of Pakistan after Karachi and Lahore.Urban Resource Centre (1998 census details) The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the Muslim refugees from Eastern Punjab and Haryanasettled in the Faisalabad District. It initially lacked industry, hospitals and universities. Since independence, there has been industrial growth, and the city's population is continually growing. Notable industry in the district include but not limited to Textile (spinning, weaving, printing, dying, stitching), Chemicals (acids, caustics, industrial gases, potash, chlorides etc), consumer goods (soaps, vegetable oil, detergents), Engineering (light electrical equipment, engineering goods), Metals & Metallurgy (steels, alloys) and Power (power equipment, power production). Initially a part of Jhang District, it gained the status of a separate district in 1904. In 1982 Toba Tek Singh District (until then a tehsil of Faisalabad) was created as a separate district from Faisalabad. As of 2006 it is a city district consisting of the city of Faisalabad.  Languages  According to the 1998 census, Punjabi is the first language of % of the population. The variety of Punjabi spoken in the urban centres of the district is known as Lyallpuri and is very closely related to the varieties spoken in Jalandhar, Lahore, Sahiwal, and Gujranwala. Urdu is the first language of only 1.2%, but it has official status and is used in education and administration.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right-handed pitcher from 1988 to 1993, most notably as a member of the Oakland Athletics team that won three consecutive American League pennants and a World Series championship in . He also played for the Texas Rangers and the St. Louis Cardinals. Baseball career Burns was born in Maywood, California. He attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, earning first-team All- America honors before being drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 7th round of the 1984 MLB draft. He played for the A's from 1988 to 1991, and would also play for the Texas Rangers (1992–1993), and St. Louis Cardinals (1993). He was nicknamed \\"The Mad Hatter\\" because of his habit of frantically tugging at the bill of his cap and re-adjusting it prior to every pitch as well as \\"Third Degree\\" for his penchant of giving up runs near the end of his career. Burns made his MLB debut on May 31, 1988, and during that season was a reliably effective starter at the back end of the A's rotation. He compiled an 8–2 record over 14 starts and three relief appearances as the A's won the AL pennant but then lost the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Burns switched to an almost exclusively relief role in following seasons. He helped the A's win two more pennants in 1989 and 1990, and a World Series in 1989, when the A's swept their cross-bay rivals, the San Francisco Giants. He left the A's following the 1991 season to sign with the Texas Rangers, then finished his career on September 17, 1993, with the St. Louis Cardinals. Burns posted a regular season won-loss record of 21–23 with a 3.47 earned run average and 13 saves in 203 games pitched. In 3 postseason series, Burns compiled a 0–0 won-loss record with a 7.36 earned run average. Burns pitched well in the 1988 and 1989 playoffs; much of this high ERA came from Game 1 of the 1990 World Series versus the Reds. Burns now runs the Todd Burns School of Baseball in Huntsville, Alabama.

He was the first son of King Francis I of France and Duchess Claude of Brittany.  Life  Francis I said of his son at birth, \\"a beautiful dauphin who is the most beautiful and strong child one could imagine and who will be the easiest to bring up.\\" His mother, Claude, Duchess of Brittany, said, \\"tell the King that he is even more beautiful than himself.\\" The Dauphin was christened at Amboise on 25 April 1519. Leonardo da Vinci, who had been brought to Amboise by Francis I, designed the decorations. One of the most researched aspects of the Dauphin's short life is the time he and his brother Henry (later Henry II of France) spent as hostages in Spain. The king had been badly defeated and captured at the Battle of Pavia (1525) and became a prisoner of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, initially in the Alcázar in Madrid. In order to ensure his release, the king signed the Treaty of Madrid (1526). However, in order to ensure that Francis abided by the treaty, Charles demanded that the king's two older sons take his place as hostages. Francis agreed. On 15 March 1526, the exchange took place at the border between Spain and France. Francis almost immediately repudiated the treaty and the eight-year-old Dauphin and his younger brother Henry spent the next three years as captives of Charles V, a period that scarred them for life. The Dauphin's \\"somber, solitary tastes\\" and his preference for dressing in black (like a Spaniard) were attributed to the time he spent in captivity in Madrid. He also became bookish, preferring reading to soldiering.  Marriage arrangements  As first son and heir to a king of France the Dauphin was a marriage pawn for his father. He could not be wasted in marriage, as many felt his brother Henry had been with his marriage to Catherine de' Medici, and there were several betrothals to eligible princesses throughout the Dauphin's life. The first was when he was an infant, to the four-year-old Mary Tudor (later Mary I of England), daughter of Henry VIII of England and Catherine of Aragon; this arrangement was made as a surety for the Anglo- French alliance signed in October 1518, but abandoned around 1521 when Mary was instead betrothed to Charles V.  Duchy of Brittany  In 1524, the Dauphin inherited the Duchy of Brittany on his mother's death, becoming Duke Francis III, although the Duchy was actually ruled by officials of the French crown. The Duchy was inherited upon the death of Francis by his brother, Henry; upon his succession to the French throne in 1547, the Duchy and the crown were effectively merged, the Breton estates having already tied the succession of the Duchy to the French crown, rather than to the line of succession of the Dukes of Brittany, by vote in 1532.  Death  The Dauphin Francis died at Château Tournon-sur-Rhône on 10 August 1536, at the age of eighteen. The circumstances of his death seemed suspicious, and it is believed by many that he was poisoned. However, there is ample evidence that he died of natural causes, possibly tuberculosis. The Dauphin had never fully recovered his health from the years spent in damp, dank cells in Madrid. After playing a round of tennis at a jeu de paume court \\"pré[s] d'Ainay\\", the Dauphin asked for a cup of water, which was brought to him by his secretary, Count Montecuccoli. After drinking it, Francis collapsed and died several days later. Montecuccoli, who was brought to the court by Catherine de' Medici, was accused of being in the pay of Charles V, and when his quarters were searched a book on different types of poison was found. Catherine de' Medici was well known to have an interest in poisons and the occult. Under torture, Montecuccoli confessed to poisoning the Dauphin. In an age before forensic science, poison was usually suspected whenever a young, healthy person died shortly after eating or drinking. There was no way to pinpoint and trace the substance after death; therefore, it was considered a quick, easy and untraceable form of homicide. There have been several other suspected cases of political-murder-by-poison in the French royal family through the ages. It is suspected that the Dauphin's younger brother, Charles may have been poisoned.

Its extinction was due to hunting by humans in its native lands. It was declared to be extinct in 2008, but it is likely to have disappeared before then. The Saudi gazelle once lived in gravel and sandy plains with acacias of the northern and western Arabian peninsula from Kuwait to Yemen, with most of the records coming from western Saudi Arabia. It was found singly or in groups up to 20. The Saudi gazelle was formerly seen as a subspecies of the dorcas gazelle, which is why its decline and extinction received so little attention from conservationists. Recent genetic studies support its position as a separate species. Apart from genetic differences, the Saudi gazelle also had shorter legs than the Dorcas gazelle and was lighter in color.The Extinction Website - Species Info - Saudi Gazelle The species was always rare and declining due to excessive hunting; it has not been seen for a few decades, and was declared to be extinct in the wild in 1980.

Psi Chi is one of the largest honor societies in the United States, having more than 1,150 chapters. Psi Chi has inducted more than 750,000 lifetime members from chapters in the United States, Canada, and multiple other countries. Notable past and present members of the organization include B.F. Skinner, Philip Zimbardo, Jon Stewart, and Dr. Phil. Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honour Societies and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Association for Psychological Science (APS). Founding Psi Chi was founded by Frederick Howell Lewis and Edwin B. Newman, psychology students at the University of Kansas. Lewis and Newman first thought of a national organization for psychology students while working on research late one night in 1927. Over the next two years, they wrote to psychology faculty and students at various universities and formed discussion groups with other students. Psi Chi's first official meeting was on September 4, 1929, at the Ninth International Congress of Psychology. Psi Chi's original name was Sigma Pi Sigma, but it was learned that the name was already in use by an honor society in physics. \\"Psi Chi\\" was chosen as the honor society's official name at its second annual meeting in 1930 because of the name's similarity to the word \\"psychology\\".  Mission  Psi Chi fosters excellence in the academia of all fields relevant to psychology and its scientific applications. Membership Membership is open to undergraduate, graduate, alumni, and faculty members who make the study of psychology one of their major interests and who meet the minimum qualifications according to Psi Chi's Become a Member webpage, which is based on the Society's Constitution. Membership is attained through application and acceptance at the local chapter level. Psychology majors who attend two-year junior or community colleges may join Psi Beta, Psi Chi's sister society. Awards and grants Psi Chi rewards its members annually with over $400,000 in various awards and grants programs. In addition to awards and grants, Psi Chi began its first scholarship program in the spring of 2015. Undergraduate and graduate scholarships are now available. Psi Chi Journal of Psychological Research Psi Chi publishes a quarterly peer-reviewed journal featuring original research conducted by undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty mentors. To increase dissemination across the psychological community, all articles are available free online. The journal is indexed in EBSCO, and in PsycINFO, a database service of the American Psychological Association with over 3 million records of peer-reviewed scholarly literature. Eye on Psi Chi Magazine Psi Chi also publishes a quarterly magazine, which features career and graduate school advice, updates in popular areas of psychology, and special announcements to keep readers connected with the organization. Notable authors and distinguished interviews include Robert Sternberg, Susan Fiske, Anthony Greenwald, Florence Denmark, and Phillip Zimbardo. All Eye articles are available free online. Activities Psi Chi members may attend national and regional conventions, held yearly. Some chapters provide information on graduate study in psychology and assist members in the graduate school application process. Tutoring, community service, and social events are also common activities of Psi Chi chapters. Structure and governance Psi Chi, a federally recognized, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, is governed by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is composed of three presidents (President, President- Elect, Past-President), six regional vice-presidents (East, Midwest, Rocky Mountain, Southeast, Southwest, West), and an executive director. The presidents and regional vice-presidents are elected by Psi Chi chapters. Regional vice-presidents serve two-year terms and may serve up to a total of two consecutive terms (four years). Regional vice-president elections are held in odd-numbered years for the Eastern, Rocky Mountain, and Western Regions, and in even-numbered years for the Midwestern, Southeastern, and Southwestern Regions. President candidates must have served at least one full two-year term as a regional vice-president. If elected by chapters to become president, the candidate becomes the Society's President-Elect for one year, President the following year, and then the Past-President the year after. Central Office The Central Office fulfills the needs of the society as directed by the leadership of the Board of Directors. The Central Office staff is composed of an executive director, director of membership and development, director of communications, director of finance, and director of information systems. As needed, the Board of Directors creates new staff positions to help better meet the needs of and provide benefits to members of the society. The title of the \\"executive director\\" position has changed over the years: Secretary-Treasurer (1929–54), Executive Secretary (1954–68), Executive Director (1969–91), Executive Officer (1991–2003), Chief Operating Officer (2004–present). The current position of Executive Director did not exist before 2004. (1958–1991) Executive Director – Ruth Cousins Ruth Hubbard Cousins (born May 21, 1920) was one of the society's most famous executive directors, serving for more than 33 years (December 1958–October 1991). She died on January 11, 2007. (1991–2003) Executive Director – Kay Wilson After Cousins retired as executive director, Kay Wilson (born September 21, 1939) took over as executive officer (the title changed, but her position still functioned as executive director) from October 1991 until her death in June 2003, of cancer. (2004–2008) Executive Director – Virginia Andreoli Mathie When Kay Wilson died in 2003, the National Council reviewed the position of executive officer and decided to split the position's function into two positions: \\"rector\\" (a new position with broader outreach and strategic planning functions) and \\"executive officer\\" (the position with office management functions that had been in place since the beginning). A search began in 2003, and Virginia Andreoli Mathie, PhD, who had been a professor of psychology at James Madison University (Virginia), was hired as the first Executive Director in the newly created position. She began on July 1, 2004, and served until June 30, 2008. Dr. Mathie was responsible for coordinating with other psychological organizations, long term strategic planning, and assisting universities applying for a Psi Chi chapter. (2008–present) Executive Director – Martha S. Zlokovich Beginning July 1, 2008, Martha S. Zlokovich, PhD, from Southeast Missouri State University and a former Psi Chi National President, began serving as Psi Chi's second Executive Director. (2003–2009) Executive Officers Paula Miller, who was the organization's previous membership and awards director (1997–2003), was hired as the executive officer in 2003, and served in that position managing the Central Office in Chattanooga, TN until 2007. In March 2007, Lisa Mantooth, formerly of the Cleveland, Tennessee, Red Cross Chapter, began as executive officer and served through November 2009. (2010–2015) Chief Operating Officers In 2010, Michele Rumpf continued in the executive officer role but the title changed to Chief Operating Officer. She served until 2015. Martha S.

Although not the most southerly point of South America (which are the Diego Ramírez Islands), Cape Horn marks the northern boundary of the Drake Passage and marks where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet. Cape Horn was discovered and first rounded in 1616 by the Dutchman Willem Schouten, who named it after the city of Hoorn in the Netherlands. For decades, Cape Horn was a major milestone on the clipper route, by which sailing ships carried trade around the world. The waters around Cape Horn are particularly hazardous, owing to strong winds, large waves, strong currents and icebergs. The need for boats and ships to round Cape Horn was greatly reduced by the opening of the Panama Canal in August 1914. However, sailing around Cape Horn is still widely regarded as one of the major challenges in yachting. Thus a few recreational sailors continue to sail this route, sometimes as part of a circumnavigation of the globe. Almost all of these choose routes through the channels to the north of the Cape. (Many take a detour through the islands and anchor to wait for fair weather to visit Horn Island, or sail around it to replicate a rounding of this historic point.) Several prominent ocean yacht races, notably the Volvo Ocean Race, the Velux 5 Oceans Race, and the Vendée Globe, sail around the world via the Horn. Speed records for round-the-world sailing are recognized for following this route.

Modern navigation Many modern tankers are too wide to fit through the Panama Canal, as are a few passenger ships and several aircraft carriers. But there are no regular commercial routes around the Horn, and modern ships carrying cargo are rarely seen. However, a number of cruise ships routinely round the Horn when traveling from one ocean to the other. These often stop in Ushuaia or Punta Arenas as well as Port Stanley. Some of the small passenger vessels shuttling between Ushuaia and the Antarctic Peninsula will pass the Horn too, time and weather permitting.  Sailing routes  A number of potential sailing routes may be followed around the tip of South America. The Strait of Magellan, between the mainland and Tierra del Fuego, is a major—although narrow—passage, which was in use for trade well before the Horn was discovered. The Beagle Channel (named for the ship of Charles Darwin's expedition), between Tierra del Fuego and Isla Navarino, offers a potential, though difficult route. Other passages may be taken around the Wollaston and Hermite Islands to the north of Cape Horn.Sailing the Patagonian channels, Yachting Club CERN, 2005. Retrieved February 5, 2006.

(For comparison, Cape Agulhas at the southern tip of Africa is at 35° south; Stewart Island/Rakiura at the south end of New Zealand is 47° south; Edinburgh 56° north) The prevailing winds in latitudes below 40° south can blow from west to east around the world almost uninterrupted by land, giving rise to the \\"roaring forties\\" and the even more wild \\"furious fifties\\" and \\"screaming sixties\\". These winds are hazardous enough that ships traveling east would tend to stay in the northern part of the forties (i.e. not far below 40° south latitude); however, rounding Cape Horn requires ships to press south to 56° south latitude, well into the zone of fiercest winds.Along the Clipper Way, Francis Chichester; p. 134. Hodder & Stoughton, 1966. These winds are exacerbated at the Horn by the funneling effect of the Andes and the Antarctic peninsula, which channel the winds into the relatively narrow Drake Passage. The strong winds of the Southern Ocean give rise to correspondingly large waves; these waves can attain great height as they roll around the Southern Ocean, free of any interruption from land. At the Horn, however, these waves encounter an area of shallow water to the south of the Horn, which has the effect of making the waves shorter and steeper, greatly increasing the hazard to ships. If the strong eastward current through the Drake Passage encounters an opposing east wind, this can have the effect of further building up the waves.Along the Clipper Way; pp. 151–52. In addition to these \\"normal\\" waves, the area west of the Horn is particularly notorious for rogue waves, which can attain heights of up to . The prevailing winds and currents create particular problems for vessels trying to round the Horn against them, i.e. from east to west. This was a particularly serious problem for traditional sailing ships, which could make very little headway against the wind at the best of times;Along the Clipper Way; pp. 72–73. modern sailing boats are significantly more efficient to windward and can more reliably make a westward passage of the Horn, as they do in the Global Challenge race. Ice is a hazard to sailors venturing far below 40° south. Although the ice limit dips south around the horn, icebergs are a significant hazard for vessels in the area. In the South Pacific in February (summer in Southern Hemisphere), icebergs are generally confined to below 50° south; but in August the iceberg hazard can extend north of 40° south. Even in February, the Horn is well below the latitude of the iceberg limit.Atlas of Pilot Charts: South Pacific Ocean; Lighthouse Press, 2001. These hazards have made the Horn notorious as perhaps the most dangerous ship passage in the world; many ships were wrecked, and many sailors died attempting to round the Cape.  Lighthouses  Two lighthouses are located near or in Cape Horn. The one located in the Chilean Navy Station is the more accessible and visited, and is commonly referred to as the Cape Horn lighthouse . However, the Chilean Navy station, including the lighthouse (ARLS CHI-030, ) and the memorial, are not located on Cape Horn (which is difficult to access either by land or sea), but on another land point about one mile east-northeast.

Despite the opening of the Suez and Panama Canals, the Horn remains part of the fastest sailing route around the world, and so the growth in recreational long-distance sailing has brought about a revival of sailing via the Horn. Owing to the remoteness of the location and the hazards there, a rounding of Cape Horn is widely considered to be the yachting equivalent of climbing Mount Everest, and so many sailors seek it for its own sake.Rob Duncan's Quest for Cape Horn, by Rob Duncan.

Joshua Slocum was the first single-handed yachtsman to successfully pass this way (in 1895) although in the end, extreme weather forced him to use some of the inshore routes between the channels and islands and it is believed he did not actually pass outside the Horn proper. If one had to go by strict definitions, the first small boat to sail around outside Cape Horn was the Irish yacht Saoirse, sailed by Conor O'Brien with three friends, who rounded it during a circumnavigation of the world between 1923 and 1925. In 1934, the Norwegian Al Hansen was the first to round Cape Horn single-handed from east to west—the \\"wrong way\\"—in his boat Mary Jane, but was subsequently wrecked on the coast of Chile.The Circumnavigators, by Don Holm; Chapter 15. The first person to successfully circumnavigate the world single-handed via Cape Horn was Argentinian Vito Dumas, who made the voyage in 1942 in his ketch Lehg II; a number of other sailors have since followed him,List Of Solo Circumnavigators, from the Joshua Slocum Society International.

In 1987 The British Cape Horn Expedition, headed by Nigel H. Seymour, rounded Cape Horn in the world's first ever 'sailing kayaks' called 'Kaymaran' two sea going kayaks which could link together with two sails mountable in any four of the sailing positions between the two kayaks. Today, there are several major yacht races held regularly along the old clipper route via Cape Horn. The first of these was the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, which was a single-handed race; this inspired the present-day Around Alone race, which circumnavigates with stops, and the Vendée Globe, which is non-stop. Both of these are single-handed races, and are held every four years. The Volvo Ocean Race is a crewed race with stops which sails the clipper route every four years. Its origins lie in the Whitbread Round the World Race first competed in 1973–74. The Jules Verne Trophy is a prize for the fastest circumnavigation of the world by any type of yacht, with no restrictions on the size of the crew (no assistance, non-stop). Finally, the Global Challenge race goes around the world the \\"wrong way\\", from east to west, which involves rounding Cape Horn against the prevailing winds and currents. The Horn remains a major hazard for recreational sailors, however. A classic case is that of Miles and Beryl Smeeton, who attempted to round the Horn in their yacht Tzu Hang. Hit by a rogue wave when approaching the Horn, the boat pitchpoled (i.e. somersaulted end-over-end). Although they survived, and were able to make repairs in Talcahuano, Chile, they attempted the passage again, only to be rolled over, and dismasted for a second time, by another rogue wave, which again they miraculously survived.Once Is Enough, by Miles Smeeton. International Marine Publishing, 2003.  History = Discovery  The voyage of Willem Schouten and Jacob le Maire in 1615–16 In 1526 the Spanish vessel the San Lesmes commanded by Francisco de Hoces, member of the Loaísa expedition, was blown south by a gale in front of the Atlantic end of Magellan Strait and reached Cape Horn, passing through 56° S where they thought to see Land's End. Since the discovery, the sea separating South America from Antarctica bears the name of its discoverer. It appears as Mar de Hoces (Sea of Hoces) in most Spanish-language maps. In September 1578, Sir Francis Drake, in the course of his circumnavigation of the world, passed through the Strait of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean. Before he could continue his voyage north his ships encountered a storm, and were blown well to the south of Tierra del Fuego. The expanse of open water they encountered led Drake to guess that far from being another continent, as previously believed, Tierra del Fuego was an island with open sea to its south. This discovery went unused for some time, as ships continued to use the known passage through the Strait of Magellan.Voyage of the Golden Hind , from The Golden Hind. Retrieved February 5, 2006.

The two ships that departed Holland at the beginning of June 1615 were the Eendrachtcalled Unitie in the Philip translation of 360 tons with Schouten and Le Maire aboard, and the Hoorn of 110 tons, of which Schouten's brother Johan was master. It was Eendracht then, with the crew of the recently wrecked Hoorn aboard,Hoorn was accidentally burned and destroyed on December 19, 1615 with no loss of life in Patagonia during a bungled cleaning attempt of the hull that passed through the Le Maire Strait and Schouten and Le Maire made their great discovery: :“In the evening 25 January 1616 the winde was South West, and that night wee went South with great waves or billowes out of the southwest, and very blew water, whereby wee judged, and held for certaine that ... it was the great South Sea, whereat we were exceeding glad to thinke that wee had discovered a way, which until that time, was unknowne to men, as afterward wee found it to be true.”The Relation, pp. 22–23 :“... on 29 January 1616 we saw land againe lying north west and north northwest from us, which was the land that lay South from the straights of Magelan which reacheth Southward, all high hillie lande covered over with snow, ending with a sharpe point which wee called Cape Horne [Kaap Hoorn] ...” At the time it was discovered, the Horn was believed to be the southernmost point of Tierra del Fuego; the unpredictable violence of weather and sea conditions in the Drake Passage made exploration difficult, and it was only in 1624 that the Horn was discovered to be an island. It is a telling testament to the difficulty of conditions there that Antarctica, only away across the Drake Passage, was discovered only as recently as 1820, despite the passage having been used as a major shipping route for 200 years.  Historic trade route  The clipper route followed by ships sailing between the United Kingdom and Australia/New Zealand passed around Cape Horn. Cape Horn as seen during the United States Exploring Expedition, depicted in watercolor by Alfred Thomas Agate From the 18th to the early 20th centuries, Cape Horn was a part of the clipper routes which carried much of the world's trade. Sailing ships sailed round the Horn carrying wool, grain, and gold from Australia back to Europe;Along the Clipper Way; p. 7. much trade was carried around the Horn between Europe and the Far East; and trade and passenger ships travelled between the coasts of the United States via the Horn.The Circumnavigators , by Don Holm; Around the Three Capes.

The Horn exacted a heavy toll from shipping, however, owing to the extremely hazardous combination of conditions there. The only facilities in the vicinity able to service or supply a ship, or provide medical care, were in the Falkland Islands. The businesses there were so notorious for price-gouging that damaged ships were sometimes abandoned at Port Stanley. While most companies switched to steamers and later used the Panama canal, German steel-hulled sailing ships like the Flying P-Liners were designed since the 1890s to withstand the weather conditions around the Horn, as they specialized in the South American nitrate trade and later the Australian grain trade. None of them were lost travelling around the Horn, but some, like the mighty Preußen, were victims of collisions in the busy English channel. Traditionally, a sailor who had rounded the Horn was entitled to wear a gold loop earring—in the left ear, the one which had faced the Horn in a typical eastbound passage—and to dine with one foot on the table; a sailor who had also rounded the Cape of Good Hope could place both feet on the table.A Voyage for Madmen, by Peter Nichols; pp. 4–5.

One particular historic attempt to round the Horn, that of HMS Bounty in 1788, has been immortalized in history due to the subsequent Mutiny on the Bounty. This abortive Horn voyage has been portrayed (with varying historical accuracy) in three major motion pictures about Captain William Bligh's mission to transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti to Jamaica. The Bounty made only 85 miles of headway in 31 days of east-to-west sailing, before giving up by reversing course and going around Africa. Although the 1984 movie portrayed another decision to go round the Horn as a precipitating factor in the mutiny (this time west-to-east after collecting the breadfruits in the South Pacific), in fact that was never contemplated out of concern for the effect of the low temperatures near the Horn on the plants. The transcontinental railroads in North America, as well as the Panama Canal that opened in 1914 in Central America, led to the gradual decrease in use of the Horn for trade. As steamships replaced sailing ships, Flying P-Liner Pamir became the last commercial sailing ship to round Cape Horn laden with cargo, carrying grain from Port Victoria, Australia, to Falmouth, England, in 1949.

Peronist masses, including many young people, had gathered there to acclaim Juan Perón's definitive return from an 18-year exile in Spain. The police estimated three and a half million people had gathered at the airport. In his plane, Perón was accompanied by president Héctor Cámpora, a representative of the Peronists' left wing, who had come to power on May 25, 1973, amid popular euphoria and a period of political turmoil. Cámpora was opposed to the Peronist right wing, declaring during his first speech that \\"the spilled blood will not be negotiated\\".La sangre derramada no será negociada, quoted by Hugo Moreno, in Le désastre argentin. Péronisme, politique et violence sociale (1930-2001), Ed. Syllepses, Paris, 2005, p.107. . From Perón's platform, camouflaged snipers from the right-wing of Peronism opened fire on the crowd. The left- wing Peronist Youth and the Montoneros were targeted and trapped. At least 13 bodies were subsequently identified, and 365 were injured during the massacre. Horacio Verbitsky, Ezeiza, Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985. Available here According to Clarín newspaper, the real number is thought to be much higher. No official investigation was ever performed to confirm these higher estimates. People involved The Ezeiza massacre marked the end of the alliance of left and right-wing Peronists which Perón had managed to form. Héctor Cámpora represented the main figure of the left-wing and José López Rega, Perón's personal secretary who had accompanied Perón during his exile in Francoist Spain, was the right-wing's representative. López Rega would also be the founder of the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina right-wing death squad. A populist and a nationalist, Perón was popular from the far left to the far- right, but this conjunction of forces ended that day. During his exile, Perón himself had supported both young left-wing Peronists, whose icons included Che Guevara (Montoneros, Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR), Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas (FAP), Peronist Youth (JP), and others) and right-wing Peronists composed \\"Special Formations\\", gathering radicals such as the Iron Guard (GH) or the Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara. The tribune had been set up at Puente 12 by Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Manuel Osinde and other far-right figures of Peronism, such as Alberto Brito Lima and Norma Kennedy. Lorenzo Miguel, Juan Manuel Abal Medina and José Ignacio Rucci, general secretary of the CGT (Confederación General del Trabajo) -- controlled by the Peronist right-wing -- had the responsibility of organizing the Peronists' mobilization to Ezeiza. Members of the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica trade union, the Juventud sindical peronista and other right-wing sectors were also on Perón's tribune, facing the left-wing groups in the crowds (FAR, Montoneros, JP and others -- the FAP had disarmed on May 25, 1973). Italian terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie, who worked in Operation Gladio but also maintained links with the Chilean DINA and Turkish Grey Wolves member Abdullah Çatlı, was also present at Ezeiza, according to investigations by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón. Carlos \\"El Indio\\" Castillo, member of the Concentración Nacionalista Universitaria (CNU), also took part in the massacre. / See also Carlos Castillo's biography in English on desaparecidos.org Political context The massacre had been planned to effect the removal of president Héctor Cámpora, a moderate of the left-wing, from power. During Cámpora's first month of governing, approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.Hugo Moreno, op.cit., p.109 Workers managed to obtain wage increases and better working conditions. The workers' movement had gathered the sympathy of large sectors, sometimes anti-Peronist, of the middle classes. On June 2, 1973, José Ignacio Rucci, general secretary of the CGT, had responded to a Cuban delegate to the CGT congress asking for a toast in honour of Che Guevara, that they were against left-wing imperialism. The Peronist right-wing gradually took control of the whole of the trade union organization, placing people close to the leader José Ignacio Rucci. Effects The battle near the Ezeiza airport marked the end of the transition period of Cámpora, who had succeeded the military dictatorship of general Alejandro Lanusse. According to Hugo Moreno, \\"if October 17, 1945 may be considered as the founding act of Peronism, by the general strike and the presence of the masses imposing their will of support to Perón, the June 20, 1973 massacre marks the entrance on the scene of the late right-wing Peronism.\\"Hugo Moreno, p. 110 See also * List of right-wing terrorist attacks *List of massacres in Argentina ReferencesExternal links * Ezeiza, Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985 by Horacio Verbitsky * La masacre de Ezeiza, El Litoral, Santa Fe, 23 June 2010 (retrieved 2011-07-24) * El hombre que fue izado de los pelos, ElArgentino.com, 2008 (retrieved 2011-07-24) Category:Mass murder in 1973 Category:History of Argentina (1973–1976) Category:Terrorist incidents in South America in 1973 Category:Massacres in Argentina Category:Montoneros Category:Deaths by firearm in Argentina Category:1973 in Argentina Category:Conflicts in 1973 Category:Cold War conflicts Category:June 1973 events in South America Category:1973 crimes in Argentina Category:1970s murders in Argentina Category:1973 murders in South America Category:Terrorist incidents in Argentina Category:Terrorist incidents in Argentina in the 1970s ","title":"Ezeiza massacre"},{"id":"4460942","text":"The cast of Babylon Park Babylon Park is a spoof of Babylon 5 and South Park that debuted on the internet in 1998, created by Christopher Russo.

Shortly after the debut of that site, Russo was approached by the Atlanta, Georgia-based NicholsFilm group, who desired to make a short fan film based on the concept. Russo granted permission, and Babylon Park: The Movie made its debut at the 1998 DragonCon, along with Russo's own short Spoohunter. The movie portion was written and directed by Alyssa Gobelle, and was an instant hit not only with fans, but with the Babylon 5 cast and crew, many of whom were in attendance at the convention. After the DragonCon premiere, Russo went forward with plans to make more shorts, but without the involvement of Gobelle or the Nicholsfilm crew. Nicholsfilm would later produce another parody, Crusade Wars, lampooning the network bureaucracy that plagued the Babylon 5 spinoff Crusade.

The Ancient Greeks and Romans used to call the river Arsanias (). It originates near Mount Ararat north of Lake Van, in Eastern Turkey, and flows westward for through mountainous area. Before the construction of the Keban Dam, the Murat River joined the Karasu River or Western Euphrates north of the dam site and north of the town of Keban. In Muş Province, the river is interrupted by the Alpaslan-1 Dam, which was completed in 2009. The Alpaslan-2 Dam is expected to be completed in 2016 and is located downstream of Alpaslan-1. The river merges into the reservoir of the Keban Dam, at one time Turkey's largest dam, which was completed in 1974 and provides electrical power. In Bingöl and Elazığ provinces, Kalehan Energy has four dams planned for the river: from upstream to downstream, the Upper Kaleköy Dam, Lower Kaleköy Dam, Beyhan I Dam, and Beyhan II Dam. The Beyhan I is completed while the Upper Kaleköy is expected to be completed by 2017. They will have a combined installed capacity of 1,855 MW.  Origin of the river name  The present name is usually connected with the Turkish Murat or its appellative murat \\"purpose, intention, desire\\".

Biography First page of Pavlos Karrer's song \\"Anthos kai Avgoula\\" Carrer was a descendant of a noble family of Zante. He studied music in his birthplace with the Italian teachers Giuseppe Cricca, Francesco Marangoni and possibly in Corfu with Nikolaos Mantzaros. A natural musical talent, but also in harmony with the cultural atmosphere of the Ionian Islands of the time, which was dominated by Italian opera and western European culture, he composed his first small musical pieces in the late 1840s. The operatic 'scena' Il pellegrino di Castiglia attracted the public's attention when it was staged at the ‘Apollon’ Municipal Theatre of Zante. In 1850, in the peak of the Risorgimento, the young Pavlos Carrer moved to Milan, the operatic capital of Europe (then under Austrian occupation), in order to specialize in his music studies. There he took private courses with Raimondo Boucheron, Pietro Tassistro and Giuseppe Winter. In the same year, he presented a concert at the ‘Carcano’ theatre with his first instrumental works. He also composed the music score for Tomaso Casati's ballet Bianca di Belmonte, produced at the ‘Teatro della Canobbiana’. Mentored by Francesco Lucca, the powerful Italian music publisher, Carrer made his debut as an opera composer in August 1852 at the ‘Carcano’, with Dante e Bice, an opera in three parts to a libretto by Serafino Torelli. The work, which seems to have annoyed the Austrian police by its political connotations, deals with the Italian national poet Dante Alighieri, his unfulfilled love for Beatrice Portinari, his political activities and the writing of the Divine Comedy. In the next year, Carrer cooperated with the choreographer Andrea Palladino for the production of a comic ballet entitled Cadet, il barbiere, which was staged at ‘La Canobbiana’ theatre with mediocre success. However, the same year would bring a great success to the young composer: the three-act opera Isabella d’Aspeno, which was presented at the ‘San Giacomo’ theatre of Corfu, followed by a triumphant series of performances at the Milanese ‘Carcano’ (April 1854 and March 1856). The work, to a libretto by an unknown author signing with the initials R.G.S. (possibly Giuseppe Sapio), occupies an important position in the Italian operatic creation of mezzo ottocento, as it seems to have been one of the many prototypes of Verdi’s famous opera, Un ballo in maschera. Carrer’s success in the Milanese stages was crowned with the production of the grand opéra La Rediviva, in three acts to a libretto by Giuseppe Sapio. The work was received with enthusiasm when it premiered at the ‘Carcano’ (January 1856), a success that was continued at the ‘Teatro Comunale’ of Como (January 1857) and at the ‘San Giacomo’ of Corfu (December 1857). Throughout his stay in Italy Carrer also composed salon music, especially opera paraphrases for piano and flute, dances and solfège exercises. With dreams of founding a national music and of becoming the first Greek national composer, Carrer was repatriated in 1857 and settled in Zante. He worked as a conductor and impresario in local theatres, taught music and married the talented soprano and interpreter of his works, Isabella Giatrà. At the same time he composed his first national opera, the four-act Marco Bozzari (1858–60), as well as numerous art songs in Greek lyrics, among which the celebrated klephtiko, ‘Ho Gero Dēmos’ [Old man Dēmos]. This song, written in the Greek traditional style of dēmoticà, was incorporated in the above- mentioned opera. Marco Bozzari, after a series of misadventures, caused by its patriotic and anti-Ottoman content, opened in Patras in April 1861. It is considered Carrer's most famous work and the most popular Greek opera during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with a record of more than 45 different stagings. The work, initially composed to an Italian libretto written by Giovanni Caccialupi, was soon translated and performed in Greek, often causing the audience's enthusiasm in the theaters where it was presented. Similar in concept, though more elaborate in terms of composition, are his other two national operas, the oriental and atmospheric Kyra Phrosyinē (libretto by Elisavetios Martinegkos, performed at the ‘Apollon’ of Zante, in November 1868) and the heroic-style Despo (libretto by Antonios Manousos, opened at the ‘Apollon’ of Patras, in December 1882). Both the first, a mature work with a strong couleur locale and sensuality, and the second, an opera with a marked national stamp, dense in traditional melodic patterns, are imprinted on compact disc and are accessible to the public. Along with his national melodramas, Carrer continued to compose Italian-style operas, such as Fior di Maria (libretto by Giovanni Caccialupi, staged at the San Giacomo of Corfu, in January 1868), in which realistic and pre-veristic elements are detected. Decisive steps towards dramatic and musical realism were made with his historic opera Maria Antonietta (libretto by Giorgio Roma, opened at the Foskolos theatre of Zante, January 1884). A special place in his operatic creation is held by Marathōn-Salamis, an ambitious opera in four parts (composed c.1886–8), combining a Classical theme with a proto-impressionist musical idiom and a hint of Wagnerian unifying procedures. Carrer never saw this last opera on stage, for it was first presented in Athens 115 years after its composition by the Greek National Opera. Finally, Carrer left a legacy of two unfinished projects, the national style three-act opera Lambros il brulottiere (about 1886) and the operetta Conte Spourgitis [Count Sparrow] (1886–7). There is also meager evidence of another opera, unidentified and lost today, entitled Don Pigna. Pavlos Carrer was one of the most popular and widely performed composers in 19th-century Greece, while achieving a considerable reputation in Italy. He followed closely the developments in European opera, lent an ear to artistic modernism and constantly updated his compositional practice. In his musical style Italian influences are evident, mainly from Verdi's middle period and the late bel canto. However, his musical idiom is distinguished for its unique personal style, and for his efforts to bring Greek national coloring in his creations. Pavlos Carrer played a leading role in the most characteristic evolution in the field of Greek art music that took place in the Ionian islands of the mid-19th century and concerned the first systematic effort of creating a national opera.

It is operated by Norwegian Cruise Lines. Inaugurated during the 2005/2006 cruise season as the first new U.S.-flagged cruise ship in nearly fifty years, Pride of America was designed to pay homage to the spirit of the United States, from the patriotic artwork on the hull to the U.S.-themed public spaces. History For much of her early build history, Pride of America was known as Project America 1; the first of a pair of 70,000 ton cruise ships to be built at the Litton-Ingalls shipyard in Mississippi with heavy federal subsidies. Project America was intended as a means of improving the competitiveness of American shipyards in performing commercial (non-military) construction, as well as creating the first U.S.-registered passenger ships of any real size in decades. Project America program collapsed in 2001, when American Classic Voyages, the company that was to operate the ships under its United States Lines division, filed for bankruptcy. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd acquired the unfinished ship and was towed to Germany for completion as Pride of America for their newly launched NCL America division. In the process, the ship was lengthened from to , increasing the gross tonnage from 72,000 to more than 80,000. Under NCL America, the ship was initially slated for completion in 2004, but the delivery date was pushed back to 2005 after a major storm hit the Lloyd Werft shipyard and caused considerable damage to the vessel which also sank at her berth. A special exemption on the part of the U.S. government allowed the modified, mostly German-built ship to attain U.S. registry. Since Pride of America is registered in the U.S., she is subject to American labor laws and is staffed by a mostly American crew. This is in contrast to most other cruise ships, which are registered in flag of convenience countries and have mainly foreign crews. In addition, Pride of America has no casino onboard, because she never leaves U.S. waters.  Major refurbishments = 2013  Pride of America entered a fourteen day dry dock on 23 March 2013 in Honolulu, Hawaii; 32 passenger cabins were added and some public facilities were refurbished.  2016  Pride of America entered a twenty four day dry dock period in February 2016, at the BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair facility. Normally, the ship uses facilities in Pearl Harbor, but these were already fully booked.  Vessel class  Pride of America is a one-off ship design. She was originally designed for United States Lines under the class name Project America. Project America was originally to have two ships in the class, though only one was ever built.  Livery  Pride of Americas hull is covered with a patriotic livery which consists of red, white, and blue stars and stripes and a stylized bald eagle.  Incidents  The Hawaii Department of Transportation reported on 8 April 2020 that six crew members of Pride of America had tested positive for COVID-19.Six COVID-19 cases confirmed on the Pride of America State of Hawaii Department of Transportation Two of the crew members were taken to a hospital for treatment, while the other patients were isolated on board the ship. Another positive case was later announced, bringing the total number of cases to seven.4 Oahu residents to leave Pacific Princess at Honolulu Harbor Monday; 7 Pride of America crew members have COVID-19 Star Advertiser 9 April 2020 Following the suspension of cruise operations to mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pride of America has not carried passengers since 14 March 2020, and docked at Honolulu Harbor, her home base, with a complement of roughly 500 crew members. She is scheduled to travel to the mainland to enter dry dock with about 200 crew members, the other 300 crew heading directly back to their home states.

They are commonly kept in aquariums. Appearance The fish can be a light purple to a deep violet starting at the head which fades mid-body to a golden yellow at the tail. The royal gramma will also have a small black spot on the front of the dorsal fin and a black line that streaks through the eye. It resembles the false gramma (Pictichromis paccagnellae), with the two main differences between the two being the false gramma has clear fins and does not fade, but rather has a distinct change in color. The royal gramma is relatively small, averaging slightly over 8 cm (3 inches) and has been tank bred. The largest royal gramma was measured at 8 cm (3.1 in). Gramma loreto Diet The royal gramma is a planktivore, eating mostly zooplankton and crustaceans. The royal gramma is also a cleaner fish. It removes the ectoparasites (a parasite that lives on the skin of a fish) from other fish and learns to eat dead food, such as crustaceans and fish flesh. They prefer to pick their food from the middle of the water column. Range Their natural range covers the Bahamas, Venezuela, Lesser Antilles, Bermuda, and through the waters surrounding Central America and the northern part of South America. The Royal Gramma tends to swim more towards the bottom with the depth range between 1 and 20 m (3 and 60 ft). In the aquarium Royal gramma in the Musée océanographique of Monaco Due to their relatively peaceful nature, diet, and small size, the royal gramma is considered an ideal inhabitant for most reef aquaria containing coral and other invertebrates. Notwithstanding this general statement, they can become aggressive towards tank-mates when kept in smaller nano reef tanks. They stake out territories throughout rocks and crevices and choose favorite hiding places. They are generally peaceful fish, but are very protective of their territories and are known for chasing out other small fish. They tend to stay in one area of the tank and, when startled, will dart back into their holes. They will vigorously guard their hiding places and, when threatened, will open their mouths wide in a threatening gesture to ward off the intruders. The royal gramma tends to orient itself to be parallel with the surface to which it is closest, resulting in the fish swimming straight up and down or sometimes upside down beneath ledges. This behavior is not to be mistaken for illness. The minimum suggested tank size is 30 gallons and the tank should not receive sharp lighting. The ideal water temperature should range between 72 and 78 °F and the water pH should be between 8.1 and 8.4, with specific gravity of 1.020-1.025. They are often kept in reef aquaria and are generally kept singly or in pairs. However, small groups can be kept as long as the tank is large enough and has enough cracks and crevices for each fish to have its own territory. The royal gramma should not be kept with its own kind unless in a formed male-female pair. It should also not be kept with larger, aggressive fish that will eat them. They are, however, resistant to most diseases and make very good beginner fish. It will also accept frozen and meaty foods, such as brine shrimp and mysis shrimp in the wild. The royal gramma is very easy to feed; but rotating their foods is said to keep them from becoming picky. Captive royal gramma will also eat flake and pellet foods. Breeding Although pairs are difficult to find because the difference between male and female is not visible, they are very easy to breed. With males usually being larger than females, the male will build the nest among rocks using pieces of algae. The male will then lead the female to the nest, where she will deposit 20-100 eggs in the nest. During the breeding period, this behavior is repeated almost every day for a month or longer. The eggs are about 1 mm (0.04 in) and are equipped with small protuberances over the surface with tiny threads extending from them. These threads hold onto the algae of the nest and keep the eggs in place. The eggs will hatch in five to seven days, normally in the evening, and can feed on rotifers until they are large enough to consume newly hatched brine shrimp. In popular culture Because the royal gramma is generally a peaceful fish, it gets along with many other types of fish. A royal gramma fish named Gurgle was voiced by (Austin Pendleton) who also appeared in the 2003 Disney/Pixar animated film Finding Nemo and the 2016 sequel Finding Dory.

His primary instrument was the clarinet, but he also played saxophone. At an early age, Cuesta began studying classical violin and then switched to woodwinds. He proved himself gifted and was selected to play while he was still in high school with the Corpus Christi Symphony Orchestra in Corpus Christi, Texas. Before being drafted into the United States Army in 1952, he graduated from Del Mar College, a community college in Corpus Christi, at which he majored in music. In the Army Special Services, he was involved in entertaining troops in Europe and England, which included a \\"Tribute to Gershwin\\" concert with the Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra in Germany. After his Army duty, Cuesta toured the United States and Canada and developed his own highly personal style. While living in Toronto, Cuesta and his group became popular for visiting musicians, including Benny Goodman on one occasion. He later toured in the working band of the legendary trombonist, Jack Teagarden. Bobby Hackett advised him to get in touch with Lawrence Welk, and after listening to his recordings, Welk hired him immediately. Cuesta made countless personal appearances performing and conducting in jazz festivals, state and county fairs, conventions, supper clubs, and symphony pops concerts. He appeared as a soloist with Jack Teagarden, Bob Crosby, Mel Tormé, in a Bobby Vinton television special, on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and ten years on The Lawrence Welk Show. He also made several appearances to the Colorado Springs Invitational Jazz Party in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and performed with numerous international jazz musicians. Cuesta died the age of seventy-one at his home in Sherman Oaks, California, after a bout with cancer.

A fixed number of players in the event win membership of the tour for the following season, otherwise known as a \\"tour card,\\" meaning that they can play in most of the tour's events without having to qualify. They join the leaders on the previous year's money list/order of merit and certain other exempt players as members of the tour. Getting through the qualifying school of an elite tour is very competitive and most professional golfers never achieve it. There can be up to four stages to negotiate, each of them like a regular golf tournament with only a small number of players going on to the next stage. The final qualifying school may be played over up to six rounds, compared with the standard four rounds in a professional golf tournament. However players who are successful at qualifying school can reach the elite level of competition very quickly. Some lower status tours are open to any registered professional who pays a membership fee so they do not have a qualifying school. Q-Schools=PGA Tour The PGA Tour's qualifying school was officially known as the PGA Tour Qualifying Tournament, but the organization also frequently refers to it as \\"Q-School.\\" The system dated back to 1965. The 2012 edition (the final Q School that offered a direct path to the PGA Tour) involved four stages: *Pre-Qualifying Stage: Five tournaments held in September, all in warm-weather locations in the United States. Each is played over three rounds. This stage was introduced in 2006 with four tournaments (six in 2007, four in 2008). In each tournament, roughly 35 to 40 players, plus ties, advance to the next stage. Participants in this stage are former college players and mini-tour veterans who have never played in a PGA-sanctioned event or major international tour. *First Stage: Thirteen tournaments held in October (compared to 14 in 2005, before the introduction of Pre-Qualifying, 10 in 2006, 12 in 2007, and 11 in 2008), also in warm-weather locations in the United States. Each is played over four rounds. The participants are a mixture of Pre-Qualifying Stage winners and players who were exempted from Pre-Qualifying. Roughly the top 25 players plus ties in each tournament advance. **Exempt into this stage: Members of international golf tours or Korn Ferry Tour over past five seasons, applicants ranked 101-200 in Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) by deadline, those who played in a major over previous two seasons, Walker Cup members, top 20 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking, anyone who made the cut in a PGA Tour event. *Second Stage: Six tournaments in November, also in warm-weather locations and each played over four rounds. Like the First Stage, certain players receive exemptions to this stage. Roughly the top 20 plus ties in each tournament advance. **Exempt into second stage: 41-70 on Web.com Tour money list, PGA Tour members, winners of Web.com Tour events over past five seasons, applicants who made the cut in a major, applicants who have made 50 or more cuts on the PGA Tour, 51-100 in OWGR, top two available players from Asian Tour, Canadian Tour, PGA Tour Latinoamérica (formerly Tour de las Américas), or Sunshine Tour. *Final Stage: One tournament played over six rounds in late November-early December. The field consists of Second Stage winners and players who received exemptions into the Final Stage. The top 25 players, plus ties, earn PGA Tour cards for the following year. Their priority ranking for purposes of tournament entry is 24; this ranking enables them to enter most full-field events on the PGA Tour, but not more prestigious stops on the tour unless a substantial number of players in higher categories skip the events. For example, the top 125 players on the previous year's money list who are not otherwise eligible are at priority 19; sponsor's exemptions are priority 11; and winners of PGA Tour events in the previous two years are priority 9. The next 50 players plus ties after the top 25 earned fully exempt Web.com Tour cards for the following year, and any remaining finishers receive conditional status on the Web.com Tour. **Exempt through final stage: 126-150 on PGA Tour's money list, 26-40 on Web.com Tour's money list, those with medical extensions, top three available players from European Tour and Japan Golf Tour, top 50 in OWGR. A number of players who earned PGA Tour privileges through a Top 25 finish on the Web.com Tour also played in the final stage in attempts to improve their status and order in the reshuffle. The reshuffle alternated between Q School and Web.com Tour graduates, with higher-finishing players getting more priority in tournaments. The initial reshuffle began with the Q School medalist, then 2nd place on the Web.com Tour money list (the money leader is fully exempt), second in Q School, and so on. The order would change according to season earnings after the eighth tournament of the season, the Masters, Players Championship, U.S. Open, and British Open, again with the highest earning players receiving higher priority into tournaments. Web.com Tour graduates did not count against the 25. In the event that there were less than 25 after the Web.com Tour graduates were discounted, those in the next position were given PGA Tour cards, as in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, twenty-six golfers originally earned tour cards, which also included Web.com Tour graduates Roberto Castro and Mark Anderson. As there were fewer than 25 after Castro and Anderson were not counted, Nathan Green, Colt Knost, and John Huh were also given Tour cards for 2012. Huh was the most successful of the three, winning at Mayakoba, playing in all four stages of the FedEx Cup, and finishing 28th on the money list en route to Rookie of the Year honors. Knost did well enough to keep his Tour privileges, while former PGA Tour winner Green finished outside the Top 150. The 2012 Qualifying Tournament was the last to award PGA Tour privileges. The tour announced in March 2012 that after the end of the 2013 PGA Tour season in September of that year, the 2014 season will begin the following month, and future seasons will begin in October of the previous calendar year. As a result, from 2013 on, the Qualifying Tournament will only award privileges on the Web.com Tour. New PGA Tour cards for the 2014 season and beyond will instead be awarded at the end of a four- tournament series, known as the Korn Ferry Tour Finals, in which the top 75 money winners on the Web.com Tour and non-exempt golfers placing between 126 and 200 on the FedEx Cup points list will be eligible. The top 25 on the Web.com Tour money list heading into the Finals will receive PGA Tour cards, with the remaining 25 cards to be awarded based on money earned in the Finals. The Finals money list will determine the priority placing for all 50 card earners in the coming season, including those earning cards through the Web.com money list. In 2015, Web.com Tour Q School was reduced to a four-round event. European Tour The European Tour has a three-stage qualifying school: *First Qualifying Stage: eight tournaments, held in various countries around Europe, each played over four rounds. *Second Qualifying Stage: four tournaments, each of four rounds, at four different courses in Spain. *Final Qualifying Stage: a single tournament played over six rounds at two courses in Spain. The leading 30 players and ties at Final Qualifying receive category 11 membership of the European Tour, which entitles them to entry to a substantial number of European Tour events, but not to the more prestigious stops on the tour unless a large number of players in higher exemption categories miss those tournaments. The leading 30 players also receive category 4 membership of the second tier Challenge Tour, with the remainder of those making the 72-hole cut being granted category 7 status, and those missing the cut, category 12. Any player not making it through to the final stage is able to take up category UR1 membership, with limited opportunities to participate in tournaments during the season. LPGA Tour The LPGA operates a qualifying school with two stages: * Sectional Qualifying: Two tournaments played over four rounds, one in California and the other in Florida, held in September and October. These tournaments are scheduled so that they do not conflict, and golfers may enter one or both sectionals. The entry fee is $4000 for one sectional or $5000 for both. The top 30 players, plus ties, from each sectional advance. * Final Qualifying Tournament: A single tournament held in late November-early December at the LPGA International in Daytona Beach, Florida, played over five rounds. No extra fee is charged for entry. The top 45 players, plus ties, receive Tournament Division Membership. Their priority position varies depending on their Q-School finish: * The top 20 finishers receive Category 12 membership, which entitles them to entry in most full- field events apart from the more prestigious events. Note that this does not include ties—if the top-20 cut includes more than 20 golfers, the players tied for the last position go to a sudden-death playoff to reduce the qualifiers to exactly 20 players. They alternate with the golfers who finished between 81 and 90 on the previous year's LPGA money list. * Finishers between 21 and 45 receive Category 17 membership. PGA Tour Champions The PGA Tour Champions, the PGA Tour's circuit for golfers age 50 and older, has its own \\"Q-School.\\" As of 2011, it involves two stages: *Regional Qualifying Stage: Three tournaments played over four rounds and held in late October, all in warm-weather locations in the United States. Each tournament has a field of roughly 78 players, with roughly 16 to 17 advancing to the final stage. Two alternates are also chosen at each site in case a qualifier is unable to make the final stage. *Final Stage: One tournament played over four rounds in mid- November. The field consists of Regional Qualifying winners and players who received exemptions into the Final Stage. The top 30 players, plus ties, earn PGA Tour Champions cards for the following year. However, for most, this only provides entry into Monday qualifying—only the top 5 players, not including ties, are assured of entry into regular tour events, and only for the first half of the season. If necessary, a playoff is used to reduce the number of fully exempt players to 5. Golfers who will turn 50 during the next PGA Tour Champions season are allowed to enter Q-School, although they will not be eligible to compete on the tour until their birth date. An example of this occurred at the 2012 Q-School, with two of the top five finishers having been born on June 13, 1963. Their exemptions were temporarily taken up by the sixth- and seventh-place finishers. Players 6th-12th are conditionally exempt. Those in the top thirty plus ties are given entry into all open-qualifying tournaments. **Exempt through final stage: Top 5 in the current year's Senior PGA Professional National Championship, top available player (no lower than fifth) on both the European Senior Tour and Japan Senior Tour Orders of Merit, all players not already exempt who are in the top 75 of either the current year's or all-time PGA Tour Champions money list. Also, since 2010, golfers who have either won an event or made 150 cuts on the regular PGA Tour are exempt to this stage for their first two seasons of PGA Tour Champions eligibility, as are former PGA Tour Champions winners for the first two seasons after losing their exemption for that tour. Other qualification methods Other methods of getting onto an elite golf tour include: *Finishing near the top of the money list/order of merit on the tour's official developmental tour, such as the Korn Ferry Tour for the PGA Tour, the Challenge Tour for the European Tour or the Symetra Tour for the LPGA Tour. *Winning a specified number of tournaments on the tour's official developmental tour may grant an exemption. For example, both the PGA Tour and European Tour grant a \\"performance promotion\\" — informally known as a \\"battlefield promotion\\" — to any player who wins three events on its developmental tour in a season. Such a player is exempt from qualifying on the higher tour for at least the remainder of that season; on the PGA Tour, the exemption runs for the entirety of the following season. *Winning a tournament on the tour after gaining entry to it through its qualification event or as a sponsor's invitee. Tiger Woods secured his PGA Tour card by winning the Las Vegas Invitational in October 1996 as a sponsor's invitee, and went on to win another event two weeks later. *Winning enough money on multiple events on the tour as a qualifier/sponsor's invitee to meet whatever criteria the tour may lay down for promotion to full membership. Even without his 1996 tournament wins, Woods would have earned his tour card by finishing in the top 125 on the 1996 money list, since he had three other top-5 finishes as a sponsor's invitee that season. *Special categories for elite golfers: Most tours offer automatic memberships to golfers with outstanding achievements such as winning a recent major championship or making a recent Ryder Cup or Presidents Cup team.

It shares much with inline speed skating. Roadskaters often skate in tight packs, drafting each other and sharing the lead, which allows a pack to travel faster than an individual skater. The individual members of a pack use comparatively less energy than the lone skater traveling at the same speed. Even the lead skater in the pack enjoys an advantage from the drafting skaters behind. While gliding downhill, an inline skater in a tucked position can achieve speeds that exceed the speed of a tucked cyclist. This is due to lower wind resistance. The rolling resistance is similar for a cyclist and a skater — it is only when actively skating (i.e., in the skating stroke) that the skater incurs greater resistance. Skating is roughly 50% slower than cycling on flat ground. Skaters routinely achieve downhill speeds of 60 km/h (37 mph), similar to cyclists. Compared to cyclists, though, skaters particularly suffer on uphills, when the drafting advantage disappears. A skating paceline going down hills may easily achieve speeds faster than a cycling paceline of equal length. The reason is that the road skating paceline has a much more efficient draft effect. The draft effect in road skating is superior for three reasons: # each skater can be much closer to the person in front of her, whereas each cyclist is limited by the distance of the wheels; # each skater gaining inertia energy from being in the draft can translate this energy to the person in front of her by maintaining contact (usually by placing a hand on the lower back of the person in front); and # the skater has much less equipment-related aerodynamic drag than the cyclist. Cross training Skating (especially road skating) is much more like cycling than running in terms of the muscles employed. Cyclists and skaters commonly participate in each other's sports as cross-training. Runners often switch to road skating due to injuries associated with the impact of running. Many skiers use road skating for off-season and pre-season conditioning as well. In addition, skating is an excellent cross-training activity for a wide range of other sports due to the lateral (side-to-side) motion involved in the skating stride. Drafting Road skating in a pack has some common rules that most skaters follow. Such rules include skating in single file except when passing or moving into the back of the pack, rotational \\"pulling\\" in the front of the pack to shield the rest of the pack from the wind, and signaling about road conditions, hazards and alike to skaters in the back of the pack. Single-file skating in a pack is mostly dictated by the need to minimize the impact of air resistance on the pack, thus shielding from the wind behind the back of the first person who is \\"pulling\\" the pack. \\"Pulling\\" is associated with up to 30% higher energy exertion; thus, it is generally accepted that skaters rotate through \\"pulls,\\" allowing for equal energy exertion through the pack. A skater who has finished \\"pulling\\" steps out of the pack and slowly moves into the back of the pack. The skater in front of the pack has a better view of the road ahead and points and calls out road hazards (holes, cracks, water puddles, cars, etc.). Street skating Street skaters in Paris, France. Street skating is the practice of roller skating (commonly on inline skates or quad skates) in groups on public roads. Street skates can be formal affairs, with prespecified routes, marshals and, at times, police escorts or ad hoc gatherings of like minded individuals. There are organized street skates in a number of cities around the world. Some of the largest are in Paris (the 'Pari Roller'),\\"Megacities\\" by Andrew Marr, BBC, June 2, 2011The night of a thousand wheels by Matthew Davis, BBC News, 20 July 2002Left Bank skating, in-line and en masse by Charles Ball, The Boston Globe, 18 February 2007 Munich and Berlin.

LondonSkate\\"Essential Info\\" LondonSkate, June 2011 runs free events on Wednesday evenings; and a smaller scene can be found in Nottingham. Guardes in front of the group Such events may involve several hundred participants, so to minimize disruption to other road users the events are usually operated in coordination with the police and other relevant local authorities, such as bus operators. Therefore, the route must be decided in advance. Volunteer marshals help to control traffic at busy junctions. Their goals are to minimize disruption to all road users and to ensure the safety of the skaters. These events are usually free to enter. Normally, the only requirement is that each individual skater can keep pace with the rest of the group and can turn and stop safely. Participants that don't meet these requirements are usually asked to leave the skate and encouraged to practice their skating skills for a few days and return to the next street skate event.  Friday Night Skate  A (often abbreviated to FNS) is a group skate occurring on Friday nights, a common night for a street skate in many cities throughout the world.Put on your dancing skates by Syrie Johnson, Evening Standard, 27 March 2001\\"All you need to know about: In-line skating\\" by Sam Murphy, The Guardian, 3 March 2007 In Vienna (since at least 2011) and Graz (Austria) once in a year – around resp. on Carfree Day, 22 September – one of the 20–25 km long tours runs for a small part on an urban highway.

New Dream’s overall goal is to change behavior, attitudes, and social norms to reduce consumption, build community, and improve quality of life. The organization states that it embraces sustainability and a celebration of non-material values. One of New Dream's stated goals is \\"to shift the culture from an emphasis on more to an emphasis on more of what matters.” It is up to the individual to determine what matters in his or her life, but the organization offers, by way of example, more time, nature, family, community, fairness, and fun as appropriate points of emphasis over material goods.

The organization’s focus on the intersections between consumption, environmental degradation, and quality of life have made it truly unique among environmental and social justice organizations. The center closed September 2020. In 2017, the Center for a New American Dream underwent a strategic restructuring and name change in order to streamline programs and better respond to the needs of a growing audience. It is now known simply as New Dream and is currently a Joint Plan of Work Partner of Virginia Organizing, a tax-exempt organization that accepts contributions on behalf of New Dream. While the group proposed that American-style consumerism and the drive to achieve the “American Dream” are largely to blame for normalizing high-consumption lifestyles, the organization's name update reflects the need to help individuals and communities around the world reduce consumerism and materialism.

Though the park is famous for white domes of the Navajo Sandstone, this dome's color is a result of a lingering section of yellow Carmel Formation carbonate, which has stained the underlying rock. In 1928 Gilluly and Reeside stated an intent to name the formation after Mount Carmel but did not give a type locality. They noted it as a basal formation in the San Rafael Group in San Rafael Swell, in Emery County, Utah. An overview along with a type locality and source of name was stated by Gregory and Moore in 1931. Mackin revised the formation's description and assigned the Homestake Limestone Member to it in 1954. Harshbarger and others created an overview in 1957. Its eastern areal limits were described by Wright and others in 1962. In 1963, western areal limits along with an overview were completed by Schultz and Wright. Another revision was done by Phoenix in 1963 who also added a Judd Hollow Tongue member. Isotopic dating was conducted by Marvin and others in 1965.

Samit's aeronautical ratings consist of an Air Transport Canada (Canadian) certified private pilot license. He is also a qualified FBI Aviator. Samit is most noted for arresting Zacarias Moussaoui on August 16, 2001. Samit became aware of Moussaoui because of Clancy Prevost,The Grounded Man Rake Magazine May 2005, retrieved Feb 6, 2017 a certified flight instructor at the Pan-Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minnesota. Moussaoui had enrolled for training in a 747-400 flight simulator at the school on August 13 but his behavior during instruction alarmed Prevost, who did not believe that Moussaoui was just a wealthy individual interested in flying jumbo jets. At Prevost's urging, the flight school contacted the Minneapolis FBI Field Office, and Samit was one of the special agents assigned to investigate Moussaoui. Moussaoui was arrested by INS Special Agents for a visa violation on August 16 but, because the arrest was effected outside the Residence Inn where Moussaoui had been staying, Samit had no legal right to search the hotel room and its contents without Moussaoui's consent. Moussaoui denied consent, so Samit could only search Moussaoui and his car. Samit found a small knife in Moussaoui's left pocket and another knife in the car. KTWB-TV, retrieved March 27, 2006 As a certified private pilot himself, Samit was suspicious, suspecting that Moussaoui was plotting an act of international terrorism against the United States. He therefore sought permission to search Moussaoui's belongings which were known to include several bags and suitcases, and a laptop computer. The first application to obtain a criminal search warrant was denied by FBI Headquarters on the ground of insufficient evidence. A second application to search was made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, but this was also denied. The FBI did obtain a search warrant for the belongings, but only after the September 11th attacks. The Minneapolis Field Office had received a report from Moussaoui's home government of France that linked him to Islamic terrorism, but the FBI Headquarters in Washington did not believe that evidence was sufficient to present to the FISA court for a search warrant. On the question of using foreign government intelligence to validate a request for a domestic search warrant through the FISA court, it is unclear if the Field Office could have appealed administratively to the White House National Security Council.

When FBI Headquarters denied both Samit's application for search powers, he initiated a process to notify the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of his suspicions of possible aircraft hijacking attempts, but FBI Headquarters censored the memo. Relying on personal contacts, Samit then met with a Minneapolis FAA official, but that official did not pursue Samit's leads. \\"I am so desperate to get into his computer, I'll take anything,\\" Samit wrote in an e-mail on September 10, 2001.

Stone with the help of several family members in Chicago, Illinois, and incorporated on April 10, 1980, as the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association, Inc. and is a non-profit American volunteer health organization which focuses on care, support and research for Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Association is the largest non-profit funder of Alzheimer's disease research. The organization has chapters and communities across the nation, with its national office located in Chicago and the public policy office in Washington D.C. Its mission is \\"to eliminate Alzheimer's disease through the advancement of research; to provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health.\\" History Jerome H. Stone founded the Alzheimer's Association with the help of several family support groups after meeting with the National Institute on Aging in 1979. Jerome Stone's Alzheimer's research efforts began in 1970 when his wife was first diagnosed with the disease. During the 1970s there was very little information available about Alzheimer's disease. Only a few support groups existed at the time. Through his research efforts, he joined with seven independent groups who wanted to form a national organization. The groups consisted of researchers, physicians, caregivers, and other humanitarians. Together they held their first official meeting on December 4, 1979, to discuss solutions for the need for Alzheimer's information, care, and cure for the disease. The Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association was incorporated on April 10, 1980. In that year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invested $13 million in Alzheimer's disease research. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan designated the first National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Week. With sub-chapters being founded nationwide, the organization launched its own research programs. Events The Alzheimer's Association Brain Bus at the Gasparilla Distance Classic Expo in 2020.  Rita Hayworth Galas  In 1980 actress and dancer Rita Hayworth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which contributed to her death in 1987 at the age of 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew international attention to Alzheimer's disease, a disease that had been virtually forgotten by the medical community since its discovery in 1906, and helped to greatly increase public and private funding for Alzheimer's disease research. The Rita Hayworth Gala, a benefit for the Alzheimer's Association, is held annually in Chicago and New York City. The program was founded in May 1985 by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, in honor of her mother. A Night at Sardi's Started in 1992 by Laurie Burrows Grad in memory of her father writer/director and Pulitzer Prize winner Abe Burrows who died from Alzheimer's disease, A Night at Sardi's was an evening of entertainment that has raised over $28 million to address this rapidly growing health crisis. The benefit originally chaired by Burrows Grad and her husband, Peter Grad, was held for the last time on March 9, 2016, and raised over 1.5 million dollars. This 24th and final \\"A Night at Sardi's\\" was chaired by Burrows Grad, James Burrows and Nicholas Grad, honoring and paying tribute to Laurie's late husband with the Philanthropy Award.

Looking for a way to raise funds for the Alzheimer's Association, Abbott organized a powder puff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan. The game is now played in 16 cities and Abbott has received national recognition for her efforts in raising over $2 million for the Alzheimer's Association. In 2014, \\"Blondes vs. Brunettes\\" rebranded as \\"RivALZ\\". Advocacy Forum The Alzheimer's Association Advocacy Forum is an annual gathering that takes place in the spring in Washington D.C. The multi-day event includes training sessions, celebrity guests, banquets, multi-media experiences and topical presentations focusing on Alzheimer's disease policy- making and legislation. The feature of the event is a lobby day during which time volunteer attendees conduct meetings with members of Congress on Capitol Hill. Past guest speakers and attendees include Soleil Moon-Frye, David Hyde Pierce, Lisa Genova, political commentators Frank Luntz and Charlie Cook, and members of Congress.Photo from Walk to End Alzheimer's in Lansing, Michigan.  Walk to End Alzheimer's  The Walk to End Alzheimer's is the world's largest event, hosted by The Alzheimer's Association, to bring awareness to Alzheimer's care. This event is held once a year in over 600 communities nationwide, brings together people of different ages, backgrounds and relationships to the disease to join the battle to fight against the disease. International Conference In 2000, the Alzheimer's Association anticipated establishing and running the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) and has made improvements in attendance, conceptual submissions and research-based presentations, and media relationships. The purpose of the AAIC is to join researchers together from all around the globe to report and converse about innovative research and data on the source, findings, cure, and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and associated illnesses. The AAIC is held annually and is the world's only largest forum for sharing research regarding the dementia research community. They accept thousands of abstract submissions and hold more than 2,000 scientific meetings to touch the millions of people affected by Alzheimer's with the use of print newspapers, radio broadcasting, and television newscast exposure. The AAIC has gained news coverage from ABC, the BBC, CBS, CNN, NBC, the Associated Press, Reuters, Good Morning America, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, USA Today, WebMD.com and Forbes.com. Through the customs of the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease (ICAD), the AAIC attempts to gather authority figures from more than 70 different countries to network and converse the most current dementia research outcomes and ideas in 2018. Alzheimer's Impact Movement Established in 2010, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement (AIM) is a registered 501(c)(4) advocacy organization that works in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association. AIM is a membership organization that is non-partisan, non-profit, and their objective is to make Alzheimer's disease a national importance. AIM supports policies designed to find an end to Alzheimer's disease through improved investments in research, enhanced care and support, and the advancement of methods designed to decrease the chance of developing dementia. AIM and the Alzheimer's Association offers a 24/7 helpline to provide advice, information, and support for those living with Alzheimer's disease, their caretakers, medical experts, and the community. AIM is a sister organization of the Alzheimer's Association, which has a voluntary and non-partisan political action committee, AIMPAC. AIMPAC is the political side of AIM, their goal is to inform members of Congress about the serious problems of Alzheimer's disease with the help of the main concerns of the Alzheimer's Association. During the 2015 and 2016 United States Presidential primary season, AIM supporters pressured each of the candidates for their individual ideas to end Alzheimer's. In the 2016 Presidential Election, AIM and the Alzheimer's Association distributed a national voter survey and results showed that 73 million voters in America knew someone close to them with Alzheimer's disease. Achievements The Alzheimer's Association has partaken in many opportunities to assist in diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's Disease. In 1987 the Alzheimer's Association teamed up with the NIA and Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company (now known as Pfizer) and helped launch and recruit participants for clinical trials of the first drug to specifically target symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. In 1995, the Alzheimer's Association funded the development of a mouse model of a rare neurodegenerative disorder, thus laying down the technical foundation for Alzheimer's mouse models. In 2003, the Alzheimer's Association partnered with the NIA in finding participants for the National Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study in order to identify Alzheimer's risk in genes. In 2004, researchers shared their first findings on an imaging agent called Pittsburg Compound B (PIB), a major potential breakthrough in disease monitoring and early detection that the Alzheimer's Association provided significant support to. In that same year, the Alzheimer's Association joined-in to sponsor the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a nationwide study that aims to create a standardized method for obtaining and interpreting brain images. In 2005, the Alzheimer's Association launched \\"Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association in hopes to further support a worldwide, interdisciplinary exchange within the Alzheimer's research community. In 2008, in hopes to maintain or improve the cognitive performance of adults, the Alzheimer's Association and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Healthy Brain Initiative. In that same year, the Alzheimer's Association created the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). In 2011, three workgroups brought together by the Alzheimer's Association and the NIA updated the information and guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease and came up with research criteria to define a new preclinical stage.

A popular fish in marine aquaria, it is the only member of the genus Paracanthurus. A number of common names are attributed to the species, including regal tang, palette surgeonfish, blue tang (leading to confusion with the Atlantic species Acanthurus coeruleus), royal blue tang, hippo tang, blue hippo tang, flagtail surgeonfish, Pacific regal blue tang, and blue surgeonfish. Description Paracanthurus hepatus has a royal blue body, yellow tail, and black \\"palette\\" design. The lower body is yellow in the west-central Indian Ocean. It grows to . Adults typically weigh around and males are generally larger than females. This fish is rather flat, like a pancake, with a circular body shape, a pointed snout-like nose, and small scales. The blue tang has nine dorsal spines, 26–28 dorsal soft rays, three anal spines, and 24–26 anal soft yellow rays. Ecology= Location  The regal blue tang can be found throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is seen in the reefs of the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, New Caledonia, Samoa, East Africa, and Sri Lanka. The regal blue tang is one of the most common and most popular marine aquarium fish all over the world. They live in pairs, or in small groups of 8 to 14 individuals. They can also be found near cauliflower corals on the seaweed side of coral reefs. The regal blue tang is ranked LC (least concern) by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), but is of low vulnerability. Diet As a juvenile, its diet consists primarily of plankton. Adults are omnivorous and feed on plankton, but will also graze on algae. Spawning occurs during late afternoon and evening hours. This event is indicated by a change in color from a uniform dark blue to a pale blue. The fish is important for coral health as it eats algae that may otherwise choke it by overgrowth. Life cycle Males aggressively court female members of the school, leading to a quick upward spawning rush toward the surface of the water during which eggs and sperm are released. The eggs are small, approximately in diameter. The eggs are pelagic, each containing a single droplet of oil for flotation. The fertilized eggs hatch in twenty-four hours, revealing small, translucent larvae with silvery abdomens and rudimentary caudal spines. These fish reach sexual maturity at 9–12 months of age. Importance to humans The regal blue tang is of minor commercial fisheries importance; however, it is a bait fish. The flesh has a strong odor and is not highly prized. This fish may cause ciguatera poisoning if consumed by humans. However, regal blue tangs are collected commercially for the aquarium trade. Handling the tang risks the chances of being badly cut by the caudal spine. These spines, on both sides of the caudal peduncle, are extended from the body when the fish is stressed. The quick, thrashing sideways motion of the tail can produce deep wounds that result in swelling and discoloration, posing a risk of infection. It is believed that some species of Acanthurus have venom glands while others do not. The spines are used only as a method of protection against aggressors. Two sharp spines stick out at the caudal peduncle—the area where the tail joins the rest of the body. Conservation The species is classified as Least concern by the IUCN, however it is threatened by overexploitation (mostly for the aquarium trade) and destructive fishing practices. Since it is dependent on fragile coral reef habitats, habitat destruction also constitutes a pressure in parts of its range. In popular culture In the 2003 Disney/Pixar film, Finding Nemo, one of the main characters, Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres) is a regal blue tang suffering from short term memory loss. She and her parents, Jenny and Charlie (voiced by Diane Keaton and Eugene Levy), appear in the 2016 Disney/Pixar film sequel, Finding Dory.

Early years McKay is the youngest son of the late John McKay, who was the Buccaneers' first head coach. McKay was a ball boy for the Buccaneers when his father was the head coach. While his father was head coach at USC in Los Angeles, McKay played quarterback at Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, California.http://www.redroom.com/blog/steven-robert- travers/rich-mckay-next-usc-athletic-director When John McKay took the Tampa Bay job he moved his family, including son Rich, to Florida where McKay played quarterback his senior year at Jesuit High School of Tampa the 1976–1977 season. He earned his bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1981 and graduated from Stetson University College of Law in 1984. Prior to entering the NFL, McKay was an attorney with the Tampa law firm of Hill, Ward, and Henderson. He and his wife, Terrin, have two sons, Hunter and John.Atlanta Falcons biography Professional career=Tampa Bay Buccaneers As the general manager for the Buccaneers from 1994 to 2003, McKay directed six teams that reached the NFC playoffs and one team that won a Super Bowl title. In 1996, McKay hired Tony Dungy as head coach, and in 1999 the Bucs played in the NFC Championship game. During his tenure as general manager, McKay drafted players such as Warren Sapp, Mike Alstott, Ronde Barber, Derrick Brooks, and Warrick Dunn. McKay constructed the 2002 Buccaneers' Super Bowl-winning roster that featured seven Pro Bowl players. The Buccaneers' 41 Pro Bowl selections between 1997 through 2002 were the most in the NFL. Sapp and Brooks – both selected by McKay in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft – are now both members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Sapp was enshrined in 2013; Brooks in 2014. According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, McKay is the only general manager in NFL history to have his first two draft picks as a GM be inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 1998, McKay, then President and General Manager of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, worked closely with the Glazer Family, the city of Tampa, former Tampa Mayor Dick Greco, and Tampa Stadium Authority on the successful construction and opening of Raymond James Stadium. Atlanta Falcons In December 2003, McKay left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to become president and general manager of the Atlanta Falcons. In his first season of directing operations, the Falcons went to the NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles. In January 2008, the Falcons hired Thomas Dimitroff as general manager, relegating McKay to the position of team president, although McKay negotiated Matt Ryan's contract. McKay's Falcons in 2010–11 had 9 Pro Bowlers. Sixteen years after building Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, McKay, as President and CEO of the Atlanta Falcons, worked closely with Falcons Chairman and owner Arthur Blank, the city of Atlanta, and the Georgia World Congress Center stadium authority to secure approval and financing for the Falcons to build a new $1.2 billion stadium in downtown Atlanta. The Falcons broke ground on the new building on May 19, 2014, and the stadium, known as Mercedes Benz Stadium, opened on August 26, 2017. McKay is believed to be the only current NFL executive who has been the point person for the negotiations and construction of two NFL stadiums. NFL committees McKay is the longest standing member in the history of the NFL Competition Committee (26 consecutive years, 22 of which he has served in the chairmanship role), making him one of the more influential executives in the league. McKay has served on the NFL Management Council Working Group of League executives that helps advise on collective bargaining issues. During the 2011 NFL lockout, McKay helped in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the NFLPA. McKay is also a member of the NFL's Health & Safety Committee.
