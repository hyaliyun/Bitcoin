In Vermont, the adjutant general is elected for a two-year term in a secret ballot of the Vermont General Assembly. The election takes place in February of each odd-numbered year for a term that begins in March. The major candidates for the position after Cray's retirement were Knight and David Baczewski, a retired Vermont Air National Guard brigadier general. Two other candidates also joined the race—retired Army Lieutenant Colonel David Graham, a former member of the Vermont Army National Guard, and Colonel (Retired) Rosanne Greco, a longtime member of the United States Air Force and resident of South Burlington who ran to protest the Air Force's plan to base F-35 fighter jets in Vermont. Winning the General Assembly vote requires a majority—91 votes if all 30 senators and 150 house members cast ballots. When lawmakers voted on February 21, 2019, 176 were present. Knight won the election on the first ballot with 95 votes, while Baczewski received 58, Greco 21, and Graham 2. Knight succeeded Cray in March and received a state promotion to brigadier general.

Hudnut proposed improving the convention and tourism budget, better optimizing use of Economic Development Commission, and floated the possibility of using tax-free bonds as a means to enlarge the city's employment base. However, he named crime to be his top issue, and called for strong leadership, better police training, and more resident participation in crime fighting. To address the high rate of unemployment among citizens between the ages of 18 and 30, Welch pledged to assemble all of the leaders of the community and \\"put the full power of the mayor's office\\" behind their efforts to address this. Welch promised he would hire a new police chief if elected, and also argued for more police officers to be placed on the street. The election saw the city's lowest voter turnout in 13 years.

He was born in 1248 to Ismail ibn Nasr, governor of Málaga and brother of Sultan Muhammad I. After Ismail's death, the Sultan brought the young Abu Said to court, where he became friends with his cousin, the future Muhammad II. When the latter became Sultan, Abu Said became his advisor on economic and military policies. He married Muhammad II's daughter Fatima, and in 1279 he was appointed as the royal governor in Málaga. The city—the realm's most important port—had just recently been recovered by the crown after a rebellion by the Banu Ashqilula since 1266 followed by a short occupation by the Marinids of Morocco since 1278. He implemented policies to pacify the population and improved the region's economic condition, as well as embarking on the construction of ships to strengthen the Granadan navy. As governor, he also led Málaga's troops in various campaigns on the Iberian Peninsula, including against rebels and against the Marinid Sultanate. He remained governor under the next Sultan, his brother-in-law Muhammad III, with whom he and his wife also enjoyed good relations. He led the Granadan campaign to conquer Ceuta in North Africa in 1306. His relations with the next Sultan, Nasr (r. 1309–1314), were poor and in 1311 he started a rebellion to enthrone his own son, Ismail, instead. His forces captured various castles and defeated the Sultan in battle, before being forced to return to Málaga after failing to besiege the capital. After this setback, he was deposed as governor of Málaga due to an attempt to yield the city to the Marinid Sultanate, and he was imprisoned by his son Ismail until his death in 1320. At some point after his imprisonment, Ismail restarted the rebellion and succeeded in taking the throne as Ismail I (r. 1314–1325).  Early life  Muhammad I, Abu Said's uncle and the founder of the Emirate of Granada. Abu Said Faraj was born in 1248, a son of Ismail ibn Nasr, brother of Muhammad, the founder of the Nasrid dynasty of Granada. The Sultan had appointed Ismail as governor of Málaga, a post that he held until his death in 1257. Upon Ismail's death, Muhammad brought his nine-year old nephew Abu Said to his court in Granada, and left Málaga under the governorship of Abu Muhammad ibn Ashqilula, a member of the Banu Ashqilula family—then allies of the Nasrids—who was also Muhammad's nephew.  Life at court  Selected members of the Nasrid dynasty up to Ismail I, including Abu Said Faraj. Sultans are depicted in boxes. At court, Abu Said became friends with his cousin, the Sultan's son Muhammad (future Muhammad II, born , ). Meanwhile, Málaga became a centre of a rebellion by the Banu Ashqilula which started in 1266 and was to last for almost two decades. When Muhammad I died in 1273 and was replaced by Muhammad II, Abu Said became the new Sultan's trusted adviser. Despite his youth, he was known for his intelligence and provided counsel on economic and military matters. Abu Said was credited with the Sultan's decision to expand and consolidate the crown lands and to replace pastures with cultivated land. Further strengthening ties between the two cousins, Abu Said married Muhammad II's daughter Fatima. The anonymous work al-Dahira al-Saniyya dates Abu Said's marriage to the year 664 AH (1265/1266), but modern historian María Jesús Rubiera Mata doubts the accuracy of this date: Fatima (born 659 AH) would have been a child then; additionally, the text confuses the bride as Muhammad I's daughter (while Fatima was his granddaughter), and says that the groom was his cousin (Abu Said was Muhammad I's nephew). Rubiera Mata suggests that the real marriage date was closer to the birth of the couple's first child, Ismail, in 1279. In that year, the Nasrid dynasty finally regained Málaga from the Marinid Sultanate of Morocco—to whom the Banu Ashqilula rebels handed the city one year earlier— and Abu Said was appointed to his father's former post of its governor. He departed on 11 February 1279, while Fatima likely remained initially in the royal palace complex of Alhambra to give birth to Ismail, who was born on 3 March.  Governor of Málaga  The Emirate of Granada in 1306 Málaga was the second largest city of the Emirate after the capital and its most important Mediterranean port, without which \\"Granada was no more than an isolated mountain-girt city\\", according to historian L. P. Harvey. As it had been reoccupied after a rebellion lasting more than a decade, governing the city posed a difficult challenge and Abu Said was likely chosen because of his administrative experience in addition to his father's previous tenure there. According to Rubiera Mata, Abu Said \\"would brilliantly overcome\\" these challenges. With his katib (secretary) Ibn Isa, he implemented polices—with both firmness and gentleness, according to the near-contemporary historian Ibn al-Khatib—which eventually won over the people of Málaga and improved economic conditions. He also became rich from the tax revenues of the region. He embarked on the project of constructing large ships in Málaga, to which Rubiera Mata attributes \\"the great power of the Nasrid fleet in the following years\\". He maintained high personal prestige due to his standing in the royal family as well as his administrative and military accomplishments, and began receiving dedications in works of literature. Ibn al-Khatib reported that he cared for his son Ismail, who enjoyed \\"the favour of his father\\" (ni'mat abihi). He also had a younger son, named Muhammad, whose birth date is unknown. Nasrid governors not only enjoyed administrative power over their regions, but were also the commander of the regional army. Málaga's troops under Abu Said's command were instrumental in Muhammad II's war against the Marinid Sultanate and in returning various outposts of the Marinids on the Iberian Peninsula to Granadan rule. He conducted vital military campaigns, principally in the area near the Straits of Gibraltar, including Algeciras, Gibraltar, and Tarifa. In 1295–1296, he led an unsuccessful campaign to suppress a rebellion in Ronda. The rebellion finally ended when Abu Abdallah ibn al-Hakim, the katib of Muhammad II and a brother of the city's rebellious leader, was sent to negotiate. Muhammad II died in 1302 and was succeeded by his son Muhammad III, Abu Said's brother-in law. According to near- contemporary historian Ibn Khaldun, Abu Said had the complete trust of the Sultan, who kept him as governor of Málaga throughout his reign. Abu Said was responsible for the 1306 conquest of Ceuta, on the North African shore, in the name of Muhammad III. Partly by the instigation of Abu Said's agents, the city had rebelled against their Marinid overlords in 1304 and was henceforth ruled by the Banu al-Azafi, a local noble family. However, on 12 May 1306 a Granadan fleet led by Abu Said arrived, was welcomed by local supporters and took over the city without a fight. The conquest of Ceuta gave Granada strategic control over both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar, but so alienated its neighbours that soon the Marinids, Aragon and Castile—its three larger neighbours—formed an alliance against Granada.  Rebellion  On 14 March 1309, Muhammad III was deposed in a palace coup and was replaced by his half-brother Nasr. At the same time, the triple alliance of the Marinids, Castile, and Aragon attacked Granada, and the ensuing war ended in various losses for Granada, including the return of Ceuta to the Marinids on 20 July 1309. Abu Said likely only returned to Málaga after this loss and continued his role as governor there. Unlike with the previous Sultan, Abu Said and his wife Fatima did not enjoy a good relation with Nasr. Furthermore, when Abu Said visited the capital to pay his respects, he found that the new Sultan was unpopular with the court. Apart from the losses in the war, Nasr—an astronomy enthusiast—was disliked for devoting himself to studying science, building astrolabes, and commissioning astronomical tables instead of working on state affairs. In addition, he was suspected of sympathising with the Christians, due to his Christian mother, his preference to dress in the Castilian manner, and his close ties with Ferdinand IV of Castile. Furthermore, the Sultan's vizier Muhammad ibn al-Hajj had grown up in Christian lands and spoke and dressed in the Castilian manner, adding to the dislike against the crown. A faction from court met with Abu Said and requested him to depose Nasr. According to the Arabist scholar Antonio Fernández-Puertas, Abu Said was further outraged at the drowning of Muhammad III at the order of Nasr after a failed attempt to restore him to the throne, but there are conflicting reports of when this assassination happened; other historians such as Francisco Vidal Castro considered the most likely date to be in February 1314, much after the start of the rebellion. Abu Said raised an armed rebellion in 1311 in Málaga, proclaiming his son Ismail—deemed to have better legitimacy than his father, as he was a grandson of Muhammad II through Fatima—as Sultan. He formed a rival court loyal to his son but whose authorities were only recognised inside the wilaya (province) of Málaga. In the same year, the Málagan army conquered the castles of Antequera, Marbella and Vélez. The army then moved towards Granada and defeated Nasr's army in battle at a place called al-Atsha in the Vega of Granada. The Sultan himself and lost his horse and had to run back to Granada on foot. Abu Said proceeded to besiege the capital but lacked necessary supplies for a protracted campaign. Upon discovering that Nasr had allied himself with Ferdinand IV, Abu Said sought peace and was able to retain his post as governor of Málaga in exchange for paying tribute to the Sultan.  Downfall of Abu Said and rise of Ismail  The castle of Salobreña, used as the royal family prison by the Nasrids, where Abu Said was imprisoned until his death. Fearing the Sultan's vengeance, Abu Said sent Ibn Isa to negotiate a secret deal with the Marinids, in which he were to yield Málaga in exchange for the governorship of Salé in North Africa. When this became known to the people of Málaga, they considered it a treachery. They rose up and deposed him in favour of his son Ismail. Abu Said remained free although Ismail kept him under watch in Málaga. During a visit outside the city, Abu Said was suspected to attempt to flee and then captured by Málaga's citizens. Ismail arrived before his father was harmed. He ordered the imprisonment of his father and moved him to a castle in Cártama. Meanwhile, the plot against Nasr continued at court, and Ismail restarted the rebellion with help from his mother Fatima and Uthman ibn al-Ula, the commander of the Volunteers of the Faith garrisoned in Málaga. As Ismail moved towards Granada, his army swelled and the capital's inhabitants opened the city gates for him. Nasr, besieged in the Alhambra fortress and palace complex, agreed to abdicate and retired to Guadix. Ismail took the throne in 1314, and ordered Abu Said moved to the Nasrid royal family prison in Salobreña. He remained in this castle—not being allowed to go beyond its gates—until he died in 24 April 1320 (14 Rabi al-Awwal 720 AH). His remains were brought to the capital, and he was buried in the royal cemetery (rawda) of the Alhambra, near the tomb of Muhammad II. His funeral was attended by Ismail I as well as the dignitaries of Granada. Centuries later with the surrender of Granada, the last Sultan Muhammad XII (also known as Boabdil) exhumed the bodies in this cemetery and reburied them in Mondújar, part of his Alpujarras estates.

Founded in 2005 the company is registered in the British Crown dependency of Jersey but headquartered in Greenwood Village, Colorado, United States. While it was formerly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, it was delisted in February 2020 as it sought creditor protection. Lydian International's major shareholders and lenders are the Resource Capital Funds (RCF Management LLC), Orion Resource Partners, Franklin Advisers of the Franklin Templeton Investments, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the state-owned Swedish Export Credit Corporation and others. Its ongoing active development is the Amulsar Gold Project located in south-central Armenia and 100% owned by Lydian International. In 2011, the company was issued a permit for prospecting and development of another gold site, Kela (Qela) in neighboring Georgia, the administrative area of Zoti Village, Chokhatauri. According to Lydian International the Kela project at the present time \\"does not comprise a material aspect of the Corporation’s business operations.\\"  Amulsar  Located in south-central Armenia, 170 km away from the capital city Yerevan and 13 km from the popular mountain resort town of Jermuk, the Amulsar project is a high sulfide, epithermal-type gold silver deposit bedded in volcanic rocks and sat in a structurally complex zone. It is set to be a large-scale, low-cost, heap leach operation with estimated mineral resources of 3.5 million measured and indicated gold ounces and 1.3 million inferred gold ounces targeted to production of approximately 225,000 ounces (7 tons) annually over an initial 10-year mine life. Lydian International says to create about 770 permanent jobs during the eleven years of production, pay nearly $50 million in annual taxes and contribute to around 1.4% of GDP of Armenia. The company plans to use cyanide to leach gold concentrate at Amulsar and the project is reported to pose health impacts, environmental risks, negative effects on tourism. A 2018 sociological study conducted around the area by a number of international organizations found that \\"85.7 per cent of respondents observed negative impacts on health,\\" such as increasing asthmatic attacks, lung diseases, dry skin, headaches and insomnia. Increased amounts of dust and muddy tap water in Jermuk and the nearby village of Gndevaz as well as an unusual dying of multiple fish in a local fish farm were reported after construction began in 2017. The mining project could potentially infringe on the habitat of the endangered Caucasian leopard. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank Group withdrew from financing the project in 2017 following complaints by NGOs over environmental and health concerns. Following the Armenian revolution of 2018 locals began a blockade of the mine in June of the same year after which Lydian International told that the protesters are conducting \\"artificial actions\\" and that other operators were trying to expel the company from Armenia. Lydian reported total losses of over $136 million as of 2018 and submitted notice to the Armenian government in March 2019 warning of plans to sue the country in corporate courts if the situation was not resolved. Surrounded by three rivers and two reservoirs, the mine site sits above a tunnel supplying water to Lake Sevan, the Caucasus region's biggest body of water. One of the largest freshwater lakes in Eurasia, Lake Sevan which holds some 25% of Armenia's fresh water, provides irrigation water as well as 90% of the fish catch in Armenia, is argued to be threatened of contamination by sulfidic mine tailings of Amulsar. A 2019 biodiversity assessment report found that the approval of the Amulsar Gold Project was in violation of Armenian Law and of Article 7 of the EBRD Environmental and Social Policy; did not comply with several articles of the Bern Convention, and \\"Many of the measures proposed in the ESIA [Environmental and Social Impact Assessment] report are likely to lead to null effect or even additional/cumulative direct negative effect on the conservation status of natural habitats or species protected in the ASCI (Emerald) Site.\\" Lydian International commissioned an environmental impact assessment in 2016 that stated there would be no significant impacts on the environment and local water supplies. The company also said they had invested over $500 million prior to 2019, that the blockade cost the company $100,000 a day and that they had to terminate 1,270 contracts due to it. A September 2019 openDemocracy article revealed details of advocacy British embassy representatives had carried out in favor of the mine project chronicling meetings between UK officials and Lydian representatives. The UK Foreign office was criticized by Labour MPs for its support of the mining company in Armenia. A Foreign Office spokesperson said in response: \\"British embassies play a positive role in helping to grow business around the world for UK companies. As such, the British embassy in Yerevan engages with British businesses active in the Armenian market.\\" During an August 29, 2019 video conference between the Lebanese company LARD and representatives of the Armenian government and members of parliament LARD experts told that \\"the activities proposed by Lydian have flaws... A new environmental impact assessment is needed,\\" therefore they could not conclude that the mine would be safe. They also said the Investigative Committee had pushed ELARD toward making a positive assessment. Lydian responded that ELARD's statements at the conference were “misleading” and said opponents of the project were being funded by its competitors. It was later reported that Armenia's Investigative Committee's official in charge of Amulsar, Yura Ivanyan, was related to the former environment minister who had earlier approved an assessment determining that the mine would be safe to operate which followed the announcement of an internal investigation into the matter by the Investigative Committee. Armen Sarkissian, the current president of Armenia occupied the position of director of Lydian International in 2013 prior to his appointment as the ambassador of Armenia to the United Kingdom.

There he served as the Commander (shaykh al-ghuzat) of the Volunteers of the Faith of Granada, and became one of the most important political figures of the Nasrid realm. Descended from branch of the Marinid dynasty, he entered the Nasrid service under Muhammad III after a failed rebellion against Sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf in his native Morocco. He was appointed to lead the Volunteers of the Faith in the western city of Málaga. When Muhammad III came into conflict with Abu Yaqub Yusuf over Ceuta, Uthman allied himself with Granada, conquered a part of Morocco and declared himself Sultan. He was eventually defeated in 1309 by Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, Abu Yaqub's grandson who became Sultan since 1308. He then returned to Granada, assisting with the relief of Almería against an Aragonese siege of 1309. He and the Volunteers under his command played an important role in the overthrow of Emir Nasr in favour of his nephew Ismail I. Under Ismail, he was appointed the overall chief of the Volunteers (shaykh al-ghuzat) and in this role won decisive victory against a Castilian Army at the 1319 Battle of Sierra Elvira. His power continued to grew, alienating other ministers in the Emirate, esppecially the Vizier Muhammad ibn al-Mahruq. The struggle between Uthman and Ibn al-Mahruq escalated to a civil war, which ended with Ibn al-Mahruq's assassination on the order of Sultan Muhammad IV and Uthman's retention of his previous power. He lost a battle against Castile in the Battle of Teba in 1330, and died on the same year at Málaga. Origin and first entry into Nasrid service Granada, Marinid Morocco, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula in the 14th century Uthman belonged to the Banu Abi al-Ula, a family related to the Berber Marinid dynasty ruling over Morocco, many of whose members served as governors and administrative officials. Nevertheless, during the rule of the Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr (), several members of this family rose in revolt against him. Like two other clans related to the Marinids and engaged in failed rebellions, the Banu Idris and Banu Rahhu, from 1286 dissident members of the Banu Abi al-Ula began finding refuge across the Straits of Gibraltar in the Emirate of Granada, where they and their followers were granted privileges and enlisted by the Nasrid emirs as \\"Volunteers of the Faith\\" against the encroachments of the Christian realms of Aragon and Castile. Uthman, who was to be the most prominent of these rebels, and eventually the most famous leader of the \\"Volunteers of the Faith\\", left North Africa in 1302 and entered Nasrid service under Muhammad III (), who appointed him as commander of a detachment of \\"Volunteers of the Faith\\" at Málaga. Rebellion in northern Morocco In 1306, Uthman returned to Morocco to lead a rebellion against Abu Yaqub, claiming the sultanate for himself. Backed by the Nasrids, who had taken control of Ceuta in 1306, Uthman captured the fortress of Aludan, which became his stronghold and base of operations. Taking advantage of Abu Yaqub's preoccupation with his attempt to capture Tlemcen, Uthman was able to take the towns of Asilah and Larache, defeat a Marinid army under the command of Abu Yaqub's son Abu Salim, and extend his rule over much of the Ghomara region as well. In 1307, Ksar el-Kebir recognized him as sultan. After Abu Yaqub's death, his successor Abu Thabit Amir () faced multiple revolts, but still concentrated much of his efforts against Uthman. The general al-Hasan ibn Amir ibn Abdallah An'ayab, first sent against Uthman, was unable to subdue him, and in June 1308, the rebel prince defeated another Marinid army under Abd al-Haqq ibn Uthman ibn Muhammad, and recapted Ksar el- Kebir. These setbacks forced Abu Thabit to take the field in person against Uthman: he captured Aludan by assault and the town of Domna, but his sudden death in 1308 cut short his plans and gave Uthman a reprieve. It was the new Marinid sultan, Abu al-Rabi Sulayman (), who in 1309 succeeded in defeating Uthman at Aladan and forcing him to abandon North Africa and seek refuge in the Nasrid emirate. Return to Nasrid service Map of the Nasrid Emirate of Granada in 1306 Immediately after his arrival in Granada, Uthman was ordered to assist the port city of Almería, which was being besieged by James II of Aragon. During the siege he distinguished himself not only through victories in clashes with the Christians, but also in his diplomatic skill in the negotiations that ended the siege. =Overthrow of Nasr and defeat of the Castilian invasion= In 1314, as commander of the North African garrison at Málaga, he played a critical role in the overthrow of Emir Nasr (), since it was the promise of support by his troops that gave the decisive impetus to the conspiracy to raise Ismail I () to the Nasrid throne. For reasons that are unknown, Nasr had become increasingly unpopular, and was dethroned on 8 February 1314, but allowed to retire to Guadix as its governor. While Uthman's support was crucial for the accession of Ismail I, not all North African troops followed him: the Zanata princes Abd al-Haqq ibn Uthman and Hammu ibn Abd al-Haqq ibn Rahhu and their men remained loyal to Nasr and followed him to Guadix. Nasr did not reconcile himself to his fate, and planned to regain his throne with the aid of Castile, whose vassal he had been since 1310. Indeed, in 1316, while Ismail laid siege to Guadix, a Castilian relief army invaded Granadan territory and marched on the city. Uthman confronted them at Wadi Fortuna, near Alicún. Details of the battle are contradictory, but it was likely won, albeit narrowly, by the Castilians, who thus gained a foothold close to Granada. Uthman's power and prestige grew continually in Granada, and he was able to secure his position as shaykh al-ghuzat (overall commander of the \\"Volunteers of the Faith\\") by side-lining potential rivals, such as his distaff relatives, the Banu Rahhu ibn Abdallah clan, which was exiled to Tunis. Such was his authority that when Granada requested Marinid aid in 1319 against the an all-out Castilian attempt to capture the city, Sultan Abu Sa'id Uthman II (), fearful of the former rebel, demanded as a precondition that he be handed over to Fez and kept in prison. The offer was rejected, and Uthman led the Nasrid troops, 5,000 strong, to a major victory over the Castilian army of 7,000 at the Battle of Sierra Elvira on 26 June 1319, which resulted in the death of the Castilian commanders, Infante Peter and Infante John. In its aftermath, an eight-year peace was signed between Granada and Castile on 18 June 1320, while the political infighting that erupted among the Castilian nobility further secured Granada from that direction. Uthman won great renown in the wars against the Christians, reportedly leading in total 732 raids into Christian terrtiory. In 1325, Uthman's forces captured the town of Rute. =Assassination of Ismail I and civil war against Ibn al-Mahruq= View of the Alhambra today On 9 July 1325, Emir Ismail I was assassinated, an event for which the sources unanimously accuse Uthman of masterminding. Ismail was succeeded by Muhammad IV (), but as he was underage, he was placed under the tutelage of a senior minister. Initially this was his father's vizier, Abu'l-Hasan ibn Masud, but he died soon after—from wounds received trying to shield Ismail—and was replaced by Muhammad ibn al-Mahruq, nominated by Uthman. Uthman thus became the dominant figure at court: having secured complete control, not only of the Volunteers of the Faith, but of the army as its effective commander-in-chief, he now also assumed the reins of government. Soon, however, his despotic behaviour alienated the other ministers, as he deprived them of authority and appropriated the state funds almost exclusively for the payment of the Volunteers. This led Ibn al-Mahruq to fear that the ambitious Uthman was planning a coup to seize power for himself, and an open rivalry emerged between the two, which climaxed in December 1326: Uthman's troops occupied the city and forced Ibn al-Mahruq and his followers to confine themselves to the Alhambra, whereas Ibn al-Mahruq sought for a rival candidate to dispute Uthman's control of the North African troops. This was found in the person of Yahya ibn Umar ibn Rahhu, Uthman's son-in-law and a member of the Banu Rahhu clan, whom Uthman had previously banished to Tunis. Yahya was appointed shaykh al-ghuzat, leading the North African troops to abandon Uthman, who was left only with his own family's followers. Faced with this abrupt reversal of fortune, Uthman chose to dissemble his intentions, pretending that he planned to seek refuge in North Africa. He even wrote to the Marinid sultan, Abu Sa'id Uthman, asking for a pardon and permission to return to Morocco. At the head of a thousand cavalry, he marched towards Almería, ostensibly to set sail for Morocco. Once he arrived in the city on 13 January 1327, he invited an uncle of Muhammad IV, Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Abi Sa'id, whom he proclaimed as sultan at the end of the month, with the laqab (regnal name) of al-Qa'im bi-amr Allah (\\"He who carries out God's orders\\"). On 4 April, he secured the submission of the fortress of Andarax, which he made into his stronghold for the struggle against Ibn al-Mahruq and Ibn Rahhu. The surrounding areas soon also recognized his authority. In the ensuing civil war, Uthman did not hesitate to make contact with the Castilians for a common front against Granada. King Alfonso XI of Castile quickly moved to profit from the division in the Granadan state by invading its western provinces, and some Muslim sources even report that one of Uthman's sons guided King Alfonso during his invasion of the province of Ronda and the capture of Olvera in June 1327. The hard-pressed Nasrid court was forced to surrender Ronda and Marbella, followed by Algeciras in the next year, to the Marinids in exchange for troops. The losses inflicted by the civil war forced Muhammad IV to act: in July/August 1328, Muhammad IV effected a reconciliation with Uthman, who settled in Guadix, while on 6 November 1328 Muhammad IV's household slaves assassinated Ibn Mahruq. The pretender Abu Abdallah was sent to North Africa, while Uthman returned to his office as shaykh al-ghuzat. The civil war ended with Uthman firmly ensconced in his previous position. =Final years and the career of Uthman's sons= In 1330, Uthman suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of King Alfonso XI at the Battle of Teba. He died soon after, in the same year, at Málaga. His son, Abu Thabit Amir, succeeded him as shaykh al-ghuzat. Amir's opposition to the policies pursued by Muhammad IV led to the latter's murder in 1333, and the subsequent expulsion of the Banu Abi'l-Ula back to North Africa by Muhammad IV's successor, Yusuf I (). Another son of Uthman, Sulayman, fought on the side of Alfonso XI in the Battle of Río Salado in 1340. Another son of his, Idris, also entered Nasrid service after leading a failed coup to seize power at Fez in 1357, and in turn became shaykh al-ghuzat in 1359–1362.

Biography Schober studied history, art history and political science in Vienna, Frankfurt and Colchester. In 2009 she got her postdoctoral habilitation at the University of Vienna with a thesis on aesthetic tactics as a means of political emancipation in modernity and the present.Schober, Anna (2009). Ironie, Montage, Verfremdung. Aesthetische Taktiken und die politische Gestalt der Demokratie. München: Wilhelm Fink. Schober completed a number of international research stays for example at the Center for Theoretical Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Essex, Colchester (2000-2003) and at the Jan Van Eyck Academie in Maastricht (2003). At the University of Vienna she directed the FWF projects \\"Aesthetic tricks as a means of political emancipation\\" (2003-2006) and \\"City Squats: The Cinema as a space for political action\\" (2006-2009). From 2009 to 2011, Schober was Marie Curie Fellow and Visiting Professor at the University of Verona, where she carried out the project \\"Picturing Gender\\".Schober, Anna (2016).

In 2011 she took over a Mercator Visiting Professorship at the Institute of Sociology of the University of Giessen, where she also worked as a deputy professor and head of a DFG research project until 2016. Since September 2016 Anna Schober is Professor of Visual Culture at the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt. Scientific contribution In her dissertation \\"Blue Jeans. An artificial mythology \\", Schober reconstructs how myths about the Blue Jeans have constituted in different visual worlds (silent films, documentary photography, Hollywood films and youth subcultures) as well as in various consumer milieus in the USA and Western Europe since the end of the 19th century and how these myths have been transnationally transmitted and transformed.Schober, Anna (2001). Blue Jeans. Vom Leben in Stoffen und Bildern. Frankfurt/ New York: Campus. In her postdoctoral habilitation, Schober explores the invention of an avant-garde and neo-avant-garde tradition in Western and Southeastern Europe, connected with a history of protest movements in the 20th and 21st centuries. The goal was to create a critical genealogy of these practices in order to re- evaluate aesthetic intervention into the public sphere, emphasizing the incalculability of these endeavors and their contingent participation on the constitution of aesthetic-political hegemonies.Schober, Anna (2009). Ironie, Montage, Verfremdung. Aesthetische Taktiken und die politische Gestalt der Demokratie. München: Wilhelm Fink. Schober continues her genealogical research in the project \\"Everybody - a transnational iconography\\" funded by DFG and writes a genealogy and iconography of \\"everybodies\\" - anthropomorphic iconic figures addressing and involving the audience.Schober, Anna (2019). Popularisation and Populism in the Visual Arts: Attraction Images, London and New York: Routledge (Arts and Visual Culture Series). In a research project on cinema as a movement in Central and Southeastern Europe, Schober examined how since the 1960s cinema spectators became cinema makers through such practices as squatting in existing cinema spaces, organizing cinema \\"events,\\" writing about film, and making films themselves. Drawing on a corpus of interviews with cinema activists, Schober compares the activities and artistic productions they staged in urban environments in Germany, Austria, and the former Yugoslavia. This study focuses on differences and similarities in the development of political public culture in countries with pluralist- democratic, one-party socialist, and post-socialist traditions.Schober, Anna (2013).

Kershaw was born in Boughton, Nottinghamshire, where his father George was a vicar. Like two of his brothers, Bertram and Sidney, he took an interest in entomology from a young age. He was influenced by David Sharp and Edward Poulton. In 1898 he went to Hong Kong and there he met amateur ornithologist Frederick William Styan and became interested in the birds of the Macao region. He helped Frederick A. G. Muir of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association in entomological studies between 1906 and 1907 to locate parasites of sugarcane pests. In 1906 Kershaw published a book on the Butterflies of Hong Kong. Kershaw continued to work with the sugarcane planters' association and travelled to northern Australia in 1910 and helped in breeding the tachinid fly, Lixophaga sphenophori, at the Mossman sugar mill to control the sugarcane weevil Rhabdoscelus obscurus. He worked for a while Trinidad in 1912 before returning to England after World War I (1918).

Many of them volunteered because they saw the defense of Muslims as their religious duty. Although North African volunteers appear in the Iberian peninsula already in the 11th century under the term ghuzāt, recruitment was expanded during the last years of Muhammad I of Granada (), and they were institutionalised and further expanded by his son Muhammad II al-Faqih (). Over time, the Volunteers eclipsed Granada's indigenous troops and became its main military force, numbering 10,000 by the end of Muhammad II's rule. Their leader, the shaykh al-ghuzat, held an influential position in the emirate's politics, as did regional ghuzat commanders appointed in major cities such as Guadix, Ronda, and Malaga.On the history of the office of shaykh al-ghuzat and its holders, cf. History and function The Iberian Peninsula and North Africa in the 14th century. The Nasrid Volunteers have their origin in the complex relationship between the Nasrid emirate and the Marinid dynasty that ruled North Africa from Fez: many of the Volunteers were dissatisfied or rebellious Marinid factions, often led by a dissident member of the Marinid dynasty, who sought refuge in Granada after their defeat. Although the structure of the Nasrid army is still unclear, it is likely that each group of Volunteers retained their separate identity and leadership, continuing to serve under the same prince and his family who had brought them from North Africa. The main headquarters of the Volunteers was located at Fuengirola. For the Marinid sultans this was a useful release valve, ridding them of potentially troublesome elements and rivals for the throne, but also allowing the Marinid regime to continue to portray itself as a defender of the Muslims of al-Andalus and continuator of the jihad traditions of its Almohad and Almoravid predecessors. For the Volunteers themselves, and especially their leaders, Nasrid service presented a safe refuge, especially given the willingness of the Nasrid emirs to accord them considerable autonomy, and a chance to gather forces and make contacts to renew their attempts to overthrow the sultan in Fez. Finally, the Nasrid emirs benefited considerably from the infusion of military strength, but also used the presence of the rival Marinid factions, and the threat of allowing them to return to North Africa, to exercise pressure on the sultans in Fez. As the Volunteers quickly became major power-brokers in the Nasrid emirate, the shaykh al-ghuzat often became a kingmaker. As a result, Emir Muhammad V () suppressed the office during his second reign, sometime between 1369 and 1374. From that point on, the Volunteers were under the direct command of the Nasrid ruler, and lost their previous autonomy and political power.  Name  The Arabic name al-ghuzat al-mujahidin means \\"warriors of the jihad.\\" The name \\"Volunteers of the Faith\\" originates from the phrase used in Baron de Slane's 19-century French translation of Ibn Khaldun's Kitāb al-ʿibar discussing this military group. The phrase is used by historians up to modern times.

Francesco d’Errico (second right) and Lucinda Backwell (left back) with friends at Tsumkwe, Namibia.  Education and career  d'Errico was born in Foggia, Italy and at the age of seven he was already searching for archaeological remains, in this case flint- stones, in the Puglia region of south-east Italy. His early education was at Liceo Classico Massimo d'Azeglio in Turin. He completed a MA in Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Turin in 1982 followed by a DEA in Prehistory and Quaternary geology at the University of Paris in 1985. During this time he was a fellow of the Italian Ministry of Research at the Institut de Paléontologie Humaine, Paris. In 1986 d'Errico completed his Diploma di Specializzazione in Archeologia Preistorica at the University of Pisa and in 1987 he was visiting professor at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, Institut de Paléontologie Humaine, Paris. He completed his PhD in prehistory and quaternary geology at Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris in 1989. In 1991 he was employed as a contract researcher at Monrepos Archäologisches Forschungszentrum und Museum für menschliche Verhaltensevolution in Neuwied, Germany. In 1992 d'Errico worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Madrid and from 1992-1993 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cambridge, England. In 1994 he was appointed research associate at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research of the University of Cambridge and joined the CNRS at the University of Bordeaux's De la Préhistoire à l’Actuel: Culture, Environnement et Anthropologie (PACEA) laboratory. In 1999 d'Errico worked as a visiting professor at the University of the Witwatersrand (WITS), South Africa and between 2015 and 2017 he was a Professorial Fellow at the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Palaeoscience in the Evolutionary Studies Institute at WITS.

His research has indicated that jewelry, engravings, pigments and tools made from bones were used in Northern and Southern Africa at least years ago, which is earlier than the previously accepted scenarios for the development of modern behaviour. Some of his research interests are the evolution of human cognitive abilities as evidenced by the use of bone tools and symbolism, including grave goods used during burial rituals in the Paleolithic period and systems of notation from the same time period. He has studied the extinction of Neanderthals and their relations with the modern humans that replaced them; and the role climate change had on human evolution. Research at Border Cave in South Africa, conducted with Lucinda Backwell and other colleagues, showed that beads, bone tools and other artefacts reminiscent of those used by San hunter-gatherers were already present in southern Africa years ago. = Current research = In 2019, d'Errico and his colleague Lucinda Backwell were collaborating on a book on the ethnoarchaeology of the San people from the Kalahari. The book is the result of the examination of San artefacts, collected by Louis Fourie between 1916 and 1928, by four San elders and their descriptions of the manufacture, use and meaning of these items.

The victim was a 23-year-old female student, who was attending Jagiellonian University. Investigators and experts from other countries were called to assist in solving the crime, including the FBI. Police made the first arrest in 2017. 19 years later, after discovering new evidence. As of September 2019, the suspect remains in custody while investigators continue to gather evidence.  Disappearance and discovery of remains  In 1998, Katarzyna Zowada began studying religion at Jagiellonian University, located in nearby Kraków. According to friends, she was a nice, although \\"sad and withdrawn\\" person. She had suffered from depression since the death of her father in 1996. During her time at the university, she changed her field of study twice. After her first semester as a psychology student, she briefly attended a history course before settling on religious studies. On 12 November 1998, Katarzyna was due to meet her mother at the Psychiatric Clinic in Nowa Huta, where she had been treated for her depression. She never made it to the appointment. Later that day, Katarzyna's mother attempted to file a missing person's report at the local police station but was told to wait. On 6 January 1999, while on the Vistula, the crew of the Elk pusher tug found a piece of foreign matter on the ship. After examination, it was discovered to be human skin. DNA tests indicated it belonged to Katarzyna. On 14 January, Katarzyna's right leg was also recovered from the river.  Investigation  In May 1999, the Forensic Medicine Unit in Kraków received a corpse of a man with a severed and scalped head. The killer, Vladimir W., turned out to be the son of the victim, originally from the Caucasus. Prior to the arrest, he was seen in a mask made of skin pulled from the head of his own father. Initially, investigators suspected that Vladimir committed Katarzyna's murder, however, no evidence was found to support it. He was later charged with his father's murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison. After a few years, he was transferred to a prison in Russia at his own request. A year later, the investigation was formally dropped because the perpetrator had not been discovered, but police officers involved in the case continued investigating credible leads. In 2012, thanks to advances in the field of forensic research and cooperation with experts, the prosecutor's office resumed the investigation. A team of police officers from the \\"X-Files\\" (cold case unit) was brought in. The exhumation and additional autopsy of Katarzyna's remains were ordered. Experts from the 3D Expertise Laboratory of the Wrocław Medical University created a model of injuries inflicted on the victim. They concluded that the attacker had used a sharp tool to wound his victim on her neck, armpit and groin, to inflict pain and cause her to bleed to death. In 2014, an FBI representative for Europe created a psychological profile of the suspect, pointing to his sadistic tendencies. In 2016, investigators consulted with University of Coimbra professor Duarte Nuno Vieira, a Portuguese specialist in forensics and UN expert in the field of signs of torture on the human body. He confirmed that Katarzyna was tortured before her death and that the perpetrator was probably trained in martial arts, specifically one particular, undisclosed variation.  The arrest of the suspect  On 4 October 2017, 19 years after the murder, police arrested 52-year old Robert J. in Cracow's Kazimierz district. Investigators searched his apartment and found blood in the bathroom. As a result, the bath and frame were secured for further testing. He was a person of interest in 1999 but had not been arrested. Robert J. fit the psychological profile as he was trained in martial arts, knew the victim, visited the victim's grave and had a history of harassing women. He had previously worked in a dissecting lab, where he dealt with human corpses. He also worked at the Cracow Institute of Zoology, where he could observe the process of preparing animal skins. His employment was terminated the day after he killed all of the institute's rabbits during his shift. Robert J. couldn't explain his actions. The police detained him after a letter from the suspect's friend. The contents of the letter are a closely guarded secret of the investigation. Robert J. was charged with aggravated murder with particular cruelty. He maintains that he did not know Katarzyna Zowada. The Court of Appeal agreed to extend his detention until 6 September 2018 while investigators gathered evidence. In December Robert J. complained of harassment from the prison guards. The claims were investigated and found to be groundless. As of September 2019, Robert J. has not yet been released. Investigators requested a closed trial.

The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1988. Overview Nagahama Castle is located on a small hill on Suruga Bay south of downtown Numazu. The castle is very small, with a length of only 100 meters. and consists of terraces built along the contour of the hill, protected by clay walls and dry moats. Vulnerable portions of the ramparts were faced with cut stone. The route to the inner bailey zigzagged through the second and third bailey, with gates in between. The top of the castle overlooks the anchorage of Uchiura, which was a strategic for the Late Hōjō clan and later the Takeda clan. History In the 1570s, the Late Hōjō clan based at Odawara Castle in Sagami province and the Takeda clan from Kai Province went to war over the disputed territories of the former Imagawa clan in Suruga Province. The Takeda clan occupied most of Suruga from 1569 and had inherited the Imagawa navy; however the Hōjō clan also had a powerful navy, with which it controlled Sagami Bay and waged war against the Satomi clan of Awa Province. In the 1570s, the Takeda reached an agreement with the Satomi, which allowed them to shift their fleet to Suruga Province, and constructed Nagahama Castle, on the border of Izu and Suruga as a base of operations. Although the Hōjō clan was unable to destroy the Takeda navy, their fleet was able to keep the Takeda fleet largely bound to port. After the fall of the Takeda clan in 1582, the Hōjō clan came into conflict with Oda Nobunaga and his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Hideyoshi's forces included the Kuki clan based in Shima Province and the Murakami clan based in the Seto Inland Sea, the two strongest naval powers in Sengoku Japan. During the 1590 Siege of Odawara, the Hōjō navy faced overwhelming odds and surrendered at Nagahama Castle and at Shimoda. Nagahama Castle was abandoned soon afterwards.

In 1867, he immigrated to the United States where he worked as a clerk by in Washington, D.C., Parkersburg, West Virginia, and Lawrenceburg, Pennsylvania. In 1876, he co-founded Siegel, Hartsfield & Company in Chicago. In 1887, he co-founded the Siegel-Cooper Company, also in Chicago, with Frank H. Cooper and Isaac Keim. In 1896, Siegel-Cooper opened a store in New York City in the Ladies' Mile Historic District. In 1902, Henry Siegel sold the company to one of his major stockholders, Captain Joseph B. Greenhut and his son Benedict J. Greenhut, who merged the store with B. Altman across the street in New York City creating a mega-store. In the same year, Siegel bought the Simpson Crawford Company (with one store in New York across the street from Siegel- Cooper) and the Schlesinger and Mayer Company (with one store in Chicago and one store in New York) and moved to New York City. In 1905, Siegel founded The Henry Siegel Company and opened a large store in Boston at 600 Washington Street; he also created a holding company, the Siegel Stores Corporation, as the parent for his retail investments in New York, Chicago, and Boston.

History Bauxite deposits in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, 1986 USGS map Bauxite was first discovered in modern Indonesia in the Riau Islands in 1924, under the Dutch East Indies administration. Production commenced in the 1930s, with the volume of ore mined between 1936 and 1960 being between 100 and 400 thousand tonnes, rising to 900,000 tonnes by 1967 and averaging over 1 million tonnes in the 1970s. During this time, most production was centered in the island of Bintan, with some mining operations in the smaller surrounding islands. Most ores in this period were exported to Japan, with smaller quantities being sold to Europe and North America. There were also no alumina plants in Indonesia, though there were proposals to construct one in Bintan and another in the then newly discovered bauxite deposits in West Kalimantan. Additionally, an aluminium smelter was proposed, which was to utilize hydroelectric power from the Asahan River. In 2014, the Indonesian government banned the export of raw bauxite among other ores, intended to stimulate the development of aluminium smelters in the country. However, the ban failed to meet its objectives, with bauxite importers purchasing more ore from neighboring Malaysia. Production Indonesia produced an estimated 7.1 million tonnes of bauxite in 2018, compared to 2.9 million tonnes in 2017. Ores Most of Indonesia's known reserves of bauxite are located in the Riau Islands (namely Bintan), the Bangka Belitung Islands, and West Kalimantan. The reserves are in form of laterite ores, and the United States Geological Survey gave a figure of 1.2 billion tonnes of bauxite in Indonesia's reserves.

It is designated as a Category A listed building. History The chapel was built between 1541 and 1544 using money bequeathed by Michael MacQueen (died 1537), supplemented by his widow, Janet Rynd (or Rhynd). The Foundation Charter of 1547 reads: 'when the said Michael was greatly troubled with an heavy Disease, and oppressed with Age, yet mindful of Eternal Life, he esteemed it ane good Way to obtain Eternal Life, to erect some Christian Work, for ever to remain and endure.' It was designed to accommodate a chaplain and act as an almshouse for seven poor men who were to pray for the soul of Mary, Queen of Scots. Prior to the Reformation, the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise arranged academic lectures there. Patronage of the chapel passed to the Incorporation of Hammermen (metalworkers) on the death of Janet Rhynd in 1553. After the Reformation, the patrons – the Hammermen – met financial trouble. The chaplain, who remained a Roman Catholic, was replaced by a Protestant minister, but successfully sued to continue to receive his salary until his death in 1567. Under the terms of the Foundation Charter, the Chapel was required to undertake Roman Catholic worship and the Hammermen were prohibited from doing anything against Roman Catholic interests or the property would revert to Janet Rynd's heirs. Since these terms were now breached, the tenants stopped paying their rent, knowing the Hammermen could not force them to pay. Only the wealth of the Hammermen allowed them to continue as patrons. From 1596 it was also the regular meeting place of the Convenery of the Trades of Edinburgh. The meeting-place was so closely identified with the Convenery of Trades that ‘Magdalen Chapel’ was often used as a metonym for the Convenery itself. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was held in the Chapel in April 1578. There is a tradition that the first General Assembly in December 1560 was also held in the Chapel. Several conventicles of the Covenanters were held in the Chapel, the largest being that of May 1674 at which William Weir was the preacher.http://www.scottishreformationsociety.org/wp- content/uploads/2016/12/Issue3-July-Sept_v41.pdf The bodies of the Marquis of Argyle in 1661, Hew Mackail in 1666, and John Dick in 1684 were prepared for burial in the chapel after they were executed. The heads and hands of martyred Covenanters were displayed in various locations in Edinburgh in 1689, and were collected at the chapel prior to burial in Greyfriars Kirk. The Chapel was used by Episcopalians, and by a Baptist congregation in the 18th century. A printing press was located either in the Chapel or a nearby building in the 18th century. In the early nineteenth century it was used as a place of worship by the Bereans, a Protestant sect following former Scottish Presbyterian minister John Barclay (1734-1798) who held to a modified form of Calvinism. The Hammermen sold the chapel in 1857 to the Protestant Institute for Scotland, and it was used by the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society. Architects Simpson and Brown undertook a major restoration programme in 1992/93. It is now the headquarters of the Scottish Reformation Society. Design features An inscription over the door reads 'He that hath pity upon the poore lendeth unto the Lord and the Lord will recompence him that which he hath given, Pro. XIX vers XVII.' A semi-circular wooden platform was installed at the east end around 1615 and the layout of the Chapel was altered. The carved armorial panel over the door was created by John Sawer in the same year, and was moved to its current location in 1649. The tower and spire were added about 1620. A bell, by the Dutch bell founder Michael Burgerhuys of Middelburg, dates from 1632. The original ceiling, no longer extant, was painted in 1725 by Alexander Boswall in 'skye colour with clouds and a sin (sic: sun) gilded in the centre'. ' A fragment is on display on the south wall. The panelling records gifts from members of the Incorporation of Hammermen. The stained glass in the middle window of the south wall features the Royal Arms of Scotland and the Arms of Mary of Guise.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Guise#/media/File:Coat_of_arms_of_Marie_of_Guise_(mother_of_Mary,_Queen_of_Scots)_as_Duchess_of_Longueville.png It is the only intact pre-Reformation stained glass window in Scotland. A sword that reputedly belonged to the Covenanter Captain John Paton and the table used to prepare the bodies of the Covenanters for burial (after their execution in the nearby Grassmarket) are still present in the chapel.

Plot  Dany Longo, a secretary in an advertising agency, is asked by her boss, Michel Caravaille, to stay overnight at his house to type up a document for him to take on a business trip to Geneva. Caravaille is married to Anita, Dany's former colleague and roommate. In the morning, Caravaille requests Dany accompany him and Anita to the airport to drive their large American car back home. Afterward, left alone with the car, Dany impulsively decides to drive to the Riviera because she has never seen the sea. On the way south, a woman who owns a roadside café stops her, and says Dany forgot her coat there the night before. Dany insists that she has never been there before and leaves. Later at a service station Dany is assaulted in the bathroom and someone injures her left hand. She is bemused as various strangers keep claiming to know her and insisting that her hand was already bandaged when they first saw her. Heading further south she meets Philippe, and they spend the night together. The following day Philippe, who is a smalltime con man, steals Dany's car. She later finds the car abandoned in Marseille, and discovers a man's body and a gun in the trunk. She is able to locate Philippe and convince him to help her. They search the dead man's pockets and find out that his name is Maurice Kaub. Philippe also discovers there a telegram addressed to Kaub and signed by Dany. After that, Philippe hits her and leaves. Dany enlists help from a friendly trucker named Jean Le Gueven whom she previously met on the road. He seems to be the only person who believes in her innocence. Dany asks him to pick up the coat she supposedly left in that roadside café earlier. In the meantime, Dany visits Kaub's villa in Avignon and oddly finds both some of her clothes and also nude pictures of herself. Afterward, she meets with Le Gueven who has brought back the coat. She finds a pay envelope in the pocket. Since she already has an identical pay envelope in her bag, Dany is now convinced of her innocence. She returns to Kaub's villa, and finds her boss Caravaille waiting for her. She points a gun at him and warns him that she has already sent both pay envelopes to the police. Caravaille confesses that Kaub was one of Anita's lovers, whom she murdered at his home. To frame Dany, he and Anita planted evidence including the coat, and set up various incidents on the road from Avignon to Paris to establish her guilt. It was Caravaille who attacked her in the bathroom and injured her hand. Then Caravaille says he is going to turn himself in and take the blame for Kaub's murder. Style and structure According to Simon Kemp, subjectivity in Japrisot's novels is at the root of his mystery plotting. “His texts are narrated or focalized through characters whose restricted perspective on the events they experience keeps the reader equally in the dark until the moment of revelation comes for both of them.” The novel is divided into four parts: \\"The Lady\\", \\"The Car\\", \\"The Glasses\\", and \\"The Gun.\\" \\"The Lady\\" and \\"The Glasses\\" are narrated in first person from Dany's point of view. \\"The Car\\" is told in third person from the perspectives of other characters: Manuel the car mechanic and Philippe the con man. The last part \\"The Gun\\" is narrated by Michel Caravaille who explains how the plot was carried out.  Reception  The novel was the winner of the 1966 Prix d'Honneur in France and received the Crime Writer's Association Gold Dagger for the best crime novel of 1968 by a foreign writer. Howard Junker in Newsweek called it \\"a chilling, baffling psychological fooler that sparkles with all the juicy terrors that can attack the heart and body\\", and added that Japrisot is \\"a great talent, whom students of the popular novel and of the narrative form in general will want to analyze.\\" NBMagazine said it \\"it’s contrived but elegantly conceived\\", and added that \\"the impossibly convoluted plotting that is now common place, and so popular, in modern psychological thriller writing owes a lot to this 1966 novel.\\" The reviewer also said \\"there’s a typically French wit about this thriller.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a circuitous, charged photomontage with the attractive cinematic effects it will undoubtedly retain on the screen.\\" The Guardian described it as a \\"fever- dream tale\\", \\"far-fetched but utterly captivating.\\"  Adaptations  * 1970: The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun, French-American film directed by Anatole Litvak * 1992: Daam Autos (The Lady in the Car), Estonian film directed by Peeter Urbla * 2001: Dama v ochkakh, s ruzhyom v avtomobile (The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun), Russian TV miniseries directed by Yuri Goldin and Sergei Babitsky * 2015: The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun, French film directed by Joann Sfar  References  Category:1966 French novels Category:French crime novels Category:French novels adapted into films Category:Simon & Schuster books ","title":"The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun (novel)"},{"id":"61763304","text":"The Mpumalanga Division of the High Court of South Africa is a superior court of law with general jurisdiction over the Mpumalanga province of South Africa.

Stýrivolt is closely related to Knüffeln and both are descended from the German game of Karnöffel, the oldest European card game with a continuous tradition of play. Styrivolt probably evolved from Karnöffel during the early 17th century and must have quickly spread to Scandinavia for, in 1648 in Sweden, a game with the name stýr-wålt is mentioned in the poem, Hercules (Herkules), by Georg Stiernhielm. On the Faroes, the game has been played since the 18th century, being mentioned, for example, in Jens Christian Svabo's Indberetninger fra en Reise i Færöe, 1781 - 1782. As Styrvolt, the game is described in several Danish games compendia, the earliest being Politiske Spille Regler for de tilladelige og meest brugelige Spil i Vertshusene (1774), an example of which is in the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen. From these sources it is clear that Stýrivolt has changed little over the last two centuries. Another early Danish reference is found in a 1798 book on the culture of North Zealand in which Styrvolt is mentioned three times, including as a game at which farmers play for money. Stýrivolt is a game for four players in two teams of two. There are five permanent trumps and two chosen suits with cards that have different privileges as follows: *Aces and Jacks - full trumps *Sixes, Twos, Threes and Fours - partial trumps i.e. they can only beat certain cards in the unchosen suits, *Sevens - unbeatable when led, otherwise worthless *Eights and Nines - free cards, only beatable by trumps when led, otherwise worthless *Kings and Queens - some privileges when led *Fives - only useful for exchanging with a trump turnup Several Faroese terms in Stýrivolt are derived directly from the German language. For example, the karniffil (from German Karnöffel) is the Jack and the pavstur (from the German Papst i.e. \\"Pope\\") is the Six. Stýrivolt has become a rare pastime now on the Faroes. In 1975, an article in the cultural magazine, Varðin, said that it was threatened by extinction and had practically disappeared from Denmark. In the same article it was described as \\"a little complicated to understand\\", but also as \\"extremely entertaining\\" once one had first learnt the special terminology. This article was published in English in 1998 (see Literature) and described the rules as the game was played in Kvívík.

Her efforts specifically focused on exposing former neo-Nazi and Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.  Early life and education  Elizabeth Rickey was born on June 11, 1956 in Lafayette, Louisiana to Horace B. Rickey Jr., an army lieutenant colonel in World War II, and his wife Flora Ann Womback. She had a brother named Robert and her uncle, Branch Rickey, was the first to sign an African American baseball player, Jackie Robinson, to major league baseball. The family was traditionally Republican and Rickey followed their beliefs. Her family did not agree with racism or racist ideologies. She attended what is now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where she received a Master's Degree in government, and Tulane University, where she earned a PhD in political science. Rickey's father was a member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee, and in 1988 Rickey also become a member. After hearing David Duke speak on several occasions and one journalist familiar with Rickey noted that she recognized “that Duke was both more sinister than ordinary redneck racists and far more politically savvy.\\" She felt that when he spoke, people could not always sense the racism in his words and as such, would not be able to see his true nature and danger. After the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism was formed in March 1990 by Lance Hill, Lawrence N. Powell, Jane Buchsbaum, and James Stovall, a minister from Baton Rouge, Rickey quickly joined.  Exposing David Duke  Rickey strongly disagreed with David Duke and viewed him as a sinister person. She stated that he was \\"a racial ideologue of a type that I have yet to encounter in my entire lifetime,\\" and stated that he was worse than George Wallace and that he is \\"truly a type that one would find in the 1930s in Germany. He sees himself at this Messiah, that he's going to save the white race\\". Duke described his time in the Ku Klux Klan as a \\"youthful indiscretion\\" and after he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives as a Republican, Rickey began following Duke and recording what he stated at public gatherings. She began with a gathering of the Populist Party that was attended by Art Jones, whose hand Duke shook, and by people openly identifying as skinheads and members of the Ku Klux Klan. During his speech he described his win as a \\"victory for the white majority\\" and when Rickey's recording was later aired, Duke described the meeting as a conservative, anti-tax rally. After learning of Rickey, Duke attempted to change her mind by inviting her to lunch, where he tried to convince her that the Holocaust had never happened, Jews in the concentration camps died of starvation, and warned her of the atrocity of mixing races. She took notes during the meeting, which led into her recording of the Populist Party gathering. Duke lost the 1991 election to Governor Edwin Edwards, with only 38.8% of the vote.  Awards and honors  In 1991, Elizabeth Rickey was nominated by the American Jewish Committee and won the Cavallo Foundation Award, which is given to people who go to great lengths to help and protect society at the risk of their own personal safety. In 2000, nine years before her death, Rickey was inducted into the Louisiana Center for Women in Government and Business Hall of Fame. The Bard Center for the Study of Hate has created an award named after Rickey, the Beth Rickey Award, which is awarded to an individual who takes extreme action against hate in the world.  Later years and death  After exposing David Duke, Rickey traveled the world and converted to Catholicism, after which she became more focused on religion. She was also diagnosed with Crohn's disease and on September 12, 2009 Rickey died in Santa Fe, New Mexico as a result of Crohn's disease and a virus she caught during a mission trip to Mexico.

This national insight subsequently becomes the perspective or vision of the nation towards its national goals and ideals. Wawasan nusantara is meant to be adopted as the Indonesian geopolitics, or the geographic effect of the archipelago on regional politics and international relations, regarded from Indonesian perspective that advocates for the national interest of the Indonesian Republic. The wawasan nusantara geopolitics stance often used by Indonesian government to argue for a national maritime integrity in some issues of territorial disputes with neighbouring countries. Since mid 1980s the concept of wawasan nusantara has been in included in Indonesian education curriculum and taught within geography education in highschool. The subject of wawasan nusantara also being taught in kewiraan or civic and citizenship education in universities to educate about citizenship, nationalism and Indonesian geopolitics stand points. In 2019, there is a call to taught geography as early as elementary school, a wawasan nusantara concept with emphasize on disaster mitigation, management and response processes as part of national resilience. It is in accordance to Indonesian geography and geologic fact as an archipelagic nation located right on top of the ring of fire, which is prone to natural disasters.  Etymology and definition  Monas Independence Hall, Jakarta. In Indonesian, wawasan means \\"vision\\", \\"insight\\" or \\"concept\\", while Nusantara generally refer to the Indonesian archipelago, Wawasan nusantara is the fundamental standpoint of Indonesian geopolitics. Literally, wawasan nusantara means the \\"archipelagic concept\\"; contextually this term is more accurately translated as \\"Indonesian archipelagic vision\\". Wawasan nusantara is a way for Indonesia to look at itself (geographically) as a unity of ideology, politics, economy, socio- cultural, security and defense aspects. Wawasan Nusantara is the archipelagic insight of Indonesian geopolitics. It is the perspective of the Indonesian people regarding themselves, their homeland, and the strategic values of their surroundings. It prioritize national unity and integrity, while still respecting every aspect of regional diversity to achieve national goals. The concept attempts to overcome Indonesia inherent geographic challenges—a state that comprises thousands of islands as well as thousands of socio-cultural backgrounds of its people. Vis-à-vis the state that eager and fighting for a national unification, the waters between the islands must be considered as the connectors rather than separators. Furthermore, wawasan nusantara is related to the ideological and constitutional basis, namely as a perspective and attitude of the Indonesian people regarding themselves and their geographical location, according to the national ideology Pancasila and the Constitution of 1945. In its implementation, wawasan nusantara prioritises regional unity while honouring its diversity to achieve social harmony, common prosperity, progress, and other national goals. Two Indonesian statesman are credited for the development this Indonesian geopolitics concept; they are Djuanda Kartawidjaja—credited for the 1957 Djuanda Declaration, and Mochtar Kusumaatmadja—former Indonesian foreign minister (1978-1988) that advocated for archipelagic insight to be accepted internationally.  Background  = History = ship on Borobudur bas relief, which argues for Indonesia's past as a regional maritime power. In Indonesian history, the native ancient kingdoms that rose to become a regional hegemon are usually a thalassocracy; such as Srivijaya (7th to 12th century) and Majapahit (14th to 15th century). This was much owed to the strategic location of Indonesian archipelago as the nexus of ancient global trade connecting two centers of Asian civilisations—ancient India and imperial China, involved actively in global spice trade, which was also the important part of ancient maritime silk road. During the Dutch East Indies period, the Ordonantie (Dutch Law) 1939, mentioned about the determination of the territorial sea which was along the 3 nautical miles width by drawing along a base line based on the tidal or island contour. This provision creates international waters in many parts of the sea between Indonesian islands (e.g. in the center of Java Sea and Banda Sea) which was outside the national jurisdiction. Indonesians shared a historical experiences of regional disunity, which must be avoided for the survival of the nation. This is because the national independence has been achieved through the spirit of unity among Indonesian people themselves. Thus, this spirit must be nurtured and maintained for national unity to preserve and protect territorial integrity of Indonesia. After the independence, Indonesia find itself as the custodian of world's main shipping lanes connecting Pacific Ocean with Indian Ocean, connecting East Asia with Middle East and Australia. Those main lanes are Malacca Strait, Karimata Strait, Sunda Strait, Makassar Strait, Lombok Strait and Ombai Strait. Sitting on the nexus of global maritime trade route has made Indonesian waters prone to be involved in global power struggle between global maritime powers. Thus, ensuring security of its territorial waters is a national priority. On 13 December 1957, Indonesian Government announced Djuanda Declaration regarding the territorial waters of the Republic of Indonesia. In this declaration, the sea boundaries is no longer based on tidal lines, but on a straight base line measured from the outline connecting the outermost points of the islands which are included within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. This erased international waters between Indonesian islands, thus increase the territorial waters. The determination of territorial waters are increased from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as an International Law regime, in which the 200-mile archipelagic boundaries are measured from the baseline of Indonesian territorial waters. With the Djuanda Declaration, thus legally and formally Indonesia became a whole undivided unity of lands and waters. = Socio-cultural = thumbrightA map in National Museum displaying ethnic distribution and diversity in Indonesia. Indonesia consists of hundreds of ethnic groups, each of which has different customs, languages, religions, and belief systems. Naturally, that national life related to inter-group interactions, contains the potential for conflicts over such differences in cultural diversity. = The territorial aspects of the archipelago = The geographic factor, its effects and influences, are the phenomenon that needs to be carefully examined, because Indonesia is rich in various natural resources as well as the diversity of its ethnic groups. = Pancasila philosophy = The golden Garuda Pancasila in Monas bearing the symbols of Pancasila, the national ideology of Indonesia. Pancasila values underlie the development of the wawasan nusantara concept. These values are: # Implementation of human rights, such as freedom of religion; providing opportunities to practice worship in accordance with their respective religions. # Prioritising the interests of the whole larger society rather than those of individuals or groups. # Decision making based on deliberation to reach consensus.  Purpose  Law of Sea Convention as described in Djuanda declaration # Wawasan nusantara as a concept of national resilience; namely as a concept in national development, security, defense and territorial aspects. # Wawasan nusantara as a development perspective; it has the scope of political unity, economic unity, socio-economic unity, socio-political unity, also defense and security unity. # Wawasan nusantara as a vision of national defense and security; as a geopolitical view of Indonesia within the scope of its homeland as a unity that encompasses all of its territory and which protected with all of the might the nation. # Wawasan nusantara as territorial vision; which clearly defines Indonesia's national boundaries, to avoid disputes with neighboring countries. Boundaries and challenges of Indonesia are: * Treatise of the BPUPKI session on May 29-June 1, 1945 discussed about the territory of the future Republic of Indonesia and mentioned several opinions of founding fathers. Dr. Soepomo said Indonesia included the boundary of the former Dutch East Indies. Moh. Yamin said that Indonesia includes Sumatra, Java, Lesser Sunda Islands, Borneo, Celebes, Maluku, Malay Peninsula, Timor, and West New Guinea. Sukarno stated that the Indonesian archipelago is an inseparable unit. * Ordonantie (Dutch Law) 1939, mentioned about the determination of the territorial sea which was along the 3 nautical miles width by drawing along a base line based on the tidal or island/land contour. This provision makes Indonesia not a unitary state, because in many parts of the sea between Indonesian islands (e.g. Java Sea and Banda Sea) there are some international waters that was outside the national jurisdiction. * Djuanda Declaration, 13 December 1957 constitutes the announcement of the Indonesian government regarding the territorial waters of the Republic of Indonesia, which states: # The way to withdraw sea boundaries is no longer based on tidal lines (low water line), but on a straight base line measured from the outline connecting the outermost points of the islands which are included within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. # Determination of territorial waters are increased from 3 nautical miles to 12 nautical miles. # Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as an International Law regime, in which the 200-mile archipelagic boundaries are measured from the baseline of Indonesian territorial waters. With the Djuanda Declaration, thus legally and formally Indonesia became a whole and not divided again.  Objective  The purpose of wawasan nusantara consists of two objectives, they are: # The national goal, which was written in the Preamble to the 1945 Constitution, explains that the goals of Indonesian independence which are \\"to protect the whole of the Indonesian people and to create common public welfare, improve national education, and to participate to carrying out world order based on the liberty, eternal peace, and social justice\\". # The inward purpose of is to ensure the unity of all aspects of life both natural and social. It can be concluded that the goal of the Indonesian people is to uphold national interests, as well as regional interests, also to enforce and foster common prosperity, peace, and uphold human dignity throughout the world.  Implementation  = Political aspect = There are several things that need to be considered in implementing the wawasan nusantara: # The implementation of political life is regulated in laws, such as the Political Party Law, the Election Law, and the Presidential Election Law. The implementation of this law must be in accordance with the law and prioritize national unity. For example, in the presidential election, members of the DPR and regional heads must implement democratic principles and justice, so as not to destroy national unity. # The implementation of community and state life in Indonesia must be in accordance with applicable law. All Indonesians must have the same legal basis for every citizen, without exception. In Indonesia there are many legal products that can be issued by provinces and districts in the form of regional regulations (perda) that do not conflict with applicable national laws. # Developing human rights attitudes and pluralism attitudes to unite different ethnicities, religions, and languages, so as to foster an attitude of tolerance. # Strengthen political commitment to political parties and government institutions to enhance the spirit of nationalism, unity and unity. # Increasing the role of Indonesia in the international arena and strengthening the diplomatic corps as an effort to safeguard Indonesia's territory, especially the outer islands and uninhabited islands. = Economic aspect = A pinisi tall masted sailing schooner, traditionally connects ports within Indonesian archipelago. # The archipelago has a high economic potential, such as the position of the equator, a vast sea area, large tropical forests, large mining and oil products, and has a population in sufficient numbers. Therefore, implementation in economic life must be oriented to the government, agriculture and industry sectors. # Economic development must pay attention to fairness and balance between regions. Therefore, the existence of regional autonomy can create efforts in economic justice. # Economic development must involve people's participation, such as by providing micro credit facilities in the development of small businesses. = Socio-cultural aspect = Preserving cultural diversity to strengthen national identity as well as become a tourism attraction, such as the kecak dance in Bali. Some things to consider in social and cultural life, namely: # Developing a harmonious national life between different communities; in terms of culture, social status, and region. For example, with equal distribution of education in all regions and compulsory education programs which must prioritising disadvantaged regions. # Development of Indonesian culture, to preserve and nurture the cultural diversity of Indonesia, that can be employed as a tourism attraction that provide the economic value for the region. For example, with cultural preservation, museum and cultural sites development. = Defense and security aspect = TNI armed force is an implementation in the defense and security aspect. Some things to consider in the defense and security aspect, namely: # Defense and security development activities must provide an opportunity for every citizen to participate. Such activities such as maintaining a residential order, improving social discipline, reporting security matters to the authorities are the citizen's obligations. # Building a sense of national unity, so that the threat of an area or island is perceived as a threat to the whole nation. This sense of national unity can be created by building solidarity and close relations between citizens of different regions. # Building a professional TNI armed force and providing adequate facilities and infrastructure for security activities in the territory of Indonesia, especially the outer islands and border regions of Indonesia.

Gold Hunting in Alaska, by Joseph Grinnell and Elizabeth Grinnell  Career  In 1904, Elizabeth Grinnell was a founding member of the Pasadena Audubon Society. Philanthropist Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage was a frequent visitor to Grinnell's home and a benefactor of the society's work. Grinnell provided photographs of birds to Vernon Lyman Kellogg for his textbook Elementary Zoology (1901). She also owned and bred goats, and raised chickens. She protested city regulations limiting the possession of chickens and cows. \\"Cows sometimes moo and good laying hens do cackle. Trolleys make a noise and so do wagons rattling over pavements,\\" she argued. Grinnell was a popular speaker on \\"birds and bees\\", and wrote at least seven books, some of them in collaboration with her elder son, Joseph Grinnell, a zoologist and museum director. Their books together were Our Feathered Friends (1898), Birds of Song and Story (1901), Gold Hunting in Alaska (1901), and Stories of Our Western Birds (1903). Other books by Grinnell were How John and I Brought Up the Child (1894), John and I and the Church (1897), For the Sake of a Name (1900), A Morning with the Bees (1905), and Thoughts for the Kit-Bag (1918). She also wrote articles and stories for Sunset magazine. Grinnell was active in the Humane Society of Pasadena.

G. murorum is a type of saprophyte. One of the techniques that is used to isolate this fungus is through dilution plate. History and taxonomy In the past, there have been some confusions regarding which genus G. murorum should be part of. Over the years, Names of G. murorum have changed numerous times. In 1905, in order to accommodate species, Torula chartarum Corda, Gueguen erected form-genus Gliomastix. At first, G. chartarum and T. chartarum, a same fungus as T. convoluta, were thought to be two different fungi. However, Mason concluded G. chartarum is synonymous to G. convoluta, which is the same fungus as the T. convoluta. and Hughes and Dickinson eventually listed all of them as a species called G. murorum and listed them to be synonymous to one another. The proposal stating Gliomastix is the same genus as Acremonium was not accepted. Also, placing G. murorum into form-genus Sagrahamala was not accepted. Growth and morphology At first, colonies of G. murorum are white/pale pink and as conidia matures, colonies start to become black. Conidia can grow to the size of 2.5-5.5μm X 2-4.5μm. and, due to granules, is rough. Conidia grow in chains from phialides and mycelial rope is where phialides arise. Although the base of phialides, which is about 2-3 μm thick, is smooth, the apex part, which is about 1μ thick, of the phialides is roughened with granules. At the apex site, there is collaratte. Overall, the length of phialides of G. murorum are about 20-30μ long. G. murorum is known to grow slowly. Physiology G. murorum does not favour one type of soil over another, and is capable of living almost anywhere. However, the fungus prefers soil with the fertilizer in the following order, NPK, PK, and NK, NPK being the most preferred and NK being the least preferred fertilizer. It grows best in water potential of 2.3 bar but it was able to survive even when it went over 9 bars. Its cellulase activity works best at pH 9 and at temperature of 29°C, it loses its activity starting at 35°C. G. murorum is tolerant of up to 10% of CO2. Although it can grow well when there is only N2, it is not tolerant of CS2 treatment. It has been reported Jason, in 1967 that G. convolute (=G. murorum) is chitinolytic. It also has been found that since fungi in genus Gliomastix, including G. murorum, has cellulase activity, they can result in deterioration of manufactured materials, such as paper and sacking. Habitat and ecology G. murorum does not grow on acid peats. Other than acid peats, there seems to be no particular place where G. murorum prefers to grow. The fungus is found in all different types of soil. It is commonly found on decaying plants and throughout the world, including both temperate zone and tropical zones. It is relatively common compared to other fungi species that are part of form-genus Gliomastix. other form-genus Gliomasix are typically spotted in tropical regions. While G. muroum is found commonly in countries, like New Zealand and Europe, it is found less in North America. It also could be isolated from places, like wood and textiles. Commercial use Research conducted on G. murorum showed that two metabolites, ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol and 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-α,α-dimethyl-2-benzofuranmethanol, that were extracted from G. murorum have antimicrobial activity. Another research showed that volatile oils from G. murorum also have antimicrobial activity The two experiments conducted on G. murorum suggest that metabolites and volatile oil that are extracted from G. murorum could possibly be utilized as a antimicrobial agent. Alpha-mannosidase, which could be extracted from G. murorum, is known for its high enzymatic activity and it is commonly used in industries because using this glycosidase is the cheapest way to make oligosaccharides Despite alpha-mannosidase being widely used in industries, like food and drug industries, there has been no specific research on the toxicity of alpha mannosidase. Crude enzyme extracted showed negative effects on some organ systems of the Swiss Albino mice.

The artist wearing one of her masksThe Damselfrau mask «Virpir» Magnhild Kennedy (born 1978 in Trondheim, Norway), better known professionally as Damselfrau, is a London-based Norwegian artist. She creates wearable art, mostly masks and jewellery. Her masks are presented on her own Instagram account and on several other websites; in magazines and exhibitions – and they are used by internationally known singers and other artists in their videos or on stage, as parts of their own projects.  Background and education  Kennedy grew up in Trondheim. Both her parents are artists. Her mother, Heidi Kennedy Skjerve, makes experimental textile art, while her father, Stein Rønning, is a sculptor. Kennedy herself is self-taught as an artist. According to herself, she has never studied anything relevant to design or to mask making. She considers growing up in a home where both parents were artists, her schooling. She has no formal training in crafts or textile work, those skills she has developed over the years, learning through looking at clothes and crafts, trial and error, and watching YouTube tutorials.  Career  Lisa C.B. Lie in her own play Skogsunderholdning, wearing a Damselfrau mask Self portrait with mask When she and her husband Robert Kennedy moved to London in 2007, she made masks only for herself and her husband, as parts of outfits to be used in parties, but from 2009 on she works as a professional mask maker under the name Damselfrau. Damselfrau consists of the English word «Damsel» (unmarried woman) and the German word «Frau» (woman). Kennedy interprets this inherently paradoxical pseudonym as «married to oneself». A journalist called it «a fitting mantle for an artist who has become renowned for her masks; a craft that involves placing another ‘self’ on top of your own, creating both a combination of the two and suggesting something entirely new altogether». Kennedy's first commission was for the Norwegian singer Anneli Drecker and the band Røyksopp for one of their tours. Since then she has made masks for artists like MØ, Beyoncé and Daphne Guinness, and collaborated with Louis Vuitton. = Materials, inspiration, technique = All Damselfrau masks are made, mostly sewn, by hand. Kennedy uses all kinds of materials she can find, literary. The materials range from pearls, old tea towels and gold confetti to plastic trinkets and old laces. She never sketches or decides the design of a mask on beforehand. The materials she combines decide the design and expression of each mask, which she sculpts on mannequin heads. The process sometimes takes a day or a week. At other times the mannequin head sits on a shelf wearing a half finished mask for a year, until the right material «surfaces» in her studio. Kennedy's masks transgress the borders between art, fashion and costume design. She is not particularly interested in masks as a category. What interests her, is to work with all sorts of materials, preferably materials with a history, and organize them in a small area, «so that in the end, they communicate something. I’m really more interested in decorating a space than a body or a face».  Exhibitions and presentations  While Instagram has been the main platform for presenting her art, her masks are also shown on art and fashion websites and magazines, like Vanity Fair, Another Man and Vogue. The masks are also frequently shown in solo and group exhibitions. = Selected solo exhibitions = * 2011 – Damselfrau, Doors Showcase, London. * 2015 – Damselfrau ll, Idios.

In 2019 she was also chosen as one of the «Top 100 wearable art designers on Instagram» by the Beautiful Bizarre Magazine.

Lockhart was born at Kirkcaldy in October 1835. He later moved to Liverpool where he was a merchant. He began his evangelical baptism in Liverpool at Hope Hall, which he rented on a weekly basis. Lockhart was regarded as one of the finest wicket-keepers of the North of England, he played his club cricket for Liverpool Cricket Club in the 1850s. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the North in the North v South fixture of 1857 at Nottingham. He made two first-class appearances in 1858 for the Gentlemen of the North against the Gentlemen of the South, before appearing twice for the Gentlemen of the North versus the Gentlemen of the South in 1859, in addition to playing for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. His final first-class appearance came for Another England Eleven against the England Eleven to North America in 1859 at Manchester. In seven first-class matches, he scored 65 runs and behind the stumps he took 8 catches and made 8 stumpings. Long after his first-class cricket career had finished, Lockhart was still a merchant preacher in Liverpool. Having outgrown Hope Hall, he moved to Hengler's Circus, where he welcomed the American evangelist Dwight L. Moody in 1867. Lockhart raised £7,000 in 1870 for the construction of Toxteth Baptist Tabernacle, opened by Charles Spurgeon in 1871. His mission was to convert the urban poor, but a critic of Lockhart's noted that his congregations mostly composed 'smug shopkeepers'. However, by 1886 his sermons were attracting roughly 1,500 people. He returned to Scotland in the 1890s, where he died in August 1893 at Ballater, Aberdeenshire.

The game comes with two physical components: the Ring-Con, a Pilates ring that the user holds and one Joy-Con slots into, and a Leg Strap, a piece of fabric affixed to the user's leg that holds the other Joy-Con. The game's main mode has the player complete a turn-based role-playing game, where player movements and battle actions are based on performing certain physical activities using the Ring-Con and Leg Strap, with the motion controls within the Joy-Con sensing the player's movement, and a strain sensor in the Ring-Con detecting bending of that accessory. Other modes include general guided fitness routines and party-style games. These activities are centered around common fitness exercises, making the game part of Nintendo's \\"quality of life\\" goals in line with a similar game of theirs, Wii Fit. The game was released worldwide on October 18, 2019 and received generally positive reviews from critics. As of August 2020, the game has sold over copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling games on the system. Demand for the game increased drastically during 2020, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related closures of gyms and other exercise facilities, causing shortages in many countries. This led to resellers selling the game for over $300, up from its retail price of $80. Gameplay Combat in Ring Fit Adventure has the player complete an exercise move (shown on left) to defeat enemies in game. Ring Fit Adventure ships with the Ring-Con and Leg Strap, which have docks to hold the Switch's Joy-Con. These accessories are required to play the game, as the player's interactions with them are tracked by the motion controls built into the Joy-Con. The game's main mode is a role- playing game, in which the player takes the role of a young athlete that meets a sentient Ring, and they team up to take down an evil, bodybuilding dragon named Dragaux. The player moves their character across the game's overworld and into various dungeons, where they encounter monsters to fight. Moving across the game world is similar to a rail shooter; the player moves along a fixed path by running in place, jumps over obstacles by squeezing and releasing the Ring-Con, and can fire projectiles at items by squeezing in the Ring-Con in the target direction. When the player encounters monsters, the game uses turn-based combat as in many role-playing games. The player attacks the enemies by performing one of about thirty different exercises, with the amount of damage they deal based on how effectively they completed the exercise. When the monsters attack, the player can defend by pressing and holding the Ring-Con into their abdomen for as long as possible during the attack. Defeating monsters earns the player-character experience points, and as they level up, they can unlock additional exercises with more potent damage. Exercises are classified by color, each color corresponding to a general part of the body the exercise is geared towards: red for arms, blue for legs, yellow for core muscles and green for yoga positions. Monsters are also marked by colors, and exercises of the same color are more effective against them, but only after that specific ability is unlocked early in the game. In addition to the adventure mode, the game includes a general fitness routine mode that allows one to perform the exercises, assisted by the game, but without the gamification elements. The game also has several mini-games based on certain exercises, which can be used by a single player to challenge themselves or can be used with multiple players each taking a turn to beat the others. An update in late March 2020 also added a \\"Rhythm Mode\\", which allows the user to move along to soundtrack from the game. This mode also includes some music from other Nintendo games such as Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 2, and Wii Fit. The game includes the option to enable only quiet exercises to avoid disturbing others nearby. For example, in quiet mode, the running-in-place in the adventure mode is replaced by performing squats. Development The game was first teased in early September 2019 with a video showing people using the Ring-Con and Leg Strap without showing the game, with a full announcement of the game a week later. Several journalists observed that the game fits into Nintendo's long-running \\"quality of life\\" program, to introduce more physical activity into the playing of video games, that had been started by Satoru Iwata with the introduction of the Wii console, particularly in the game Wii Fit. Parts of the design of the Nintendo Switch had been from player feedback from Wii Fit looking to make the controllers smaller so they could be strapped to the body and used in more possible ways. Ring Fit Adventure was released in North America on October 18, 2019. The game, shipping with the Ring-Con and Leg Strap, cost slightly more than a typical game. On March 26, 2020 a free update was released, adding a rhythm game mode.  Reception  Ring Fit Adventure received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic, with a score of 83/100. Many critics agree that while Ring Fit Adventure is not designed for strength training, it is effective exercise for maintaining fitness. The RPG elements of the game are very simplistic; which allows casual videogame-players to play the game with ease, but which can be disappointing for fans of RPGs who want more of a strategic challenge. = Sales = Ring Fit Adventure debuted at #3 in the UK, and #1 in Japan and South Korea.https://gematsu.com/2019/10/famitsu-sales-10-14-19-10-20-19 In Japan, it sold 68,497 copies within its first week on sale, which placed it at number one on the all format sales chart.

Early life Kinnicutt was born on January 23, 1877 in New York City. He was the eldest of two sons born to Susanna Eleonora (née Kissel) Kinnicutt (1852–1910) and Dr. Francis Parker Kinnicutt (1846–1913), who served for many years as trustee and president of Columbia- Presbyterian Medical Center. Dr. Kinnicutt was also a close friend of novelist Edith Wharton, and owned a \\"rambling Colonial Revival house on Cliffwood Street overlooking the golf course,\\" known as Deepdene (designed by Bruce Price) in Lenox, Massachusetts. Among his siblings was brother Francis Harrison Kinnicutt, a Harvard Law School graduate who married Margaret Chanler Emmet (daughter of C. Temple Emmet, granddaughter of John Winthrop Chanler, and descendant of John Jacob Astor). He was named after his maternal grandfather, Gustav Hermann Kissel, a Hesse born banker, and the husband of Charlotte Anna (née Stimson) Kissel. His paternal grandparents were Francis Harrison Kinnicutt (a descendant of Roger Kinnicutt who emigrated to America ) and Elizabeth Waldo (née Parker) Kinnicutt (herself a niece of Governor of Massachusetts Levi Lincoln Jr. and granddaughter of Levi Lincoln Sr., the 4th U.S. Attorney General). Kinnicutt graduated from Harvard University in 1896. Career Following his graduation from Harvard, Kinnicutt began his banking career in 1900 with J.P. Morgan & Co. Later, his father accompanied J. Pierpont Morgan on an excursion up the Nile in January 1912. In 1904, he organized his own firm, known as Kinnicutt & Potter, which continued through various name changes (including Kissel, Kinnicutt & Co. with his uncle, Gustav Kissel). In 1922, Kissel, Kinnicutt & Co. offered $3,000,000 in farm loan bonds for Chicago Joint Stock Land Bank. In December 1931, it was announced that Kissel, Kinnicutt & Co. would merge with Kidder, Peabody & Co., at which point, Kinnicutt joined the new firm as a general partner on January 1, 1932. At the time of his death, he was a senior partner with Kidder, Peabody which was located at 17 Wall Street. In 1934, Kinnicutt appeared in Washington before the House Interstate Commerce Committee as a representative of eighteen investment firms from New York to \\"protest what was termed the paralyzing legislation of the Fletcher-Rayburn stock exchange bill.\\" He also joined with other prominent investment bankers to demand Federal supervision over regulation of stock markets. During World War I, Kinnicutt was chairman of the Liberty Loan Committee in New Jersey. Like his father, she served as a trustee of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, and also as president of the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing. Personal life On April 18, 1907, Kinnicutt was married to May Appleton Tuckerman (1886–1947) at the Church of the Incantation at Madison Avenue and 35th Street. She was the daughter of Bayard Tuckerman and Annie Cotton (née Smith) Tuckerman, and sister of Bayard Tuckerman Jr. Together, the Kinnicutts had homes in Manhattan, Maine, Paris, and a large summer home in Far Hills, New Jersey known as Mayfields. He collected antiques, including furniture later described by his interior designer daughter as \\"that awful English brown.\\" May and Hermann were the parents of four children, three of whom lived to adulthood: * Francis Parker Kinnicutt (1908–1961), who married Sybil Kane Jay (1914–1997), daughter of Delancey Kane Jay (and niece of Peter Augustus Jay), on Valentine's Day, 1937. * Dorothy May Kinnicutt (1910–1994), who married banker Henry Parish II, son of Edward Codman Parish, on Valentine's Day, 1930. * Gustav Hermann Kinnicutt Jr. (1912–1984), who married Iréne (née Schultze) Solmsen, the former wife of Rudolph Solmsen, in 1948. * Bayard Tuckerman Kinnicutt (1920–1934), who died aged 17 while playing baseball at St. Mark's School in Southboro, Massachusetts. Kinnicutt died of a heart ailment on December 6, 1943 at 65 East 82nd Street, his home in Manhattan. After a funeral at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension on Fifth Avenue attended by more than 400 mourners, he was buried at Saint Bernards Cemetery in Bernardsville, New Jersey.

Commissioned too late to see service during the conflict, she was initially used to conduct fishery surveys that were later used as the basis for the German Fisheries Act in 1874. Pommerania went to the Mediterranean Sea in 1876 in response to the murder of a German diplomat and remained in the region to observe the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. After returning to Germany in 1879, she spent much of the 1880s either operating as a fishery protection vessel or conducting surveys of the German coastline. Decommissioned in 1889, she was struck from the naval register in 1890, sold in 1892, and was converted into a sailing schooner. She was renamed Adler, but was lost with all hands on her first voyage as a merchant ship in January 1894. Design The early history of Pommerania is poorly recorded, as few official records concerning her construction have survived. The ship was originally built for the packet service between Stettin and Stockholm; her design was prepared by the Prussian Navy's chief designer, Carl Elbertzhagen, in 1863. The navy also assumed the cost of construction; the naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Röhr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz state that the fact that the Prussian Navy bore the cost of construction and designed the ship suggests that the naval command wanted to have access to a steamship that it could use as needed. She was requisitioned during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 as what was by then the North German Federal Navy sought to acquire ships with which it could defend the North German Confederation's coast in the North and Baltic Seas. Pommerania was among four merchant ships purchased by the navy, along with the paddle steamer and the HAPAG passenger liners Cuxhaven and Helgoland. =Characteristics= Pommerania was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of over her hull and over the boxes for her paddle wheels. Her draft was . As designed, she displaced and at full load, this increased to . Her iron hull was constructed with transverse frames; the number of watertight compartments has not survived. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. The ship was a good sea boat and was very maneuverable, but she handled poorly in severe weather. She was difficult to control and lost considerable speed in a head sea, and she tended to ship large quantities of water forward. To supplement her steam engine, she carried a schooner rig, but it contributed little to her performance. These problems were typical of paddle steamers. The ship had a crew of four officers and sixty-one enlisted men. She carried four smaller boats of unrecorded type. Pommeranias propulsion system consisted of one vertical, oscillating 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a pair of paddle wheels located amidships. The wheels were in diameter, with ten paddles each. Steam for the engine was provided by two coal-fired trunk boilers. The engine and boilers were placed in a combined engine/boiler room, and the boilers were each ducted into their own funnel. The system was rated at 300 nominal horsepower. In service, she was capable of and a top speed of . She could carry up to of coal, which allowed a cruising radius of at a speed of . The ship was armed with a pair of 23-caliber (cal.) breechloading hoop guns that were supplied with 120 shells. Later in her career, these were replaced with a pair of 24-cal. hoop guns. She also received four Hotchkiss revolver cannon in 1880. Service history Pommerania was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1864. She was launched in September that year and entered service on 1 May 1865 with the North German postal service, operating on the Stettin–Stockholm route for the next five years. During this period, she ran aground off Hiddensee in early September 1868 and had to be pulled free. By the late 1860s, the aviso was worn out and in need of a lengthy reconstruction; on 2 July 1870, the naval command instructed Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette captain) Franz von Waldersee to examine Pommerania to determine if she could be a suitable replacement while Loreley was out of service. Waldersee's trials were underway when war with France broke out on 19 July, and the North German Federal Navy requisitioned the vessel on 20 August at no cost. Crew shortages and a lack of equipment during the conflict delayed conversion of the vessel into a warship until 27 April 1871, by which time the war had ended in German victory and creation of the German Empire. The German Fisheries Association requested a commission to conduct research in the North and Baltic Seas and the navy—now the Imperial Navy—provided Pommerania for the work. She left Kiel in mid-June 1871 for the first research trip, which took the ship into the Skagerrak, to Stockholm, and then to the coast of Courland. From there, she proceeded to Friedrichsort in the Kieler Förde, where the survey work ended owing to an outbreak of cholera among the crew, forcing Pommerania to go into quarantine. In the course of the voyage, the ship had traveled . The ship was recommissioned on 11 July 1872 for another fishing survey expedition that began ten days later. After departing Kiel, she steamed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak to Bergen, Norway. She then steamed south across the Dogger Bank to Den Helder in the Netherlands, followed by a stop in British Helgoland. From there, she proceeded to Wilhelmshaven and then back through the Skagerrak and Kattegat to Kiel, arriving there on 10 September, having traveled . She was decommissioned there on 21 September. The two expeditions provided the basis for the Fisheries Act of 1874. Pommerania was recommissioned in 1873 to conduct surveys of the Mecklenburg coast, but she had to return to port for repairs in May after suffering machinery problems. Sketch of the German fleet conducting maneuvers Pommerania remained out of service until 1 May 1876, when she was recommissioned to join the ironclad training squadron. The ships were sent to Salonika in the Ottoman Empire in response to the murder of the German consul there. On the way there, Pommerania stopped in Algiers on 12 June, which was one of the first times a German warship had stopped in a French port following the Franco-Prussian War. The German ships were joined by French, Russian, Italian, and Austro-Hungarian warships in an international demonstration condemning the murder. Most of the German vessels left in August, but Pommerania and the ironclad remained in the eastern Mediterranean, first off the Levant and then stopping in Smyrna. On 15 November, Pommerania went to the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, where she served as the second station ship along with Loreley. She remained there until early March 1877, when she returned to Smyrna. On 16 May, Pommerania steamed back to Constantinople in response to the start of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. She stayed in Constantinople until 12 June 1879, when she began the voyage back to Germany, arriving in Wilhelmshaven and being decommissioned there on 9 August. The ship was recommissioned on 25 August 1881 to serve as a tender for the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station); she served in this capacity for the next three years without incident and was decommissioned again on 24 April 1884. During this period, Kapitänleutnant (Lieutenant Captain) Karl Ascher served as the ship's commander from April to May 1884. From 25 March to 30 September 1885, she served as a fishery protection vessel in the North Sea. She repeatedly intervened to stop British fishing vessels from illegally operating in German territorial waters off the East Frisian Islands. In late August, these duties were interrupted so Pommerania could participate in the annual fleet training exercises. She served as a survey vessel from 8 April to 12 October 1886, operating along Germany's North and Baltic Sea coasts. She conducted further surveying work in the Baltic beginning on 13 April 1887, and in June, she went to Kiel to participate in the ceremonial start of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The canal's namesake, Wilhelm I, came aboard Pommerania to observe a naval review; this was the last time he visited the fleet. Pommerania was decommissioned in Kiel on 15 October, returning to service again in 1888 and 1889 for more survey work. She was decommissioned for the last time on 16 October 1889 and was struck from the naval register on 10 August 1890. She was sold in 1892 to a Hamburg-based company and converted into a three-masted sailing schooner. Renamed Adler, the ship was operated by the firm Paulsen & Ivers, based in Kiel. On her first voyage, she sank in a storm on 20 January 1894 with the loss of her entire crew.

In January 1988 they opened an additional center in East Los Angeles.“The 1980s.” Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History in America, Thomson Gale, 2004. Connexxus was “an educational and charitable corporation for women, with most programs and services designed to meet the needs of a severely undeserved population: lesbians.”Connexxus/Centro de Mujeres Collection The organization served as to access information and referrals to various human service agencies, gain business counseling about developing and operating your own business, and be sponsors and hosts to cultural and educational activities by the community. __TOC__ History In May 1984 a diverse group of women, from business women, to writers, scholars, artists, and activist met to establish next steps to make Connexxus happen. They first needed to identify the needs of the community to create relevant services. To tackle this process they surveyed Los Angeles and its human service agencies, plus, hosted general meetings with local women and lesbians by distributing questionnaires to gather data. Through their findings they identified three major concerns: lesbians were undeserved by human service agencies, the quality of services offered needed improvement, and no facility existed to support the lesbian community. With this knowledge in mind, the women started planning and bringing Connexxus to fruition. Connexxus ran for 6 years from May 1984 through June 1990. Throughout their run the organization was led by notable lesbian members in the community, Lauren Jardine, Del Martinez, Judy Doyle, Jean Cordova, Jane Wagner, Bunny MacCulloch, Yolanda Retter, and June Mezer.Cordova, Jean. When we were Outlaws. Tallahassee, Spinster Ink, 2011.“Cordova, Jeanne.” Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History in America, Thomson Gale, 2004.Judy Doyle Southern California Women for Understanding (SCWU) collection, 1975-1999 includes the Judy Doyle Papers which are housed at the UCLA Library Special Collections To sustain the organization the board was able to raise over $20,000 for its operations. They received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council, Colling Higgins Foundation, and the Liberty Hill Foundation. Additionally, they hosted numerous fundraisers such as their annual Casino Cabaret, Founding Celebration, and the New Year's Eve Gala. Smaller events included, Fun-Raising Party & Auction, Day at the Races in Santa Anita at the Oak Tree Racing Association, and the Dinah Shore Picnic in Palm Springs. Despite the successful run of this organization until 1990, in 1991 Connexxus Women's Center/ Centro de Mujeres was officially dissolved. In a letter to the community, on January 18, 1990, they shared that as Connexxus expand and their work surpassed their intended goals, more human service organizations followed their lead and expanded their services. Due to the increasing number of specialized groups, services, and business less lesbians accessed the center's services. Due to these fall in numbers and an imminent financial crisis, Connexxus decided to close its doors on June 30, 1990. Work =Economic Empowerment= Before U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an Executive Order in May 1998, discrimination based on sexual orientation was not part of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA).“Antidiscrimination Law and Policy.” Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History in America, Thomson Gale, 2004. Due to blatant discrimination towards the Lesbian community and women of color in the workforce, Connexxus created an economic empowerment component to their services from 1985–1986. For them, it was crucial to outreach and bring in underemployed and unemployed women, particularly “displaced homemakers, youth, parolees from prison, welfare recipients, and re-entry women.” They hosted workshops about dealing with: discrimination in the workforce and during job hunting. Developing new employable skills, how to write application and resumes, creating and sustaining your own business, and career exploration. The majority of these services were free or low-cost to participants. =Mental Health Services= Connexxus offered two different types of mental health services, direct one- one-one therapy and facilitator run support groups. The organization also served as a training facility for counselors and therapists still earning their hours. Connexxus built a community based therapeutic approached to their healing services. This model was beneficial for both the clients and therapists because services were affordable, if not free, and the latter gained specialized training opportunities. Facilitators were expected to be neutral parties in the group and were simply there to navigate, instigate, and guide the conversation between attendees. Each facilitator received training rooted in lesbian and women of color theories such as the work of Audre Lorde and Cherrie Moraga. Much like the one-on-on therapy, the support groups' topics were planned based on the needs of the participants. =June Mazer Collection= June Mazer and her lover Bunny MacCulloch started the June L. Mazer Collection at Connexxus, a “Lesbian Herstory Collection” of Lesbian people, events, organizations, and spaces from the Bay Area and Los Angeles, California.Bunny MacCulloch PapersJune Mazer Instagram The collection, previously called the West Coast Lesbian collection, contains archives about important Lesbian women in the 1980s and 1990s, records of organizations like the Daughters of Bilitis, and even the Lesbian Love Records (a radio show targeted towards this community). After Connexxus disbanded the collection traveled to various repositories and finally found a permanent home at 626 N. Robertson Blvd. in West Hollywood, in a building owned by the city. Through an equitable partnership with UCLA Library Special Collections the Mazer retained rights over their materials but increased access to community members through digitization. =Latina Lesbian Mental Health Conference= On Saturday November 8, 1986 Connexxus in collaboration with El Centro Human Services Corporation and Latinas Unidas coordinated the “Latina Lesbian Mental Health Conference: Issues, Research, and Implications for Practices.” The conference covered topics about parents of lesbians, children of lesbian, and parenting lesbians, as well as identity developing, coming out, and lastly, clinical experiences and best practices for therapists. The conference intended to give service providers the unique experiences of the Latina Lesbian population to make their services more accessible and effective. =Community Events= Because the center was intended to be a community space, on top of the social based fundraisers, Connexxus hosted a variety of events. They hosted economic empowerment workshops to support the women's skill development. Social groups based on identities, such as Black Lesbians, singles, Latinas, mixers were common. The most popular one was All Around Town in 1988, which doubled as a fundraiser, where women would meet across the greater Los Angeles Area and share meals, partake in activities such horse races, and enjoy local festivals. Another popular event was a gallery show of long time support Laura Aguilar, a Chicana Lesbian photographer, called the Chicana Lesbians Series.Zepeda, Susy (2012-01-01). \\"Tracing Queer Latina Diasporas: Escarvando Historical Narratives Of Ancestries And Silences\\" (PDF).

It is Vorarlberg's oldest brewery. With a total market share of 47.2 percent in the gastronomy and retail sectors, in 2013, the Mohrenbrauerei was the market leader among the four Vorarlberg breweries.  History  The origin of the current Mohrenbrauerei is the inn \\"Zum Mohren\\", licensed to the owner of the inn and brewery Josef Mohr. The oldest found documentation on the new name \\"Mohrenwirt\\" dates back to 1784. In 1834, the catering and brewery business was transferred to the Huber family. Franz Anton Huber, trader and locksmith in Dornbirn-Markt, bought the inn including the estate and associated brewery in 1834 from a farmer from Hohenems. The brewery has been family-owned since that day. At the turn of the century, an amount 30,000 hl of beer per year has been produced under the East Silesian master brewer Anton Decker. The end of World War II and declining demand had to stop production eventually. The brewery was temporarily converted into barracks and hosted Moroccan soldiers. The Mohrenbrauerei only recovered from this around 1951. In 2012, the beverage production amounted to 222,911 hl per year.  Name and logo  The name and logo of the Mohrenbrauerei are controversial. Nowadays, the German word Mohr (\\"Moor\\") is an antiquated and pejorative term for African people. Furthermore, the logo depicts the head of an African with bulging lips and curly hair. In 1834, today's co-owner, the Huber family, took over the Mohr from the family crest of the original brewery founder Josef Mohr, who had the literal depiction of his last name, namely an African, incorporated into the logo. The Mohrenbräu brewery argues that it has been using the logo for almost 200 years. The brewery further states that the crest is based on early depictions of Saint Maurice. Due to the rising awareness of racism in 2020 (see Black Lives Matter), the discussion about the Mohrenbräu's logo has been reignited. More than 6,000 people signed a petition to keep the depiction of the African as part of the logo, Mohrenbräu's arguments for keeping the logo being tradition as well as the lack of racist intention.  Mohren Biererlebniswelt  The Mohren Biererlebniswelt is a museum about the history of the Mohrenbrauerei and the art of brewing in general. It was opened on 22 October 2016. The museum is located at the headquarters of the Mohrenbrauerei in Dornbirn. There are about 10,000 exhibits on display, from small as beer coasters to a replica of the facade of the former inn \\"Zum Mohren\\" or a brewery from the 19th century.

Life Qays was the son of a certain al-Haytham ibn Asma ibn al-Salt of the Banu Sulaym tribe of the Hejaz (western Arabia). He was directly appointed by Caliph Uthman () over the Nishapur district of Khurasan in 649/50. Before his assassination in 656, Uthman expanded Qays' governorship to the entire province of Khurasan. Qays appointed his paternal cousin, Abd Allah ibn Khazim al-Sulami, as his deputy governor and left the province for Basra to assess the political situation in the wake of Uthman's death; however, Ibn Khazim, using a diploma he previously obtained from the governor of Basra, Abd Allah ibn Amir, declared himself governor and remained in the post until his dismissal by Caliph Ali (). Qays was angered by his cousin's ruse and reportedly stated: \\"I had a better right than Abd Allah to be the son of [Abd Allah's mother] Ajla.\\" When Mu'awiya I acceded to the caliphate in 661, Qays was reappointed governor of Khurasan by the order of Ibn Amir or the caliph himself. He remained in the post for two years. He was again replaced by his cousin Abd Allah after failing to quell a revolt at Qarin and briefly imprisoned in Basra until his mother intervened on his behalf. He was later made the deputy governor of Basra by Ibn Amir when the latter visited Mu'awiya's court in Syria in 664. After Ziyad ibn Abihi was appointed governor of Basra in 665, he appointed Qays as governor of Marw al- Rudh in Khurasan. In 678/79, Ziyad's son Abd al-Rahman was made governor of Khurasan by Mu'awiya. By then, Qays had become the leader of the Banu Sulaym faction of Basra, one of five tribal divisions of the city's garrison. Abd al- Rahman appointed Qays his deputy and had him enter the province ahead of him. Afterward, Qays arrested the powerful tribal chief Aslam ibn Zur'a al-Kilabi. During the reign of Caliph Yazid I (), in 680/81, the caliph's new appointee over Khurasan, Abd al-Rahman's brother Salm, dispatched his lieutenant al- Harith ibn Mu'awiya al-Harithi to settle matters for him in the province before his arrival. Al-Harith arrested and imprisoned Qays and put his son Shabib in shackles. Qays later returned to Basra where he continued as a nobleman of the Sulaym and the wider Mudar confederation (which was opposed to the Azd–Rabi'a confederation). Together with a Basran tribal noble from the Azd–Rabi'a faction, al-Nu'man ibn Suhban al-Rasibi, Qays was an arbitrator for selecting the successor of Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad as governor of Basra following Ubayd Allah's expulsion in the aftermath of Yazid's death in 683. Basra and most of the Caliphate recognized the Mecca-based, anti-Umayyad Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr as caliph. Qays was dispatched with the Basran security forces to stamp out an attempt by supporters of al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, the pro-Alid ruler of Kufa, to gain control of Basra.

Unlike many others, he avoided arrest, and in 1875 entered university in St-Petersburg, but was expelled in 1876 and sent back to Saratov for taking part in a student protest. The following year, he was exiled to Arkhangelsk for spreading populist propaganda. He attempted to escape, but was caught on the road. He was accused of shooting at the police during his arrest, though he claimed that he had fired in the air, hoping that he would be tried in public and would be able to use his trial to expose the arbitrariness of Tsarist rule. He was sentenced to death by a military tribunal in Arkhangel, but because of his youth - he was aged 19 - the sentence was commuted to 20 years hard labour in Kara katorga. He spent ten years in the Kara convict settlement, working in the mines. On hearing of the death of the political prisoner Nadezhda Sigida, who had been subjected to 100 lashes, he was one of 20 male prisoners who poisoned themselves in protest, on 15 November 1889.

They would come at night to one's pillow side and flip over the pillow. They are also considered to change which direction one's head or feet are facing. They are often found in many actual stories from the Edo Period to the modern period, and they are often said to appear as a small child or a bōzu, but there are no clear-cut accounts of how they look. In the Edo Period collection of yōkai pictures, the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō, they are depicted as a miniature Niō. Legends by area \\"Makuragaeshi\\" (反枕) from the Gazu Hyakki Yagyō by Sekien Toriyama Besides being seen as a yōkai, it is also thought that people who died in a room would become that room's makuragaeshi. There are stories about wealthy travelers who come and take lodging (including zatō, Buddhist pilgrims, pharmacists, which differ by the area in which this is talked about, but all travelers that go to these lands) and get tricked by the owner of the house and have their money stolen, after which every night, the traveler's spirit would move the pillows of the people who lodged there, among other stories. In the Tōhoku region, it is often said that makuragaeshi is a prank pulled by zashiki-warashi. The folklore researcher Kizen Sasaki notes in Tōno no Zashiki-warashi to Oshira-sama (遠野のザシキワラシとオシラサマ, The Zashiki-warashi and Oshira-sama of Tōno) that besides flipping pillows, they would also press on people's bodies as they sleep, lift up tatami mats, and left small footprints behind. This same book goes on and notes that in South Samuraihara, Kunohe District, Iwate Prefecture (now Kuji) and in Mukai, Miyako town, Shimohei District (now Miyako city), there is a mysterious pillar, and it is said that if one sleeps while facing this pillow, one would have a run in with makuragaeshi, making sleep very difficult. In Omoto, Shimohei District, Iwate Prefecture, it is said that once in a certain house, a deceased person was put in a coffin and left in the residence, whereupon a fire burned the coffin and tatami mats, and despite changing all the tatami mats after, those who sleep on top of this tatami would have a run in with makugaeshi. There are several theories on what is truly behind this makuragaeshi, such as being the work of a tanuki or monkey, among others. In Higashiagatsuma, Agatsuma District, Gunma Prefecture, the makuragaeshi is said to be the deed of a cat turned into a kasha, and it is said that when people sleep facing east, it would turn them to face west. There are also regions where a yōkai with the appearance of a child is called makura-kozō (枕小僧). In the Iwata District, Shizuoka Prefecture, the makura-kozō has a height of around 3 shaku (around 90 centimeters), and it is said to do pranks such as turn over the pillows of those who sleep alone. At temples Some stories about running into a makuragaeshi in certain rooms and buildings can be seen in the temples of various lands in Japan. At Daiō-ji in Ōtawara, Tochigi Prefecture, there is a hanging scroll with a ghost drawn on it called the \\"Makuragaeshi Ghost\\" (Makuragaeshi no Yūrei), and it is said that if one hangs this scroll, one's pillow will be found to have turned upon morning. This was drawn by an artist named Koryūen Ōkyo, but in one theory, there is a saying that it was actually drawn by his sick mother in bed, and the mother died right after the picture was finished, after which various paranormal events happened in relation to the picture, so it was placed in this temple as a memorial. At Ōkubo-ji in Sanuki, Kagawa Prefecture, if a makura-kozō stands near one's pillow while asleep, one could no longer move own's body, so people are warned against sleeping there. There are also examples of temple makuragaeshi that are said to be wonder workers that the temple itself is dedicated to as the principal object of worship. At Daichū-ji in Nishiyama field, Ōhira, Tochigi, Tochigi Prefecture, there is a room called the \\"Makuragaeshi Space\\" (makuragaeshi no ma). It is said that once, there was a traveler who took lodging in this room, and they slept with their feet facing the principal object of worship, but upon morning, their head was facing the principal objct of worship, and this is counted as one of the seven mysteries of Daichū-ji. At a temple called Hakusan-ji at Koganeda, Mino Province (now Seki, Gifu Prefecture), there is a Kannon Bosatsu called \\"Makuragaeshi no Kannon\\" that is worshipped, and it is said that by being inside the temple, one would for some reason end up feeling sleepy, that one would doze off even if one is right in front of the Buddhist altar, but it is said that having a dream about having one's pillow flipped is proof that one's wish will be granted. Makuragaeshi that take lives There are also examples of legends that not merely pull pranks, but also take people's lives. In Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, it is said that at a certain residence, a makuragaeshi in the form of a beautiful woman would appear, but when the footwear (zōri) servant of that place was laughed at by this makuragaeshi in front of the residence, the servant fell unconscious right there and died just liked that. In Hidaka District, Wakayama Prefecture, it is said that there were 7 woodcutters cutting a large hinoki tree near the Komata river, and at night, while the 7 were sleeping, a tree spirit appeared and flipped their pillows, and all 7 died. There is a similar story in Wakayama where 8 woodcutters were trying to cut a momi tree, and they gave up midway because it couldn't be cut in one day, and the next day, the cut opening went back to how it was before. Thinking this strange, they kept watch over the tree at night, when they saw a wood spirit put woodchips in the cut. After this, the woodcutters would burn away all the scraps as they cut the tree, so they were able to finally finish cutting the tree. After doing so, one night, the wood spirit came to the woodcutters and flipped their pillows. However, one of the woodcutters was wholeheartedly chanting the Heart Sutra, so the wood spirit saw this one as devout, and went back without turning over this woodcutter's pillow. It is said that next morning, all of the other 7 died. The meaning of pillow flipping It is thought that since ancient times, it was widely believed in Japan that the soul leaves the body while dreaming, and the soul cannot return to the body if the pillow is flipped during that time. In the historical tale Ōkagami written in the final years of the Heian period, there is a statement about how Fujiwara no Yoshitaka left a will that said that on his death, he would make sure to return to this world, so there will be no funeral by the usual customs, but despite this, a normal funeral was held with the pillow's position corrected to face north, so his wish to revive was not granted. The folklorist Akira Takeda notes that the pillow contains a person's living spirit or ikiryo, and to turn the pillow would mean to put that person closer to death. The folklorist Miyata Noboru notes that in the past in Japan, dreaming was thought of as a way to go to another world, and in order to dream, people would kindle a sleep-inducing aroma into their hakomakura (箱枕, box pillow). Miyata remarks that because of this, the pillow is a special tool for moving to another world, basically a boundary to interactions with another dimension, and to have one's pillow flipped while sleeping, this \\"makura- gaeshi\\" (pillow-flipping) wouldbe an abnormal state where all orderliness is turned upside down. It is viewed that these folk beliefs about pillows was the origin of these makuragaeshi legends, and having a makuragaeshi (pillow- flipping) happen was feared as an abnormal state where one's body is cut off from one's soul, but as this belief gradually died out, the makuragaeshi (pillow-flipping) became seen as a mere prank.

Archeology The site is a dolerite quarry which was the exploited in the Neolithic period, from 3500BC to 1800BC, for the production of polished stone tools. This production is estimated at 5,000 axes per year, various other tools besides axes were produced and widely exported beyond the limits of Armorica. Quelfennec's axes have been found throughout western France (from Normandy to Languedoc), but also in North-West Europe, the British Isles, and Belgium, These polished stone axes were used to carry out deforestation to allow for the expansion of agriculture. It is the particular hardness of dolerite, without excessive brittleness, which explains its particular interest in making axes and adzes (hatchets with curved edges like the muzzle of an ermine) but also strikers. By around 2000BC the site gradually went out of use with the introduction of metal tools, which ultimately replaced their stone predecessors.

Capital and Ideology follows Piketty's 2013 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which focused on wealth and income inequality in Europe and the United States. Described by Piketty as \\"in large part a sequel\\" to its predecessor, Capital and Ideology has a wider scope, and Piketty has expressed his preference for the 2019 book. In the book, Piketty outlines potential means of redistributing wealth, and explores historical and contemporary justifications for inequality. Paul Krugman wrote of the book, \\"In Marxian dogma, a society’s class structure is determined by underlying, impersonal forces, technology and the modes of production that technology dictates. Piketty, however, sees inequality as a social phenomenon, driven by human institutions. Institutional change, in turn, reflects the ideology that dominates society: 'Inequality is neither economic nor technological; it is ideological and political.'\\" Methods for redistributing wealth proposed in the book include the \\"inheritance for all,\\" a payment distributed to citizens by their country at the age of 25. The book has received overall positive reviews from economists, scholars and pundits. The book also generated attention because Piketty refused to censor parts of it, which led to it not being published in mainland China.  Reception  Book Marks reports an overall reception of \\"Positive\\" based on two rave reviews, six positive reviews, and six lukewarm reviews. Robert Shortt of RTÉ.ie rated the book four stars out of five. He wrote, “Some of his conclusions [...] can at times sound simplistic, even glib\\", referring to Piketty's proposal that pooling sovereign debt in the Eurozone would reduce member states' debt interest payments and his criticism of the much greater spending on interest payments than on a program like Erasmus+. Shortt also said that the history \\"sometimes takes away from the very real and pertinent questions Piketty raises” about modern politics. However, Shortt said that Capital and Ideology still “goes a long way towards framing what is happening both here and abroad in a broad historical and political context.” In Kirkus Reviews the book was billed as a \\"deftly argued case for a new kind of socialism that, while sure to inspire controversy, bears widespread discussion.\\" William Davies of The Guardian wrote that the book \\"is occasionally naive (it will bug the hell out of historians and anthropologists) but in a provocative fashion, as if to say: if inequality isn’t justified, why not change it?\\" and that Piketty's policy recommendations \\"are not the most arresting features of the book.\\" However, Davies also wrote, \\"Amid the distraction and perpetual outrage of our dysfunctional public sphere, this enlightenment confidence in empirics feels beamed in from another age. It also makes for a unique scholarly edifice, which will be impossible to ignore.\\" Marshall Steinbaum of Boston Review stated that in comparison to Capital in the Twenty-First Century the work \\"loses much of the economic theory, but it gains a vast wealth of historical, sociological, and political detail\\". She wrote that the book \\"systematically demolishes [the] self-serving conceit\\" of the economy as a natural force uninfluenced by ideas on how it should work. While Steinbaum said that Piketty's narrative that left-wing parties became parties of the educated rather than the working class is flawed \\"because the working class is getting more educated\\", Steinbaum lauded Piketty's engagement with political science, writing, \\"Few economists are as methodologically curious and versatile, much less as adept.\\" Geoff Mann praised Capital and Ideology in London Review of Books. He disputed Piketty's claim that social democracy in the 20th century was intended to transcend private property and capitalism. However, Mann said that the book \\"proves conclusively that [the idea that economic growth will fix the inequality problem] was an illusion\\", and concluded, \\"Whether or not his revolution without revolutionaries can get us where we need to go, his analysis of how we got here demands our attention.\\" The Hindu's G. Sampath wrote, \\"Contradicting the claims of Hayekian market fundamentalists, Piketty shows, through page after page of charts, graphs and histograms, how unfettered capitalism in 19th century Europe led to levels of inequality not seen anywhere except in quasi- slave societies. [...] The singular value of this book may well be its power to revive research and activism that re-embed economic problems in a social and civic substrate.\\" The New Republic's Robin Kaiser-Schatzlein argued, \\"Piketty’s own imagination of new worlds is grounded in a rigorous and detailed analysis of the institutions that have existed in the real world. [...] He is uncovering ideas that have worked before. They could work again.\\" In The Washington Post, James Kwak approved of Piketty's explanation for the rise of far-right politics and wrote that \\"as long as the Democratic Party muddles along with the same old ideology of market-driven growth and supposed equality of opportunity, our political system will remain defined by two parties dominated by competing segments of the economic elite.\\" Ryan Cooper of The Week praised the book. Cooper said that Piketty sometimes \\"struggles with organizing his titanic collection of arguments and evidence\\", but found convincing Piketty's discussion of the rightward shift in 21st century politics and dubbed Capital and Ideology \\"a fascinating, essential study both of where we came from and of two possible paths forward: how we might create a better future for all human society, and the dark possibilities should we fail. [...] on his key point of the brute necessity of a reborn international left, Piketty is inarguably correct.” Keith Johnson of Foreign Policy wrote, \\"The reams of economic data he unearths are eye-opening; many of his proposed solutions seem eye-rolling in the current climate. [...] Piketty’s latest effort is a very welcome, very controversial, and, in another time and place, possibly even constructive contribution.\\" Conversely, a reviewer in The Economist said that Piketty \\"draws on an impressive range of historical statistics\\" and that, compared to most post-Marxist critiques, Capital and Ideology is \\"readable. The prose is pithy and light on theory.\\" But the reviewer described the economist's account of ideology by elites throughout history as lesser than accounts by thinkers like Theodor W. Adorno and Michel Foucault because Piketty \\"flits between case studies\\" and suggests that \\"elites are only ever self-serving\\"; the reviewer also said that he insufficiently deals with concerns that \\"sky-high wealth taxes would play havoc with incentives, reducing investment and entrepreneurship [...] it is hard not to conclude that, deep down, Mr Piketty believes the worth of a society is measured by its Gini coefficient alone.\\" The Guardian's Paul Mason said that Piketty's discussions of history and ideologies show ignorance of the \\"methodological debates that rage\\" in the field of history. The journalist also argued that \\"Piketty’s solutions [for the rise of nativism and xenophobia] are perfunctory [...] a survey of ‘red wall‘ seats found they [...] reject attempts to take money from the modestly well-off and even from billionaires“. Summing up Piketty's central idea as taxing capitalism out of existence, Mason concluded, \\"My objection is not that it is too radical but, lacking any explanation of which social forces might enact it, not radical enough.\\" Paul Collier of New Statesman wrote, \\"There is much of value here and many of its ideas are insightful. But in the end, if this becomes the agenda of the left, it will exchange one cul-de-sac for another.\\" Collier claims that Piketty \\"conflates opposition to open borders with hatred of immigrants\\". Collier also said the northern working class in the U.K. would likely prefer a tax on the capital appreciation of the ABs who own London property to Piketty's recommendations, and that \\"it is ethically better that you should save to help your children rather than lavish consumption on yourself now\\". Cole Stangler of The Nation discussed how Piketty differs from Marx and Engels, in that Piketty views major transformations in economics as shaped by various factors (like religious beliefs, sense of national belonging, and crises) whereas Marx and Engels famously described the history of all society as a history mainly of class struggle. Stangler wrote that while some might find nuanced Piketty's lack of identification of a central force and his unpacking of each major transformation \\"on its own terms, insisting on a multitude of alternative paths that might have been followed at any given moment [...] others may be put off by its unwillingness to dig in and take sides.\\" Stangler also argued against the privileging of ideological struggle over class struggle by arguing that some groups are selfish and \\"simply aren’t interested in a good-faith debate [...] one can’t help but wonder if [Piketty] underplays the extent to which individuals’ access to and relationship with wealth [...] influences how they look at the world and engage in politics.\\" Tyler Cowen's words were mostly unfavorable. While he argued that there is a \\"considerable sum of useful and valuable material\\" and praised as \\"carefully done\\" Piketty's history of wealth and property accumulation, Cowen dismissed his commentary on recent events as \\"distorted and unreliable. There is massive distrust of the wealthy in this book, and virtually no distrust of concentrated state power.\\" Cowen suggested that the high innovation of the United States and that, according to him, real wages are higher in the United States than in Western Europe stand as evidence against Piketty's worldview. Till Breyer and Felix Kersting reported in Critical Inquiry that his \\"concrete historical analysis seems to run somewhat counter to” his view of ideas as autonomous, and actually supports the view that crises and struggles are needed for changes in ideological structures. In Financial Times, Raghuram Rajan wrote that Capital and Ideology \\"reflects a prodigious amount of scholarship\\" but wouldn't persuade those who disagreed. Rajan said that studies had debunked Piketty's implicit assumption that today's rich are largely the \\"idle rich\\"; that the high growth from 1950 to 1980 was dependent on a number of factors that are unlikely to be repeated; that \\"we never actually ran the high-tax experiment\\" because tax loopholes were abundant in that period; and that other factors besides tax policy determine inequality. Rajan also argued, of the author's vision of participatory socialism, that \\"it is unclear what would offer a countervailing balance to an overpowerful state [...] Most people will have little sense of control over their futures.\\" Rajan said, \\"Inequality is a real problem today, but it is the inequality of opportunity, of access to capabilities, of place, not just of incomes and wealth.\\" Leonid Bershidsky of Bloomberg said, in response to the high proposed taxes, that \\"Piketty’s book doesn’t do a good job of explaining how an inevitable collapse in property prices will affect the tax base and investment — or, indeed, in what form assets will be parceled out if the rich can’t sell 90% of their assets immediately.\\" Bershidsky also wrote, \\"I’m pretty sure Piketty overestimates the role inequality has played in the recent rise of [political forces that want to focus on identity and tradition rather than any economic vision].\\" Ingrid Harvold Kvangraven, however, wrote that the book is too tepid, stating that Piketty ignores \\"key Marxist insights about dynamics such as the profit motive, unequal access to and ability to develop technology, and labour-squeezing cost-cutting.\\" In Paul Krugman's unfavorable review, he praised the Pikettian method of using \\"a combination of extrapolation and guesswork to produce quantitative estimates for eras that predate modern data collection\\" as applied \\"to very good effect\\" in Capital and Ideology. But he also questions whether Piketty knows enough to have constructed valid claims about the dozens of societies he discusses, as well as whether all of the case studies strengthen Piketty's core argument that rising inequality throughout history is fundamentally due to ideology and politics rather than economics and technology (with Krugman noting Evsey Domar's claims on the reasons for serfdom in Russia). Krugman also argued that the white working class in the U.S. would probably not support Piketty's policies. Despite saying that \\"the book does advance at least the outline of a grand theory of inequality, which might be described as Marx on his head\\", Krugman concluded by asserting that he was unsure what the book's central message was.

It was established in 1205, following the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, and lasted until it was reclaimed by the Byzantine Despotate of Epirus in 1213. Background During the late 11th and the 12th centuries, the city of Durazzo and its province (the \\"Theme of Dyrrhachium\\"), had risen to assume great strategic importance to the Byzantine Empire. The city was the \\"key of Albania\\", the western terminus of the Via Egnatia and the main point of entry for trade, but also for the Norman invasions, from Italy, and was ideally placed to control the actions of the Slavic rulers of the western Balkans.. Establishment and end After the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade and the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, the city was up for grabs. In the partition treaty among the Crusaders, the Republic of Venice had secured recognition of her claims on the westernmost Byzantine provinces, which were crucial in view of the vital Venetian interests in the Adriatic Sea. However, the claim had to be quickly enforced, lest others, and chiefly the Venetians' main rivals, the Genoese, occupy it first. As a result, in the summer of 1205, the Venetian fleet carrying the new Latin Patriarch of Constantinople to his see, also attacked and captured Durazzo and Corfu. At Durazzo, the Venetians met little opposition and one of the captains, Marino Vallaresso, was appointed governor of Durazzo with the title of duke, a sign of the value the Venetians placed in their new possession. For the same reason they insisted on the appointment of the city's Roman Catholic archbishop, who replaced the previous Greek Orthodox prelate, directly by Venice, without the involvement of the Pope. Although the Venetians had also laid claim to the mainland region of Epirus, they did not move to establish control there. Consequently, the area came under the rule of a Byzantine Greek aristocrat, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, who established his own principality there, the Despotate of Epirus. Doukas' power grew quickly, and he soon controlled all the mainland between the Venetian Duchy of Durazzo and the Corinthian Gulf in the south. Unable and unwilling to undertake the effort necessary confront him, the Venetians preferred to conclude a compromise treaty with Doukas in June 1210, which recognized him as ruler of Epirus, but as the nominal vassal of Venice, which had claimed this territory since 1204. This treaty was expedient for Doukas, but did not mean the abandonment of his own designs on Durazzo: in 1213, his forces captured the city, ended the Venetian presence, and restored a Greek Orthodox archbishop to the local see. Soon after, Doukas' forces also took Corfu, and moved to extend his rule over Albania and western Macedonia, capturing the lordship of Croia and pushing up to the borders of Zeta. Aftermath In 1216, the Venetians turned to the new Latin Emperor, Peter II of Courtenay, to help them recover Durazzo. Peter landed at Durazzo in 1217, but although he may have briefly recovered the city, he was soon defeated and captured by Michael Doukas' half-brother and successor, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, and the city returned to Epirote hands. After the Epirote conquest, the city declined as an entrepôt for trade, as the Venetians moved their commerce to Ragusa instead. The city continued to change hands in the 13th and 14th centuries between the Greeks of Epirus and the restored Palaiologan Byzantine Empire, the Angevins of Naples, and the Serbs. Venice once again took possession of the city in 1392, holding it until it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1501.

Christopher Nolan is a British-American filmmaker known for using aesthetics, themes and cinematic techniques that are instantly recognisable in his work. Regarded as an auteur and postmodern filmmaker, Nolan is partial to elliptical editing, documentary-style lighting, hand-held camera work, natural settings, and real filming locations over studio work. Embedded narratives and crosscutting between different time frames is a major component of his work, and his films often feature experimental soundscapes and mathematically inspired images and concepts. Nolan prefers shooting on film to digital video and advocates for the use of higher-quality, larger- format film stock. He also favours practical effects over computer-generated imagery, and is a proponent of theatrical exhibition. His work explores existential and epistemological themes such as subjective experience, materialism, distortion of memory, human morality, the nature of time, causality, and the construction of personal identity. His characters are often emotionally disturbed, obsessive, and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed. Nolan also uses his real- life experiences as an inspiration in his work. His most prominent recurring theme is the concept of time; questions concerning the nature of existence and reality also play a major role in his body of work. Nolan's wife, Emma Thomas, has co-produced all of his features, and he has co-written several of his films with his younger brother, Jonathan Nolan. Other frequent collaborators include editor Lee Smith, cinematographers Wally Pfister and Hoyte van Hoytema, composer Hans Zimmer, sound designer Richard King, production designer Nathan Crowley, and casting director John Papsidera. Nolan's films feature many recurring actors, most notably Michael Caine, having appeared in eight (including a cameo in Dunkirk).  Aesthetics  = Style = Regarded as an auteur and postmodernist,Hill-Parks, p. 2. Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, dialogue scenes framed in wide close-up with a shallow depth of field, inserts, and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, hand-held camera work, natural settings, and real filming locations over studio work. His colour palettes have been influenced by his red-green colour blindness. Nolan has noted that many of his films are heavily influenced by film noir, and he is particularly known for exploring various ways of \\"manipulating story time and the viewer's experience of it.\\" He has continuously experimented with metafictional elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots, genre hybridity, and the merging of style and form.Fischer, p. 37. alt=A staircase in a square format. The stairs make four 90-degree turns in each corner, so they are in the format of a continuous loop. Drawing attention to the intrinsically manipulative nature of the medium, Nolan uses narrative and stylistic techniques (notably mise en abyme and recursions) to stimulate the viewer to ask themselves why his films are put together the way they are and why they provoke particular responses. Nolan's preoccupation with recursive narratives and images first appear in his 1997 short film, Doodlebug, and can be seen in many of his features.Joy, Stuart (2020) Some examples include the infinity mirrors created by Ariadne in Inception, and Mementos poster design, inspired by the Droste effect, in which a picture appears within itself. His films often explore mathematically inspired ideas such as the Möbius strip, impossible objects, visual paradoxes and tessellations. He frequently uses these ideas as foundation for creating narrative form, such as the palindrome structure of Tenet. Notable examples of \\"mathematical beauty\\" in his work include the Penrose stairs in Inception, and the tesseract in Interstellar, \\"a three-dimensional representation of our four-dimensional reality (three physical dimensions plus time) inside the five-dimensional (four dimensions plus time) hyperspace\\". The logo for Nolan's production company, Syncopy, is a centreless maze. A map showing the structure of Memento (2000) Nolan sometimes uses editing as a way to represent the characters' psychological states, merging their subjectivity with that of the audience. For example, in Memento the fragmented sequential order of scenes is to put the audience into a similar experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories. In The Prestige, the series of magic tricks and themes of duality and deception mirror the structural narrative of the film. His writing style incorporates a number of storytelling techniques such as flashbacks, shifting points of view, and unreliable narrators. Scenes are often interrupted by the unconventional editing style of cutting away quickly from the money shot (or nearly cutting off characters' dialogue) and crosscutting several scenes of parallel action to build to a climax. Embedded narratives and crosscutting between different time frames is a major component of Nolan's auteurship.Mooney, p. 11. Following contains four timelines and intercuts three; Memento intercuts two timelines, with one moving backward; The Prestige contains four timelines and intercuts three; Inception intercuts four timelines, all of them framed by a fifth. In Dunkirk, Nolan structured three different timelines to emulate a Shepard tone in such a way that it \\"provides a continual feeling of intensity\\". Noted film theorist and historian David Bordwell wrote, \\"For Nolan, I think, form has centrally to do with the sorts of juxtapositions you can create by crosscutting. You could say he treats crosscutting the way Ophüls treats tracking shots or Dreyer treats stark decor: an initial commitment to a creative choice, which in turn shapes the handling of story, staging, performance and other factors.\\" Bordwell further added, \\"It's rare to find any mainstream director so relentlessly focused on exploring a particular batch of storytelling techniques... Nolan zeroes in, from film to film, on a few narrative devices, finding new possibilities in what most directors handle routinely. He seems to me a very thoughtful, almost theoretical director in his fascination with turning certain conventions this way and that, to reveal their unexpected possibilities.\\" The director has also stressed the importance of establishing a clear point of view in his films, and makes frequent use of \\"the shot that walks into a room behind a character, because... that takes [the viewer] inside the way that the character enters\\". On narrative perspective, Nolan has said, \\"You don't want to be hanging above the maze watching the characters make the wrong choices because it's frustrating. You actually want to be in the maze with them, making the turns at their side.\\" = Music = Nolan frequently works with Hans Zimmer to compose music for his productions. In collaboration with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films feature slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan began working with Hans Zimmer, who is known for integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more exuberant, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\". For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: \\"The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent.\\" The score for Dunkirk was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone. It was also based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Ludwig Göransson, the composer for Tenet (2020), researched retrograde music to generate tunes that would sound the same forward and backward. Part of the soundscape for the villainous character in Tenet was based on Nolan breathing through a microphone, and later manipulated and turned into uncomfortable, raspy sounds by Göransson. He called working with the director an \\"eye-opening experience\\", saying \\"I know from watching his films how savvy he is with music, how much he understands it, but I didn't fully know that he could speak about it almost like a trained musician.\\" Responding to criticism over his experimental sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan remarked, \\"I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound.\\" The mix for Tenet received similar attention, with some deeming it \\"infuriating\\", while others found it \\"inspiring\\". Peter Albrechtsen, a sound designer who worked on Dunkirk, commented that Nolan rarely uses ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement), so the dialogue in his films are mostly based on production sound. He also noted that the way Nolan uses sound is \\"very visceral ... It is a physical experience. It's a very intense sonic experience, and I can see why, for some, that's quite overwhelming.\\" = Themes = Nolan's work explores existential, ethical, and epistemological themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, the nature of time, causality, and construction of personal identity.Eberl, Dunn (2017), p. 211. On subjective point of view, Nolan said: \\"I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, that we are all stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on what we all agree to be an objective reality, and movies are one of the ways in which we try to see things from the same point of view\\". His films contain a notable degree of ambiguity and often examine the similarities between filmmaking and architecture. The director avoids divulging the ambiguities of his films so that audiences can come up with their own interpretations. Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as \\"epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach.\\" In an essay titled \\"The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan\\", film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. \\"Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes.\\" In his book, Out of Time: Desire in Atemporal Cinema, author and film theorist Todd McGowan claim that many of Nolan's films break from linear chronology in order to emphasize the repetition of \\"the psychoanalytic drive\\". He writes, \\"the future does not provide the promise of desire's realization but rather a repeated failure to attain its object. By scrambling chronology, atemporal films make evident this failure for the spectator and thus encourage the spectator to embrace the repetition of the drive rather than put their faith in a different future.\\" Nolan often grounds his stories in broader societal issues, such as corruption, surveillance, economic inequality and climate change, and his characters are usually emotionally disturbed, obsessive, and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed. By exploring \\"everyday neurosisour everyday sort of fears and hopes for ourselves\\" in a heightened reality, Nolan makes them more accessible to a universal audience. The protagonists of Nolan's films are often driven by philosophical beliefs, and their fate is ambiguous. In some of his films, the protagonist and antagonist are mirror images of each other, a point which is made to the protagonist by the antagonist. Through the clashing of ideologies, Nolan highlights the ambivalent nature of truth. In his book, The Traumatic Screen: The Films of Christopher Nolan (2020), film scholar Stuart Joy builds on contemporary psychoanalytic film theory to consider \\"the function and presentation of trauma across Nolan's work, arguing that the complexity, thematic consistency, and fragmentary nature of his films mimic the structural operation of trauma. He writes that, \\"Nolan's films highlight cinema's ability to probe the nature of human consciousness while commenting on the relationship between spectator and screen.\\" The director uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work, saying, \\"From a creative point of view, the process of growing up, the process of maturing, getting married, having kids, I've tried to use that in my work. I've tried to just always be driven by the things that were important to me.\\" Writing for The Playlist, Oliver Lyttelton singled out parenthood as a signature theme in Nolan's work, adding: \\"[T]he director avoids talking about his private life, but fatherhood has been at the emotional heart of almost everything he's made, at least from Batman Begins onwards (previous films, it should be said, pre-dated the birth of his kids).\\" Time is a recurring theme in Nolan's work. Many ideas in Tenet was first explored in a thought experiment by James Clerk Maxwell in 1867, in which he suggested how the second law of thermodynamics might hypothetically be violated. Nolan's most prominent recurring theme is the concept of time. The director has identified that all of his films \\"have had some odd relationship with time, usually in just a structural sense, in that I have always been interested in the subjectivity of time.\\" Writing for Film Philosophy, Emma Bell commented that the characters in Inception \\"escape time by being _stricken_ in itbuilding the delusion that time has not passed, and is not passing now. They feel time grievously: willingly and knowingly destroying their experience by creating multiple simultaneous existences.\\" In Interstellar, Nolan explored the laws of physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. With Tenet, Nolan used entropy and the second law of thermodynamics to explore temporal paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox and the causal loop, as well as ideas about retrocausality, fatalism, infinity, the one-electron universe, and Maxwell's demon. Brandon Katz of The Observer wrote that \\"time isn't just a narrative gimmick in Nolan's filmography nor are his settings mere window dressing for the action. Instead, they are integral elements of the story that interact with both the characters and the viewers to elicit an emotional and psychological response both consciously and subconsciously. Ontological questions concerning the nature of existence and reality also play a major role in his body of work. Alec Price and M.Dawson of Left Field Cinema noted that the existential crisis of conflicted male figures \\"struggling with the slippery nature of identity\\" is a prevalent theme in Nolan's films. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than the way in which we absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. \\"It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found.\\" According Todd McGowan, these \\"created realities\\" also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, \\"They show us how truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray.\\" McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. In Inception, Nolan was inspired by lucid dreaming and dream incubation. The film's characters try to embed an idea in a person's mind without their knowledge, similar to Freud's theory that the unconscious influences one's behaviour without one's knowledge. Most of the film takes place in interconnected dream worlds; this creates a framework where actions in the real (or dream) worlds ripple across others. The dream is always in a state of emergence, shifting across levels as the characters navigate it. Like Memento and The Prestige, Inception uses metaleptic storytelling devices and follows Nolan's \\"auteur affinity of converting, moreover, converging narrative and cognitive values into and within a fictional story\\".  Commentary  Nolan's work has often been the subject of extensive social and political commentary. Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises shows that Hollywood blockbusters can be \\"precise indicators of the ideological predicaments of our societies\\". The Dark Knight trilogy explored themes of chaos, terrorism, escalation of violence, financial manipulation, utilitarianism, mass surveillance, and class conflict. Batman's arc of rising (philosophically) from a man to \\"more than just a man\\" is similar to the Nietzschian Übermensch. The films also explore ideas akin to Jean-Jacques Rousseau's philosophical glorification of a simpler, more primitive way of life and the concept of general will. Theorist Douglas Kellner saw the series as a critical allegory about the Bush–Cheney era, highlighting the theme of government corruption and failure to solve social problems, as well as the cinematic spectacle and iconography related to 9/11.Kellner, Douglas M (2009), p. 11–12. In 2018, the conservative magazine The American Spectator published an article, \\"In Search of Christopher Nolan\\", writing, \\"All of Nolan's films, while maintaining a strong patriotism, plunges below the surface into the murky waters of philosophy, probing some of the deepest human struggles in our unfortunately postmodern age.\\" The article further argues that Dunkirk echoes the work of absurdist playwrights like Samuel Beckett and the bleak, existential novels of Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. Nolan has said that none of his films are intended to be political.  Method  Nolan has described his filmmaking process as a combination of intuition and geometry. \\"I draw a lot of diagrams when I work. I do a lot of thinking about etchings by Escher, for instance. That frees me, finding a mathematical model or a scientific model. I'll draw pictures and diagrams that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that I'm after.\\" Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne compared Nolan's intuition to forward-thinking scientists, saying the filmmaker intuitively grasped things non-scientists rarely understand. Regarding his own decision-making of whether to start work on a project, Nolan has proclaimed a belief in the sincerity of his passion for something within the particular project in question as a basis for his selective thought. When working with actors, Nolan prefers giving them the time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. \\"I've come to realize that the lighting and camera setups, the technical things, take all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues.\\" He prohibits the use of phones on set, and favours working in close coordination with his actors, avoiding the use of a video village. Cillian Murphy said, \\"he creates this environment where it's just you and the actor or actors, there's Wally [Pfister], the camera man, and he stands beside the camera with like his little monitor but he's watching it in real time. And for him the performance is paramount. It's the connection between the actors. He allows room for spontaneity.\\" Gary Oldman praised the director for giving the actors space to \\"find things in the scene\\" and not just give direction for direction's sake. Kenneth Branagh also recognised Nolan's ability to provide a harmonious work environment, comparing him with Danny Boyle and Robert Altman: \\"These are not people who try to trick or cajole or hector people. They sort of strip away the chaos.\\" Nolan chooses to minimise the amount of computer- generated imagery for special effects in his films, preferring to use practical effects whenever possible, and only using CGI to enhance elements which he has photographed in camera. For instance, his films Batman Begins, Inception, and Interstellar featured 620, 500, and 850 visual-effects shots, respectively, which is considered minor when compared with contemporary visual-effects epics, which may have upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 VFX shots. Nolan explained: > I believe in an absolute difference between animation and photography. > However sophisticated your computer-generated imagery is, if it's been > created from no physical elements and you haven't shot anything, it's going > to feel like animation. There are usually two different goals in a visual > effects movie. One is to fool the audience into seeing something seamless, > and that's how I try to use it. The other is to impress the audience with > the amount of money spent on the spectacle of the visual effect, and that, I > have no interest in. Nolan shoots the entirety of his films with one unit, rather than using a second unit for action sequences. That way, he keeps his personality and point of view in every aspect of the film. \\"If I don't need to be directing the shots that go in the movie, why do I need to be there at all? The screen is the same size for every shot... Many action films embrace a second unit taking on all of the action. For me, that's odd because then why did you want to do an action film?\\" He uses multi-camera for stunts and single-camera for all the dramatic action. He then watches dailies every night, saying, \\"Shooting single-camera means I've already seen every frame as it's gone through the gate because my attention isn't divided to multi-cameras.\\" Nolan deliberately works under a tight schedule during the early stages of the editing process, forcing himself and his editor to work more spontaneously. \\"I always think of editing as instinctive or impressionist. Not to think too much, in a way, and feel it more.\\" He also avoids using temp music while cutting his films.  Collaborators  His wife, Emma Thomas, has co-produced all of his films (including Memento, in which she is credited as an associate producer). He regularly works with his brother, Jonathan Nolan (creator of Person of Interest and Westworld), who describes their working relationship in the production notes for The Prestige: \\"I've always suspected that it has something to do with the fact that he's left-handed and I'm right-handed, because he's somehow able to look at my ideas and flip them around in a way that's just a little bit more twisted and interesting. It's great to be able to work with him like that\\". When working on separate projects, the brothers always consult each other. The director has worked with screenwriter David S. Goyer on all of his comic-book adaptations.Jesser, Pourroy (2012), pp. 33–51. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer for all of Nolan's films from Memento to The Dark Knight Rises. Embarking on his own career as a director, Pfister said: \\"The greatest lesson I learned from Chris Nolan is to keep my humility. He is an absolute gentleman on set and he is wonderful to everyonefrom the actors to the entire crew, he treats everyone with respect.\\" With Interstellar Nolan began collaborating with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. Lee Smith has edited seven of Nolan's films, while Dody Dorn has cut two.Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 253. David Julyan composed the music for Nolan's early work, while Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard provided the music for Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.Jesser, Pourroy (2012), pp. 254–57. Zimmer scored The Dark Knight Rises and worked with Nolan on many of his subsequent films. Zimmer said his creative relationship with Nolan was highly collaborative, and that he considers Nolan a \\"co-creator\\" of the music. The director has worked with sound designer Richard King and re-recording mixer Gary Rizzo since The Prestige.Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 261. Nolan has frequently collaborated with special-effects supervisor Chris Corbould,Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 223. stunt coordinator Tom StruthersJesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 242. first assistant director Nilo Otero, and visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin.Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 286. Production designer Nathan Crowley has worked with him since Insomnia (except for Inception).Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 57. Nolan has called Crowley one of his closest and most inspiring creative collaborators. Casting director John Papsidera has worked on all of Nolan's films, except Following and Insomnia. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy have been frequent collaborators since the mid-2000s, each appearing in upwards of 3 films each. Caine is Nolan's most prolific collaborator, having appeared in eight of his films (including a cameo in Dunkirk); Nolan regards him as his \\"good luck charm\\". In return, Caine has described Nolan as \\"one of cinema's greatest directors\\", comparing him favourably with the likes of David Lean, John Huston, and Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Nolan is known for casting stars from the 1980s in his films, i.e. Rutger Hauer (Batman Begins), Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight), Tom Berenger (Inception), and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). Modine said of working with Nolan, \\"There are no chairs on a Nolan set, he gets out of his car and goes to the set. And he stands up until lunchtime. And then he stands up until they say 'Wrap'. He's fully engagedin every aspect of the film.\\"  Influences  Nolan has credited M. C. Escher as a major influence. The filmmaker has often cited Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher as a major influence on his own work. \\"I'm very inspired by the prints of M.C. Escher and the interesting connection-point or blurring of boundaries between art and science, and art and mathematics.\\" Another source of inspiration is Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. The director has called Memento a \\"strange cousin\\" to Funes the Memorious, and has said, \\"I think his writing naturally lends itself to a cinematic interpretation because it is all about efficiency and precision, the bare bones of an idea.\\" Filmmakers Nolan has cited as influences include: Stanley Kubrick, Michael Mann, Terrence Malick, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, Nicolas Roeg, Sidney Lumet, David Lean, Ridley Scott, Terry Gilliam, and John Frankenheimer. Nolan's personal favourite films include Blade Runner (1982), Star Wars (1977), The Man Who Would Be King (1975), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Chinatown (1974), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and Withnail and I (1987). In 2013 Criterion Collection released a list of Nolan's ten favourite films from its catalogue, which included The Hit (1984), 12 Angry Men (1957), The Thin Red Line (1998), The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933), Bad Timing (1980), Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983), For All Mankind (1989), Koyaanisqatsi (1982), Mr. Arkadin (1955), and Erich von Stroheim's Greed (1924) (unavailable on Criterion). He is also a fan of the James Bond films, citing them as a \\"a huge source of inspiration\\" and has expressed his admiration for the work of composer John Barry. Nolan's habit of employing non-linear storylines was particularly influenced by the Graham Swift novel Waterland, which he felt \\"did incredible things with parallel timelines, and told a story in different dimensions that was extremely coherent\\". He was also influenced by the visual language of the film Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982) and the structure of Pulp Fiction (1994), stating that he was \\"fascinated with what Tarantino had done\\". Inception was partly influenced by Dante's Inferno, Max Ernst's Forest series, and the films Orpheus (1950), La Jetée (1962), On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), and Zabriskie Point (1970). For Interstellar, he mentioned a number of literary influences, including Flatland by Edwin Abbott Abbott, The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks, and A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle. For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927), as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Other influences Nolan has credited include figurative painter Francis Bacon, architects Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and authors Raymond Chandler, James Ellroy, Jim Thompson, and Charles Dickens (A Tale of Two Cities was a major influence on The Dark Knight Rises).Jesser, Pourroy (2012), p. 51.  Views on the film industry  Nolan is known for shooting on 70 mm film, and is credited for popularising the use of IMAX 70mm cameras in contemporary cinema. = Analog film = Nolan is a vocal proponent of the continued use of film stock and prefers it over digital recording and projection formats, summing up his belief as, \\"I am not committed to film out of nostalgia. I am in favor of any kind of technical innovation but it needs to exceed what _has_ gone before and so far nothing has exceeded anything that's come before\\". Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying, \\"I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [a production] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo.\\" He opposes the use of digital intermediates and digital cinematography, which he feels are less reliable than film and offer inferior image quality. In particular, the director advocates for the use of higher-quality, larger-format film stock such as Panavision anamorphic 35mm, VistaVision, Panavision Super 70mm, and IMAX 70mm film. Rather than use a digital intermediate, Nolan uses photochemical colour timing to colour grade his films, which results in less manipulation of the filmed image and higher film resolution. Seeking to maintain high resolution from an analogue workflow, Nolan has at times edited and created release prints for his films optically rather than though digital processes. On occasion he has even edited sequences for his films from the original camera negative.. When digital processes are used, Nolan will use high resolution telecine based on a photochemical film print, striving to maintain a \\"film look\\". Nolan (right) and director Colin Trevorrow discussing the importance of film at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival Nolan is credited for popularising the use of IMAX film cameras in commercial filmmaking, and has used his influence in Hollywood to showcase the IMAX format, warning other filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, movie studios would begin to phase out the use of film in favour of digital. In 2014, Nolan, along with directors J. J. Abrams, Quentin Tarantino and Judd Apatow, successfully lobbied for major Hollywood studios to continue to fund Kodak to produce and process film stock, following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, as Kodak is currently the last remaining manufacturer of film stock worldwide. At the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, Nolan attended a panel entitled \\"Power of Story\\", where he discussed the importance of allowing filmmakers the continued artistic choice of shooting on film. Nolan argued for the artistic merits of film on the grounds of \\"medium specificity\\", which highlights the importance that a work shot on film be presented in its original format, and \\"medium resistance\\", that the artist's choice of what medium is used to create a work will further effect choices in how a work is made. Nolan is also a proponent of film preservation and is a member of the National Film Preservation Board, as well as the board of Martin Scorsese's non-profit Film Foundation. = Theatrical exhibition = Nolan is an advocate for the importance of films being shown in large-screen cinema theatres as opposed to home video formats, as he believes that, \\"The theatrical window is to the movie business what live concerts are to the music businessand no one goes to a concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage.\\" In 2014 Christopher Nolan wrote an article for The Wall Street Journal where he expressed concern that as the film industry transitions away from photochemical film towards digital formats, the difference between seeing films in theatres versus on other formats will become trivialised, leaving audiences no incentive to seek out a theatrical experience. Nolan further expressed concern that with content digitised, theatres of the future will be able to track best-selling films and adjust their programming accordingly, a process that favours large heavily marketed studio films, but will marginalise smaller innovative and unconventional pictures. To combat this, Nolan believes the industry needs to focus on improving the theatrical experience with bigger and more beautiful presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in the home, as well as embracing the new generation of aspiring young innovative filmmakers. Nolan assisted in the 2019 renovation of the DGA theatre in Los Angeles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nolan wrote about the social and cultural importance of movie theaters in an article published by The Washington Post. He called it \\"the most affordable and democratic of our community gathering places\\" and urged Congress to include struggling theater chains and their employees in the federal bailout. \\"I hope that people are seeing our exhibition community for what it really is: a vital part of social life, providing jobs for many and entertainment for all. These are places of joyful mingling where workers serve up stories and treats to the crowds that come to enjoy an evening out with friends and family. As a filmmaker, my work can never be complete without those workers and the audiences they welcome.\\" On 30 September 2020, he signed a letter to Washington lawmakers calling on the federal government to provide support for the industry. Owen Gleiberman of Variety deemed Nolan \\"the film industry's most dynamic public advocate for the movie-theater experience.\\" = Criticism = Nolan has been critical of 3D film and dislikes that 3D cameras cannot be equipped with prime (non-zoom) lenses. In particular, Nolan has criticised the loss of brightness caused by 3D projection, which can be up to three foot-lamberts dimmer. \\"You're not that aware of it because once you're 'in that world,' your eye compensates, but having struggled for years to get theaters up to the proper brightness, we're not sticking polarized filters in everything.\\" Nolan has also argued against the notion that traditional film does not create the illusion of depth perception, saying, \\"I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional ... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading.\\" He also opposes motion interpolation, commonly referred to as the \\"soap opera effect\\", as the default setting on television. In 2018, Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson and other filmmakers reached out to television manufacturers in an attempt to \\"try and give directors a voice in how the technical standards of our work can be maintained in the home.\\" A TV setting called \\"Filmmaker Mode\\" was announced by UHD Alliance a year later.

Located on The Quay, today the building is used as Bideford Arts Centre and has been a Grade II listed building on the Register of Historic England since 2001.Bideford Arts Centre on the Historic England Register of Listed Buildings History Front of the former art school The former Bideford Art School is now a listed building. The builder and architect was George Malam Wilson (1855-1917) of Bideford.Elain Harwood, England's Schools: History, architecture and adaptation, English Heritage (2010) - Google Books pg. 49 Built of red brick with a slate roof and parapeted gable ends, the building is on an L-shaped plan with the former classrooms to the north and east and the main entrance on the south side opening onto a small courtyard with the original office/Master's house. It opened in 1896 as a technical college as attested by the large plaque on the side of the building which mentions Henry Ascott, then Mayor of Bideford, together with Alderman John Whitlock Narroway, who was involved with opening Bideford Library. The drive for ‘municipal socialising’ during the latter decades of the reign of Queen Victoria saw the opening of numerous museums, art galleries and technical colleges for the improvement of the public. Possibly because of its location as a place where artists met and worked, the technical college at Bideford evolved into a specialist art school where students were able to access excellent teaching in small groups before moving on for further training at larger art schools elsewhere.A brief history of Bideford Art School - Bideford Buzz - Newspages for the Bideford and district communityBideford Art School - Artist Biographies: British and Irish Artists of the 20th Century Among the artists who trained at Bideford are Allin Braund, who later taught at Hornsey School of Art in the 1930s, and Judith Ackland and Sheila Hutchinson; their work is part of the nearby Burton at Bideford's permanent collection. Rosemary Sutcliff, later to gain fame as the author of The Eagle of the Ninth, trained in art here before going on to become a member of the Royal Society of Miniaturists. Leslie Worth, who became President of the Royal Watercolour Society, trained here, as did George Belcher and Bertram Prance, both of whom became cartoonists for Punch. The artist Leslie Davenport taught here early in his career. In the 1950s under the direction of Jim Paterson the art school at Bideford became well known for its training in pottery. Recent years In the 1970s the Art School became a general further education college at which time art education became centred at North Devon College in nearby Barnstaple (now Petroc College). The building now houses Bideford Arts Centre.

James Cook, During the Years 1772, 3, 4, and 5) is Georg Forster's report about the second voyage of James Cook. The book was written in 1776/77 by Georg instead of his father, Johann Reinhold Forster, the naturalist on the Second Voyage, after the elder Forster had fallen out with Cook and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. It was published in March 1777 and has become a classic of travel literature.  Background  Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster, by John Francis Rigaud, London 1780. The plant in the brim of the hat is a Forstera sedifolia, locating the scene in New Zealand, although the image has been commonly called \\"Reinhold and George Forster at Tahiti\\" or similar. The first voyage of James Cook, 1768–1771, had been undertaken to observe the 1769 transit of Venus from Tahiti. Another aim, following the urgings of geographer Alexander Dalrymple, had been to find Terra Australis Incognita. Cook circumnavigated New Zealand, proving it was not attached to a landmass further south, and mapped the East coast of Australia, but had not found evidence for a large southern continent. After Cook's return, a second voyage was commissioned with the aim to aim to circumnavigate the globe as far south as possible in order to finally find this famed continent. In the preparations for Cook's second voyage, Joseph Banks, the botanist on the first voyage, had been designated as main scientific member of the crew. He asked for major changes to the expedition ship, HMS Resolution, which made it top-heavy, and had to be mostly undone. Subsequently, Banks was dissatisfied with the ship and refused to go on the expedition. On ten days' notice, the Royal Society's vice president Daines Barrington then commissioned Johann Reinhold Forster as the expedition's scientist, accompanied by his seventeen-year-old son Georg (sometimes referred to as \\"George\\" in English), and First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Sandwich recommended Forster to the prime minister. After the return of Cook's expedition, there was disagreement about who should write the official account of the journey. After Cook's first voyage, a report had been compiled from the journals of Cook and Banks by writer and editor John Hawkesworth for a compensation of £6,000, after Hawkesworth had been recommended to Lord Sandwich by their mutual friend Charles Burney. Hawkesworth's report, which contained several inaccuracies, was poorly received by critics, and Cook strongly disliked both Hawkesworth's moralising and instances where Hawkesworth had chosen not to follow either of Banks' or Cook's journals. After this experience, Cook preferred to write his own report. Johann Reinhold Forster, on the other hand, believed he would be allowed to write the official report and reap the expected financial rewards from it. Both Cook and Forster had kept journals for this purpose and reworked them in the winter of 1775/76. In April 1776, Sandwich brokered a compromise that both sides agreed to: Cook should write the first volume, concentrating on the nautical observations, and the elder Forster was to write the second volume concerning the discoveries made in natural history and ethnology. Costs and profits were to be shared equally, but the Admiralty was to pay for the engravings. However, when Forster had completed a sample chapter, Sandwich was dissatisfied with the writing style and asked Daines Barrington to revise it. Reinhold Forster was furious about this interference with his writing, and refused to submit his drafts for correction. He offered to sell his manuscripts to the Admiralty for £200, which Cook and Barrington supported, but Sandwich refused. In June 1776, it was decided that Cook would publish his report alone, giving Cook the full financial benefit of the publication. Reinhold Forster's agreements with Sandwich made it impossible for him to publish a separate narrative.  Writing and publication  Georg Forster was not bound by his father's agreements with the Admiralty, and began to write A Voyage Round the World in July 1776. His father's journals were the main source for the work. The facts about what they saw and did are typically taken from these journals but recast into Georg's own style, with different ordering of the details and additional connecting material. Some parts were also based on segments of Cook's journals that Forster's father had had access to or on Georg's own notes and recollections, including his own memorandum Observationes historiam naturalem spectantes quas in navigationes ad terras australes institutere coepit G. F ., which contains botanical and biological observations up to 1 January 1773. Unlike the systematic approach of Johann Reinhold Forster's later book Observations Made during a Voyage round the World (1778), A Voyage Round the World is a chronology of the voyage, but written as entertaining literature instead of a dry collection of facts, including the use of quotations from classical literature to frame the narrative. Among the first books using such scientific-literary techniques, it is regarded as a seminal book in the history of travel writing and has been described as \\"unambiguously the finest of the Cook voyage narratives\\". The book's manuscript was proofread by Oxford astronomer Thomas Hornsby. The book appeared on 17 March 1777, printed by Benjamin White, in two volumes totalling 1200 pages. Cook's official account of the voyage, A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, appeared six weeks later. Cook's book included 63 copper engravings, some of which were based on Georg Forster's drawings, while A Voyage Round the World was not illustrated. Nevertheless, both books were sold at the same price of 2 guineas. Forster's book sold slowly; in 1778, 570 of about 1000 copies were still unsold, and the Forsters, who were in debt, had to sell most of their collection of Pacific artifacts and of Georg's drawings. The drawings were not published for more than 200 years, when they appeared in an illustrated German edition of Voyage.  Authorship controversy  The authorship of the young Forster was immediately questioned. William Wales, who had been the astronomer on Cook's second journey, considered Johann Reinhold Forster to be the true author, and accused him of lies and misrepresentations. The editor of Cook's journals, John Beaglehole, refers to Georg's claims of originality as \\"not strictly truthful\\" in his biography of Cook. R. L. Kahn, the editor of the 1968 edition of Voyage, calls the book a joint work based on Reinhold's journals, stating \\"probably sixty percent of it was finally written by George\\". According to Leslie Bodi, the style and philosophy both point towards Georg. Thomas P. Saine similarly states in his biography of Georg Forster that the quality of the English writing is too good to be Reinhold's work, and the comments and observations \\"reveal more of the youthful enthusiasm and attitude to be expected from Georg than of the more scientific temperament to be expected of Reinhold\\". In her 1973 thesis, which has been described as the most reliable account of the history of writing and publication of Voyage, Ruth Dawson describes the style of the work as \\"convincing evidence\\" for Georg's authorship and notes that his father was \\"involved in other matters\\" during the six months of writing. On sources, she states \\"While the role which J. R. Forster personally played in the writing of Voyage round the World and Reise um die Welt is a limited one, his records are the major source for almost all the facts and events described.\\" Her overall conclusion is \\"It seems certain however that it was Georg Forster who wrote the account.\\" Philip Edwards, while pointing out many observations that clearly are Georg's, calls Voyage a \\"collaborative, consensual work; a single author has been created out of the two minds involved in the composition.\\" Nicholas Thomas and Oliver Berghof, the editors of the 2000 edition, explicitly disagree with Kahn and state the text is \\"in effect an independent account, an additional source for the events of Cook’s second voyage, rather than simply a revised version of another primary source\\", differentiating Voyage from earlier publications where Georg had been his father's assistant.  Content  Map showing the second voyage of James Cook The book is structured as a travelogue, chronologically retelling the events and observations of the journey. Unlike Cook's report, it does not focus on the nautical aspects of the voyage, but on the scientific and ethnological observations. Forster describes encounters with the peoples and cultures of the South Seas and the corrupting impact of the contact with European sailors. Peoples described include the Tahitians, the Maori of New Zealand, and the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, whose technologies and societies Forster analysed and compared. The following is a summary of the contents of each chapter, following the journey of the Resolution under Cook, which was accompanied for parts of the journey by the Adventure under the command of Tobias Furneaux. = Preface = Forster explains the history of the work, including the agreements between his father, Cook and Sandwich. He proceeds with an apology for producing a work separate to Cook's, and gives an account of Omai's life in England. = Book I = Halcyon leucocephala acteon, by Georg Forster, Cape Verde, 1772  Chapter I. Departure—Passage from Plymouth to Madeira—Description of that Island.  The Forsters travel from London to Plymouth. After final works on the Resolution have been completed, the sea voyage begins. They sail along the coast of Spain, then spend some days in Madeira, and Forster describes the island on several pages.  Chapter II. The Passage from Madeira to the Cape Verd Islands, and from thence to the Cape of Good Hope.  The voyage passes first the Canary Islands, then crosses the Tropic of Cancer. They visit Cape Verde. Forster comments on its inhabitants and their wretchedness, which he blames on \\"despotic governors, bigotted priests, and indolence on the part of the court of Lisbon\\". On the way south, they encounter dolphins, flying fish, and some luminous sea creatures.  Chapter III. Stay at the Cape of Good Hope.—Account of that Settlement.  Table Mountain and Cape Town, by William Hodges, 1772 The voyagers spend three weeks in Cape Town. Forster describes the colony, which he finds far superior to the Portuguese colony at Cape Verde. They meet Anders Sparrman, who agrees to accompany them.  Chapter IV. Run from the Cape to the Antarctic Circle; first season spent in high Southern Latitudes.—Arrival on the Coast of New Zeeland.  The voyagers sail south, into unknown waters. As the weather gets colder, Cook provides warm clothing to the seamen. At 51°5’ South, they encounter icebergs. William Wales and Forster's father get lost in the fog in a small boat, but eventually manage to return to the ship. The sailors are drunk at Christmas. Ice is brought on board to be melted. On 17 January 1772, they cross the Antarctic Circle: The voyage continues eastwards, with occasional attempts to go further south. They lose contact with the Adventure. Several sailors suffer from symptoms of scurvy. They arrive in New Zealand at the end of February, \\"after a space of four months and two days, out of sight of land\\".  Chapter V. Stay at Dusky Bay; description of it, and account of our transactions there.  Melaleuca aestuosa, watercolour painting of a Metrosideros umbellata, by Georg Forster, New Zealand 1773. Dusky Bay in New Zealand, painting by William Hodges, April 1773 Resolution arrives at Dusky Bay, where they meet some natives and make several excursions. There is plenty of fish and many ducks to shoot. They leave some geese to breed, and restock with water and timber. They stay for some days at Long Island. After six weeks in the area, Forster concludes:  Chapter VI. Passage from Dusky Bay to Queen Charlotte's Sound—Function with the Adventure.—Transactions during our stay there.  The voyagers encounter a waterspout. At Queen Charlotte Sound, they are rejoined by the Adventure, and Forster reports on its journey to New Zealand via Tasmania. Again, they make several excursions, including one to another Long Island, where Cook has some seeds planted. Forster comments on the geology and concludes the existence of volcanoes in New Zealand. They trade with natives and invite them on board the ship, and the unmarried women are forced into prostitution by the natives: Forster comments on the moral corruption inflicted upon the natives by the Europeans. The voyagers spend several more days in the areas and converse with the natives, and Cook shows one of them the seed garden on Long Island.  Chapter VII. Run from New Zeeland to O-Taheitee.  The ships pass through Cook Strait and turn to the northeast. Forster reports on consumption of dog meat and on the relatively better health of the crew on board the Resolution as compared to the Adventure.  Chapter VIII. Anchorage in O-Aitepeha harbour, on the lesser peninsula of O-Taheitee.—Account of our stay there.—Removal to Matavai Bay.  Forster describes the arrival in Tahiti: The natives are friendly, and come to the ship unarmed and in large numbers. Forster finds the language very easy to pronounce, and notices that the letter O that many words seem to begin with is just an article. They continue to trade, and an incident of theft is resolved after Cook confiscates a canoe. The Forsters go ashore to collect plants, and the natives help them, but do not sell their hogs, stating these belong to the king. They continue to enjoy the hospitality of the natives and meet a very fat man, who appears to be a leader. Some days later, Cook and his crew are granted an audience with the local chief, attended by 500 natives. Forster reports on the recent political history. They continue to Matavai Bay, where Cook had stayed also during his previous visit to Tahiti.  Chapter IX. Account of our Transactions at Matavaï Bay.  View of Maitavie Bay, Otaheite, by William Hodges, 1776 The voyagers meet King O-Too. An exchange of presents ensues, including several live animals. On excursions the Forsters encounter more hospitality, including a type of refreshing massage. After two weeks, they leave Tahiti, and Forster remarks on the society of Tahiti, which he perceives as more equal than that of England, while still having class distinctions.  Chapter X. Account of our Transactions at the Society Islands.  Forster reports that some seamen have caught venereal diseases from their sexual encounters in Tahiti. They arrive at Huahine, and there is a welcoming ceremony for Cook. On an excursion, Forster and Sparrman notice a woman breastfeeding a puppy; upon inquiry, they find out she lost her child. The interactions with local chief Oree are described. Soon after, on Bora Bora, they shoot some kingfishers, which makes the women unhappy, and the local chief asks them not to kill kingfishers or herons, while allowing them to shoot other species. They discuss the nearby islands with the natives. Forster describes a dance performance. They visit O-Tahà, and Forster describes a feast, the local alcoholic beverages, and another dance performance. = Book II =  Chapter I. Run from the Society Isles to the Friendly Isles, with an Account of our Transactions there.  Fully restocked and with a crew that is healthy except for venereal diseases, the voyagers continue eastwards. Cook discovers Hervey's Isle. They meet the natives at Middelburg Island. Forster criticises related images by Hodges and Sherwin. The natives sing a song for them, a transcription of which is given in the book. Forster comments on the houses and the diet of the inhabitants, and describes their tattoos and ear piercings. As there is little opportunity to trade, they continue to Tongatapu. Here again, the natives are friendly, and Forster sees one of their priests. During daytime, many women prostitute themselves on board the ship, all of them unmarried. Forster describes the natives' boats and their habit to colour their hair with powders. The priest is seen drinking a kava-based intoxicating beverage and shares some with the travellers. Forster compares the Tahitians and the Tongans.  Chapter II. Course from the Friendly Isles to New Zeeland.—Separation from the Adventure.—Second stay in Queen Charlotte's Sound.  The ships sail back to New Zealand, where some natives in Hawke's Bay perform a war dance for them. A storm hinders them from passing west through Cook's Strait, and they have a terrible night, in which most of the beds are under water and the Forsters hear the curses of the sailors \\"and not a single reflection bridled their blasphemous tongues\\". They lose sight of the Adventure, but finally manage to pass through Cook's Strait and return to Queen Charlotte's Sound on South Island. Forster describes various trades and excursions, and comments on the treatment of women: A shipmate buys the head of a victim of a recent fight, and takes it on board, where other natives proceed to eat the cheeks, proving the existence of cannibalism in New Zealand. Forster describes the mixed reactions of the company on board; the most shocked is Mahine, a native of Bora Bora who accompanies them. They take provisions in order to continue their journey, with the \\"hope of completing the circle round the South-Pole in a high latitude during the next inhospitable summer, and of returning to England within the space of eight months.\\"  Chapter III. The second course towards the high southern latitudes from New Zeeland to Easter Island.  Resolution sails south. Forster describes Mahine's reaction to seeing snow for the first time and to life on board. They observe Christmas at the Antarctic Circle, with icebergs often hindering their progress south. Going east and north again, they have finally \\"proved that no large land or continent exists in the South Sea within the temperate zone, and that if it exists at all, we have at least confined it within the antarctic circle.\\" Forster comments on the hardship of the voyage. When they turn south again, they are stopped at 71° 10' south by \\"a solid ice- field of immense extent.\\" They turn north again towards the tropics; many crew are afflicted with scurvy, and the captain with other illnesses, and they sail to Easter Island.  Chapter IV. An Account of Easter Island, and our Stay there.  A View of the Monuments of Easter Island, by William Hodges, 1776 As the voyagers come to Easter Island, the natives provide them with fresh bananas, which are very welcome to the crew that has lacked fresh provisions. Trade with the natives is not very successful, as they do not have much, and sometimes attempt to cheat. The sailors buy sexual favours fairly cheaply. Forster quotes from his father's journal, which describes seeing the moai and meeting the king. Forster closes with the observation by their companion Mahine, \\"the people were good, but the island very bad.\\"  Chapter V. Run from Easter Island to the Marquesas—Stay in Madre-de-Dios harbour on Waitahoo—Course from thence through the Islands to Taheitee.  As they sail slowly northwest towards the Marquesas Islands, many of the crew are sick again, including the captain. Forster's father has his dog killed to provide better food for Cook. When they arrive at the Marquesas, they trade with the natives for food. A native who has attempted to steal is shot dead by one of the officers. Forster describes the inhabitants and finds them overall very similar to those of the Society Islands. They sail to the King George Islands, discover the Palliser Islands, and return to Tahiti.  Chapter VI. An account of our second visit to the island of o-Taheitee.  Forster describes a war fleet of canoes and some of the background of the war. Red feathers are highly valued by the natives, leading to offers of prostitution from higher-ranked women than before. Mahine marries a Tahitian girl, and the ceremony is witnessed by a midshipman, who can't relate any details, and Forster laments the lost opportunity to observe the local customs. Forster describes the recent political and military history of the island. He concludes with a comparison of life in England and in Tahiti.  Chapter VII. The second stay at the Society Islands.  On their way from Tahiti to Huahine, they have a stowaway on board. Arrived at the island, they trade again, and there are various incidents involving theft. They encounter the arioi, a venerated religious order of people who remain childless by killing their newborn. It turns out that Mahine is a member of this order, but he is persuaded not to kill any of his own children. Forster describes more encounters and more of the religion and calendar of the natives.  Chapter VIII. Run from the Society to the Friendly Islands.  As they leave the Society Islands, about half of the crew suffer from venereal diseases. Forster discusses their prevalence and states that there is now proof that they existed before contact with Europeans. They discover Palmerston Island, but do not go ashore. They continue to Savage Island, where they are attacked and retreat. They continue to Nomuka and other of the Friendly Islands, where people are similar to those of Tongatapu, and Forster describes their houses and their trade. The sailors celebrate the second anniversary of their departure by drinking. = Book III = Cook's map of New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, titled Chart of discoveries made in the South Pacific Ocean in his majesty's ship Resolution under the command of Captain Cook. 1774., plate III of Cook's Voyage Towards the South Pole, vol II, 1777 Chapter I. An account of our stay at Mallicollo, and discovery of the New Hebrides.  The voyagers sail in the vicinities of Aurora Island, Lepers Island and Whitsun Island. After seeing the volcano on Ambrym, they turn to Mallicollo, where they engage with the natives. Forster reports their language as different from all South Sea dialects they encountered especially in its use of consonants. The natives are described as intelligent and perceptive, and an account is given of their body modifications and clothing, their food and their drums. As the voyagers sail south, some of the officers suffer from poisoning after eating a red fish. They discover the Shepherd Islands and then Sandwich Island, and continue south to Erromango, where they attempt to land in order to obtain fresh water, but are attacked by the natives. They see the lights of a volcano at night and then anchor close to it at Tanna Island. Chapter II. Account of our stay at Tanna, and departure from the New Hebrides.  The Landing at Tanna, one of the New Hebrides, by William Hodges, 1775–1776 At Tanna, they meet the natives. As a demonstration of might, Cook has a cannon fired. When a man tries to steal the buoy, they fire more shots, without harming the natives. They manage to land and, after giving some presents to the natives and receiving coconuts in return, ask to take some fresh water and wood, which is granted. On the next day, the natives come aboard to trade, and when a man tries to take what he was bartering for without payment, Cook again uses firearms to punish the theft. Many natives gather on the shore in two groups, but Cook scares them away: They stake out an area that the natives should not enter, and have no more trouble with them. Forster describes their hairstyle, bodypaint, and scars as well as their weaponry. Forster and his father make several excursions on the island and learn the names of several nearby islands from the natives. Whenever they approach a certain area, they are stopped by the natives who threaten to eat them. They do not succeed to approach the volcano, but measure temperatures at solfataras and hot springs. A native is shot dead by a marine despite Cook's orders. After 16 days, they depart. Forster comments at length on the island's geography, plants, animals and people. They sail near islands called Irronan and Anattom. Cook names the island group the New Hebrides. They sail north to Espiritu Santo and discover further small islands off its eastern coast. At Espiritu Santo, again the language is different from those previously encountered. Chapter III. Discovery of New Caledonia.—Account of our stay there.—Range along the coast to our departure.—Discovery of Norfolk Island.—Return to New Zeeland. Sailing south, they discover New Caledonia, come in contact with the natives and go ashore. Forster describes the clothes, earrings, and tattoos of the natives. With their help, they find a watering place. William Wales and Cook observe a solar eclipse. Forster observes some native women cooking, but they send him away. Cook's clerk purchases a fish that the Forsters identify as a Tetraodon and warns against the possibility that it might be poisonous, but as Cook claims to have eaten the same fish before, a meal is made of its liver. The liver is so oily that Cook and the Forsters eat very little of it, but still suffer symptoms of poisoning. When natives come aboard and see the fish, they make signs that it is bad and suggest to throw it in the sea. The poisoning makes excursions difficult, and Forster apologises for the lack of interesting content, asking the reader \\"to consider our unhappy situation at that time, when all our corporeal and intellectual faculties were impaired by this virulent poison.\\" They meet an albino native. When the natives observe the travellers eating a large beef bone, they are surprised and assume that this is a sign of cannibalism, as they have never seen large quadrupeds. They depart, and Forster compares the people of New Caledonia with others they have encountered. They continue eastwards along the coast of New Caledonia, aiming for New Zealand, discovering further small islands and catching a dolphin. Sailing south, they discover Norfolk Island. They quickly sail onwards to arrive at Queen Charlotte Sound in New Zealand. Chapter IV. Third and last stay at Queen Charlotte's Sound, in New Zeeland.  Resolution stays in Queen Charlotte's Sound for repairs and restocking. They learn that there has been a battle between natives and some Europeans, with many dead, and are concerned for the Adventure. Forster reports on what they found out later: a boat with 10 people had gone ashore to collect celery and scurvy-grass when natives stole one of their jackets, and the Europeans fired at them until their ammunition was spent and were then killed by the natives. Forster reports on incidences of killings between New Zealanders and Europeans from other journeys. They make further excursions and interact and trade with the natives. Forster comments on their music, with some excerpts in musical notation. Having restocked on fish and antiscorbutics, they depart. Chapter V. The course from New Zeeland to Tierra del Fuego.—Stay at Christmas Harbour.  They sail east towards Tierra del Fuego. They drop anchor in a small cove, 41 days after their departure from New Zealand. They make excursions and meet the natives, which Forster finds extraordinarily wretched. They sail on, around Cape Horn, pass the eastern side of Tierra del Fuego and sail eastwards to the small islands near Staten Islands that Cook calls New Year's Islands. Chapter VI. Stay at the New Year's Islands. Discovery of lands to the southward. Return to the Cape of Good Hope.  Map of South Georgia, from James Cook's report, 1775. Note that North is downwards on the map. Forster describes large seals, called sea-lions. The crew hunt sea-lions and penguins. They sail to the east and discover Willis Islands and claim South Georgia for Great Britain. They sail around South Georgia, proving it to be an island. They continue southward, but are stopped by ice fields, \\"greatly to the satisfaction of all the crew, who were at present thoroughly tired of this dreadful climate\\" They sail east and discover Southern Thule and various other islands that Cook names Sandwich Land. Having exhausted their supply of antiscorbutic sauerkraut, they sail on to the Cape of Good Hope. Chapter VII. Second stay at the Cape of Good Hope.—Run from thence to the Islands of St. Helena and Ascension.  At the Cape of Good Hope, they are restored to full health and hear news from Europe. They go on some excursions while the ship is repaired. A German stowaway is found on board, who is first punished then allowed to stay. They sail on to Saint Helena, where Cook learns of its incorrect description by Hawkesworth, and they are invited by the governor and to a ball. The next stop is Ascension, which Forster finds dreary. They encounter a ship from New York and catch turtles for food. Chapter VIII. Run from Ascension, past the Island of Fernando da Noronha, to the Açores.—Stay at Fayal.—Return to England.  From Ascension, they sail west, coming in sight of Fernando de Noronha and exchanging salutes with forts there. They cross the equator again after two years and nine months in the Southern hemisphere. Their next stop is the Azores, where they anchor at Fayal, and visit the town Horta, where they stay in the house of the deputy consul. Forster proceeds to describe the Azores. They soon continue to England.  Reception and influence  =Contemporary reviews= While it did not sell well, Voyage was well received critically in Britain, with many favourable reviews, some of which gave quotations from both Forster's and Cook's report that demonstrated the superior style of the former. For example, the Critical Review found fault with many mistakes in the engravings in Cook's book and with Cook's inclusion of nautical details, and after presenting lengthy sections where Forster's presentation is superior, concluded \\"We now leave the reader to judge for himself on the merits of each of these performances\\". In the Monthly Review, an author identified by Robert L. Kahn as William Bewley reviewed Voyage in the April and June issues, mostly giving a summary of the Preface in April and of the rest of the voyage in June. The reviewer concludes by \\"acknowledging the pleasure we have received from the perusal of this amusing and well-written journal ; which is rendered every where interesting by the pleasing manner in which the Author relates the various incidents of the voyage in general ; as well as those which occurred to himself, in particular, during his several botanical excursions into the country.\\" In The Lady's Magazine, two anonymous \\"Letters to the Editor\\" are followed by excerpts, first from Forster's Tahiti episode, then from Cook's and Forster's description of the arrival at Middelburg Island. The letter- writer praises the writing of Forster and the engravings in Cook's work, concluding \\"In our opinion it is worth every gentleman's while to purchase both, in order to compare the prints of the one, with the descriptions of the other ; but where one must be rejected, the choice of the reader will fall on Mr. Forster's narrative, whilst those who delight in pretty pictures, will prefer Cook's.\\" =Translations= The book was translated into German by Georg Forster and Rudolf Erich Raspe as . The translation also included some additional material taken from Cook's report. After publication of the German edition, excerpts of which were published in Wieland's influential journal , both Forsters became famous, especially Georg, who was celebrated upon his arrival in Germany. immediately made Georg Forster one of the most widely read writers in Germany. Both Forsters eventually obtained professorships in Germany: Georg started teaching at the Collegium Carolinum in Kassel in 1778 and his father at Halle in 1780. The first German edition sold out in 1782 and was followed by a second edition in 1784, and has become a classic of travel literature, reprinted in many editions. Voyage was also translated into other European languages. Before 1800, translations into French, Russian, and Swedish appeared; additionally, a Spanish translation contained also parts of Cook's official account. =Influence= Georg Forster and his works, especially Voyage, had a great influence on Alexander von Humboldt and his . In the article on Georg Forster in the 9th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Richard Garnett wrote about Voyage, \\"His account of Cook's voyage is almost the first example of the glowing yet faithful description of natural phenomena which has since made a knowledge of them the common property of the educated world, a prelude to Humboldt, as Humboldt to Darwin and Wallace.\\" The book has been studied as one of the sources for Samuel Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which is heavily influenced by reports of Cook's second journey, possibly because William Wales was one of Coleridge's teachers at Christ's Hospital. According to Arnd Bohm, there are \\"details of imagery and wording that suggest Forster as the strongest influence.\\" There has been a large body of literature studying Voyage since the 1950s, including the PhD thesis of Ruth Dawson, which contains the most extensive account of the genesis of the text. The most widely studied part of the work is the content relating to Tahiti. Despite making up less than five percent of the text, almost half of the literature about Voyage has focused exclusively on this part of the journey.  English editions  Other than an unauthorised reprint of both Cook's and Forster's reports that appeared in Dublin in 1777, the book was not reprinted in English for almost two centuries. In 1968, it appeared (edited by Robert L. Kahn) as the first volume of an edition of Forster's collected works, published by the East German Akademie-Verlag. Finally, in 2000 the University of Hawaii Press published an edition by Nicholas Thomas and Oliver Berghof.

Discovery  Each DAZ protein family member was discovered individually, over a period of time by different research groups. BOULE was first identified in Drosophila, with homologs being found in other organisms, from sea anemone to humans, DAZL is thought to have come from BOULE by a gene duplication event and was first discovered in mice, but is present in all vertebrates, and the Y-chromosomal DAZ gene was first found in infertile males, but is also present in apes and Old World monkeys. DAZ arose during primate evolution by (i) transposition (moving) from the autosomal gene to the Y chromosome, (ii) removing unwanted parts of Exons within the transposed gene and (iii) amplification (making multiple copies) of the modified gene.  Mechanism of action  The DAZ family of proteins have multiple mechanisms of action with varying regulatory effects on translation. The proteins exert their action on target mRNAs by binding various 3’-UTR sequences via their conserved RNA recognition motif. DAZL, which binds the GUU sequence of target mRNAs, interacts with poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) to initiate translation. PABPs consequently bind to the poly(A) tails of target mRNAs and cause the 5’ end to fold over, bringing it into close proximity with the 3’ end. This aids the recruitment of ribosomal units and hence the initiation of translation. This is an important function of DAZL as many mRNAs within germ cells have short pol(A)-tails and would therefore not be recruited for translation without the assistance of DAZL. DAZ and DAZL also interact with the translationally repressive RNA Binding Protein PUM2 from the Pumilio RBP family. PUM2 interacts with both the conserved RRM and DAZ regions to form a complex which can interact other mRNAs to regulate their translation. Although the mechanism of this complex is not fully understood, it is thought that due to the inhibitory role of independent PUM2, the combination of both DAZ/DAZL and PUM2 will exert similar repressive effects.  Family characteristics  DAZ family of proteins are mRNA translation regulators with a characteristic recognition motif for binding target mRNAs and a sequence of 24 amino acids that is characteristic to the family, named DAZ repeats. The characteristic structure of the protein family is a single RRM-like RNA- binding domain at the N-terminus (amino terminus) and amino acid repeats in the C-terminus (carboxy terminus). DAZ protein family is one of the few examples of a tissue-specific RNA-binding protein that acts as a developmental regulator. In mice and humans, DAZ protein is non-uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of pre-meiotic germ cells due to its oligomerisation with itself. However, there are currently not relevant data for DAZL and BOULE. None of the family members is found in plants or fungi suggesting the DAZ family is an animal specific family of reproduction genes.  Conservation among species  Expression of DAZ proteins varies between species but is mainly expressed in Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs). One DAZ homologue is expressed in nearly every stage of spermatogenesis, from PGCs to mature spermatozoa. The conservation of DAZ family genes among various species ranging from unicellular organisms to humans indicates their important role in fertility. More precisely, DAZ is only present in higher primates, without any homologues being present in unicellular organisms whereas BOULE is found in species ranging from sea anemones to humans and DAZL is conserved among vertebrates. BOULE was the first gene originating, while DAZ evolved from DAZL during primate evolution resulting in a 90% similarity in humans.  Clinical significance  In humans, 50% of infertility issues are caused by males, and of this, genetic deletions in the Y chromosome make up a lot of this majority, since only men have the Y chromosome. DAZ gene in present on Y chromosome and deletion of this gene has been directly shown as a main cause of infertility. This causes no sperm cell found in semen and it is termed Azoospermia. One DAZ homologue is expressed in nearly every stage of spermatogenesis, from Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) to mature spermatozoa. DAZ is not absolutely required for spermatogenesis as some DAZ deleted men are still able to father children. DAZ pushes ESCs in to germ cells with molecular features of being spermatids. DAZL is expressed in humans from early progenitor germ cell migration, right up to spermatozoa differentiation. Since DAZL is located on an autosome, it has been shown to be important in germ cell development of both oocyte and spermatocytes (in spermatogenesis and oogenesis), albeit in different expression patterns for both.

The Department of Justice says they remain \\"committed to assist training for better prevention, response, and recovery practices involving active shooter incidents\\" and they encourage training for civilians as well as first responders. Although training is currently optional, businesses and organizations are beginning to face citations due to non-compliance with OSHA's guidelines regarding Workplace Violence.Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2017) Enforcement Procedures and Scheduling for Occupational Exposure to Workplace Violence (CPL-02-01-058).

Legal/government requirements  In the United States, OSHA has made recommendations for businesses when it comes to active shooting and the workplace.Occupational Safety and Health Administration (1970) OSHA Act of 1970 General Duty Clause 5(a)(1) (29 USC 654). Washington, D.C. https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact Their guidelines within certain organizations also extend to building securities and facilities structures, as well as properly implemented active shooter preparation training. Lawmakers have also held organizations accountable for not having appropriate training or other protocols in place, citing OSHA's general duty clause. In 2017, the Department of Labor published the new “Enforcement Procedures and Scheduling for Occupational Exposure to Workplace Violence” which provides policy guidance and procedures to be followed when issuing citations related to workplace violence. Given these changes, active shooter response training is quickly becoming a standard across America. Current active shooter training methods range from books to videos to multi-day on- site courses, but not all fall under OSHA's guidelines or judges approvals.  Types of training  Much analysis has been done on the techniques and methods active shooters. In response to the data, some training programs include a focus on medical response for civilians, whereas other training programs place their attention on prevention, self defense, security of the building, escape during the event, psychology or physical escape.United StatesS Department of Homeland Security (2008). “Active Shooter, How to Respond” Washington, D.C. https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/active_shooter_booklet.pdf“Active Shooter: Recommendations and Analysis for Risk Mitigation,” Raymond W.

Training for law enforcement  Many training programs focus on a particular group or groups of people. ALERRT (Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training) in conjunction with CRASE, and FLETC (Federal Law Enforcement Training Center) are examples of Federal- and State-level training, intended to help first responders and federal agents know how to respond to an active shooting. Other local agencies are also joining the fight and instituting their own form of training.Delaware Dept. of Human Resources (2015). “Policy Guidance Subject, Active Shooter” http://www.delaware.govCity of Olympia, WA. “Active Shooter Training Preparation.” http://olympiawa.govSergeant John Suess. “Active Shooter Training: Broward County Sheriff’s Office” Public Safety Commission Broward County, FL 2019  Training for organizations  Active shooter response training should not be confused with speech seminars, continuing education courses, or requesting a visit from local law enforcement. The FBI stresses the importance that training and exercises for citizens include an understanding of the threats faced and also the risks and options available in active shooter incidents. Private programs are available to organizations, businesses, schools (and more) which provide training in how to respond to or prepare for an active shooter. Active shooter response training has become an increasingly demanded service, directly proportional to the increase in active shooting events in the United States, as well as to the continuing changes in laws, litigation, and OSHA requirements. There are unfortunately few active shooter training programs available to the public to match the need, and not all agree on what are the correct methods for addressing the issue. The hope among many is that more training programs will continue to become available, and the FBI urges everyone to receive proper training. The FBI has stated: > Recognizing the increased active shooter threat and the swiftness with which > active shooter incidents unfold, [our] study results support the importance > of training and exercises— not only for law enforcement but also for > citizens...even when law enforcement was present or able to respond within > minutes, civilians often had to make life and death decisions, and > therefore, should be engaged in training and discussions on decisions they > may face.  Training and insurance  FBI study results reveal that as of 2013, 45.6% of incidents occurred in areas of commerce, including those open and closed to pedestrian traffic. The second-largest area for incidents was places of education at 24.4%. From 2013-2018, the trends have remained similar, with more events occurring at places of business. Demand for a new active shooter insurance has increased, with some policies now offering discounts to those organizations who have received prior and qualifying active shooter training. Some schools and organizations are already spending millions on active shooter insurance, as it is becoming a growing necessity.  Controversy  = Risks vs. Benefits = Those who plan training programs determine what should be conveyed in the drills, or if there should be drills at all. In the United States, there has been some controversy over the effectiveness of active shooter training programs. Organizations disagree whether teaching youth to \\"fight\\" the active shooter (as referenced in the Department of Homeland Security \\"Run, Hide, Fight\\" directive) is dangerous or effective.West Virginia Education Association, 2019. Kanawha Students Receiving Controversial New Training To Counter School Shootings. Charleston, WV. https://www.wvea.org/content/kanawha-students-receiving-controversial-new- training-counter-school-shootings While the U.S. Department of Education doesn't recommend that students try to fight an active shooter, the FBI senior executive in charge of its active shooter initiative believes that fighting is often an unfortunate necessity and points out that individuals can at least train to fight. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida raised the question of whether training programs can accidentally yield strategic information to would-be shooters. Like most U.S. states, Florida requires schools to test their plans with drills.United States Government Accountability Office. Report to Congressional Requestors, Emergency Management: Improved Federal Coordination Could Better Assist K-12 Schools Prepare for Emergencies. March 2016. https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675737.pdf The shooter, a former student, may have been familiar with the school's drills and emergency plans regarding active shootings; some alleged that he used the information to increase total casualties. The school had indeed received active shooter training before the actual shooting occurred, and the 2018 shooting in Parkland was the deadliest school place shooting in the United States since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. There is a movement among national teacher organizations to end these drills. One such voice is the Massachusetts Teachers Association labor union. Merrie Najimy, the head of the MTA, said in 2020 that the drills are \\"scary\\" and \\"stressful\\" for students and that \\"lockdown is just a narrow and fear-based view of how to address a serious problem. It doesn't get at the root causes.\\" Some believe the drills and training programs are too traumatic for the students and that the training is more harmful—emotionally and mentally—than beneficial. = Effectiveness & Qualifications = Other controversies arise over the effectiveness of certain programs or the qualifications and tactics used by those teaching them. For instance, some trainers focus solely on the training acronyms and directions, no matter the situation. Others deem this type of training as ineffective and are instead advocating for a scenario-based training protocol. Some training programs are created by police, school resource officers, or SWAT, while others are created by current or former military, Special Operations, psychologists, Federal agents, or more. Some citizens and other professionals express concern that first responders do not have the appropriate credentials to direct an active shooter response training program for civilians.National Active Shooter Preparation and Recovery Administration. Certifying administration for Active Shooter Professionals. https://NASPRA.orgBroward League of Cities and Engage One Broward. (June 4, 2018). The Broward County League of Cities’ School and Community Public Safety Task Force initial report and recommendations. Broward County, FL. Retrieved from http://browardleague.org/wp-cnt/uploads/2018/06/ BLOC_PUBLICSAFETY_TASKFORCE_FINAL_RR_6_2_18_PM1.pdf. The expressed concern is that some first responders are not adequately trained in active shootings and either haven't received, are currently receiving or only recently received their own training through the ALERRT (or like) program--thereby representing inadequate qualifications or experience to be training others. The FBI indicates that some officers and agents are under-experienced and under- educated in how to handle active shootings, even as a first responder. Broward County Sheriff's Office, for example, also received widespread criticism for their handling of the Stoneman Douglas school shooting as first responders. The public outcry was focused on the inadequacies of first responders in addressing active shootings at all. = Certifications (or lack of) = Until 2019 there were no regulating or certifying agencies for the qualifications of active shooter response training directors, trainers, or programs. There has been only one certifying organization--The National Active Shooter Preparation and Recovery Administration--which claims to hold active shooter training professionals to a certain standard. The industry of active shooter response training has gone and can continue to go unregulated, since certification is not mandatory. Even OSHA, with their citations, recommendations, and compliance requirements, does not mandate a certain set of prerequisites for active shooter training directors or trainers. = Lack of Drill Safety = Another area of public critique was seen when Indiana State Teachers Association expressed concern over the event in which their active shooter training from the ALICE program was incorporated with a drill that resulted in teachers being shot with pellet guns, execution style, and also left staff with welts and blood drawn. They have called for a focus on educator and student safety during these trainings and drills, and further requested mental health be added to the House Bill 1004. = Discrimination = Still other controversies stem from the actors used during mock drills and the ways in which the shooter (actor) was presented. In one such incident, a particular nationality and religion was said to have been represented by utilizing certain skin color and costume on the actor playing the active shooter. Some felt this was discriminatory, while others responded that any correlation was unintentional and not meant to be used in a derogatory manor.

Born in London, Morrish attended school in Hampstead, then found work with the Post Office, becoming a technical officer. He joined the Post Office Engineering Union (POEU), and became known as a militant. He was elected to the union's London District Committee, and Sectional Council A. In March 1940, he asked a clerk to show him some confidential material which he was not entitled to see, believing that it contained information the membership should be aware of. His act was discovered, and he was expelled from the union. At the 1941 annual conference, his brother Harry made the case for his reinstatement, but it was voted down by a large majority. However, the following year, the union leadership agreed to readmit him, believing that with the Soviet Union now part of the Allied war effort, militants would no longer cause any problems. In 1944, he was sent to work in the coal mines until the end of the war as \\"Bevin Boy\\". By 1948, Morrish was again a leading figure in the London POEU, and he was one of the organisers of a demonstration for wage increases, against the wishes of the union leadership. He was reminded of his previous expulsion, but a motion at conference for harsher measures against him was defeated. Unable to make progress in the POEU, in 1954 he found a full-time position with the Civil Service Union, rising to become the union's assistant general secretary. He remained there until 1972, when he was appointed as the general secretary of the Customs and Excise Group, which he led into a merger with the Society of Civil and Public Servants. Morrish retired in 1976, and moved to Northamptonshire, and in 1981 he won election as a Labour Party member of Northamptonshire County Council, also serving as the council's deputy leader, and as chair of its education committee. In 1986, he moved back to London and was elected to the Hounslow London Borough Council, becoming vice-chair of its education committee. He served until 1990, when he returned to Northamptonshire, and from 1993 to 1998 served as a co-opted member of the county council's education committee. He was also involved in training school governors, and in 1994 he led the formation of the National Governors' Council, and serving as its first vice- chair. In 1998, Morrish moved to Somerset, representing the county on the National Governors' Council, and acting as a governor of a local school.

It was first assigned to Bryansk Front, then moved to Western Front where it took part in the early stages of the winter counteroffensive northwest of Moscow as part of 16th Army. On December 31 the 1st Guards Rifle Corps was formed for the second time and the 7th Guards was assigned to it as its core formation. It was then sent north to join Northwestern Front and became locked into the dismal fighting around Demyansk until that salient was finally evacuated by the German II Army Corps in February, 1943. Through the rest of that year it participated in battles in the Staraya Russa region, mostly under command of 1st Shock Army, until in January, 1944 it was transferred to the 7th Guards Rifle Corps of 10th Guards Army in the Nevel region. During operations in the Baltic states that summer and autumn the 7th Guards was awarded both a battle honor and the Order of the Red Banner.

Until November 23 the division was engaged in stubborn fighting with the attacking German forces and on that date was defending the line from Gurevo to Drakino with one rifle regiment while the other two regiments were concentrating in the area of Shatovo, Ivankovo and Kalinovo, about 5 km south of Serpukhov. From that date it was boarding trains at the Podolsk station en route to Povarovo station, having been transferred to 16th Army. On November 25 its lead regiment occupied a defensive line from the woods east of Yesipovo and Zhukovo (8 km southeast of Solnechnogorsk) while the remaining units were concentrating, as they disembarked, in an area about 12 km southeast of the same city with the objective of occupying a defensive line from Shelepanovo to Terekhovo to Zhukovo, astride the Leningrad road.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow 1941-1942, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2015, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 3, 5 During the following days the 7th Guards was involved in heavy fighting in the area south of Solnechnogorsk with the German 4th Panzer Group seeking to break out to the southeast. 16th Army faced the heaviest German attacks during November 29-30 as they attacked along the Kamenka-Ozeretskoe road, and along the Leningrad and Istra roads. By the end of November 30 the division, along with the 8th and 9th Guards and 18th Rifle Divisions, was waging a fierce struggle along part of the line from Lyalovo to Alabushevo to Barantsevo to Zhevnevo. During December 2-3 the German forces managed to take Kryukovo after heavy street fighting but were unable to break through 16th Army's lines. The 7th and 8th Guards continued to contest their hold there into the night of December 5 as the German forces began to go over to the defense.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 3 =Winter Counteroffensive= On the evening of December 6 Lt. Gen. Konstantin Rokossovsky, commander of 16th Army, reported to the Western Front command that the Army would go over to the attack at 1000 hours the next day and described his objectives (in part):The German forces put up fierce resistance along the entire front and the division's attack was halted by defensive fire. Despite this the vastly overstretched 4th Panzer Group began to withdraw to the west. The division had more success on December 8, driving two battalions out of Lyalovo which then began to fall back toward Zhilino and Nikolskoe. The next day it was pulled back into the Army reserve in the area of Bolshie Rzhavki, and on December 14 it went into the Reserve of the Supreme High Command.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 2 At the start of January, 1942 the 7th Guards was still in the Reserve, but at the same time the 1st Guards Rifle Corps was being formed for the second time and Colonel Gryaznov was appointed to its command on January 5, being replaced in divisional command by Col. Efim Vasilevich Bedin. The division formed the major unit of the Corps, backed by the 14th, 15th and 52nd Rifle Brigades, 72nd Naval Rifle Brigade, 69th Tank Brigade and the 203rd, 204th and 205th Ski Battalions and was at the disposal of the command of Northwestern Front by February 1.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 18, 26 During January the very successful Toropets–Kholm Offensive by Kalinin Front had deeply outflanked the German II Army Corps to the south of its positions around Demyansk, and Northwestern Front saw the opportunity to encircle and destroy that Corps. Both the 1st and 2nd Guards Rifle Corps were deployed to the region southeast of Lake Ilmen in order to complete the encirclement from the north.Robert Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43: The frozen fortress, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2012, Kindle ed. Battles for Demyansk In the last days of January Northwestern Front's 11th Army created a 32km-wide gap in the German defenses down the Redya Valley. The lead elements of 1st Guards Rifle Corps arrived near Staraya Russa after an approach march of 110km over frozen marsh tracks from Valday. On February 2 the 14th and 15th Rifle Brigades, followed by 7th Guards,Forczyk states the division was \\"reinforced\\", but does not specify in what manner. were ordered to seize a crossing over the Redya at Davidovo. At the same time the command of German 16th Army was scrambling to create several small battlegroups to control key road intersections. Battlegroup Leopold at Davidovo commanded about 900 men from a wide variety of sources, backed by artillery, antitank guns and mortars. On February 3 it repulsed the 15th Brigade with heavy losses. The more experienced 7th Guards soon came up, and 1st Guards Corps managed so slip ski troops behind the German river defenses. On February 5 the Corps launched a concentric attack that nearly overwhelmed Battlegroup Leopold; its survivors were forced to retreat westward. The Corps promptly advanced southeast and liberated the village of Ramushevo on the Lovat River on February 8. This cut the last road into Demyansk and II Corps was now completely dependent on airlift for supplies.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. On February 20 Northwestern Front began a concentric attack with 1st Guards Corps and Group Ksenofontov (primarily the 154th Naval Rifle and 42nd Rifle Brigades of 3rd Shock Army) to complete the encirclement which occurred five days later when the two forces linked up near Zeluchye. Slow movement through the mostly trackless forests and swamps of the region would be characteristic of the remainder of the battles for the pocket. The Front now received orders to crush the encircled grouping within four to five days. 7th Guards, backed by several rifle brigades and ski battalions, began a series of violent attacks on Group Eicke at Zeluchye, which was based on about 4,000 men of the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf. These attacks inflicted about 60 percent casualties on the SS men, but also cost the Soviet forces very heavily. In the end the German forces held the western part of the pocket in late February by the thinnest of margins.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. German plans for the relief of the pocket began almost at once and Operation Brückenschlag began at 0730 hours on March 21. By the end of the month the relief force was still 7km from Ramushevo and 20km from Group Eicke inside the pocket. The spring thaw turned the land to a quagmire and the German advance was reduced to a crawl; it wasn't until April 12 that their leading elements were able to spot Ramushevo in the distance. Two days later a breakout effort, Operation Fallreep began, using a force mostly based on the 32nd Infantry Division to batter a thin wedge through the 7th Guards' positions and advance towards the Lovat. It took another week of fighting for the relief force to capture Ramushevo and the breakout force to clear the east bank of the river, but the linkup was finally made late on April 21. A tenuous ground link less than 4km wide in places was soon established, but II Corps remained dependent in part on airlifted supplies.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. In June the 1st Guards Corps, which now consisted of the 7th Guards and 391st Rifle Divisions, came under command of the 1st Shock ArmyCombat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 121 which held the south side of the Ramushevo corridor. The Corps launched offensives in July, August and September in efforts to link up with 11th Army and cut the lifeline, but 7th Guards played little role in these. On September 27 the 16th Army launched Operation Michael in an attempt to drive back or even destroy the 1st Guards Corps in a salient it held south of the corridor. Supported by artillery and airstrikes the Germans surrounded and overwhelmed one regiment of the division within hours. After a six-day fight the east side of the salient was smashed in, and after a regrouping the west side was struck on October 7. With 1st Shock on the verge of a crushing defeat, the salient was evacuated.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. Later that month the 1st Guards Corps headquarters went into the Reserve of the Supreme High CommandSharp, \\"Red Guards\\", p. 37 and the 7th Guards became a separate division under 1st Shock Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 209 Soviet positions at Demyansk, spring 1943. The 7th Guards was in the 1st Shock Army sector south of the Ramushevo corridor The Soviet forces around Demyansk were intended to play a role in the second Soviet winter offensive, which also included Operation Uranus and Operation Mars, if only to tie down German forces that could be more usefully employed elsewhere. Yet another attack on the corridor began on the night of November 23/24, this time focused on its eastern end, but the division played no major role in it.David M. Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 100-01 On November 27 Colonel Bedin was promoted to the rank of major general. Given that Demyansk had always been partially supplied by air, following the encirclement of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad those air assets were much more required to the south. Too late to make a difference, on January 31, 1943 Hitler authorized the evacuation of the salient.Forczyk, Demyansk 1942-43, Kindle ed. Meanwhile on January 27 General Bedin handed his command to Maj. Gen. Nikolai Pavlovich Anisimov. Bedin would go on to command the 253rd Rifle Division and became a Hero of the Soviet Union in October during the Battle of the Dniepr.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=13173.

In the aftermath of Operation Iskra, which had restored land communications with Leningrad, Marshal Georgy Zhukov planned a further operation, Polyarnaya Zvezda, intended to completely end the siege of that city and destroy Army Group North. Northwestern Front's role in the offensive would once again be the elimination of the Demyansk pocket. At the same time the German command was planning its Operation Ziethen, the phased withdrawal from the salient. 1st Shock Army's part in the offensive was to begin on February 19. It was regrouped westward to attack the south side of the mouth of the corridor and was reinforced with four tank regiments, two artillery divisions, two Guards Mortar divisions, and two aviation corps. The 391st and 7th Guards formed a secondary shock group to launch an attack on a 5km sector from Shotovo to Viazki, with the objective of taking Ramushevo. In the event, nothing went as planned. In mid-month intense cold was replaced by continuous rain with reinforcements and supplies becoming bogged down. Ziethen began on February 17 and immediately began freeing up German troops to form reserves. 1st Shock's attack had to be postponed until February 26 by which time it was facing three German divisions instead of one. The assault troops managed to gain from 1 - 3km with great difficulty, and a further effort the next day was stopped in its tracks.Glantz, After Stalingrad, pp. 415-25 =Operations in 1943= On March 7 General Anisimov traded places with Maj. Gen. Maksim Evseevich Kozyr, commander of the 391st. In May the 7th Guards finally left 1st Shock and moved to the Front reserves where it joined the 14th Guards Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 132 In a final change in command on May 15 Col. Mikhail Emmanulovich Moskalik took over from General Kozyr. Kozyr would go on to become a Hero of the Soviet Union before being killed in action in April, 1945. Moskalik would be promoted to major general on October 16. In July the 14th Guards Corps was briefly assigned to the 34th Army but by the beginning of September the division had been reassigned to the 12th Guards Rifle Corps and was back in the Northwestern Front reserves.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 186, 215 On November 19 Northwestern Front was disbanded and most of its forces, including 12th Guards Corps, came under command of 2nd Baltic Front. The 7th Guards would remain in this Front until March, 1945. 12th Guards Corps was subordinated to 1st Shock Army,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 300 but in January, 1944 the division was reassigned to the 7th Guards Rifle Corps of 10th Guards Army. This Army had been under command of 1st Baltic Front until its transfer, which covered a distance of 210km, began on December 8 and was completed on December 31, 1943.Glantz, Battle for Belorussia, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, p. 691 At this time the 7th Guards Corps was made up of three regular rifle divisions (207th, 208th and 312th) but when the Army went back into action on January 14 these had been replaced by the 7th, 21st and 119th Guards Rifle Divisions.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 11, 38 The 7th Guards would remain under this Corps and Army command for the duration.

It drains into the Sainte-Marguerite River. Location Lake Cacaoui is in the unorganized territory of Lac-Walker, part of the Sept-Rivières Regional County Municipality. The Cacaoui River leaves the west of the lake and runs north through a stretch of rapids into the Sainte-Marguerite River. Little Lake Cacaoui (Petit lac Cacaoui) connects to the main lake at its south end. The lake is at an elevation of . It is about northwest of Sept-Îles. Name The name \\"Cacaoui\\" is a variant of kakawi, the local name of the long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis). According to Placide Vigneau (1842−1926), who wrote about the Mingan Archipelago and Havre-Saint-Pierre, the duck's name should be written as kakawit, and the local people of the Havre-Saint-Pierre region pronounce it as cacaoite. The duck is loquacious, with a musical call that sounds like \\"ah-ah-wè\\", which may be the basis for the name. The name was approved by the Geography Commission in 1945. Dam IOC (Iron Ore Company), a Rio Tinto subsidiary, owns the SM-2 hydroelectric plant on the Sainte- Marguerite River. IOC also owned the wooden dam on the Cacaoui Lake reservoir. This dam was built in 1950. It had fallen into decay and was dismantled in 2010 and replaced with a structure of local rocks to naturally control the water flowing into the western part of the lake. The work was done by the Groupe Nordique, and involved dismantling several buildings and dams, and recovering iron. The rockfill weir is high and long. The reservoir has an area of .

The forest contains small islands of a few hectares of Picea glauca (white spruce) up to high within stands of Picea mariana (black spruce). The spruce is dominated by Abies balsamea (balsam fir), which is well adapted to the cold and damp climate.

The squadron operated mostly outside the United Kingdom since its formation in 1948 until 2006 when it was disbanded. It started out as a field squadron before becoming involved in the GBAD programme, where it operated the Rapier missile system. History No. 16 Squadron RAF Regiment was formed at RAF Watchet in 1948. During the Cyprus crisis of 1963–64, elements of No. 16 Squadron were used to bolster the numbers of 3 Wing RAF Regiment on the island of Cyprus. The squadron also deployed as part of 33 Wing HQ RAF Regiment to Northern Ireland, along with No.s 37 Squadron and 48 Squadron. Their mission was part of Operation Banner and the area they had to secure bordered the Irish Republic. During its tenure at RAF Wildenrath in the 1980s, No. 16 Squadron assumed the airfield defence role from No. 25 Squadron RAF, who had previously operated the Bloodhound missile system. No. 25 Squadron returned to an aircraft role at RAF Leeming operating the Tornado F3 variant. No. 16 Squadon used the Rapier Missile system and operated under No. 4 Wing RAF. Whilst operating out of Germany in May 1988, two unarmed members of the squadron, along with a third serviceman, were shot by terrorist forces in Holland. All were killed outright, with some senior members of the IRA stating that the killings were revenge for the SAS shootings in Gibraltar. Whilst deployed to Iraq in 2003 on Operation Telic, one of the gunner's on the squadron, Duncan Pritchard, was severely injured in a road traffic accident and died after being evacuated back to Britain. In 2005, the squadron was awarded the battle honour of Iraq 2003 by the Queen, though this was without the right to emblazon the honour on their standard. A Defence Review in 2004 removed the airfield defence capability from the RAF Regiment, and along with 15, 26 and 37 Squadrons, No. 16 Squadron was put on notice of disbandment by March 2007. Between the announcement of disbandment in 2004 and its eventual demise in September 2006, the squadron deployed to Kabul and the Falkland Islands.

She worked with the Vicariate of Solidarity, the (FASIC), the , and the Ministry of the Interior's Human Rights Program. She became the human rights director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after Chile's transition to democracy, and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 2018. Early life and education Carmen Hertz was born into a right-wing family in Santiago on 19 June 1945. Her father, Germán Hertz Garcés, was a lawyer of German descent, active in the now-defunct Liberal Party. She spent the first years of her childhood mainly on the family farm in Carrascal (today in the commune Quinta Normal). She attended Andrew Carnegie College, a small elementary school that was near the family home on José Miguel Infante Street in Providencia. In her third year of humanities she entered , where she encountered new points of view. She entered the Law School of the University of Chile, where she initially politically identified with the liberals, gradually moving to the left. In those years as a student, she was José Miguel Insulza's girlfriend. After graduating she approached the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), a party in which she was active for a short time. After the victory of Salvador Allende, on whose electoral campaign she had worked, Hertz decided to join the Communist Party (PC) in the late 1970s.

When her friend Carlos Berger – a lawyer and a communist journalist who had gone to Moscow for a year, and with whom she had maintained an active correspondence – returned to Chile in 1971, they immediately began a romantic relationship. Berger was commissioned to create the first left-wing youth magazine, Ramona. Then, after was appointed Minister of Finance, Hertz became his press secretary in June 1972.

The family left for Chuquicamata in August, and there, Berger took over as director of Radio El Loa and Hertz began working in the mining company's legal department. On 11 September, the day of the coup d'état, Berger was arrested after continuing radio broadcasts although the new authorities had ordered him to cease them. That night he was released, but hours later, the military raided the house and took him away. Berger was subjected to a drumhead court-martial that sentenced him to 60 days in jail for failing to comply with the order to stop transmissions during the day of the coup. On 17 October, Hertz, who was his lawyer, managed to have the remaining days of the sentence commuted to a fine. But the political prisoners who were held at Calama, including Berger, were taken away and brutally killed by members of the so-called Caravan of Death, an operation directed by Sergio Arellano Stark to eliminate political dissidents from the recently established military dictatorship.

Subsequently the bodies were removed by military order and thrown into the sea. Decades later, some bone fragments were found in the ditch, which allowed the identification of 18 of the 26 victims, among them Carlos Berger.

It was mounted by the white paramilitary group the Self-Preservation and Loyalty League (SPLL) in Thibodaux, Louisiana. They were supported by the owners of Great Southern Lumber Company, a giant logging corporation, that hoped to prevent union organization and the Black and White labor organizations from merging. Background =Great Southern Lumber Company= The Great Southern Lumber Company was chartered by the Goodyear family in 1902 to harvest and market the virgin longleaf pine (Pinus palustris L.) forests in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi. Bogalusa, Louisiana was developed from the ground up as a company town and was the location for Great Southern Lumber Company's sawmill, which began operation in 1908. Other company interests included a railroad and paper mill. The company ceased operation in 1938 when the supply of virgin pines was depleted. Bogalusa became the site of a paper mill and chemical operations, followed by other industry. The Great Southern Lumber Company was the largest sawmill in the world from its opening in 1908, until 1938, when it ceased operation. Even though the company had made incredible profits supporting the war effort its workers still only made 30 cents an hour ($ in ). =Racial violence= On August 31, 1919, Black veteran Lucius McCarty was accused of assaulting a white woman and a mob of some 1,500 people seized McCarty and shot him more that 1000 times. The mob then dragged his corpse behind a car through the black neighborhoods before burning his body in a bonfire. =Union organization= Lum William was able to merge a number of Unions into the Central Trades Assembly. They then asked the sawmill for formal recognition in September of 1919. The company fired many of the union organizers and banned company stores, almost all of the stores in Bogalusa, from selling union members goods. The workers went on strike and the company brought in Black strikebreakers from New Orleans. This use of Black, out of town, labours increased racial tension in the town. Attack The Bloody Bogalusa Massacre occurred on November 22, 1919, after years of struggle when workers in the timber industry were trying to organize. That year there had been earlier armed conflicts in town and some 200 black workers were forced out. The sawmill at Bogalusa was the largest complex in the world. To offset labor demands for better wages, the town police arrested black men nightly for minor offences and brought them at gunpoint to be forced labor at the mill. If any were too sick or refused to work, they were beaten. While the International Union of Timber Workers had sections for blacks and whites, four white union men died in this incident while defending Sol Dacus, the head of the black union. It was a highlight of interracial union support. Dacus's house was shot up the night before but he and his family escaped injury in the attack. The next day, he showed up at work, flanked by white workers. The company called out 150 deputies of its large, private militia against unrest. It blew the whistle to signal a riot and attempted to arrest J. P. Bouchillon and Stanley O’Rourke, who were carrying shotguns. While the company claimed the unionists shot first, other eyewitness accounts contradicted them. The white men Bouchillon, O'Rourke, Lem Williams, president of the Central Trades and Labor Council; and carpenter Thomas Gaines were all killed. Two black men were also killed, and the unionization effort suffered. When black workers at the sawmill attempted to organize a labor union, and were gunned down by the largest private army in Louisiana. William H. Sullivan had been appointed by the Goodyear brothers to serve as general manager of the Great Southern Lumber Company. Sullivan was also mayor of Bogalusa. Social order was restored when the Louisiana Governor requested the deployment of federal troops in Bogalusa. Five officers and 100 troops arrived to secure Bogalusa for one month, under the leadership of Major General Henry G. Sharpe. After this period, interracial union cooperation declined with the rise of AFL craft unions, which had segregated locals. In addition, labor organizing was tainted by government fears about communist and socialist activities after World War I. Aftermath This labor action was among several incidents of civil unrest that are now known as the American Red Summer of 1919. Attacks on black communities and white oppression spread to more than three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine race riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the Chicago race riot and Washington D.C. Race Riot, which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.

These three novels are Patan Ni Prabhuta (), Gujarat No Nath () and Rajadhiraj (). Written in chronological order, though having separate stories, the trilogy deals with the Solanki rule in Gujarat. Publication history Munshi published the first part of trilogy, Patan Ni Prabhuta, in 1916 under the pseudonym 'Ghanshyam'. The second part, Gujarat No Nath, and the third part, Rajadhiraj, were published in 1917 and 1922 respectively. Characters The principle characters of the novel are: *Munjalamatya (chief minister) of Patan *Jayasimhathe young king of Patan *MinalRajamata (mother of the king), beloved of Munjal *Kakan adventurous warrior *Manjaria young, modern woman who marries Kak *Kirtideva visionary, Mujal's son Plot Patan Ni Prabhuta, the first of the series, has Asmita (self-consciousness) as its theme. Minaldevi, the mother of the king, craves for power at any cost, while Munjal, the amatya (minister) believes in the people's rule. He is interested in the harmony and integrity of Gujarat. Just to gain power, Minaldevi joins hands with Anandsuri but the people of Patan revolt and depose Minaldevi, who ultimately realizes the greatness of Patan. Gujarat No Nath puts forward the concept of the integrity of entire Āryāvarta. There is a four-year gap between the end of Patan Ni Prabhuta and the beginning of Gujarat No Nath. The political situation of the novel has two contexts: treaty with Avanti and conflict with Sorath. The novel emphasises that national unity is essential to face outside invasion and defend liberty. Just to project this idea, the author introduces the fictional character of Kirtidev. Kirtidev tries to uphold the unity of Patana and Avanti but Munjal opposes this, and the dream of Kirtidev is shattered. Kak also proposes to unite Āryāvarta, but by power. His adventures, designed to fulfill his political ambitions and to win Manjari's heart, cover the major part of the novel and are narrated in a romantic style. Udayan plays the villain and his clash with Kak for the fair hand of Manjari is elaborately described. The aim of the episode is to add passion to a tale of adventure. The importance of Kak is further heightened in Rajadhiraj, the last of the series. Kak departs for Sorath. In the absence of Kak, Revapal revolts in the region of Lata and declares independence, but the army of Patana crushes the revolt. To bring about a union of Lata and Patana, Kak arranges the marriage of Mrinalkumvariba, the princess of Lata, with Maharaj Jaidev, but fails to establish peace. He struggles hard to win over the disgruntled soldiers of Lata and at last becomes successful. Reception and criticism The trilogy became famous, and with its publication, Munshi became a household name in Gujarat. N. D. Jotwani translated Gujarat No Nath, the second part of the trilogy, into English in 1995. It was titled The Master of Gujarat: A Historical Novel. The trilogy has been co-translated by Rita Kothari and her husband Abhijit Kothari: Patan Ni Prabhuta as The Glory of Patan (2017), Gujarat No Nath as The Lord and Master of Gujarat (2018) and Rajadhiraj as The King of Kings (2019). Writers Radheshyam Sharma and Raghuveer Chaudhari note in their book Gujarati Navalkatha (Gujarati novel): \\"one cannot deny the allure of the aesthetic pleasure that Munshi has created by delightfully delineating the wrestling of the brawn with the brain in Patan Ni Prabhuta, Gujarat No Nath and Rajadhiraj. It is constantly felt that writer's powerful personality has a hold over the story-line.\\". Manubhai Pancholi, a Gujarati writer, accused Munshi of being unfaithful to history, and said that \\"In Gujarat No Nath, Rajadhiraj, and Patan Ni Prabhuta, he [Munshi] has twisted and distorted historical facts\\". Critic Dhirendra Mehta also noted that, though there are references to Munjal and Kak in the history of Gujarat, they are quite transformed in the narrative. He felt that the character of Kak is overly glorified in the novel and treated as a hero, while Siddharaja Jayasimha, who according to him, was a respectable king of Gujarat, loses his grace. According to Mehta, Munshi does not go strictly by historical facts; his aim is to make the story interesting. He adds that chronological and geographical details often lack accuracy. He praised the trilogy for the conflict and dramatisation of situations, individuality of characters, short and sparkling dialogues, and picturesque narration.

During the early 20th century, Snyder led the campaign that earned New York women the right to vote. Besides her positive impact to the women's rights movement, Snyder was an academic who focused on the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. British philosopher John Henry Muirhead called Snyder a \\"pioneer in the sympathetic re-examination of these manuscripts\\".  Early life and education  Snyder was born to a Congregational minister, Peter Miles Snyder, from Connecticut and grew up in Rockford, Illinois. Her mother, Grace Evelyn (Bliss) Snyder, was a pianist and mathematics teacher. Her brother Franklyn Bliss Snyder became the 18th President of Northwestern University and her other brother, Edward D. Snyder, became an Associate Professor of English at Haverford College. Her family moved to Rockford, Illinois, where Snyder graduated from Rockford Central High School in 1905. She decided to attend Vassar College, her mother's alma mater, and eventually earned an A.B. in 1909. Upon her graduation, she was bestowed a graduate fellowship for English. She was offered a fellowship in English at Vassar, so she remained there until 1911 when she graduated with her A.M. degree. In 1914, after working as an instructor in English at Vassar, she became an assistant in rhetoric at the University of Michigan. Snyder graduated with a PhD from the University of Michigan.  Career  Snyder returned to Vassar College as an English professor in 1915 and was acting as chairman of the Poughkeepsie Woman Suffrage Party in 1916. During her only term as chairman, she led the campaign that earned New York women the right to vote. She also led a suffragist club at Vassar. The following year, she was elected president, replacing Laura J. Wylie. By 1918, Snyder stepped down as campus editor of the Vassar Quarterly and continued her activism within the Woman's Defence Committee and the Poughkeepsie Women's City Club. In 1920, she was promoted to assistant professor in the English department and five years later, became an Associate professor. In 1921, as an assistant professor in the English department, Snyder, Wylie, and Amy Reed submitted a report to the entire department that emphasized democratic organization and budget cuts. In the year following her promotion, she took a leave of absence. In 1929, Snyder published Coleridge on Logic and Learning which focused on the lesser known manuscripts of poet S. T. Coleridge. In 1930, she was promoted to Full Professor. In 1935, she published S. T. Coleridge's Treatise On Method. For her work on the poet, British philosopher John Henry Muirhead called Snyder a \\"pioneer in the sympathetic re-examination of these manuscripts\\". She took a leave of absence from the college in 1940 for one year. During this leave, she did further research on Coleridge in the Huntington Library, Pasadena. She returned to Vassar in 1941, where she was subsequently elected chairman of the English Department. She was active in the American Labor Party, Modern Language Association, Modern Humanities Research Association, and National Council for American-Soviet Friendship.  Death and legacy  After her death from a heart attack in February 1943, a fund was created in her name. The year after her death, in 1944, $2,500 was raised. She was succeeded as professor in the English faculty by Edgar Johnson and Helen E. Sandison.

Marion County prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith defeated state senator Virginia Blankenbaker for the Republican nomination. Before the primary, Goldsmith had secured the nomination of the county Republican caucus. Blankenbaker unsuccessfully sought to win by attracting crossover votes by Democrats. General election On education, Goldsmith was a supporter of school choice, increased parental involvement in education, and an opponent of court ordered desegregation busing. Mahern similarly supported school choice and argued for the need to reestablish neighborhood schools. Both candidates supported completing the construction of the Circle Centre mall. Goldsmith, however, promised not to spend any more public funds on it. On crime, both candidates supported community policing. Mahern supported implementing a waiting period for the purchase of guns. Both candidates argued that the city needed to undertake infrastructure improvements. Both candidates opposed raising property taxes to fund such improvements. Mahern was supportive of an increase in the city's sewer tax, and sought to create a commuter tax. Goldsmith was open to increasing user fees to pay for infrastructure expenditures. The two candidates disagreed on the expense of infrastructure demands. Mahern endorsed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce's report on infrastructure, while Goldsmith contended that between $100 and 200 million could be cut from the report's $1.1 billion cost estimate. Both candidates proposed selling municipal assets in order to raise funds. Less than half of the city's 417,000 eligible voters participated in the election. Mahern lost a significant share of the traditionally-Democratic Catholic vote, which some experts attributed to his stance on abortion. Mahern received strong support from African American voters. Goldsmith overwhelming won the city's outlying, primarily white, precincts.

History  This spring was originally known as Valenzuela Spring until about 1950. It was subsequently named for Joaquin Murrieta, a Sonoran bandit in California during the California Gold Rush who used this region as a rendezvous and hideout from around 1850 to the time of his alleged death nearby at Murrieta Spring on July 25, 1853. This name change was an error, in that Joaquin Murrieta was only one of the five accused leaders of the Five Joaquins Gang, named Joaquin that could be found there.Frank F. Latta, JOAQUIN MURRIETA AND HIS HORSE GANGS, Bear State Books, Santa Cruz, California. 1980. The one leader most responsible for the Gang in the vicinity of the spring was Joaquin Valenzuela one of Joaquin Murrieta's cousins. It was he who organized the gathering and drives of the Gangs stolen and wild horses to Sonora from their nearby rancho and hideout on Cantua Creek. Among other uses for Joaquin Rocks, the Valenzuela band of the Gang would post lookouts on the Rocks to observe the valley below and probably got the water for their camp there, at that spring. It may have been the memory and stories told of him among the surviving gang members of Valenzuela's band and mesteñeros that sold their horses to the Gang, who lived and worked long afterward on the ranches of the San Joaquin Valley and in the Diablo Range that gave the spring its original name.

She has been a member of the German Bundestag since the 18th general election, having won the direct mandate in the constituency of Delmenhorst – Wesermarsch – Oldenburg-Land in both the 2013 and 2017 general elections. She was already a directly elected member of the German Bundestag from 2009 to 2010, and from April 2010 until her resignation in December of the same year, State Minister for Food, Agriculture, Consumer Protection and Regional Development of Lower Saxony.  Early life and career  Schober was born in Cologne and grew up in Brühl (Rhineland), where she graduated from the Erzbischöfliches St. Ursula-Gymnasium in 1984. From 1984 to 1990, she studied food and nutrition science at the University of Bonn and graduated as a certified ecotrophologist. She was the first in her family to graduate from university. During her apprenticeship she worked (partly as an intern) in the food industry, the bakery and butcher trade, in canteen kitchens, in retirement homes and in agriculture. In 1990, she joined the then-family business of her in-laws, Germany's second largest turkey hatchery Ahlhorn, and in 2001 she took over the management together with her husband Garlich Grotelüschen.Für den Absatz: Biographie beim Deutschen Bundestag; Nils Klawitter: Tierquälerei-Verdacht.

Political career  Grotelüschen has been a member of the CDU since 2000 and deputy district chairman of her party in Oldenburg-Land since 2001. Since 2001, she has been a member of the municipal council of Großenkneten and has served as group leader since 2006; she is also a member of the district council of the administrative district Oldenburg since 2006. In the 2009 general election, Grotelüschen won the constituency Delmenhorst - Wesermarsch - Oldenburg-Land in Lower Saxony with 35.3% of the first votes and thus directly entered the Bundestag. She was able to prevail against Holger Ortel (SPD), who had won the constituency before, and now entered the Bundestag via the state list. The SPD had previously won the constituency for nearly thirty years.Ute Winsemann: Astrid Grotelüschen zum zweiten Mal dabei. In: Weser- Kurier.de, 23 September 2013.

Landtag stimmt Kabinettsumbildung zu. In: Mein-Niedersachsen.de, 27 April 2010. She left the Bundestag, and was replaced by Ewa Klamt. On December 17, 2010, she resigned from her ministerial office. In the general election on 22 September 2013, Grotelüschen reappeared in her former constituency, prevailed narrowly with less than 700 votes ahead and thus entered the 18th German Bundestag, which she has been a member of since its formation in mid-October 2013. In the 18th legislative term from, Grotelüschen chaired the Subcommittee on Regional Economic Policy and ERP Business Plans from 2014 until 2017. In the 2017 elections, Grotelüschen won the constituency for the third time in a row with 34.1% and a lead of 2063 first votes. She has since been serving on the Committee on Economic Affairs and Energy. In April 2020, Grotelüschen announced that she would not stand in the 2021 federal elections but instead resign from active politics by the end of the parliamentary term.Michael Korn (April 10, 2020), Astrid Grotelüschen will nicht wieder für Bundestag kandidieren Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung.

The species is uncommon in nature but is saprotrophic in nature and been discovered on decaying plant matter, particularly wood. This fungus is naturally found in the Netherlands and has successfully been cultured in lab. It is a teleomorph of the ascomycota division and possesses brown spores. History and taxonomy Capronia mansonii is a type of black yeast that was first discovered from an isolated strain in 1968. The fungus was originally described from a strain in vitro found in Norway by Schol- Schwarz on an aspen tree, and it has not yet been described in situ. This fungus was the first species in Herpotrichiellaceae discovered to create ascomata in an isolated culture. It is one of the only five species out of thirty Capronia species that has successfully produced ascomata in vitro. The basionym for this species is Dictyotrichiella mansonii. Its anamorph is thought to be Exophiala mansonii but uncertainty and discourse remains. The original anamorph was first thought to be Rhinocladiella atrovirens and then Exophiala castellanii An analysis of rRNA gene sequences concluded that C. mansonii is the same biological species as E. castellanii. Capronia mansonii is often misidentified as its sister species Capronia munkii but can be differentiated by its larger and thicker cell walls and more frequent ascospores that transversely septate. It is also differentiated from its anamorph because it lacks conidia, slimy colonies, and aerial hyphae. Growth and morphology This fungus is a teleomorph or sexual form that is formed in vitro. This species has yet to be described in situ. The fungus is thought to be closely related to Exophiala dermatitidis, and is often hypothesized in literature to be the teleomorph of E. dermatitidis. The fungus is a part of the ascomycota phylum, also commonly defined as sac fungi. This phylum is often defined by its possession of asci, a microscope sexual structure that produces non-motile spores called ascospores. The asci of C. mansonii produce 8 ascospores upon germination. These ascospores begin with a glassy transparent appearance and then progress to a more grey-yellow, olive, and finally brown colour. These ascospores have 4–5 transverse thick-walled septa and 1 incomplete longitudinal septum. The spores have been described in literature as not tight at the septa. Juvenile asci have thicker, longer, and more lightly coloured ascus walls whereas as fully matured asci form thinner dark brown walls that are filled with ascospores. The ascomatal wall itself can range from a brown-yellow to a light brown colour which is commonly seen in other black yeasts. Physiology and reproduction This mesophilic fungus has been successfully cultured by Untereiner at room temperature ranging from 20–25 °C. C. mansonii has also been observed in a yeast budding form. This fungus has a homothallic breeding system indicating that it does not need a partner to sexually reproduce. The ascospores of this fungus have been described to germinate within 12 hours on Oatmeal Agar. They appear slimy and resemble yeast within 48 hours, reaching full maturity at 16 weeks. The ascomata that have been grown in lab have been shown to fully mature and develop septae but are unable to produce asci and ascospores. Artificial daylight is thought to be the limiting factor that prevents the production of asci. Further replications of the above experiments revealed that the structure formed may actually be a pseudothecium, an ascocarp that resembles a ascocarp but whose asci do not organize into a hymenium. The pseudothecia grew in abundance and also failed to produce ascospores. Habitat and ecology Members of the Capronia family are described as saprotrophic meaning they get their nutrients from decaying matter. Strains of this fungus have been found on various plant hosts, particularly on their leaves. They are regularly found on other decaying ascomycota and basidiomycota in the Netherlands, particularly on the wood of Populus tremula. The holotype was discovered on the stems of a Lupinus polyphyllus by Schol-Schwarz in 1968. This fungus has occasionally been found on fresh sausages consisting of pork, beef, or mixed meats. They remain unstable on meat and are unable to persist for more than three days in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria.

It was firstly introduced by Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem, a French botanist, and was the type species of the genus Ascodesmis. It is an uncommon species but its development of the fruit body has been the subject of much laboratory study due to the easy nature of its cultivation. Ascodesmis nigricans is not pathogenic to human, animals or plants. This species has world-wide distribution. History and taxonomy Ascodesmis nigricans is firstly introduced in by Philippe Édouard Léon Van Tieghem in France in 1876 as a representative type species of genus Ascodesmis. The genus Ascodesmis belonged to discomycetes which is characterized by species contained disc-shaped ascocarps called apothecia. \\"Ascodesmis\\" was given as the genus name because of all the species that under it have a fruit body which only contained an exposed bundle of asci. The growth and development of Ascodesmis nigricans were further studied by van Tieghem. In 1905, Peter Claussen published a paper on Ascodesmis nigricans, giving a detailed description of the morphology of A. nigricans, but he mistakenly regarded this fungus as Boudiera, a new species of that genus. This error was corrected soon after the publication, by Fridiano Cavara an Italian botanist who had published his observation and record of A. nigricans grew on human feces. The etymology of the species epithet of A. nigricans refers to the Latin \\"nigricans\\", meaning black in color. Ascomata and ascospores of Ascodesmis nigricans Morphology and ultrastructure The mycelium of A. nigricans consisted of hyaline cylindrical hyphae that do not produce conidia and spermatia. Apothecium, the cup-shaped fruit body of A. nigricans, could be alone or gregarious and its small size make this species difficult to be collected frequently from the natural environment. However, the structure of apothecium would be observed clearly when it grows on artificial media. It consists of exposed hymenium which contains several unprotected asci surrounding with abundant unbranched paraphyses. Apothecium also contained hypothecium which formed by thin-walled hyphae and without excipulum. The tiny apothecium is hemispherical and flattens as aging. The clavate asci which contain ascospores are produced by the ascogenous hyphae with the broad base or a short broad stalk. Only a cluster of asci would be formed in a mature apothecium, and as the asci successfully mature, the asci shrink to a short stipe and give rise to a large attached operculum. Randomly arranged ascospores that set in the upper area of asci would be discharged through operculum at the asci tip. The ultrastructure of ascospores of A. nigricans was investigated to have a deeper understanding of the formation of wall layers and ornamentation of ascospores. The invagination of the plasma membrane of ascus generates the two unit membranes that consist of the ascus vesicle. Then partially invaginated ascus vesicle form the delimiting membranes for ascospore which also consist of two unit membranes with close space between them. Subsequently, a primary and secondary wall of ascospore would be formed. The inner delimiting membrane became the primary wall with a consistent structure and no ornamentation. The ascospores would become more spherical as the completion of the primary wall. As soon as the primary wall is formed, the wall material deposited in the original space between two delimiting membranes gives rise to an extra wall layer which is known as the secondary wall. The randomly arranged wall material develops ornamentation for mature ascospores. During the formation of the secondary wall, the primary wall differentiates into two layers, inner endospore, and outer epispore. Growth and reproduction Ascodesmis nigricans is a homothallic fungus. The formation of apothecium begins with the lateral hyphae which then branch dichotomously and form T-shaped gametangial initials. After the germination, these initial organs lengthen and coil helically to form exposed gametangia. Then multinucleate hyphae give rise to archicarps, which would develop to ascogonia eventually, and antheridia of A. nigricans. Each archicarps consist of an oogonium which contains approximately 6 nuclei and a trichogyne which contain two nuclei normally. The nuclei of trichogyne disintegrate later. When the communication between oogonia and antheridia is established, male and female nuclei fuse together in pairs in oogonium. In the nuclear fusion process, the nuclear content mix together after the dissolution of the membranes of each nucleus, and larger nuclei would be produced as the final product of this nuclear fusion. Following nuclear fusion, the oogonium expands and about three ascogenous hyphae would develop from it and give rise to asci which then produce ascospores. Ascodesmis nigricans is easily to grow on artificial media within a proper temperature range, which is around 24°C. Also, light is not necessary for either formation or maturation of the ascospores. Habitat and distribution As a coprophilous fungus, A. nigricans is commonly isolated from the dung of both omnivorous and herbivore animals, such as dogs, goat, sheep, rat, donkey, pig, fox and ostrich. It also was found from the soil contaminated by dung. Basically, A. nigricans is a cosmopolitan species. Its distributions cover France, India, Italy, Portugal, Canada, U.S.A., England, Denmark, Sweden. In addition to this, it was found in Asia, Africa, Australia occasionally.

He was, for nearly 30 years, arts editor of The Scotsman newspaper, and was regarded as a champion of young critics. Wright first began to review at the annual Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1957 and today, the young writers' award at the Fringe is named the Allen Wright Award in his honour, having been established in 1998. He was 'arguably Scotland's most respected arts journalist' of the era and a 'major figure in the Scottish cultural scene'. Career Wright worked his entire life at The Scotsman. He joined the paper straight from school as a 'tube boy', a messenger who delivered editorial copy via a vacuum tube system. He graduated to reporting, with film reviewing as a sideline, then became drama critic in succession to Ronald Mavor and deputy news editor. In 1964, the paper's editor Alastair Dunnet made him the Scotsman's first arts editor. He continued in much the same way under Dunnett's successor, Eric Mackay, but he found some of the demands of later editors harder to comply with. Nevertheless, he remained in the role until suffering a stroke in 1993. In the early years of his time with the Scotsman, the paper attempted to review every production at the Fringe. The then deputy editor of the Scotsman, Arnold Kemp, considered Allen's organisation of the paper's Fringe coverage his greatest single achievement. Wright was not an admirer of all aspects of the contemporary theatre of the day, especially what he regarded as 'cultish' productions. For example, he found an all-male production of Hamlet by Glasgow's Citizens' Theatre distasteful. However, his reviews were commended for being 'clear, informative, and judicious' and he was 'able to acknowledge his blind spots... and sought to neutralise them'. John Fowler of rival newspaper The Herald referred to him as 'a man of grace and sterling worth'. He enjoyed whisky and golf. Death In 1993, he was incapacitated by a stroke, shortly after returning from a holiday in France after that year's Fringe. This left him in a wheelchair and unable to converse. He died on 16 November 1997, survived by his wife Eleanor and three grandchildren.

The wasp normally stings and paralyzes an Ephippiger or related orthopteran prey, and brings it back to its burrow; it leaves the prey item near the entrance, enters the burrow, lays an egg, and then drags the prey item into the burrow where the egg can hatch nearby and the wasp larva can feed. If the prey item is moved while the wasp is in the nest, it will exit, become confused, then grab and reposition the prey near the entrance, and re-enter the nest; if the prey is moved again before the wasp re-emerges, it will continue the process indefinitely.

Biography  He was a member of a large family of painters. His father Josef František Adolf (around 1685–1762) worked as court painter of the Mikulov Ditrichštejn and Milotice Serényi aristocratic families. However, the best-known of the whole family was Karl Josef's younger brother, František Adolf of Freenthal (1721–1773). Karel Josef was born during his father's stay at the Milotice chateau, probably on September 4, 1715 since we know he was baptized that day. We know nothing about the education of young Adolf, we can only assume that he received his first painting training from his father and that perhaps as his younger brother he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. He then served as a valet and court painter for three Olomouc bishops: for Ferdinand Troyer between years 1745 and 1758, for Leopold Egkh between years 1758 and 1760 and for Maximilian of Hamilton between years 1760 and 1776. He was considered a skilled painter of hunting still lifes and paintings with animal motifs, some of which are still displayed in the picture gallery of the Kroměříž Castle. His is known for his paintings with allegorical themes, for portraits and decorative paintings. At the Episcopal Court, he was recognized as an art connoisseur. He served as an artistic adviser and was in charge of an extensive episcopal collection of paintings. He also worked as a restorer in the episcopal gallery. Other nobles engaged him as a restorer as well. References  Other Sources  * ČOUPEK, Milan. Několik poznámek k životopisu malířské rodiny Adolfů (Adolph).

Edward James Townsend, a Church of England clergyman, whose parish was first Rawmarsh and then Ilmington near Stratford-on-Avon. Frederick was educated at Harrow and went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a BA in 1850 and then an MA in 1855. He was a respected amateur botanist and was elected a Fellow of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1846 and as a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1878. After living in Hampshire for several years he published the \\"Flora of Hampshire\\" in 1883. He was a friend to fellow botanists Cardale Babington and William Williamson Newbould. He was especially close to Newbould until his death in 1886.  Parliamentary career  Townsend entered Parliament as MP for Stratford-on- Avon as a result of the 1886 general election in which the Conservative Marquess of Salisbury became Prime Minister, ousting the Liberal leader, William Gladstone. He defeated the incumbent Liberal MP, Lord William Compton, with a majority of 489 votes. The constituency has only once elected a non- Conservative candidate since then. His first recorded contribution in the House of Commons was on the 7 May 1888 and was in regards to the Excise Duties (Local Purposes) Bill; he asked the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Goschen, whether a steam ploughing engine which was only used for agricultural purposes, and thus only travelled by road from the owner's home to their field or from field to field, would be exempt from the £5 duty on locomotives. Townsend did not stand for re-election in the 1892 general election and so was succeeded by fellow Conservative Algernon Freeman-Mitford.  Personal life  Honington Hall In 1863 he married Mary Elizabeth Butler. As a result of the death of his uncle in 1874, Rev. H. Townsend, he inherited the family estate, Honington Hall, Warwickshire. He died on the 16 December 1905 in Cimiez, Nice.

He was noted for his Afrocentric Catholic Masses, his ebullient style and for his writing. LeDoux was featured in a documentary film about St. Augustine Church in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Although well-known, he was active primarily in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. Early life and education LeDoux was born on February 26, 1930, in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Pursuing a religious education and following the path of his older brother Louis Verlin, he attended high school at St. Augustine's Seminary in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, graduating in 1947. There, his education consisted of music and the classics such as Greek, Latin, and French, in addition to religious instruction. He then completed a two-year novitiate in the seminary for the Society of the Divine Word in Techny, Illinois. LeDoux attended college for two years at Divine Word Seminary in Epworth, Iowa, before completing his college education at St. Augustine's Seminary in 1953. He remained at St. Augustine's Seminary for four more years to complete his theology studies. In the time period of the 1940s and 1950s, Jim Crow laws limited religious educations for African-Americans in the southern United States, and St. Augustine's Seminary served to train African- American men in the religious life and priesthood. Following an additional four years studying theology at St. Augustine's Seminary, LeDoux was ordained as a member of the Society of the Divine Word. Subsequent to his ordination, LeDoux pursued graduate studies at the Gregorian University in Rome, Italy. There, he earned a masters degree in theology and a doctorate in canon law, completing these in 1961. Religious career On completion of his graduate studies, LeDoux assumed a teaching position at St. Augustine's Seminary where he taught theology and canon law from 1961 to 1967. He then became a faculty member at Xavier University of Louisiana, teaching theology, from 1969 to 1980. Beginning in 1981, LeDoux held a series of ministries as pastor, beginning with St. Martin de Porres Church in Prairie View, Texas, where he served from 1981-1984. He then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he was pastor of St. Paul the Apostle Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from 1984 to 1988. LeDoux was pastor of St. Augustine Church in New Orleans, for his longest tenure, from 1990 to 2006. He then was pastor of Our Mother of Mercy Church in Fort Worth, Texas, from 2006 to 2015. LeDoux's ebullient style became manifest during his ministry in New Orleans. He donned colorful vestments during the Mass, danced in the aisles and rode a donkey to the church on Palm Sunday. He sometimes included jazz, African drumming and dancing, Mardi Gras Indian chants, and second line parades in Masses that he ministered. Out of respect for African-American history, LeDoux sometimes wore the regalia of the Buffalo soldiers. In 2005, the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper wrote, \\"But besides the rich history of St. Augustine, the church's real draw is the weekly sermon and golden voice of LeDoux.\\" LeDoux was known colloquially as \\"the people's priest\\" in the New Orleans region. On August 29, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, LeDoux opted to remain at St. Augustine Church rather than evacuate the city. Stranded at the church for eight days and being a vegan, he survived on a diet of pasta and marinara sauce, while taking in people who had lost their homes in the hurricane. Within six months following the hurricane, the archbishop of New Orleans decided to close St. Augustine Church. The congregation under LeDoux's leadership vehemently and publicly challenged this decision, for which the archbishop dismissed LeDoux as pastor. In 2011, LeDoux authored a book, War of the Pews: A Personal Account of St. Augustine Church in New Orleans, documenting the difficulties faced by St. Augustine Church in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans, with the general trend in declining church attendance. The book's title relates to the early years of St. Augustine Church when pew fees were a common practice. Beginning in 1969, LeDoux wrote a weekly column \\"Reflections on Life\\" which was syndicated in the Louisiana Weekly, the Seacoast Echo, the Long Beach Times, the Opelousas Daily World and the New St. Pete Bulletin, in addition to publication in various Catholic weeklies over the years he wrote this column. In a 2018 magazine interview, LeDoux pointed to the unifying influence that music can have especially in New Orleans with its ethnic diversity. He contrasted the impact of music with racial identity which he said can be inaccurate in contemporary society, in which racial terms can separate people rather than unify them. LeDoux died of heart disease at Lafayette General Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana, on January 7, 2019. At the time of his death, he was in pastoral residence at Holy Ghost Church in Opelousas, Louisiana. He is buried at the cemetery at St. Augustine's Seminary. =Tomb of the Unknown Slave= Tomb of the Unknown Slave With several parishioners at St. Augustine Church, LeDoux conceived of the idea of a Tomb of the Unknown Slave. With the efforts of the church handyman and other interested people, the shrine was constructed and installed in a garden plot at St. Augustine Church, completed by 2005. The shrine consists of heavy chains and iron shackles in the shape of a cross, weighing approximately 1500 pounds. It includes a plaque mounted on the wall of the church. The church property was the site of an archeological dig to the Claude Tremé Plantation House, and the shrine marks graves of unknown slaves from the area. Recognition In 2007, St. Augustine Church honored LeDoux with a Golden Jubilee. Events in the jubilee celebration included a \\"jazz mass\\", with jazz musicians such as the Tremé Brass Band, Trombone Shorty, and the St. Augustine Soulful Voices Choir. Then New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin declared a \\"Fr. Jerome LeDoux Day\\" for the city in 2007. Around the same time, the New Orleans City Council acknowledged the contributions of St. Augustine Church to the musical heritage of the city, which LeDoux nurtured as part of his St. Augustine ministry. As part of the 2007 recognition, New Orleans artist Richard Thomas painted a poster honoring LeDoux, with proceeds of its sale as prints benefiting LeDoux's church. Also in 2007, filmmaker Peter Entell produced a documentary film \\"Shake the Devil Off\\" about St. Augustine church and its efforts to remain open as a parish church in the time following Hurricane Katrina, made in a cinéma vérité style and featuring LeDoux as he conducts daily church business. As part of the incident, Entell highlighted the dismissal of LeDoux and his replacement by a caucasian priest in this predominately African-American parish. In the film, Entell claimed that racism played a role in the decision of the local archdiocese. The name of the film is also the name of a gospel song which is sung by LeDoux and parishioners in the film. References External links *An example of a gospel mass with Fr.

History  In 1953, van Fleet left Korea after leading the UN, US, and South Korean forces as a commander in the US Eighth Army division.Robert B. Bruce, \\"Tethered Eagle: Lt. Gen. James A. Van Fleet and the Quest for Military Victory in the Korean War, April--June 1951,\\" Army History, no. 82 (2012): 6--29. The general made inroads with his Korean counterparts and the bonds created through the war formed a strong desire to further the partnership. At his departure, Van Fleet said, \\"I shall come back. You have made me a part of you. I know you are a part of me. I shall not ask you to give me back my heart. I leave it with you.\\" Upon his return to the US, Van Fleet commenced a campaign to raise funds to facilitate reconstruction efforts and aid support for the people of Korea. Following his position during the war, Van Fleet occupied the position of chairman to the American-Korean Foundation (AFK) in the 1950s.Carlo W. D'Este, \\"The Will to Win: The Life of General James A. Van Fleet,\\" The Journal of Military History 66, no. 2 (2002): 618. Van Fleet was successful in facilitating a fund drive aimed at humanitarian efforts for the Korean people in need of aid. This success led to other aspirations in using his relationships and position to further cooperation between the United States and the people of Korea.James K. Van Fleet, Power with People, 1970. In this effort, he sought the input of leaders such as Arthur Hays Sulzberger of The New York Times, Henry Luce of Time-Life, Spyros P. Skouras of 20th Century Fox, William Randolph Jr. Van Fleet also sought the involvement of William Zeckendorf, a real estate developer, Juilliard President, William Schuman, and Ben C. Lim, the first Korean Ambassador to the UN. The Korea Society set up its first operation center at 420 Lexington Avenue with a vision of a non-sectarian, non- political, and non-profit agenda aimed at strengthening the existing United States and Republic of Korea alliance.James H. Toner, \\"American Society and the American Way of War: Korea and Beyond,\\" Parameters 11, no. 1 (1981): 79. The organization received its first boost and acknowledgment from President Eisenhower through a government endorsement. Since its inception in the 1950s, the organization has progressively followed subsequent alignments following bilateral relations between the US and Korea.James I. Matray, Building a Beacon: The United States and the Republic of Korea (Blackwell Publishing Ltd Oxford, UK, 2009). The vision of Van Fleet is maintained through programs aimed at awarding and honoring Americans and Koreans engaged in outstanding programs and achievements. The award honorees granted over the years include Ban Ki-moon, Jimmy Carter, Chey Tae-won, Park Yong-man, Colin Powell, Chung Mong Koo, Lee Kun-hee, George W. Bush, and Kim Dae-Jung.

History  The Five Point Generalz gang originates from two high-rise buildings known as \\"The Twin Towers\\" in the area of Weston Road and Lawrence Avenue West. The gang was created in the late 1990s by five original members nicknamed \\"the five generals\\", from which the gang's name is based. The original five members then grew their gang by recruiting other local gangsters in Toronto's west end Mount Dennis neighborhood, as well as other locations along the south side of Weston Road and Jane Street. The Five Point Generalz first gained nationwide attention after members of the gang were involved in the 2005 Boxing Day shooting, which caused the death of 15-year-old bystander Jane Creba and wounding of six others. The story influenced the then-underway 2006 federal election campaign on the issues of gun crime and street violence. 2005 was dubbed the \\"Year of the Gun\\" due to the spike in shootings in the city, including many allegedly perpetrated by members of the Five Point Generalz.CTV Toronto - Toronto sets a new record for gun-related carnage - CTV News, Shows and Sports - Canadian Television The event was used to support a call for the banning of handguns in Canada. The gang was once again thrust into the spotlight in 2007, after 11-year-old Ephraim Brown was killed by a stray bullet to the neck during a gang shootout, allegedly involving the Five Point Generalz and rival gang the Baghdad Crew, at Jane Street and Sheppard Avenue. In December 2010, alleged Five Point Generalz member Akiel Eubank and alleged Baghdad Crew member Gregory Sappleton were acquitted in the murder trial of Ephraim Brown. Despite being pegged as \\"gang enemies\\" by the prosecution, both Eubank and Sappleton hugged upon leaving the courtroom and stated that they have always been friends, not rival gang members as alleged. Eubank conceded that he was a member of the Five Point Generalz, but Sappleton denied the prosecution's claim that he was a member of the Baghdad Crew. The event, along with the shooting death of 15-year-old Jordan Manners at C. W. Jefferys high school in the same area, raised calls for a ban on handguns once again.

She was influential in state and national child welfare and juvenile criminal legislation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early life Kent was born on June 3, 1853 in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania to woolen manufacturer Thomas and Fanny Kent. She was the eldest of five children and received an education from both private and church schools. On October 23, 1873, she married engineer Frederick Schoff, with whom she would raise seven children. Career In the 1800s, Kent Schoff rose up the ladder within the National Congress of Mothers. She first became a project manager but was eventually promoted to vice president for a three-year term. She also founded the Pennsylvania Congress of Mothers in 1899 and became its first president until 1902. While in these leadership positions, Kent Schoff began to read news articles of youth tried and jailed as adults in the Pennsylvania area. She was specifically interested in a case from May 1899, regarding an eight-year-old girl sentenced to the House of Refuge for arson. This sparked her to lead a campaign to establish a Juvenile court system. She lobbied for states to follow the recently passed Illinois Juvenile Court Law, which mandated that youths be held in houses, not detentions while awaiting trials, regular checkups, and a mandated police officer watching over them. After taking over presidency of the National Congress of Mothers from Alice Birney, Kent Schoff persuaded President Theodore Roosevelt to endorse the Juvenile court system and was the first woman to speak in front of Canadian Parliament on this topic. She also established a National Endowment Fund to sustain the organization, established the Home Education Division within the U. S. Bureau of Education, and created the first national magazine called the National Parent Teacher. In 1908, the first International Congress on the Welfare of the Child was held under the sponsorship of the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations. In 1913, she was appointed director of the Home Education Division within the U. S. Bureau of Education. Before her resignation in 1920, Kent Schoff changed the name of the organization to the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations. While the organization supported the suffragist movement, Kent Schoff firmly believed in a women's power within the home. Kent Schoff died on December 12, 1940.

The main building, which partly dates from the Middle Ages and partly from the 1840s, was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History =Rani and Markmand families= A village named Harrested was in the Middle Ages located at the site. Harrestedgård was in the beginning of the 14th century owned by Karl Nielsen Rani. After his death in 1344, Harrestedgård passed to his two children. his daughter, Ingerd Karlsdatter Rani, the widow of Peder Grubbe, brought her half of the estate into her second marriage with Iven Markmand. Iven Markmand became the sole owner of the estate when his brother-in-law died in 1366. Harrestedgård then remained in the hands of the Markmand family for the next 150 years. =Parsberg family= Jørgen Evertsen Markmand, the last member of the Danish branch of the family, in 1500, sold Harrestedgård to the brothers Jørgen and Tønne Parsberg. Both Jørgen Markmand and the Parsberg brothers were involved in a feud with Jørgen Rud, who claimed to be ebntitled to a share in the Harrestedgaard estate. In 1493, King John ruled in favour of Tud but his claim never seems to have been satisfied since he ten years later filed a complain over the treatment of him. Tønne Parsberg passed Harrestedgård to his son, Verner Tønnesen Parsberg, a pricy counsellor, who played a significant role during the Northern Seven Years' War. Harrestedgaard remained in the hands of the Parsberg family for more than 130 years. =Lykke and Vind= Holger Vind In 1634, Frederik Parsberg sold the estate to Niels Lykke. He significantly increased the size of the estate. In 1638, it was acquired by Admiral Jørgen Vind. He was in 1755 killed in the Battle of Colberger Heide. Harrestedgård then passed to his three sons. In 1674, Holger Vind bought out his two brothers. In 1676, he was granted royal permission to close down the village of Harrested and placed both the windmill and all the land directly under the manor. In 1679, Holger Vind was appointed as Vice-Chancellor of Danish Chancellery. =Plessen family= Carl Adolf von Plessen Holger Vind's son, Vilhelm Carl Vind, sold Harrestedgård to Carl Adolf von Plessen. Plessen was already the owner of seven estates on the southern part of Zealand. Having no children, Plessen established De Plessenske Fideikommisgodser. Many of the later owners spent most of their time on their German estates. =Later owners= In 1925. Harrestedgård passed to Baron Johann Ludvig von Plessen. He served as German envoy in Rome. After the Second World War, an act was passed that made it possible to condiscate German property in Denmark. The government condiscated Harrestedgård and part of the land was subsequently sold off in lots. In 1049, Ove Christian Riisberg purchased the rest of the estate.e Lars Foghsgaard, who had made a fortune on the sale of Scandinavian Mobility, bought Harrestedgård in 1998. In 2002, he sold the estate to Jannik Hartvig Jensen. Architecture The oldest parts of the main building date from approximately 1350. The building is constructed in red brick on a foundation of field stone. The building is only 14 metre long. Many of the walls are 1.2 -1.3 m thick and have probably originally supported a two-storey building. This building was reduced to a single storey in the 1840s. 1.6 metres of the old walls were in the same time removed but the building was at the same time extended by more than nine metres to the south. Two east-facing, half-timbered side wings were formerly attached to the main wing. They were probably constructed during the Renaissance and demolished before 1816. An extension to the west side of the building was constructed in 1912. In 1923, a veranda was constructed towards the garden. The building is now white-washed and has a red tile roof. The building was in 1953 refurbished under supervision of the architect s F. and L. Halleløv. Fredningsstatus 2013: Hovedbygningen er fredet. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. Today Harrestedgård was in 2012 acquired by Vincens Chr. C. Lerche after he had ceded Benzonsdal to his son.

Born in Massachusetts, he joined the United States Navy at the age of sixteen, where he was introduced to Catholicism by way of a book that accidentally came into his possession, and prompted him to become a Catholic. He entered the Society of Jesus and spent the next twenty-five years studying and teaching mathematics at Jesuit institutions around the world, including in Canada, England, Ireland, and around the United States in New York, Maryland, Boston, and Louisiana. He became the vice president of Spring Hill College in Alabama, before being appointed President of Georgetown University. During his three-year tenure, a number of improvements were made to the campus, including the completion of Gaston Hall, the construction of the entrances to Healy Hall, and renovations of several other buildings. The Georgetown University Hospital also was established during his presidency. After the end of his term, he went to Boston College for several years as treasurer, before doing pastoral work in Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and Baltimore, where he became prefect of St. Ignatius Church. He continued to spend time at Boston College, where he died in 1917.  Early life  John Dunning Whitney was born on July 19, 1850, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. Descending from a prominent family, his father was Thomas G. Whitney and his mother was Esther A. Whitney née Dunning. His mother was a devout Congregationalist, and he was raised in that faith. He was sent to several public and private schools, including Nantucket High School, before entering the United States Navy in 1866. While serving as a lieutenant aboard the schoolship USS Mercury, he had a religious conversion experience. = Conversion to Catholicism = Aboard the Mercury, he would often discuss religion with a shipmate of his, who argued that none of the Protestant churches were the one true church, and that either The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the Catholic Church was the true church. He was also able to compare the different practices of the Protestant and Catholic chaplains aboard the ship. His conversations with his shipmate convinced Whitney to consider \\"the claims of the Catholic church\\". In August 1870, the Mercury was in Newport, Rhode Island, to attend the America's Cup. The captain invited a newlywed Catholic couple aboard to return to New York City from the yacht races. While sailing through the Long Island Sound, the bride dropped a book overboard, and the executive officer had a dinghy lowered into the water to retrieve it. After disembarking in New York, the bride left the book behind, which Whitney discovered to be The Invitation Heeded by Father James Kent Stone, who later became a Passionist priest known as Father Fidelis; the book was written in response to Pope Pius IX's call for all Christians to return to the Mother Church. Having read the book repeatedly, he approached one of the ship's chaplains, Father Dominic Duranquet, a Jesuit, and declared that if its contents were true, then he must become a Catholic. After being instructed to pray and study further, he requested to be received into the Catholic Church, with Stone as his godfather. On November 2, 1870 (All Souls' Day), Whitney was conditionally baptized by Duranquet in the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York City. = Education and teaching = Whitney entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1872, in the Sault-au- Récollet neighborhood of Montreal, Canada, where he remained for two years. He went to Manresa House in the Roehampton district of London, England, in 1875 to study rhetoric for a year, and then to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire for three years to study philosophy. He taught mathematics for a year, before returning to the United States in 1880, where he continued to teach mathematics at St. Francis Xavier College in New York City for four years. In 1884, he went to Woodstock College in Maryland to study theology. The following year, he was sent to Mobile, Alabama, where he was ordained a priest on August 15, 1885. He began teaching mathematics in 1886 at Spring Hill College, and eventually became vice president of the school. After four years at Spring Hill College, he went to Ireland in 1890, where he studied theology at Milltown Park in Dublin, before returning to Roehampton for his tertianship in 1892. Whitney then returned to the United States, and began teaching mathematics at St. Charles College in Grand Coteau, Louisiana from 1893 to 1895. He was transferred to the College of the Immaculate Conception in New Orleans in 1897, and then to St. John's College in the Fordham section of The Bronx.  Georgetown University  alt=Gaston Hall in 1904 Whitney was appointed president of Georgetown University on July 3, 1898, succeeding J. Havens Richards. During his presidency, a number of improvements to the campus were made. The Georgetown University Hospital was opened, and the first patient was accepted. Gaston Hall was decorated and completed in 1901. That year, he also received a donation from Anthony A. Hirst, a wealthy resident of Philadelphia and alumnus of Georgetown College and Law School, to construct Hirst Library inside Healy Hall. The main and center entrances to Healy Hall were completed, walkways were paved, and several campus buildings were renovated, including Dahlgren Chapel. On May 14, 1901, the university hosted Archbishop Sebastiano Martinelli, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, upon his elevation to the College of Cardinals. The grand reception in Healy Hall was attended by the students and faculty in their academic regalia, as well as many dignitaries, including the Secretary of War Elihu Root, all the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, all the Justices of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, most of the foreign ambassadors to the United States, many military and naval commanders, and the faculties of other local universities. Whitney's term as president came to end on July 11, 1901, and he was succeeded by Jerome Daugherty.  Later years  Following the end of his presidency at Georgetown, Whitney became treasurer of Boston College in 1902, and held this post until 1907. While in Massachusetts, he also worked closely with the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. He then left Boston to take up ministry at St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia, before becoming prefect of St. Ignatius Church in Baltimore in August 1909. He succeeded Father Francis X. Brady, who left to become president of Loyola College in Maryland, and Whitney was stationed at St. Ignatius for the remainder of his life. While at St. Ignatius, he directed the sodality of St. Ignatius Church, which administered the W. G. Read Mullan Scholarship. He spent the year of 1912 in Brooklyn, away from his parish. In May 1916, his health began to deteriorate, and he spent part of 1917 at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, where he died on November 27 of that year. His funeral was held in the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Boston, and he was buried at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.

He also serves as chairman of the National Water Resources Committee (NWRC). He has long served as a political \\"fixer\\" for the military junta that assumed power in the 2014 Thai coup d'état. Thamanat has described himself as \\"the main artery\\" in Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's 17-party government coalition which Thamanat helped forge in the 2019 Thai general election. He was born on 18 August 1965. Education Thamanat holds a bachelor's degree from Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, a master's degree in Buddhism from Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University and a master's in political science from Ramkhamhaeng University. He has a PhD in public administration from Calamus International University and California University (CUFCE). His dissertation, The forms of the local performance development and promotion with image and identity in order to increase the value-added and value-creation: a case study of Phayao Province was \\"posted\\" in the European Journal according to Thamanat. Some have suggested that the doctoral degree might be bogus. Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam says it does not matter if the doctoral degree is fake as it is irrelevant. Thamanat has vowed to file around 100 lawsuits against those who he believes have lied about his past. Military service Thamanat served in the Royal Thai Army, rising to the rank of captain. He frequently uses his former military rank before his name and is often referred to as \\"Captain\\" by the media. Political activists have asked the Election Commission of Thailand (EC) to answer several Thamanat-related questions: how he managed to get reinstated in the army after his long stay in Australia in \\"state-sponsored accommodation\\" and then got promoted in 1997 after returning to Thailand, and why he used the military rank of captain in documents he submitted to join the current cabinet even though his title was revoked in a Royal Thai Government Gazette announcement in September 1998. Australian drug conviction Manat Bophlom, now known as Thamanat Prompow, was convicted of conspiring to import heroin to Australia. The ruling was handed down on 31 March 1994 when he was sentenced to six years imprisonment. Manat served four years, then was deported upon his release. BBC Thai reporters traveled to Downing Court in Sydney to view court records. Forbidden to make photocopies, they translated a relevant court document into Thai as proof of the conviction that Thamanat continues to deny. Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwon asked the Thai people to leave the past in the past, saying the case has already been cleared up and that it was a matter concerning one person that has nothing to do with the nation. Thamanat claims he will sue the Sydney Morning Herald for defamation, although he declines to respond to their reporting. COVID-19 mask imbroglio A Thamanat aide, Pittinan Rak-iad, was associated with a medical mask profiteering scheme divulged on social media during the COVID-19 virus outbreak. In a statement to the press on 9 March 2020, Thamanat said that his aide had met with a man, Sornsuvee \\"Boy\\" Pooraveenasawatchari, to \\"discuss masks\\" at a Bangkok hotel. Pittinan told the press that he does not know the man and only took photos with him at a local hotel in Bangkok on 20 February because they happened to have a mutual friend. Sornsuvee claimed to have a stockpile of millions of medical masks for sale at a time when masks were in short supply at hospitals due to the viral outbreak. Pittinan did not know the man, it was their first meeting, and no deal to trade in masks was concluded, Thamanat said. Thamanat dismissed the story as an attempt to discredit him. Although Sornsuvee had posted photos on social media of himself pictured with a large stash of boxed masks, he denied knowing to whom they belonged. When reporters asked who the masks belonged to, Sornsuvee said: \\"No one. I've never seen them. I don't know who the owner is. I know nothing.\\" When asked about the incident, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha refused to comment. A government order prohibits stockpiling or profiting from the sale of sanitary masks. Violators face up to seven years in prison. Political career Thamanat began his political career with the Thai Rak Thai Party in 1999.https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-49644827 In the 2014 Thai general election, he ran for a seat in the House of Representatives as a Puea Thai Party candidate, but the election was declared invalid. When the National Council for Peace and Order seized power in 2014, he was one of the persons ordered to report to the National Council for Peace and Order. In 2018, Thamanat joined the Palang Pracharath Party, being appointed chairman for its northern strategy, and was elected to the House of Representatives for Phayao District 1 by defeating Arunee Chamnanya of the Puea Thai Party. As Deputy Agriculture Minister Thamanat has been active in his support of Thai farmers. In December 2019 he proposed spending 18 billion baht to purchase 30 million latex foam pillows to prop up rubber prices for struggling growers. The proposal would require buying 150,000 tonnes of latex from Thai rubber farmers who would be paid 65 baht per kilogram instead of the market price of 40 baht. The chief of Thai Hua Rubber PLC, in favour of the idea, suggested that the pillows—estimated to cost 600 baht to manufacture—could be sold at low prices or given free to foreign tourists. Along with several other ministers of Prime Minister Prayut's government, Thamanat was the subject of a multi-day censure debate in the Thai Parliament in February 2020. Opposition parties charged that Thamanat is ineligible to be a cabinet minister because of his criminal record, and says he lied to Parliament about his case. In the course of the debate Thamanat tried to block the admission of Australian court records, arguing that accepting an Australian court's decision as proof of his unfitness for office would be an infringement of Thai sovereignty. During the debate Thamanat went on to claim that the 3.2 kilograms of heroin he was accused of smuggling into Australia was ordinary flour. At debate's end, he was rebuked by 17 members of his own party and received fewer votes of confidence than the five other ministers involved, but kept his job as Deputy Minister of Agriculture. Personal life Thamanat's parliamentary declaration of assets in August 2019 listed two wives, seven children, and a net worth of about A$42 million, including a Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Tesla, and Mercedes-Benz along with 12 Hermès and 13 Chanel handbags, luxury watches, and Thai Buddha amulets.

History The company issued 4 million dollars with of stock to pay for the railroad and began finding coal veins all along the route. The company established headquarters at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Mining companies could own stock and counties affected could sell bonds or levy taxes to buy stock or to pay off the bonds. J. Dickenson Sergeant, Thomas Graham, Richard Wood, Henry Beckwith, S. H. Newbery, William Firmstone, R. F. Hoke, P. H. McCaull, P. W. Strother, and Richard B. Roane were the founders of the Railroad. William Firmstone, an industrialist and engineer died three years later, 1877. He had rebuilt Furnace of Glendon Iron Company with intent to modernize it. Frank Firmstone, his son, modernized two more. William Firmstone's son Harry Firmstone, was the first engineer in Virginia to use coke to make pig iron in 1874. The high grade coke, that made this possible, came from the New River. P. H. McCaull was a Delegate in the Virginia House of Delegates and a County Clerk of Roanoke County 1887. P. H.

The state would subsidize the cost of clothes, food, medical expenses and guards of the men to a maximum of what the state would pay if the men had stayed in prison. In return the railroad would pay back these expenses each year with railroad bonds bearing six percent interest. The New River Railroad and Mining and Manufacturing Company merged with Bluefield Railroad to form the New River Railroad of West Virginia in December 23, 1881. These railroads became the basis for Norfolk and Western Railway, New River Division. Norfolk and Western Railway President, Frederick J.

She was the namesake of the town of Sedona, Arizona. She helped in the establishment of the family farm and general store in the town. She also served as the town's bible school teacher. Sedona saved funds to build the Wayside Chapel. Among her legacy is a sculpture of a statue in her likeness by the Sedona Red Rocks Arts Council honoring her memory. Early years Sedona Schnebly (birth name: Sedona Arabella Miller) was born in the town of Gorin, Missouri (later renamed South Gorin Missouri) to Philip and Amanda Miller. Her mother made up the name of Sedona which she named her child, however she was known as \\"Dona\\" a name which most people called her most of her life.Our namesake: Sedona Miller Schnebly History of SedonaSedona Miller Schnebly (b. 1877, d. 1950)Vernde News She attended the Gorin Academy where she received her basic education and learned to play the piano. After she graduated Sedona earned a living as a teacher. When she was 20 years old she met Theodore Carleton (T C) Schnebly, an enterprising young man. They fell in love, however her parents objected to their relationship because of religious reasons. The Millers were Methodist and Theodore Carleton Schnebly was a Presbyterian. Arizona Sedona Schnebly (the city's namesake) and her son Ellsworth (Tad) Miller Schnebly in a christening gown in 1898 Theodore Schnebly's brother, Ellsworth had previously moved to the Oak Creek region of Arizona for health reasons upon the recommendation of his medical doctor. Ellsworth wrote to the Schneblys' encouraging them to move to Arizona which had plenty of land with deep grass, crystal clear air and plenty of room. Convinced by Ellisworth, the Schneblys told Sedona's parents about their plans of moving to the West (Arizona). Sedona's parents did not approve of their plans and this eventually caused a rift in the families relations. Theodore arrived in Oak Creek, which called the red rock country, before the rest of the family. Together with other pioneer families, he blasted out irrigation routes and moved the water through ditches, flumes and pipelines. He purchased twelve acres for a farm and an orchard in the area known as Camp Garden, which was along Oak Creek. He began to haul his produce goods to the City of Flagstaff where he sold them and then he would return to his farm in Oak Creek with goods from that city. Theodore sent for his wife Sedona and their two children. She mounted a train with her children and belongings that was headed to the mining town of Jerome. Theodore was waiting in Jerome for his family to arrive and when they did he put his family and family possessions on a wagon and headed towards Oak Creek. They all arrived to their new home on October 12, 1901. They built a two-story house and established a small store where they sold their goods to the local residents. The Schneblys hired road crews to build what is now known as Schnebly Hill Road. This road provided a much better way to take their crops to Flagstaff. How Sedona got its name Oak Creek Tenthouse Their large house served as a boarding residence for visitors. The guests never paid more than $1 a day for room and board. There wasn't enough room in the house for all the guests and therefore Sedona and her husband placed tenthouses on their property. Not only did Sedona cook for everyone and tend to her children, but she also helped on the farm, made soap, and canned fruits and vegetables. The Schneblys believed that the fast growing community needed a post office. Theodore wanted to be the area's first postmaster and began to organize a post office. He wrote to the Postmaster General in Washington, D.C. and suggested the following names \\"Oak Creek Crossing\\" and \\"Schnebly Station\\". However, the Postmaster General considered both names too long and therefore rejected them. Ellsworth, Theodore's brother, suggested that he submit the name of \\"Sedona\\" his wife. Theodore did and on June 26, 1902, the name was approved by the Postmaster General. The Schnebly family tragedy On June 12, 1905, Sedona's five-year-old daughter Pearl was killed when she became tangled in the reigns on her pony and she was trampled to death. They buried their daughter in their front yard and Sedona became very depressed. The Schneblys returned to Missouri in an effort to improve Sedona's heath. Sedona's husband eventually decided that he would like to return to farming and the family moved to Boyero, Colorado. Their economic situation was a difficult one and Theodore's health worsened. His medical doctor recommended that he should return to Arizona for health reasons and they did. Back in Sedona Grave-site of Sedona Schnebly (1877–1950) In 1930, they moved to Phoenix and that same year they returned to Sedona. There was nothing left of their homestead and they had no other choice then to rent a small one-room house on Jordan Road. Both, Sedona and Theodore were given jobs in the orchards owned by Ruth and Walter Jordan. Sedona helped Ruth with the cleaning and cooking and care of the Jordan's three children. She also washed and ironed Civilian Conservation Corps boys' uniforms for 10 cents per shirt. Sedona Schnebly taught bible at the American Sunday School and she saved money to fund the building of a religious chapel. In 1950, the Wayside Chapel just off Highway 89A was completed and dedicated to Sedona Schenebly. Sedona was suffering from cancer and on November 13, 1950, she died. Her husband Theodore, outlived her by almost four years, he died March 13, 1954. both Sedona and Theodore are buried in Cooks Cedar Glade Cemetery off Airport Road. The remains of their daughter Pearl were also moved to Cooks Cedar Glade Cemetery. Legacy On February 14, 2012, the Sedona Schnebly Memorial bell was rung at 2:14 during the Arizona Centennial celebration of Statehood in front of the Wayside Chapel. The Red Rock Quilters guild completed an Arizona Centennial quilt featuring an image of Sedona Schnebly picking apples against a background of some of the town of Sedona's most famous views. A statue with the likeness of Sedona was commissioned by the Sedona Red Rocks Arts Council to honor Sedona's memory. The statue which was made in 1964 by Susan Kliewer, a local artist was unveiled on October 1, 1994 in front of the Sedona Public Library located at 3250 White Bear Road. It was Sedona's first Art in Public Places project. The plaque on the base of the statue reads as follows : The town of Sedona dedicated a garden to her, the Sedona Schnebly Memorial Garden which is located at 260 Schnebly Hill Road.

He is considered one of the pioneers of the Drum and bass genre. Some of Blame's singles appeared on the UK Singles Chart between 1992 and 2004.  Career  Blame grew up listening to electro and hip hop music. While studying at college, Blame was exposed to house music from Europe and the United States and was inspired to combine hip hop breakbeats with these new House music sounds. He then hired a community recording studio in Luton called the 33 Arts Centre to work on his own music and the resulting track was \\"Music Takes You\\", which ended up getting signed to the Moving Shadow record label in 1991 while he was still a teenager. Moving Shadow also released Blame's singles \\"Feel The Energy\\", \\"Are You Dreaming\\", and \\"Neptune\\". Several of Blame's releases, including \\"Neptune\\", were heard at Fabio (DJ)'s Speed nightclub in London. Good Looking Records then offered Blame a record contract.

Fenton was a skilled carpenter Paradice and Nisbet It overlooks Big Payette Lake, from its western side, in town of McCall. \\"The building is situated on a small knoll above the lake, in what is currently a heavily wooded area. The primary façade faces the lake to the east. The Payette Lakes Club was built between 1914 and 1915 by a non-profit social club of the same name organized by Judge Samuel H. Hays of Boise and marketed by H. W. Arnold & Company. The building was designed in the Rustic style by noted Boise architects Nisbet and Paradice. The building is a three-story, side- gabled wood-framed building with a T-shaped plan and three prominent front- facing gables. The foundation is poured concrete. Decorative features include the jerkinheads at the gable ends, the large decorative wooden gable brackets, window boxes and shutters, porches and verandas with low balustrades, and the numerous gabled dormers. A popular vacation spot, the inn was instrumental in the early development of recreation in the McCall area, as well as central Idaho, and is an excellent representative of Rustic style architecture. Although the Club suffers from some condition issues, it retains sufficient integrity to convey its significance under Criteria A and C.\\" \\"The Inn is a large, three-story wood-framed building of post and beam construction, which is set on a concrete foundation (Figure 1). Designed in the Rustic style, with elements of Swiss Chalet Revival, the main section measures 33 ft. by 100 ft. wide and is supported by a series of several large 18-in. hand-planed timbers. The prominent front porch is 34 ft. x 16 ft. and is recessed beneath the large front-facing cross-gable, supported by eight hand-planed square timbers. A low balustrade encircles the porch. A small ell in the southwest corner where the kitchen is located measures 22 ft. by 24 ft. and would have been reached by a separate entrance. The siding is clapboard, and is heavily deteriorated in sections. The north and south gable ends are jerkinheads, with six large wooden gable brackets, while the front-facing cross-gable also has six large brackets. The gable ends were originally clad in board and batten siding. The steeply pitched gabled roof is currently clad in corrugated metal, although it originally had wood shingles. The widely overhanging eaves exhibit exposed rafter tails. Several gabled dormers pierce the roof; originally, there were eight on the west façade, only three of which remain. Currently, seven dormers remain on the east elevation.\\" Perhaps this is a draft, not final? With plans and historic photos but not 26 photos from 2015 included in its submission.

Biography = In Europe = Born in 1870 in Brańsk, Grodno Governorate, Poland, to Yehuda Aryeh of the Rosen family, which was made of many Torah scholars, Moshe Rosen learned in the local school in Brańsk, then in Bielsk Podlaski by Aryeh Leib Yellin, and finally in Raszyn by Mordechai Gimpel Jaffe before pursuing his studies independently. He had a close relationship with the rabbi of Brańsk, Meir Shalom HaKohen, author of Milchemet Shalom, and he was known as a \\"masmid\\" (non-stop learner of Torah).Nezer HaKodesh, 5779 edition, Toldot BeKetzirat HaOmer Upon marrying Hinda, daughter of Hillel David Trivash, in 1893, Rosen studied in Kovno Kollel and was ordained by Rabbis Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor and Moshe Danishevsky at the age of twenty. In 1897, Rosen was installed as the rabbi of Chweidan (Kvėdarna), Lithuania, where he remained until his departure to the United States, despite several offers from other communities. He was active in the community, rescuing people from forced labor and mandatory labor on the Shabbat. He established the Agudath HaRabbonim of Lithuania and stood at its head.Asher Rand, ed., Anshe Shem (New York, 1950), pp. 123—24 Rosen was also a contributor to the first three issues of his father-in-law's Torah journal HaPisga, the first article of which was entitled \\"Aruch laNer\\" and attacked an enlightened view of the Miracle of Chanukah. His words were praised and analyzed by Chaim Hezekiah MediniSdei Chemed (Maarechet Chanukah 1 s.v. ודע at the end, Klalim Aleph 17 s.v. לפי and 22 s.v. ומה)  Relationship with R' Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz (Chazon Ish)  The Chazon Ish’s wife was from Chweidan, the Chazon Ish lived there after getting married (Rosen was the officiating Rabbi). Rosen and the Chazon Ish established a close relationship and began studying Torah together. He developed tremendous respect for his younger study partner and considered himself the student, not the teacher.Memoirs of R' Shlomo Lorincz shlita, A Torah of Life, and Love of Chessed, Chapter Seven Rosen and the Chazon Ish became quite close, and the former would call upon the latter to join him on the Beit Din when serious matters requiring expert dayanim were brought to the table. They would work together on matters of community, and Rosen's daughter, Leah, would assist Karelitz's wife in her store and home. All the while, the Chazon Ish's genius was kept hidden from the public. Even when the Chazon Ish began delivering a Gemara lecture to local townspeople, and Rav Moshe Rosen would himself attend, people were given the impression that the rabbi of the town was coming to encourage the young Karelitz. Indeed, even when Rosen published his first sefer, Divrei Soferim, he quotes Karelitz as \\"Chazon Ish,\\" a name that, at the time, nobody but he recognized. Rosen couldn't afford to publish this sefer, though, due to his unlivable salary as a rabbi, so Karelitz loaned him some of his own dowry and said not to worry. It was Rosen who first told Chaim Ozer Grodzinski about the unknown, hidden genius, Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz.Pe'er HaDor vol. 1 pp. 189-192 Rosen was a Zionist, unlike the Chazon Ish.OBVIOUS MISTAKE, MORE GRAMMATICAL POINTS, BUBBE MAYSEH, APOSTATES AND THE ZOHAR There was a plan to publish Masechet Kelim with three commentaries, that of the Chazon Ish, Rav Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, and Rav Moshe Rosen, but the plan did not come to fruition, as Rav Chaim Ozer was too busy with his other responsibilities.Pe'er HaDor vol. 4 page 186 Later in life, someone told Rosen that the Chazon Ish could learn 100 pages of Gemara a day, to which Rosen responded that he hadn't heard of that, but he had seen the man learn one page of Gemara over a hundred days and the first perek of Mikvaot for three months, fifteen hours a day!Pe'er HaDor vol. 1 pp. 191 The Chazon Ish also proofread the volume of Nezer ha-Kodesh on Zevahim, except in order to blunt his comments, he articulated them in Rosen's own style to make it seem as though Rosen himself was writing corrections, not someone else.Pe'er HaDor vol. 1 pp. 270 After the Chazon Ish left Chweidan, their friendship continued in the form of the letters they wrote to one another discussing various Torah topics.printed in \\"Zichron Moshe\\" by Rosen's grandson, Rabbi Hillel Litwack = In America = In 1928 Rosen immigrated to the United States, where he became a Talmud instructor at Mesivta Torah Vodaath. After only one year, he left the Torah Vodaath yeshiva in favor of the professional rabbinate, serving as a pulpit rabbi at several congregations in Brooklyn for the next two decades. Rosen spent his final years as rabbi of Congregation Beth Medrash HaRav in Brooklyn. An advocate of religious Zionism, Rosen worked for the benefit of Mizrachi and the Jewish National Fund. He was active on behalf of Ezrat Torah and the Agudath Harabbonim, later serving as honorary president of the Agudath Harabbonim. An exceptional Talmudic scholar who maintained correspondence with many of the leading sages of the day, and publishing several volumes of halakhic studies and more than a dozen volumes of Talmudic commentary, Nezer Ha-Kodesh. He was well known for his erudition and deep Torah insights both while he was still in Europe and throughout his life in America.HaPardes vol. 27 issue 4, January 1953 Rosen was the Rosh Yeshiva of the Beis Midrash level of Torah Vodaath from September 1926 to June 1928. Upon his departure, the Beis Midrash students also left. Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz joined the faculty of Torah Vodaath in June, 1927, and when the Beis Midrash was reorganized in 1929, became the Rosh Yeshiva.The Jewish Observer, February 1992, page 42 One of his notable students was Avraham Yaakov Pam.Shul Shaylos: The Rulings of the Gadol of Brownsville Rosen was reportedly offered a position at RIETS but declined.Shu\\"t HaShavit vol. 6 Yoreh Deah Siman 46 He also collected money to support the Chazon Ish, Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik, and institutions of Torah learning regularly. During World War II, he helped organize a Vaad Hatzalah to help Jews escape to America. Rosen was married to Hinda, the daughter of Rav Hillel David Trivash. She died on March 12th, 1952 (Shushan Purim), and he died in New York in October (first day of Chol HaMoed Sukkot, 1957, at the age of 86. He was survived by a son and five daughters.New York Times October 13 and 14, 1957, Moshe D. Sherman, Marc Raphael, Orthodox Judaism in America: A Biographical Dictionary and Sourcebook pp. 174-176. As he died on a Friday which was also the second day of Sukkot, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein advised the funeral be delayed until Sunday in his honor (i.e. not to bury on Friday afternoon or Saturday night). At the funeral, he was eulogized by Rabbis Aharon Kotler, Moshe Feinstein, Avraham Kalmanowitz, Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, Pinchas Mordechai Teitz, and Nissan Telushkin.

The building is due for completion in early 2020. The location is within the Chippendale Heritage Conservation Area (HCA), item ‘C9’ on Schedule 5 of the Sydney Environmental Plan (LEP) 2012. The site is also within the Chippendale Locality as described in Section 2.3.1 of the Sydney Development Control Plan (DCP) 2012.  History of the site  = Establishment of the suburb and street = Between 1788 and 1824 the area south of Sydney town was devoted to farming relying on water from Blackwattle Swamp Creek and brick and tile manufacture based on the local clay. Land to the south of the subject site was granted to William Chippendale in 1815, and in 1825 Governor Brisbane granted land bounding onto Parramatta Road to the pardoned convict Robert Cooper, a onetime London distiller, who built the Brisbane Distillery there. The southern part of Cooper’s grant, including the subject site, remained as grazing land until the 1840s, when Cooper built workers’ housing including a row of over fifty cottages known as Cooper’s Row, an early element in Chippendale’s street layout and effectively today’s O’Connor Street. = Residential evolution of the site = { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": {}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 151.19914770126346, -33.88627504605158 ] } } ] } The two-room timber and shingle houses making up Cooper’s Row were of notoriously poor quality: the Sydney Morning Herald of March 8th, 1851 suggested that ‘the tenants will awake some morning with a weightier covering on them than the bed-clothes.’ They were demolished in the 1850s following acquisition by the recently arrived English businessman Clark Irving. Irving with carpenter Peter Royal built ‘fourteen cottages and one public house’ on the site, naming the houses Adelaide Terrace after Irving’s wife, with Royal himself occupying what later became 37 O’Connor Street. In 1861 the houses were described as two-storey brick, slate-roofed buildings with four rooms; by 1863 a fifth room, probably a kitchen, had been added. Tenants included Miss Meta Mantle’s ladies’ school, James Carroll, a solicitor, and Ebenezer Dibley, a bricklayer. In 1873 the terrace and adjacent hotel were purchased by Bernhard Holtermann, an immigrant gold miner, merchant and member of parliament. Renamed Holtermann’s Terrace, the houses, featuring verandas with concave iron roofs and shuttered French windows, were auctioned in 1876, when they were described in the Sydney Morning Herald as ‘repaired, painted, decorated and made equal to new’, ‘in a populous and improving part of the city’. By 1881 the terrace had become 37-49 O’Connor Street, named for the City of Sydney alderman Daniel O’Connor. The terrace and corner hotel were acquired by Tooth & Co. Ltd as part of their hotel holdings, and sold in 1920, by which time the slate roofs had been replaced with corrugated iron.  Small industry and the influence of war  In 1938 the terrace was acquired by John Henry McEvoy, a boot manufacturer, who had established Fostar’s Shoe Factory at the corner of O’Connor and Balfour Streets in 1929. Reputedly the largest shoe manufacturer in Australia, Fostar’s used its own airplane for interstate distribution and in 1941-42 won a government contract to produce army boots. The National Emergency Act of 1941 required certain military-related companies to provide ‘an air raid shelter, amenities, equipment and training among other protective measures in the event of an air raid’, and the site was put to this purpose. The old houses were demolished and the new building constructed in 1942, providing a ground floor collection area, including a canteen, and a basement shelter capable of sheltering Fostar’s 800 employees. Despite legal controversies over its army contract and McEvoy’s death in 1945 the company continued to prosper into the 1950s. The building was acquired by HM Property Development Co. Pty Ltd in 1968 and, following modification, tenanted by a martial arts academy, a dance studio and a gymnasium. In 2013 the building was extensively damaged by fire.  Associations with notable people  Robert Cooper was a London distiller. Found guilty of receiving stolen goods, he was transported to Australia in 1813 and pardoned in 1818. Cooper entered into a variety of sometimes questionable business dealings, appearing as both litigant and defendant in court reports. Granted land at what is now the southeast corner of City Road and Parramatta Road in 1825, he built the Brisbane Distillery soon after. By the 1840s he had built a range of workers’ housing on his land, including a row of over fifty cottages known as Cooper’s Row. Cooper became insolvent by 1850. Clark Irving arrived from England in the early 1840s, became manager of the Australasian Sugar Company among other business roles and was one of a group associated with the Colonial Sugar Refinery who acquired Cooper’s property, including the distillery and the subject site, in 1852. In 1857 he and the carpenter Peter Royal demolished part of Cooper’s Row and built a group of terrace houses on the subject site, which he named Adelaide Terrace after his wife, and an adjacent corner hotel. Irving went on to become a significant grazier and member of parliament. Bernhard Holtermann arrived from Germany in 1858, became a ‘gold miner, merchant and member of parliament and is significant for his role in promoting photography’, partly as a means of encouraging migration to Australia. He acquired and renovated the Terrace and hotel in 1873, renamed them Holtermann’s Terrace and Holtermann’s Family Hotel, and may have commissioned the photograph of his property, included in the Appendix to this report, taken at that time. Holtermann sold the terrace and hotel in 1876. Crawford H MacKellar, who designed the existing building for Fostar’s Shoes, arrived from Scotland in 1906 and practised as an architect, designing prominent buildings including the Woolworths Building in Darlinghurst Road, the David Jones Department Store and the Gowings Building in central Sydney. Fostar’s Shoes, established near the subject site in O’Connor Street in 1929, was reputedly the largest shoe manufacturer in Australia, with stores across the country, 800 employees at its Chippendale factories alone and a company airplane for interstate distribution. The company was contracted to supply army boots during World War II and, despite some ensuing legal controversy, remained an Australian household name into the 1950s.

The station operated on 89.3 MHz between 1975 and 1990. History On November 30, 1973, Premontre High School applied to build and operate a 10-watt radio station from its campus at 610 Maryhill Drive in Green Bay. WGBP-FM signed on March 10, 1975, as the fourth high school radio station in the state. The impetus to start the station had come when students had heard of WSHS at Sheboygan North High School in Sheboygan and wanted to start up a facility; faculty advisors thought that, despite the paperwork burden, such an outlet would be useful. The station's program output during the school day included easy listening and rock music, plus news, weather, sports and public affairs programming. WGBP quickly developed a deep tradition in sports broadcasting—one that would outlive the station itself. In its first full school year of operation, WGBP began carrying play-by-play of Premonte sports, quickly becoming the station's most popular program output. One of its first sports play-by-play announcers was a young Kevin Harlan, son of Packers executive Bob. After spending his freshman year doing studio work, Harlan began doing play-by-play of the school's football, basketball and hockey games as a sophomore, which included home and away broadcasts. After attending the University of Kansas and being named the lead radio announcer for the Kansas City Kings at the age of 22, making him the youngest announcer in the four major sports, Harlan called getting into radio at WGBP his \\"first good move\\". Another basketball announcer, Pete Pranica of the Memphis Grizzlies, also started his career in broadcasting at the station. Mark Daniels, who later went on to a lengthy career in Green Bay sports radio, was a senior at Premonte when WGBP started up and served as its first sports director. As the 1980s drew to a close, two different events would signal the end of WGBP-FM. The first concerned Premontre High itself. In November 1989, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay announced a three-way merger that would combine Premontre with Abbot Pennings High School and St. Joseph Academy on Premontre's campus; the new Notre Dame Academy began operating in 1990, and the station was closed. Even if the station had been allowed to continue, the increasing power of other stations would have foreclosed its continued operation. In 1991, the Federal Communications Commission assigned 90.1 to a new radio station applicant, whose station signed on in 1994 as WORQ.

Military career  As an officer's son, he decided in his youth to serve in the army. He took part in the Austro-Turkish wars and in 1790 is already listed as a captain. His father Major Josef Frierenberger was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa. After the Battle of Austerlitz he was, like his father, decorated on May 28, 1806 with the highest Austrian military decoration - Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (this represented a claim to a lifetime peerage Knight (Ritter) and eventually the holder could claim the hereditary title of free lord). He was promoted to lieutenant colonel the following year and in 1809 to colonel. Subsequently, on April 27, 1813, he was promoted to major general. He was severely wounded on August 26, 1813, during the Battle of Dresden. Afterwards, the command of the artillery was taken over by General Friedrich Karl von Langenau. Subsequently, the Russian Tsar Alexander I awarded him the Russian Order of St. Anna. In January 1820 he was retired and spent the last years of his life in Kroměříž, now Czech republic. He is buried in the old Kroměříž cemetery.  Monument near Austerlitz  On December 2, 1995, a stone monument near the old post office along the Olomouc road was unveiled (). It was built by the Czechoslovak Napoleonic Society together with the Austerlitz Battery to commemorate two Austrian artillery batteries, which under the command of Major Václav Jan Frierenberger covered the retreat of the Russian corps of General Pyotr Bagration at the conclusion of the Battle of Austerlitz.  Cemetery monument  In 1836 Frierenberger's widow had a monument built on her husband's grave. In 1936, the memorial was relocated to the current town cemetery entrance (). The memorial in the Empire style is on the list of Cultural Monuments of the Czech Republic under the item number 101308.

Biography  His father was a furrier. At the age of eighteen, he began working as a draftsman in the mechanical workshops of Trondheim. It was there that he took up painting in his spare time. In 1880, he applied for a state travel grant, but was rejected. Nevertheless, he left Norway and enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he studied until 1884, when he had his debut at the Autumn Exhibition. His primary instructor there was the genre painter Ludwig von Löfftz, who influenced him to focus on genre scenes as well. In 1890, he was called to be a Professor at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar, and remained there in that capacity until 1904.

It was a partnership of architects Benjamin Morgan Nisbet and Frank H. Paradice, Jr. formed in 1909. The partnership lasted five years. They dissolved it in 1915, and Nisbet moved to Twin Falls, Idaho to establish an individual practice, and Paradice did likewise in Pocatello, Idaho. A number of their works are recognized by listings on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Nisbet Benjamin Nisbet (born December 19, 1873) was born and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He apprenticed with an architectural firm there before enrolling at the University of Pennsylvania's school of architecture. In 1897 he won a school award there, and graduated in 1898. He was married in 1903 and soon moved to Nampa, Idaho, where he opened a practice. He began partnering in Boise, Idaho with another architect (J. Flood Parker) during March to August 2004, then joined an established Boise firm. He worked for J.E. Tourtellotte and Company in Boise from 1903 to 1909. With After partnering with Paradice during 1909 to 1915, he moved to Twin Falls, where he designed the City Hall, the high school, the Methodist church, and the IOOF building.Perhaps the Buhl City Hall and the Buhl IOOF Building, in Buhl rather than Twin Falls, were the buildings intended to be referenced. These two were designed by Paradice. It is not immediately verifiable that he might have designed another city hall and another IOOF building in Twin Falls. Paradice Frank H. Paradice, Jr., was born May 4, 1879, in Ontario, Canada. His family moved to Denver by 1880, and he eventually graduated from high school there. He studied architecture the Armour Institute of Technology in Chicago. Back in Denver, Paradice apprenticed with a firm and at the same time worked for the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, where he designed depots and other structures in Colorado and New Mexico. He opened his own architectural office in Denver, and moved to Boise in 1907. After partnering with Nisbet during 1909 to 1915, Paradice moved to Pocatello, where he designed \\"several Sullivanesque commercial buildings\\". He designed the high school, the Franklin Building, the Fargo Building, the Bannock Hotel, the Kasiska and Central Buildings and many other buildings. At least two of his works there are contributing buildings in historic districts listed on the National Register.Two works in East Side Downtown Historic District are Paradice's; more perhaps are in other districts there.

They were kidnapped, maimed and killed between 1989 and 1993. According to the Pará authorities, the crimes were committed for the purpose of satanic rituals and black magic, promoted by the \\"Superior Universal Lineage\\" sect, a mystical organization that, among other things, challenged the Western idea of divinity. However, after the case was closed, Maranhão police arrested Francisco das Chagas Rodrigues de Brito, a serial killer who claimed 42 murders committed against children, including 12 in Altamira, which brought uncertainty over the judicial outcome. The accused, who have always claimed to have no involvement with the crimes, asked the court to reinvestigate the cases. Due to the level of violence, the case quickly generated mainstream attention and international repercussion.  Victims  The victims were poor young boys, aged between 8 and 14, who lived in Altamira. They were found naked, castrated and with signs of sexual violence.

Since then, he hasn't been located. Months earlier, the boy's brother had escaped an abduction attempt. Investigation Due to the high level of violence, the crimes reached widespread attention. The subsequent investigation was led by Civil Police Chief Éder Mauro. Initially, the murders weren't linked to each other, which led to many of them being abandoned for lack of evidence. =First arrest= In 1990, after the first investigations were completed, the Pará police arrested Rotílio de Souza, a drifter who wandered through the city streets. Investigators truly believed he was responsible, but De Souza died in prison under suspicious circumstances some months later. However, the occurrence of new deaths with the same characteristics as the previous ones showed that he wasn't the perpetrator, and the investigation resumed. =Alleged organ trafficking ring= Work resumed and other lines of investigation were followed. One of them maintained the existence of an alleged gang of traffickers who were kidnapping the city's children to extract their organs. For the police, the manner in which the cuts were induced indicated clinical motivation, besides the possible participation of doctors. The recent move of two doctors to the city caught the attention of investigators: they were Anísio Ferreira de Sousa and Césio Brandão, who had moved to Altamira in 1990. Both were detained for clarification. However, expert reports proved that as they were extracted, the organs were unusable for transportation purposes. Without sufficient evidence, the doctors were released and the case went cold. =\\"Superior Universal Lineage\\" sect= In 1993, the researchers reopened the case and rearrested De Sousa and Brandão again. According to witnesses, these men participated in a sect called the \\"Superior Universal Lineage\\", a mystical organization that, among other things, challenged the Western idea of divinity and preached caution in living with children. In a book called \\"God, the Great Scam\\", the sect's founder, Valentina de Andrade, stated: \\"...Watch out for children, they are unconscious instruments of the great scam called God and his evil collaborators...\\". The text also called children \\"violent\\", and recommended paying special attention to those born after 1981. Due to its eccentric religious philosophy, the organization was investigated in Paraná for alleged involvement of the kidnapping and murder of Evandro Ramos Caetano in 1992, a case also known as the Evandro case. At that time, searches were carried out on Valentina's estate, where hoods and videos were found, in which, according to police, she in a trance said: \\"...kill little children...\\". However, experts found that the expression used was actually \\"...yes...but there are more experienced little children...\\". In view of this, the material was disregarded and Valentina's name was removed from the judicial inquiry. She claimed to have never worked with the organization in Brazil, and had visited Altamira only a few times, the last time being in 1987. =Indictment= Based on this evidence and having no other lines of investigation, Éder Mauro closed the case and concluded that the murders were committed by sect participants during rituals of Satanism and black magic. The indictment forwarded to the prosecution was based solely on data gathered from previous investigations and witness testimony. According to the investigators, 74-year-old Agostinho José da Costa would have seen Dr. Brandão on the Trans-Amazonian Highway carrying a styrofoam box and a bloodstained machete. Another witness, named Edmilson da Silva Frazão, reported to have attended a \\"satanic cult\\" at De Sousa's house in 1991, where he would have seen Valentina de Andrade. In all, the investigation indicted 7 people for allegedly participating in the crimes. * Anísio Ferreira de Sousa: doctor and spiritualist. Accused of doing the castrations. Witnesses would have seen him praying to the \\"god of darkness\\". According to police, as not to arouse suspicion, the doctor treated residents of the region for affordable prices. He also provided free housing, as well as making campaigns to raise donations to help needy families. * Césio Brandão: doctor. Indicted based on witness testimony, and also alleged to have done the castrations. He had a temporary arrest issued on July 9, 1993, later converted to a preventative one. He remained in a Bélem prison for two years until he obtained a habeas corpus, to await trial in freedom. * Amaílton Madeira Gomes: homosexual, heir to several farms and gas stations. According to investigators, it was him who attracted and raped the boys. Witnesses would have seen him with a bloodstained shirt upon the disappearance of one of the victims. * Carlos Alberto Santos Lima: military policeman, working as a security guard at a gas station belonging to Gomes. According to investigators, he himself confessed to being part of the criminal group. * Aldenor Ferreira Cardoso: military policeman. Accused of providing security to the sect. * José Amadeus Gomes: Amaílton's father, accused of masterminding the murders committed by the doctors. According to police, he practised the rituals for financial gain. * Valentina de Andrade: the sect leader and intellectual mentor for the homicides. Among the defendants, only José Amadeus Gomes and Valentina de Andrade had no pre-trial detention and were allowed to walk free until their trials. The police investigation had several flaws: no autopsies were performed on the corpses, no forensic examinations were performed on the body locations and there was no evidence connecting any of the accused to the crimes. However, on September 6, 1993, the indictment was accepted by the prosecutor and the complaint was forwarded to the judiciary, where it was accepted by Judge Orlando Arrifano. From then on, the judicial process against the accused began. Lawsuit Due to the nature of the complaint, the court case against the seven defendants was referred to the jury. The Brazilian constitution establishes that it is up to this court to adjudicate cases involving intentional crimes against life. However, in order to reach the trial stage, the law states that the complaint must be approved in the so-called \\"investigation stage\\", where the target of the trial is not the accused party, but the probative structure of the prosecution. =Investigation phase= This phase of the process was long and controversial. On several occasions, decisions taken in Altamira were revoked at higher levels, leading to the resumption of the process. Three different magistrates participated in this phase: Orlando Arrifano, Roberto Vieira and Ernane Ferreira Malato. =Investigation by Arrifano= On September 10, 1993, the complaint against the seven accused was offered to the judiciary. The then-responsible for the third criminal court for the district of Altamira, Orlando Arrifano, accepted the complaint and initiated the investigation phase, calling for testimony from the witnesses and informants. =Instruction hearings= Among the witnesses summoned was Duilio Nolasco Pereira, former husband of Valentina de Andrade and owner of a hotel in Altamira. On November 30, 1993, Duilio testified to seeing Valentina in town, touring with a group of friends, in 1986. What also caught his attention was the way these friends revered the way she sat or got up. In early 1994, upon hearing the case, the chief prosecutor, Roberto Pinho, dismissed the defendants for lack of evidence. The assistant prosecutor Antonio Cesar Brito Ferreira rebutted Pinho's arguments and summoned Frazão's testimony, a key witness in the inquiry. Then, on May 17, 1994, Edmilson reiterated his previous testimony given in the police investigation. However, he contradicted himself when he could not say when the alleged acts occurred: when asked, he cited 1989 or 1990. In his first statement, he claimed that it had had happened in 1991. Still, Judge Arrifano found the statement satisfactory, and on June 20, contrary to the prosecutor's wishes, pronounced the accused as guilty. The judge's decision was challenged by the defense team, who filed an appeal to the state court. On November 21, 1994, a prosecutor named Castelo Branco accepted the appeal, due to the lack of evidence for the conviction. When the decision was published, several social groups organized in Bélem and promoted large mobilizations. There was also the symbolic burial of the Altamira chief prosecutor who, fearing for his safety, had to leave the city. Under pressure, on December 22, the three judges voted to maintain the arrest of the suspects and continue the process. The judicial proceeding was at an advanced stage, only awaiting a date for the defendants' jury trial. =Supreme Court annuls part of the trial= On March 24, 1995, Edmilson da Silva Frazão surprised the court by requesting a new hearing. In his new testimony, he refuted everything he had previously, claiming that he had been under pressure from the Federal Police. Three days later, Edmilson returned to the court and reaffirmed his statements, claiming that he was urged and coerced to give further testimony by three men, named Hercilio, Arnaldo and Amadeu, which offered him money and he couldn't refuse. Accordingly, the defense lawyers sent a habeas corpus application to the Federal Supreme Court, alleging that Judge Arrifano was partially judging the case, which made the right of defense impossible. The Second Panel acknowledged irregularities in the case, and issued a request to the state court, ordering the hearing of new defense statements, which reopened the investigation phase and nullified the defendants' conviction. However, the habeas corpus was not granted. In August 22, 1995, the First Chamber of the State Court of Justice decided to revoke the remand of Césio Brandão, who was held for more than two years in Bélem. After the decision, Brandão declared his intention to sue the state, claiming to have been used as a scapegoat by authorities to hide flaws in the investigation process. On September 12, the other defendants were also released, following the same line as Césio's lawyers.

Initially, Noujaim and Amir meant out to make a documentary revolving around the Sony Pictures hack, however the film evolved and shifted course as they started looking at how people's minds have been hacked and changed, which led to The Great Hack about the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Amer and Noujaim have directed The Vow a documentary series revolving around NXIVM and its leader Keith Raniere for HBO. They are also developing a TV series \\"aimed at challenging perceptions of the Arab world as portrayed by such shows as Homeland and Tyrant\\".

Synopsis Accident-prone sports news photographer Cory (Jim Henshaw) carries a torch for his best friend's wife Linda (Susan Hogan). After Linda discovers her husband dallying with another woman, she leaves him. Cory's hopes appear to be dashed when she moves in, not with Cory, but his gay neighbour. Meanwhile, Cory's free-spirited co- worker from the newspaper Annie (Susan Petrie) has decided that Cory is the one for her. Eventually, after a great many twists and turns, the convoluted series of events resolves itself, and everyone lives happily ever after. Cast ;Main ;Supporting A Sweeter Song was Nick Mancuso's first on screen role. Themes and influences Before the film began shooting, Allan Eastman described it as \\"a comedy of sexual values and identities\\" and \\"a study of a Toronto subculture\\". Stephen Chesley pointed out that this was \\"one of the few times an audience is presented with an examination of young people's mating habits that is made by young people, rather than someone middle-aged who's trying to remember.\\" Several years after its release, the film was described as a parody of \\"the great Canadian loser\\", an \\"angst-ridden boy drinking himself to death, isolated against the wilderness.\\" The film also incorporated a critique of the Canadian film establishment in the form of a Canadian spoof film-within-a-film. Fresh from graduating from the University of Bristol Film School in 1975, Eastman was strongly influenced by the French New Wave, not realizing, he said in 1985, that \\"they'd stolen their best ideas from the great American directors\\". Production =Background and financing= Jim Henshaw wrote the script for A Sweeter Song and reworked it with Eastman, whom he had met on the set of Lions for Breakfast, in which Henshaw co-starred with Eastman's girlfriend, Susan Petrie. Henshaw recalled in 2008 that Eastman, who was bored, asked if Henshaw had anything to read, so Henshaw gave Eastman a script he had written: > At day's end, he wandered back, said he'd liked it and would I be amenable > to him directing and Susan assuming the female lead. I said sure and that > weekend we talked to \\"Lions\\" producer Tony Kramreither and mutual friend > John Hunter about producing. They said sure and a year later \\"A Sweeter > Song' was in the can. Eastman said in 1985 that A Sweeter Song \\"only got made because I wouldn't take no for an answer.\\" According to him, he was the sole producer at first, through the company he founded, Labyrinth, up to the point when Canadian Film Development Corporation funding had been secured, \\"at which point John Hunter became Line Producer\\" and Anthony Kramreither joined as Executive Producer (Burg Productions), \\"providing the private investment and contracting to handle the post-production business.\\" The film's budget was $125,000. After an article that implied that Kramreither had creative input into the film was published in Cinema Canada, Eastman wrote a letter to the editor disputing its accuracy: > Tony is my friend and a sweetheart but does have a tendency to take credit > where it is not due... Tony had no creative involvement in the picture from > start to finish and, indeed, only showed up on the set when we were shooting > a nude scene (being basically a dirty young man)... I am very proud of A > Sweeter Song, as my first feature, and I want people to know who did what. =Filming= The film's working title was Double Exposure. Shot in 16mm colour, principal photography for A Sweeter Song took place in Toronto from 6 September to 3 October 1975. =Music= Music for the film was composed and performed by David Jove. While no official soundtrack album was released, many of the film's songs are found on Jove's Sweeter Song vinyl LP (Pax Records, 1974). Video artist Jon Noel Shelton remarks that the version of Isn't It Funny in the film is distinctly different from the one on the album. Release A Sweeter Song premiered in North and South Carolina theatres on 12 January 1976, followed by a screening at the 29th Cannes Film Festival in May, almost a year before its Canadian premiere in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario on 11 March 1977 to a pair of reviews by The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star on 11 and 16 March 1977, respectively. =Distribution= Kramreither signed a world sales and U.S. distribution deal on 30 April 1976 with Bob Hope's company Epoh: $250,000 for U.S. distribution with a $50,000 cash advance, not including TV sales. His experiences had made him an ardent believer in the \\"back-door policy\\" to Canadian distribution and world sales: \\"first you sell it and open it in the States, then you make your Canadian distribution deal\\" because: \\"Any film which has opened in the US will do better on the marketplace afterwards.\\" =Home media= With the advent of the VCR, A Sweeter Song was released (as Snapshot) on VHS (VCI Video). Reception =Commercial performance= The film, like most of the B series Kramreither executive produced, was a financial success. =Critical response= Contemporary Stephen Chesley predicted that the A Sweeter Song's contemporary audience would react well to the film's theme of youth sexuality: \\"overall there is a freshness and likeability to the film\\", and credits the novice director for choosing \\"such a difficult genre\\" and \\"bringing most of it off.\\" Chesley praised both the cinematography, editing, and the principal cast of five actors for their strong, enthusiastic acting, singling out Susan Petrie: > Susan Petrie proves herself to be one of the best actresses in Canadian film > with this role. Unlike her past typecasting as the frigid teenage tease, she > finds things in this character that aren't in the script, and it's one of > the few times we can see a contemporary young woman on the screen, > especially considering the void that now exists in roles for women. She > allows the script to overwhelm her at points too much relish in her dirty > lines that are grafted onto the dialogue, and tossing away a term such as > \\"meaningful relationship\\" by laughing at its wrenching commonness as she > proclaims it in her character - but in her crucial moments she's completely > believable, and carries her low comedy scenes with great timing. Chesley was less impressed with the \\"far from full\\" characters themselves, faulting the script's tendency toward self-indulgence, low comedy, and extraneous scenes, speculating that Henshaw and Eastman were \\"too far removed\\" from the \\"type\\" of individual they were portraying in the film to do so \\"with any credibility\\", but elsewhere, the satire \\"works exceptionally well\\", as with the Canada Manpower scenes: \\"Henshaw's character would get into such a situation and act in the situation in just the way he does, and at the same time the whole experience, to everyone who's been through it, is a highly effective comedic extension of the horror of the real thing.\\" Natalie Edwards felt that Henshaw had not quite mastered comic timing and that it was \\"obvious\\" that this was Eastman's first film and that \\"sharper cutting might tighten up the film, which lags a little self-indulgently at the moment\\". Despite this, \\"the film has a lot of attractive features, not the least of which is a bright performance by Susan Petrie.\\" Retrospective The Great Canadian Movie Guide describes the film as a wandering, counter-culture comedy that \\"starts out weakly,\\" but \\"gets better, and more off-beat, as it goes along.\\" It is a \\"likeable, product-of-its-time\\" with unabashed Canadianisms now \\"almost unheard of\\". Legacy Although the success of A Sweeter Song launched Eastman's directing, writing and producing careers, looking back in 1985, Eastman himself was not sure whether the film's criticism of the Canadian film industry helped or hurt his career. While he continued directing, he did not release another feature film until The War Boy.

It was first played in the Circo Metropolitano de Caracas on 26 November 1897. Background Edison in 1897, they were quickly surpassed by other forms of projector. Ruiz was a showman by trade, and rented the Circo Metropolitano to show zarzuelas and circus variety shows as well as films. In 1897, after the release of the first Venezuelan films in Maracaibo, Ruiz went into business with Ricardo Rouffet to create their own films. He had several contracts with figures including W. O. Wolcopt with a and Gabriel Veyre with a Cinematograph to show films at the Circo. Wolcopt then traveled around the country and Veyre left to Colombia before Carlos Ruiz peleando... was released, but his Cinematograph, which could both record and project film, may have been used to make Ruiz' films. Azuaga García describes Ruiz' choice to hold film showings in a circus as \\"gaudy\\", as the previous screenings were held in spectacular theatres and halls, but also suggests it was Ruiz' attempt to \\"truly bring cinema to the popular classes\\". Film screening and content In November 1897, advertisements in Caracas start promoting \\"the new Projectoscope\\", claiming it played in color, and \\"criollo views\\", referring to the pair of films made by Venezuelans Ruiz and Rouffet. They also claimed that they would be the first Venezuelan-made films to play in the capital. In the film, Ruiz as a character gets into a stagecoach heist and a fight with its coachman; Azuaga García notes that the devised situation makes this film an early attempt at narrative staging. Despite the fictional scenario, the films may have been advertised to the French as showing \\"real things\\" from life in the Caracas area. Sueiro Villanueva proposes that Rouffet was the film's active director, but also proposes that someone else altogether could have handled the camera, acting as director but staying absent from the public screenings. Details on neither Rouffet nor the films were published in the local press, suggesting that it was critically overlooked.

She completed her only finished piano concerto in 1835, and played it first that year with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Felix Mendelssohn.  History  Clara Wieck was an accomplished concert pianist, trained by her father Friedrich Wieck. She was already making international tours at age eleven and composed piano pieces for her recitals. In January 1833, at age 13, she began composing a Piano Concerto in A minor, completing in November a single-movement Konzertsatz that she orchestrated herself. In February 1834, her future husband Robert Schumann revised the orchestration, and the 14-year- old prodigy then performed it in several concerts. She then expanded the work by adding two more movements, using the Konzertsatz as the finale. The new first movement was completed in June 1834, and the slow second movement \\"Romance\\" with its extended cello solo was finished the following year. She again orchestrated the work herself, including undoing Robert's revisions of the original Konzertsatz, completing her new three-movement Piano Concerto on 1 September 1835, less than two weeks before her 16th birthday. Wieck premiered the full concerto in November 1835 as soloist with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Mendelssohn.  Instrumentation  The concerto is scored for piano solo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in A, 2 trumpets in C, trombone, timpani in A & E, violins I & II, violas, cellos, and basses. With this instrumentation Clara Schumann chose the usual orchestration typical of early Romantic music.  Structure and music  The concerto is in three movements: # Allegro maestoso (A minor) # Romanze: Andante non troppo con grazia (A-flat major) # Finale: Allegro non troppo – Allegro molto (A minor) The duration of the concerto is under 20 minutes. Virtuoso writing for the piano dominates the composition. A reviewer of a 2004 recording noted that it is a \\"truly remarkable piece for a 14 year old. It is a work with memorable themes and a sunny vision throughout\\". It has been favourably compared to Chopin's piano concertos. The opening movement begins dramatically, with the piano entering in a virtuosic manner. The first movement segues into the second, called a \\"Romance\\" written for piano and cello, without orchestra. It begins with an extended solo piano passage, then the solo cello enters. At the end, a timpani drum roll segues into the final movement. This movement is the heaviest, dancing in a triple metre. The woodwinds and the piano enter with counterpoint.  Recordings  The piano concerto was recorded in 2000 in the Neuberinhaus, Reichenbach, Vogtland, Germany, by Elena Margolina, piano soloist, with the Vogtland Philharmonie conducted by Doron Salomon (ARS SACD ARS38141, with the composer's 2nd Konzertsatz in F minor, written in 1847 and not published until 1994, and Robert Schumann's Konzertsatz in D minor, written in 1839, two years before his A minor concerto). Another recording was made in 2004 in the church in Naples, Italy, by pianist Francesco Nicolosi with the Alma Mahler Sinfonietta, Stefania Rinaldi conducting (Naxos CD 8.557552, with the composer's Piano Trio in G minor, Op. 17 from 1846).

Informally, it says that, for any cake, for any n people with different tastes, and for any fraction r, there exists a subset of the cake that all people value at at least a fraction r of the total cake value. The theorem is about a circular 1-dimensional cake (a \\"pie\\"). Formally, it can be described as the interval [0,1] in which the two endpoints are identified. There are n continuous measures over the cake: V_1,\\\\ldots,V_n; each measure represents the valuations of a different person over subsets of the cake. The theorem says that, for every weight w \\\\in [0,1], there is a subset C_w, which is a union of at most n-1 intervals, which all people value at exactly w: : \\\\forall i = 1,\\\\ldots,n: \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, V_i(C_w)=w  Proof sketch  W \\\\subseteq [0,1] be the subset of all weights for which the theorem is true. Then: # 1 \\\\in W. Proof: take C_1 := C (recall that the value measures are normalized such that all partners value the entire cake as 1). # If w\\\\in W, then also 1-w \\\\in W. Proof: take C_{1-w} := C\\\\smallsetminus C_w. If C_w is a union of n-1 intervals in a circle, then C_{1-w} is also a union of n-1 intervals. # W is a closed set. This is easy to prove, since the space of unions of n-1 intervals is a compact set under a suitable topology. # If w\\\\in W, then also w/2 \\\\in W. This is the most interesting part of the proof; see below. From 1-4, it follows that W=[0,1]. In other words, the theorem is valid for every possible weight. = Proof sketch for part 4 = * Assume that C_w is a union of n-1 intervals and that all n partners value it as exactly w. * Define the following function on the cake, f: C \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^n: :: f(t) = (t, t^2, \\\\ldots, t^n)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,t\\\\in[0,1] * Define the following measures on \\\\mathbb{R}^n: :: U_i(Y) = V_i(f^{-1}(Y) \\\\cap C_w)\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, Y\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^n * Note that f^{-1}(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) = C. Hence, for every partner i: U_i(\\\\mathbb{R}^n) = w. * Hence, by the Stone–Tukey theorem, there is a hyper- plane that cuts \\\\mathbb{R}^n to two half-spaces, H, H', such that: :: \\\\forall i = 1,\\\\ldots,n: \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, U_i(H)=U_i(H')=w/2 * Define M=f^{-1}(H)\\\\cap C_w and M'=f^{-1}(H')\\\\cap C_w. Then, by the definition of the U_i: :: \\\\forall i = 1,\\\\ldots,n: \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, V_i(M)=V_i(M')=w/2 * The set C_w has n-1 connected components (intervals). Hence, its image f(C_w) also has n-1 connected components (1-dimensional curves in \\\\mathbb{R}^n). * The hyperplane that forms the boundary between H and H' intersects f(C_w) in at most n points. Hence, the total number of connected components (curves) in H\\\\cap f(C_w) and H'\\\\cap f(C_w) is 2n-1. Hence, one of these must have at most n-1 components. * Suppose it is H that has at most n-1 components (curves). Hence, M has at most n-1 components (intervals). * Hence, we can take C_{w/2}=M. This proves that w\\\\in W.  Tightness proof  Stromquist and Woodall prove that the number n-1 is tight if the weight w is either irrational, or rational with a reduced fraction r/s such that s\\\\geq n. = Proof sketch for w=1/n= * Choose (n-1)(n+1) equally-spaced points along the circle; call them P_1,\\\\ldots,P_{(n-1)(n+1)}. * Define n-1 measures in the following way. Measure i is concentrated in small neighbourhoods of the following (n+1) points: P_{i},P_{i+(n-1)},\\\\ldots,P_{i+n(n-1)}. So, near each point P_{i+k(n-1)}, there is a fraction 1/(n+1) of the measure u_i. * Define the n-th measure as proportional to the length measure. * Every subset whose consensus value is 1/n, must touch at least two points for each of the first n-1 measures (since the value near each single point is 1/(n+1) which is slightly less than the required 1/n). Hence, it must touch at least 2(n-1) points. * On the other hand, every subset whose consensus value is 1/n, must have total length 1/n (because of the n-th measure). The number of \\"gaps\\" between the points is 1/\\\\big((n+1)(n-1)\\\\big); hence the subset can contain at most n-1 gaps. * The consensus subset must touch 2(n-1) points but contain at most n-1 gaps; hence it must contain at least n-1 intervals.

It was executive produced by Akiva Goldsman, Geoff Johns, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Greg Walker, with Walker serving as showrunner for the second consecutive season. Created by Goldsman, Johns, and Berlanti, the series is based on the DC Comics team Teen Titans. Brenton Thwaites, Anna Diop, Teagan Croft, and Ryan Potter return to the main cast from the previous season, joined by season 1 guest stars Curran Walters, Conor Leslie, Minka Kelly, and Alan Ritchson and series newcomers Chelsea Zhang, Joshua Orpin, and Esai Morales. The season sees Dick Grayson (Thwaites) form a new Titans team comprising Rachel Roth (Croft), Gar Logan (Potter), and Jason Todd (Walters) in his original San Francisco base. Concurrent with the Titans' return, an old enemy resurfaces in the form of Deathstroke (Morales), whose past conflict with the original Titans team of Dick, Donna Troy (Leslie), Dawn Granger (Kelly), and Hank Hall (Ritchson) caused them to disband. As Deathstroke looks to eliminate the Titans, with his daughter Rose Wilson (Zhang) also taking part in the fight, the heroes face another threat from Cadmus Laboratories when they encounter runaway test subject Conner (Orpin). Meanwhile, Kory Anders (Diop) discovers that she is being hunted by her sister Blackfire (Damaris Lewis). A second season of Titans was confirmed in 2018 prior to the premiere of the first season. Filming began the following year and 13 episodes were announced, two more than the 11 episodes of its predecessor. The season was originally planned to feature H.I.V.E. as the Titans' enemies, while Dick would operate under his new mantle of Nightwing after assuming the identity in the initially intended season 1 finale. Before the start of filming, however, the original season 1 finale would be pulled and reworked into the second season, which provided a new resolution to the previous season's story in its premiere episode. The second season was subsequently re-envisioned to depict Dick's gradual transformation into Nightwing, with Deathstroke replacing H.I.V.E. It will be the last season to release on DC Universe as a result of the service's original programming moving to HBO Max in 2021. Shortly before the conclusion of the second season, a third season was announced, with season 2 guest star Lewis scheduled to join the main cast. The third season was originally intended to air in late 2020, but its premiere date was pushed back following the COVID-19 pandemic, which delayed its filming. Production on the third season is scheduled to begin in the final quarter of 2020 and conclude by early 2021, with the season expected to air on HBO Max the same year. Critical reception to the second season was mixed. While episodes in the first half of the season received positive reviews, the premiere and later episodes were met with a more negative response.

After the original season 1 finale was pulled, elements of the episode were given to the season 2 premiere, which became the resolution of season 1's Trigon story. H.I.V.E. was replaced by Deathstroke, while Dick's arc into Nightwing was re-envisoned to conclude in the season 2 finale. =Casting= Series regulars Brenton Thwaites, Anna Diop, Teagan Croft, and Ryan Potter reprise their roles from the first season as Dick Grayson, Kory Anders Rachel Roth, and Gar Logan. Curran Walters, Conor Leslie, Minka Kelly, and Alan Ritchson also return as Jason Todd, Donna Troy, Dawn Granger, and Hank Hall, promoted to series regulars after guest starring in the previous season. In February 2019, it was announced that Joshua Orpin had been cast as Conner for season two, taking over for body double Brooker Muir in the first season. After the character was teased by co-creator Geoff Johns, Esai Morales was cast as Deathstroke in March 2019, with Chella Man and Chelsea Zhang announced as his children Jericho and Rose. Iain Glen was cast as Bruce Wayne on April 11, 2019, marking the character's first physical appearance after being portrayed by stunt doubles in the first season finale. In June 2019, Natalie Gumede and Drew Van Acker were cast as Mercy Graves and Garth, respectively. In July, Genevieve Angelson was announced as Cadmus Laboratories scientist Dr. Eve Watson. In August 2019, Michael Mosley was revealed to be portraying Dr. Light. Also in August, Oluniké Adeliyi announced on her Instagram she had joined the cast in an undisclosed role that was later revealed as burlesque dancer Mati Matisse and Hanneke Talbot was revealed to be Shimmer. In September 2019, Demore Barnes was revealed to be portraying Wintergreen. Following the character's appearance in an October 2019 trailer, Diop confirmed on her Instagram that Damaris Lewis would be portraying Kory's sister Blackfire, which was also confirmed by Lewis. =Filming= Filming for the second season began on April 2, 2019, and concluded on September 20, 2019. Production was temporarily put on hold in July due to accidental death of special effects coordinator Warren Appleby; the season 2 premiere is dedicated in his memory. Release =Broadcast= The second season premiered in the United States through DC Universe on September 6, 2019, and concluded on November 29, 2019. Outside the United States, the second season became available for streaming via Netflix on January 10, 2020. =Home media= On March 3, 2020, the second season was released digitally and on DVD and Blu- Ray. Reception The season 2 premiere, written by executive producers Akiva Goldsman (pictured), Geoff Johns, and Greg Walker, was met with a mixed response On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds an 81% approval rating based on 21 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"Though Titanss sophomore season suffers from a slight slump at the start, it quickly resets itself, building on the momentum from its first season while laying fascinating framework for where the show could go.\\" The premiere episode \\"Trigon\\", which had story elements originally intended for the season 1 finale, drew mixed reviews. Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant wrote that the premiere \\"feels like two distinct episodes roughly stitched together, rather than a proper start to a new season\\" and \\"the show's simply carrying too much baggage at the start and is reaching for a conclusion too long after the ostensible end of season 1 to deliver much in the way of a fulfilling resolution or a promising new beginning\\". Giving the episode a 5.8/10, Jesse Schedeen of IGN called it \\"an extremely messy episode, with one half tasked with wrapping up Season 1's Trigon storyline and the other laying the groundwork for a new status quo and new villain\\" and \\"delivers a very anticlimactic finish to Season 1's story\\", although he found promise for future episodes. Den of Geek reviewer Aaron Sagers said the premiere \\"would have served as an excellent season 1 finale\\", but concluded that \\"it feels quite a bit like a much-needed course correction for this series\\" and gave it a 3.5/5. Following the premiere, early episodes of the season earned a positive reception. In a review for the second episode \\"Rose\\", Forbes contributor Linda Maleh called it \\"the real season premiere\\" and wrote, \\"season 2 has taken the best things about season 1, and elevated them\\". Praising the sixth episode \\"Conner\\" and Joshua Orpin's performance in the title role, Sagers said, \\"it is a strong introduction of the anticipated character, and Titans makes up for the fact we've waited so long in the season for it\\". Schedeen gave the eighth episode \\"Jericho\\" a 9.3/10, which he described as \\"easily the strongest installment of Titans: Season 2, and a clear contender for the series' best episode overall\\". However, the later episodes were received more negatively. In a review for the 11th episode \\"E.L._.O.\\", Charles Pulliam-Moore of Gizmodo wrote, \\"Titans seemingly lost its focus\\" after the eighth episode and \\"with just two episodes to go, it doesn’t seem possible that the writers are going to be able to wrap things up in satisfying or interesting ways\\". For the finale \\"Nightwing\\", Pulliam-Moore called it \\"a travesty of epic proportions\\", criticizing how the episode concluded the season's storylines. The death of Donna Troy in the finale was widely panned as illogical and unnecessary, with several reviewers questioning if electrical discharge from a transmission tower would have been sufficient to kill the character. Although giving the overall episode a 3.5/5, Sagers commented, \\"Even if I were to accept that Donna couldn't withstand that electrical charge, and even if I could explain why the super-boy [Conner] didn't rush to stop the falling tower, the death played out in cheap fashion, like yet another box that had to be ticked for the finale.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Christian Holub said, \\"Donna Troy's last-minute death felt so stupidly unnecessary that I can't help but throw up my hands at this whole season finale\\", describing the scene as \\"such a stupid death I honestly thought it was a joke at first\\". Future Three weeks prior to the conclusion of the second season, DC confirmed in November 2019 that Titans was renewed for a third season. The third season was scheduled to premiere in the fourth quarter of 2020, but is currently delayed amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the pandemic, filming is expected to begin in the fall of 2020 and conclude by summer 2021. During the production delay, DC Chief Creative Officer Jim Lee announced that the series would be moving from DC Universe to HBO Max, making the second season the last to premiere on DC Universe. The third season will be the first to premiere on HBO Max.

She was also heard in early broadcasts on French radio and made several recordings for Disques Odéon. Amongst the roles she created were The Child in Ravel's opera L'enfant et les sortilèges. Life and career Gauley was born in Paris to Armande Gauley (1864–1922), an actor at the Théâtre de l'Odéon, and Marie Gauley-Texier (1866–1948), a mezzo-soprano who sang at the Opéra de Paris. The couple also taught diction and singing to private pupils at their apartments on the Avenue de Tourville. As a child she sometimes performed with her parents, including two matinees given by the Baroness de Beaulieu in 1913. Gauley was a student at the Paris Conservatory from 1921 until 1924. In her final year she won the conservatory's first prizes in singing and opéra comique. She made her stage debut on 2 November 1924 as Olympia in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann at the Théâtre de l'Opéra-Comique in Paris. It was the beginning of a long and successful career with the company. Gauley as The Child in L'enfant et les sortilèges, Paris 1926 Gauley had particular success at the Opéra-Comique as Rosina in The Barber of Seville and in the title roles of Mireille and Lakmé. She recorded excerpts from all three of these operas for the Odéon label. Her petite figure led to her successful assumption of child characters as well. She sang The Child in Ravel's L'enfant et les sortilèges at both its world premiere in Monaco in 1925 and in its first performance at the Opéra-Comique in 1926. Ravel attributed the opera's success in part to Gauley's acting and her \\"ravishing voice.\\" Her other child roles included Yniold, the young son of Golaud in Pelléas et Mélisande and Andreloun, the shepherd boy in Mireille. From the late 1920s through the 1930s, Gauley appeared in several world premieres of contemporary operas and had a parallel career as a concert singer. She also appeared in radio broadcasts on Radio Paris and . Although her operatic career was primarily based at the Opéra-Comique, she appeared at Opéra de Monte-Carlo in 1927 where she sang all three of the lead female roles in Les contes d'Hoffmann and Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier. She also appeared as a guest artist at La Monnaie in Brussels and in the opera houses of Amsterdam, Geneva, Liège, Lyon, Strasbourg, and Aix-les-Bains. As late as 1950 she sang in Paul Dukas's Ariane et Barbe-bleue in its first performance at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. After her retirement from the stage, Gauley taught singing in Paris until 1987. She died five years later at the age of 88 in Malakoff, a suburb of Paris.

The first Ottoman Turkish volume was published in 1862, and the second was published in 1865. Serialization began in 1872,, Cited: p. 67. and the first volume labeled \\"Destur\\" was published in 1873. The final volume was published in 1886. M. Safa Saraçoğlu, author of \\"Economic Interventionism, Islamic Law and Provincial Government in the Ottoman Empire,\\" stated that its style and structure are similar to that of the 1851 legal collection Mecmu'a-yı Kavanin., Cited: p. 66-67. Contents The later volumes include a copy of an 1849 provincial council code. Translations =Greek= Greek version Demetrius Nicolaides published the first Greek translation, Оθωμανικοί Κώδηκες (\\"Othōmanikoi kōdēkes\\", meaning \\"Ottoman Codes\\", with Demotic Greek using \\"Οθωμανικοί κώδικες\\"), in 1871, making it the first version of the Destur not in any variety of Turkish.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 29 (PDF p. 31) Nicolaides used the publishing company of Eptalofos to do this,Balta and Kavak, p. 36 and bundled copies with his newspapers.Balta and Kavak, p. 50. He advertised the translation in the supplements of his newspapers and personally.Balta and Kavak, p. 40 At one time the price was 400 piastres.Balta and Kavak, p. 52. Nicolaides, who indicated in applications to the Ottoman press office that he intended to help increase the job performance of employees of the Ottoman government who belonged to the Rum Millet (as in Greek-speaking employees),Balta and Kavak, p. 51. stated that even a complete collection of such laws in Ottoman Turkish did not exist, and that his was the only one that was complete. He received favours from the Ottoman government as a reward for his work, and this enriched him, giving him money used to operate his newspapers. Publication of an annex (\\"parartēma\\") began in 1874. The publishers of Thrake (\\"Thrace\\"), another publication of Nicolaides, published additional \\"Law Annexes\\" translated by Kon. G. Vayannis from 1879 to 1881.Balta and Kavak, p. 50-51. Nicolaides requested the Ottoman government to allow him to publish an updated Greek version, and the state let him do this on the condition that he publish the updated version in the same manner as the previous one. From 1889 to 1891 the second edition was distributed, with four volumes. In order to have his costs paid for and to spread the knowledge in the codes, he requested that Orthodox Greek members of local and regional governments buy the Greek Düstur. Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdulhamid II gave Nicolaides, through the Ottoman Internal Affairs fund, 5,000 piastres due to the translations of the legal documents. He made requests to vilayet governments to buy the books again in 1893, as well as to Greeks working for private companies.Balta and Kavak, p. 53. The price of the Greek Düstur declined to 300 piastres after Nicolaides successfully petitioned the government to do so in 1892. After a natural disaster destroyed one of his houses in 1894, Nicolaides asked Ottoman government ministries to buy or promote the book to help resolve his debts.Balta and Kavak, p. 54. Authorship of the Greek version The main dragoman at the embassy of Greece in Constantinople (now Istanbul), D. Rhazes, translated the Ottoman land codes into Greek, and those codes were used in the Greek Düstur. Johann Strauss, author of A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire: Translations of the Kanun-ı Esasi and Other Official Texts into Minority Languages, wrote that as the French version of the land codes in another law collection, Législation ottomane, was later revised with the Rhazes version in mind, \\"This Greek version was apparently held in such high esteem\\".Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 30 (PDF p. 32) Nicolaides also included a Greek translation of the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 made from the official Ottoman Empire French version, with several notes attached from a different French translation of the edict made by François Belin. Nicolaides included additional notes including an 1860-issued berat in Greek, and removed some of Belin's notes; Johann Strauss argued that they were excised \\"probably because [Nicolaides] considered them too critical\\". The Ottoman Commercial Code (Ticaret kanunu) was about the same as the French Code de commerce, and the Greek collection's version was translated from the French, with the translation stating this explicitly. The document has an annex in the Greek language that explains how the Turkish and French models are different.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 30-31 (PDF p. 32-33) Reception to the Greek version British lawyer John Alexander Strachey Bucknill wrote that for Nicolaides \\"high praise is due as it is an accurate and useful rendering\\". George Young, the author of Corps de droit ottoman, stated that there were inconsistencies in the translation and that the work lacked an index. =French= A portion of the French version of the Düstur, in Législation ottomane, published by Gregory Aristarchis and edited by Demetrius Nicolaides A French version of the Düstur was included in Législation ottomane, volumes one through five, with the fifth titled as Doustour-i-hamidié.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 27 (PDF p. 29) L. Rota, a lawyer stated by Strauss to be \\"probably of Levantine origin\\" located in Constantinople, translated several texts in the Législation ottomane collection. Mihran Chirinian, an ethnic Armenian, assisted him in the translations of content in volumes 1-3 and 5.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 28 (PDF p. 30) Nicolaides requested the Ottoman government to allow him to publish an updated French version, and the state let him do this on the condition that he publish the updated version in the same manner as the previous one. The Ottoman Imperial Command paid him 100 Ottoman lira in 1887 as a reward for his translation of the codes into French. =Bulgarian= Volume 1 of the Bulgarian version Christo S. Arnaudov (; Post-1945 spelling: Христо С. Арнаудов) published the Bulgarian version, titled \\"Complete Collection of the State Laws, Regulations, Instructions, and High Orders of the Ottoman Empire” (Пълно събрание на държавните закони, устави, наставления и високи заповеди на Османската империя Pălno săbranie na dăržavnyte Zakoni, Ustavy, Nastavleniya i Vysoky Zapovedi na Osmanskata Imperia). Volumes one through three were published in Constantinople in 1871, 1872, and 1873 while volume four was published in Sofia, Bulgaria in 1886.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 31 (PDF p. 33) Straus concluded that the Bulgarian version likely originated from Nicolaides's Greek version due to \\"striking similarities\\" between the two, even though the Bulgarian one states that it was a collaborative work that was directly translated from Ottoman Turkish. Strauss stated that the introduction was \\"mostly a literal translation\\" of the Greek one and that the notes \\"are almost identical\\". Nicolaides had in fact wrote a document in which he stated that he translated volumes of the Dustür and the Mecelle into Bulgarian.Balta and Kavak, p. 51-52. He lacked funds to publish the entire collection; vilayet council leaders agreed to fund the distribution of these volumes. He had translated two volumes which together had half of the Düstur and Mecelle laws at the time. The Bulgarian version includes material absent from the Ottoman Turkish version, including copies of treaties made with other countries. =Others= Moïse del Médico (a.k.a. \\"Moiz Bey Dalmediko\\", 1848-1937) and David Fresco (1850-1933) published Koleksyon de las leyes, reglamentos, ordenanzas i instruksyones del Imperio Otomano, the translation of the Düstur into Judaeo-Spanish (Ladino), in 1881.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 23 (PDF p. 25), with Fresco's date of birth and death on p. 24 (PDF p. 26) The Düstur was eventually published in Arabic,Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 24 (PDF p. 26) even though Ziya Pasha wrote a satirical article about the difficulty of translating it into Arabic, suggesting that Ottoman Turkish needs to be changed to make governance easier.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 21 (PDF p. 23) Evangelinos Misalaidis, from 1861 to 1871, released a translation in Karamanli Turkish (Turkish in Greek characters).

P.W. Hasler (London: 1981). Early life George Beeston was the son of John Beeston (died 1542) and Katherine Calverley, a daughter of Sir George Calverley of the Lea, Cheshire. According to George Ormerod in his History of Cheshire (1819), his memorial in Bunbury Church states his age as 102 but he was legally declared on an inquisition post mortem to be only 22 years old when he succeeded to his father's estates in 1542, indicating a likely birth year of 1520 and an age of 80 or 81 at death. Soldier and sailor He was recorded as one of the captains ordered 'to keep the Narrow Seas' in 1562, and in charge of the land defences at Gravesend, Kent, in about 1576. For his part in the defeat of the Spanish Armada, Beeston was knighted on the deck of the Ark Royal by Lord Effingham on 26 July 1588.J. Paul Rylands and F. C. Beazley, 'The Monuments of Bunbury Church, part 2', Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, vol. 70 (1918), p. 78. Beeston had already fought in France and in Scotland.

Edinburgh The year after the victory against the Spanish armada, Beeston took a fleet to Scotland for an unknown purpose. James VI had a proclamation made at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh and at the Shore and Pier of Leith urging the townspeople to welcome the \\"nearest friends confederates to this realm, lately repaired within the same, with some ships of war of ready to fulfill and follow his Majesty's direction.\\"National Records of Scotland, Treasurer's accounts, June 1589. However, an unfortunate incident embarrassed James VI. On 1 June 1589 Beeston arrived in the Forth on the Vanguard followed by Edward Croft in the Tiger with the Achates. On 5 June some of the English crewmen came ashore into Edinburgh to shop and sightsee. Three got in fight in a tavern, one was stabbed, and then as they returned to Leith and their ship they were attacked by a group of Spanish sailors, and one man, a trumpet officer, was killed. Beeston and the English ambassador William Ashby had an audience with James VI on 7 June at the Palace of Holyroodhouse seeking an enquiry and justice. Ashby and Thomas Fowler wrote that the king treated the sailors honourably; James VI gave Beeston a locket set with diamonds and 100 gold crowns and gold chains and rings provided by the goldsmith Thomas Foulis to his captains.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 11-2, 22-3: NRS Treasurer's accounts, June 1589. James also requested that Edinburgh town council give him, his three captains, and the English ambassadors an \\"honest banquet\\" in Nicol Edward's house.John Marwick, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 544.

He is remembered for creating slapstick comedy films in the late 19th century. Theatre producer and showman Ruiz's first business was in putting on popular shows, a pursuit he never gave up through his filmmaking efforts. Filmmaking In 1897, shortly after it opened, Ruiz rented the Circo Metropolitano, where he would show zarzuelas and circus variety shows. He also planned to go into the film business after the release of the first Venezuelan films in Maracaibo in January 1897, forming a partnership with Ricardo Rouffet to create their own films. He also hired a man, W. O. Wolcopt from the United States, as part of this venture. Wolcopt brought a from New York, which was displayed in the Circo from 26 June to 14 July 1897. Ruiz and Wolcopt may have shown a film called Disputa entre Andracistas y Rojistas, which showed a fight between supporters of that year's political candidates Ignacio Andrade and Juan Pablo Rojas Paúl; the nature of the film suggests a Venezuelan author, but there are few records of it. After the show Wolcopt traveled the country for four months with the Projectoscope before returning to Caracas. Ruiz then hired Gabriel Veyre to show his Cinematograph at the Circo after seeing him project another film at the Fortuna Hall in Caracas. Ruiz and Veyre had a dispute, with Ruiz claiming Veyre was in breach of contract and sent a letter saying so to Veyre's mother; Veyre fled the country to Colombia, but his Cinematograph, which could both record and project film, may have been used to make Ruiz's films. Azuaga García describes Ruiz's choice to hold film showings in a circus as \\"gaudy\\", as the previous screenings were held in spectacular theatres and halls, but also suggests it was Ruiz's attempt to \\"truly bring cinema to the popular classes\\". Elisa Martínez de Badra reviews the cinema of early Venezuela shortly by suggesting that the partnership of Ruiz and Wolcopt, along with the first Venezuelan films shown in January 1897, can be considered early examples of attempts at narrative cinema. He briefly returned to films in 1899, before going back to his production business. Later life Ruiz became a devoted writer in his later life. He died in August 1912, and is interred at the Cementerio General del Sur in Caracas.

He is Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Founding Dean of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Dozier's research and teaching have focused on snow science, Earth system science, radiative transfer in snow, remote sensing and information systems, image processing, and terrain analysis. Dozier is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Distinguished Scientist in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the NASA/Department of Interior William T. Pecora Award and of the NASA Public Service Medal. In 2009, he was awarded the Jim Gray Award from Microsoft. He helped explain optical properties of snow to animators of the film Frozen, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. He has led six expeditions to the Hindu Kush range in Afghanistan, where he made a dozen first ascents, and has had a climbing destination, Dozier Dome, in Yosemite National Park named after him.  Early life and education  While Dozier was at the University of California, Berkeley in the early 1960s, he dropped out after a year and a half and went to Europe where he climbed and studied German. He then hitchhiked from Germany to India. His experience during this trip inclined him to learn more about Earth's water and climate. He received his B.A. in Geography from California State University, Hayward (now East Bay) in 1968. Subsequently, he completed the M.Sc. in 1969 and Ph.D. in 1973 in Geography from the University of Michigan. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled 'An evaluation of the variance minimization principle in river channel adjustment,' and a chapter on adjustment of supraglacial streams was published.Dozier, J. (1976). An examination of the variance minimization tendencies of a supraglacial stream. Journal of Hydrology, 31, 359-380. In 1971, he joined California State University, Hayward as a lecturer and taught there until he moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1974. In 1974, Dozier went to the Hindu Kush for his sixth climbing expedition. While crossing a steep slope, Dozier realized that he had no idea whether that slope might avalanche. That experience moved his research interest towards Snow and Avalanches.  Career  In 1974, Dozier joined University of California, Santa Barbara as an Assistant Professor, becoming Associate Professor in 1980 and Full Professor in 1985. From 1987 to 1990, he worked as a senior member of the technical staff and the Project Scientist for a potential spectroscopy space mission at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. From 1990 to 1992 he worked at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as the Senior Project Scientist at the start of NASA's Earth Observing System,Dozier, J. (1990).

Woodbury, NY: American Institute of Physics when its configuration was established. In 1992, with Gordon MacDonald and D. James Baker, he co-founded the MEDEA group, which investigated the use of classified data for environmental research, monitoring, and assessment. In 1994, Dozier founded the Bren School at UCSB and took on the position of its Dean until 2000. He was the chief scientist for the proposed NSF Waters Network from 2008 to 2010 and the principal investigator from 2018 to 2021 of the University of California multicampus Headwaters to Groundwater study, which also included scientists from the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. In 2016, Dozier was appointed as the Burges Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Washington, and in 2018 he served as a Visiting Distinguished Scientist for the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was an Editor of Geophysical Research Letters from 1991 to 1993.  Research and work  Dozier's research extends from detailed studies of snow hydrology to conception and implementation of remote sensing and information management systems that have facilitated developments in the broader Earth science community. He has led interdisciplinary studies in three areas: snow hydrology and biogeochemistry in the mountain environment and its extension to groundwater management in the surrounding lowlands; hydrologic science, environmental engineering, and social science in the water environment; and the integration of environmental science and remote sensing with computer science and technology. His work in the world's mountains addresses the storage and melting of snow that dominate the hydrologic cycle and have economic and social significance to the people who depend on snowmelt for their water resources.Mankin, J. S., Viviroli, D., Singh, D., Hoekstra, A. Y., & Diffenbaugh, N. S. (2015). The potential for snow to supply human water demand in the present and future. Environmental Research Letters, 10, 114016. Since mountain environments are rugged, remote, and sometimes uncomfortable, they are difficult to investigate, especially in seasons when snow is widespread. Dozier had insights about the study of mountain snow that continue to yield important benefits for Earth science and its social significance. Shortly after arriving at UC Santa Barbara in 1974, he appreciated that remote sensing from satellites would be the key to measuring snow properties and the energy balance that determines the rates of melting and sublimation, particularly over extensive, inaccessible terrains. His approaches took the view that the information from these satellites would best be interpreted through a rigorous examination of the physics of the sensors, and how the radiation they record interacts with the atmosphere, the ice crystals and liquid water in the snow pack, and the surrounding terrain. Then in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his experience with the EOS Data and Information System and opportunities to work with computer scientists on the National Academy's report on Computing the Future and the Sequoia 2000 projectStonebraker, M., Frew, J., & Dozier, J. (1993). The Sequoia 2000 project. In D. Abel & B. C. Ooi (Eds.), Advances in Spatial Databases (pp. 397-412). Berlin: Springer-Verlag. helped him learn how vast amounts of information, which would have to be transmitted and stored to conduct satellite-assisted environmental science, would require thoughtful design and management of very large information systems. Thus, Dozier's research has extended from ground-level studies of energy balance processes to laboratory and field techniques for measuring snow properties, to remote sensing, spatial modeling, and what has become known as environmental informatics.Frew, J. E., & Dozier, J. (2012). Environmental informatics. Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 37, 449-472. Dozier's work in remote sensing extended beyond snow. In 1980, he spent a year working for NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service in Maryland. There, he and Michael Matson observed tiny bright spots on a satellite image of the Persian Gulf. The image had been captured by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument on the NOAA-6 satellite, and the spots, they discovered, were campfire-sized flares caused by the burning of methane escaping from oil wells. It marked the first time that such a small fire had been seen from space. He and Matson were intrigued by the possibilities, and Dozier developed a mathematical method to identify small fires in pixels a kilometer in size. This method,Dozier, J. (1981). A method for satellite identification of surface temperature fields of subpixel resolution. Remote Sensing of Environment, 11, 221-229. published in 1981, became the foundation for nearly all subsequent satellite fire-detection algorithms. Dozier continued work in this area for several years studying thermal infrared remote sensing and how to calculate land surface temperature from space.Wan, Z., & Dozier, J. (1996). A generalized split-window algorithm for retrieving land-surface temperature from space. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 34, 892-905.

G. Vishwa Prasad. The film stars Madhavan, Anushka Shetty, Michael Madsen and Anjali in the lead roles. Although the film was intended to have no dialogues, it was later shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, with the latter version titled Silence. The films released, along with a dubbed Malayalam version, through Amazon Prime Video on 2 October 2020.  Plot  In 1972, a couple spending Christmas night at a villa near Seattle are mysteriously murdered, with the male victim being crucified. The county takes possession of the villa, which remains unsold until 2019 due to its reputation as a haunted house. Sakshi, a deaf-mute artist, travels with her fiancé to the villa to find a painting of a previous owner whose ghost is believed to have killed the couple. However, she runs away blood-stained after a while and gets hit by a car. Detective Maha and Captain Richard are assigned to investigate. It is revealed that Sakshi's fiancé has died in the basement, and as his corpse is taken out, a key falls from his hand. Maha interrogates Sakshi in the hospital, learning she found his body crucified and couldn't see the attacker. Maha then researches the victim, Anthony Gonsalves, a famous cello player whose previous wife committed suicide. As many girls have already gone missing in Seattle, the police are under heavy scrutiny, which Richard reacts poorly to due to the death of his wife two years prior. The initial investigation is inconclusive, so Sakshi is interviewed again. It is revealed that soon after her engagement with Anthony, Sakshi's best friend Sonali went missing. Sakshi recounts her past. She grew up in an orphanage in Sequim where she met Sonali. One day, she received an invitation to show her art in a Seattle gallery. Sonali, who is very possessive, doesn't agree but changes her mind after deciding to live with Sakshi. At the gallery, Sakshi meets Vivek, a photographer. Anthony, a new exhibition's guest of honour, meets Sakshi and is impressed with her work. He donates a million dollars to her orphanage and invites her to his concert. Sakshi attends and is mesmerised by his music. They grow closer, eventually fall in love and get engaged. After Sonali went missing, she decided to go to the villa for a week to relax and find the painting. Maha realises that Sonali wants all of Sakshi's attention after seeing similar behaviour in a child. She goes to the orphanage to investigate Sonali's disappearance suspecting a connection to Anthony's death. She learns Sonali's only friend was Sakshi, even getting arrested for stabbing someone who went out with her. Maha also discovers a drawing of crucifixion in Sonali's room. Concerned, Maha goes to Sakshi's house and encounters a hooded man who escapes after she shoots at him. The police search the villa again, hoping to discover evidence against Sonali. Tom finds the key in the basement brings it to Richard, who kills Tony and pockets it. Maha notices Richard's coat button next to Tom's corpse and suspects his involvement, so she breaks into his office and gets the key. She then trails Richard and follows him to a farmhouse in the outskirts of Seattle, which she discovers secretly belongs to Anthony. Richard searches for the house's CCTV footage to no avail and leaves. Soon afterwards, the hooded man, revealed to be Vivek who took the footage earlier, meets with Sakshi at the Space Needle, where a flashback occurs. Vivek and Sakshi became good friends and started living together with Sonali, who becomes jealous. Vivek is hurt but Sakshi explains Sonali's nature. When Sonali and Sakshi were baristas, a customer asked Sakshi out. Sonali insists that he is a flirt and tried to prove it. Sonali and Sakshi go out with him for coffee and Sonali rubbed his leg. He put his hand up Sonali's skirt under the table, so he brought his hand up and stabbed it with a fork, leading to her arrest. Vivek decides to give Sonali a chance and they begin to get along. With Sakshi's encouragement, Vivek and Sonali fall in love. Later on, when Anthony proposes to Sakshi, Sonali is visibly displeased. One day after Anthony's concert, his fans greet him. Some kiss him and even gave him their phone number. Sonali tries to convince Sakshi that Anthony is also a flirt, but Sakshi dismisses her. Sonali texts him flirtatiously to prove it. He refuses at first, but eventually agrees to meet her. Sakshi reassured Sonali that he doesn't have bad intentions, but Sonali went to meet him anyway, with Sakshi secretly observing them. She sees them drink and get intimate in the farmhouse. However, Anthony suddenly kills Sonali. Richard arrives at the scene and helps Anthony clean the scene. Sakshi left unnoticed and told Vivek what happened. They went to the police station, where she recognised Richard. Anthony brought Sakshi to Richard again to report Sonali's disappearance, where she saw a poster for a girl who gave Anthony her number. Sakshi discovered the dates of the disappearances coincides with Anthony's concerts. She planned to take revenge with Vivek by deceiving Anthony to go to the villa so that Vivek can kill him. After Anthony is knocked out and restrained, they interrogate him after he wakes up. Anthony reveals that he killed his wife and her lover at a motel for their unfaithfulness. Richard entered the room and decided to let him continue. When he went to meet Richard outside, Richard reveals he had come to the same motel to investigate his wife who was also cheating on him in another room. Anthony then proceeded to kill Richard's wife, and Richard helps cover up the murders. Subsequently, Anthony begins killing all unfaithful women who hit on him and Richard hides all the bodies and evidence. Upon hearing this, Sakshi killed him in anger. In the present, Sakshi and Vivek decide to expose Richard to the FBI using the footage. However, Richard kidnaps Vivek and holds him hostage. Maha, who put a tracker on Richard's car earlier, shows up, kills Richard, and saves them. Afterwards, Richard and Anthony's crimes are finally proven. Anthony's murder officially remains unsolved. The film ends with Sakshi and Vivek paying respects to Sonali at her grave.  Cast  *R. Madhavan as Anthony Gonsalves *Anushka Shetty as Sakshi *Michael Madsen as Richard Dawkins *Anjali as Mahalakshmi *Subbaraju as Vivek *Shalini Pandey as Sonali *Srinivas Avasarala as Purna Chandra Rao  Production  In 2013, director Hemant Madhukar re-watched Singeetam Srinivasa Rao's dialogue-less film Pushpaka Vimana (1987) and developed a desire to make a similar dialogue-less film. He was keen to explore the idea with a hearing and speech impaired protagonist. Once he wrote the story that would become Nishabdham, he pitched it to the PVP Group for production, but there was no progress for months despite PVP liking the idea. Madhukar then discussed the project with screenwriter Kona Venkat, who helped improvise the script and develop the screenplay. Venkat felt it had potential to be an \\"international project\\", and included dialogues. R. Madhavan and Taapsee Pannu were signed on to play the lead roles, though the actress later opted out citing a scheduling conflict. Venkat later narrated the script to Anushka Shetty on a flight, and she joined the project. Anjali was cast as an American police officer, while American actor Michael Madsen was cast in an important role. Shalini Pandey, Subbaraju, and Srinivas Avasarala were cast in supporting roles. Principal photography began in May 2019. The filming took place predominantly in the United States, with a 60-day long schedule. The film was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, while international actors spoke their lines in English.  Release  The film was scheduled to be released on 31 January 2020 but was postponed to 2 April 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the film's release was postponed indefinitely. The official trailer was launched by Amazon Prime Video on 21 September 2020. The film was released through Prime Video on 2 October 2020 in Telugu and Tamil languages, along with dubbed versions in Kannada and Malayalam.  Reception  Regarding the Telugu version, The Times of India gave the film three out of five stars and stated, \\"Nishabdham on the whole promises to be a treat, not just to Anushka’s fans but to movie buffs who love thrillers too. Sadly, it doesn’t always live up to that promise because all it ends up being is a stylish film with no depth\\". Regarding the Tamil version, The Times of India gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and noted that \\"Silence is meant to be a whodunit, but the moment you get the plot points, the film stops being one\\" and additionally stated that \\"the Tamil version resembles a dubbed film\\". Karthik Kumar of Hindustan Times called Nishabdham \\"a colossal mess\\", and added, \\"Despite the presence of some talented stars like Anushka and Madhavan, the film is excruciatingly boring and lacks the thrills to keep one invested throughout.\\" Sowmya Rajendran writing for The News Minute, opined that \\"The ideas must have sounded good on paper but the writing and execution, unfortunately, don't hold up.\\" While appreciating the performances of Shetty and Pandey, Sowmya wrote \\"Michael Madsen as police chief Richard Dickens deserved more to his character. With a limp and a swagger, he does his best with what he's given.\\"  Music  The film's music was composed by Gopi Sundar, whereas the lyrics for the Telugu version are written by Bhaskarabhatla, Sreejo, Krishna Kanth, and Ramajogayya Sastry. The song \\"Ninne Ninne\\" in Telugu and \\"Neeye Neeye\\" in Tamil was released as single from the album on 17 December 2019 on the YouTube page of Mango Music. The song was sung by Sid Sriram in Telugu and Alap Raju in Tamil. Madhuramithe in Telugu and Pudhu Unarve in Tamil were released on 29 September 2020.

Sansom (2000:241) In that year, Eijuō-maru's uncle Ōi Mochimitsu managed to have him appointed to the post of Kantō kubō, nominally the Shōguns deputy in the Kantō region, and Eijuō-maru changed his name to Ashikaga Shigeuji.Kokushi Daijiten Vol. 10 (1983:162) However, Shōgun Yoshimasa, not trusting Shigeuji, nominated his ally Uesugi Noritada as kanrei with the task of keeping him informed of whatever was happening in Kamakura. The relationship between the two men, already difficult because of the role the Uesugi had had in Mochiuji's death, was therefore strained from the beginning.Tension culminated with Shigeuji's 1454 killing of Uesugi Noritada, who was invited to Shigeuji's mansion where he was murdered. This killing caused the Kantō region ro fall into chaos as all of the Uesugi vassals rose in revolt against Shigeuji. This conflict was later known as the Kyōtoku Incident. Shogun forces led by Imagawa Noritada defeated Shigeuji at Kamakura in 1455 and he fled back Koga, where he later became known as the Koga kubō. The Uesugi clan asked Ashikaga Yoshimasa to send someone to replace Shigeuji, so Yoshimasa sent his younger brother, Ashikaga Masatomo, from Kyoto. However, as many clans in the Kantō region remained loyal to Shigeuji and suspicious of the intentions of the Kyoto-based shogunate, Masatomo found that he was unable to even enter Kamakura. Instead, he set up his headquarters in HorigoeSeveral sources, for example Sansom and Papinot, use the reading Horikoshi. in Izu Province, which was thereafter known as the Horigoe Gosho. Thus, per the historian George Bailey Sansom, the Kantō therefore found itself with two rulers, one in Koga and one in Horigoe, neither of whom was able to rule. The precise site of the Horigoe Gosho was not certain for many years, but was by tradition held to be at this location due to its local place name. Excavation surveys in 2007 and 2008 found the foundations of a large structure and the remains of an garden with ponds, indicating the presence of a Muromachi-period palace, confirming that the Horigoe Palace was most likely at this location.

Willcocks worked in shipbuilding from an early age, and joined the Associated Shipwrights' Society. He slowly rose to prominence, and became known for his skills in negotiation, in which he was involved as early as World War I. He was on the right wing of the union, and hoped that a Labour government could eliminate inflation, thereby reducing industrial conflict. He was elected as the union's assistant general secretary in 1929, and worked closely with the union's leader, William Westwood, the two also being close friends outside work. In 1939, Westwood was appointed as the government chief labour adviser, leaving him with insufficient time to attend to union business. Willcocks began filling the role and, given his experience, especially of wartime conditions, proved successful. He was officially made acting general secretary in 1941 and, due to the increased demand for shipbuilding during World War II, the union's membership rose from 20,000 to nearly 30,000 over the next few years. At the end of the war, Westwood was appointed to the government, and so retired from union business, and the union's executive appointed Willcocks as the union's permanent general secretary without holding an election, a decision which was approved by a vote of the union's members. The same year, he was additionally elected as the president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, serving for two years. By the start of 1948, Willcocks was in poor health, and he retired at the end of March, dying just over a month later. In his spare time, he served as a magistrate in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Mihran Chirinian, an ethnic Armenian, and Alexander Adamides, an ethnic Greek, assisted him in the translations of content in volumes 1–3 and 5, and 6, respectively. According to Strauss, as \\"Characteristically Greek is the treatment of Turkish\\" and in the initial section several technical words from Ottoman Turkish had been \\"almost slavishly [transcribed] from Greek\\", some translations in the collection in fact originated from Greek instead of Ottoman Turkish and were done by translators unaware of Ottoman Turkish conventions. Reception D. G. Hogarth, in a review of Corps de droit ottoman for The English Historical Review, described Législation ottomane as \\"well-known\\" but also \\"as inaccurate as it is incomplete\\".

Leonard Knight Elmhirst was its first Director. Overview Rabindranath was engaged in his zamindari work in his family estates at Shilaidaha and Patisar during 1890s. In an address to the workers of Sriniketan in 1939, he said, “Gradually the sorrow and poverty of the villagers became clear to me, and I began to grow restless to do something about it ….from that time onward I continuously endeavoured to find out how villagers’ mind could be aroused, so that they themselves could accept responsibility for their own lives.“ Tagore wrote, “Life in villages must be made more attractive, work and joy must be combined and an aesthetic sense should be developed.“ The village-oriented activities at Sriniketan were multi-faceted. “In Sikha-Satra and Sikha-Charcha-Bhavana, the village boys belonging to all castes received education as well as instruction in music, agriculture, hygiene and sanitation and also in village craft. Experiments were undertaken for varieties of new crops that may be suitable for local conditions in the department of agriculture. Scientific experiments were made in dairy and animal husbandry for improvement of financial conditions of village people. Revival of cottage industries and introduction of new ones was the main motto of the activities in Silpa-Bhavana. Thus, income from agriculture could be supplemented with the help of rural industries. Village Welfare Department took initiative for public works like road repairing, tank cleaning and maintaining a circulation library. Brati Balak or boy-scouts organization and Maternity and Child Welfare section were established in 1940. A number of Co-operative Health Societies provided medical treatment at a low cost for the villagers…” History In 1921 Rabindranath bought a large manor house with surrounding lands in Surul, 3 km from Santiniketan, from the Sinhas of Raipur. He set up the Institute of Rural Reconstruction in the manor house, in 1922 with Leonard Knight Elmhirst as its first Director. Rathindranath Tagore, Santosh Chandra Majumdar, Gourgopal Ghosh, Kalimohan Ghosh and Kim Taro Kasahara joined Elmhirst.Basak, Tapan Kumar, Rabindranath- Santiniketan-Sriniketan, An Introduction, pp. 6-8, BB Publication The second but contiguous campus of Visva Bharati was subsequently located around the same place in 1923 and it came to be known as Sriniketan. Silpa Bhavana at Santiniketan had already started training in handicrafts. Sriniketan took over the work with the objective bringing back life in its completeness to the villages and help people to solve their own problems instead of solution being imposed on them from outside. An emphasis was laid on a scientific study of the village problem before a solution was attempted. In consonance with such ideas about reconstruction of village life a new type of school meant mainly for the children of neighbouring villages, who would eventually bring the offering of their acquired knowledge for the welfare of the village community, was also conceived. Siksha-Satra was such a school set up at Santiniketan in 1924 but shifted to Sriniketan in 1927. The Loka-Siksha Samsad an organisation for the propagation of non-formal education amongst those who had no access to usual educational opportunities, was started in 1936. Siksha Charcha for training village school teachers followed next year. In 1963, an agricultural college was set up in Sriniketan and in 1977 Rural Research Centre was set up. The institute Just because Santiniketan is home to such institutions as Kala Bhavana and Sangit Bhavana, it must not be assumed that Visva-Bharati came to represent only a dreamy aesthetic outlook that ignored the harsh realities of everyday life. Tagore founded an Institute of Rural Reconstruction in 1922. The place came to be known as Sriniketan (Abode of well-being). He launched a vigorous programme of rural reform that aimed to address the problems that pervaded rural India in the early twentieth century, problems like poverty, disease, ignorance, superstition and caste. The Institute of Rural Reconstruction, known (in Bengali) as Palli Samgathana Vibhaga has four departments: Rural Extension Centre (Department of Adult, Continuing Education and Extension), Palli Charcha Kendra (a teaching department founded in 1977), Department of Social Work (a teaching department founded in 1963 and offers social work degrees at undergraduate, post-graduate and Ph D levels) and Silpa Sadan (a Centre for Rural Craft, Technology and Design). Palli Siksha Bhavana (Institute of Agricultural Science), also located at Sriniketan, is a separate institute that imparts education in agricultural sciences. Silpa Sadana (earlier called Silpa Bhavana) offers 2-year (1 year training + 1 year practice) in leather craft, book binding and handmade packaging, batik work and handmade paper making. It offers 3-year (2 years training + I year practice) in handloom weaving, wood work and pottery. The eligibility for both the courses is passed at least class VIII and age preferably between 16 and 25 years.Siksha Charcha offers 2-year D El Ed course.Palli Charcha Kendra offers a 2-year post graduate course in Rural Development. The Rural Extension Centre (Department of Adult, Continuing Education and Extension) is one of the oldest units under Palli Samgathana Vibhaga, Visva-Bharati. It has been actively engaged in improving the condition of the villagers since its inception. The idea is to encourage the villagers to become self-reliant through formation of village development societies, self-help groups, Brati organisations, mohila samities and the like. The area of operation of the unit spread over 43 villages under 8 Gram Panchayats in 2 blocks of Bolpur Sriniketan and Illambazar. Indian Council of Agricultural Research established the Krishi Vigyan Kendra mandated for the district of Birbhum, West Bengal in 1994 under the administrative control of Palli Siksha Bhavana. It was named as Rathindra Krishi Vigyan Kendra to pay tributes, homage and regards to Rathindranath Tagore, the man who was the guiding force behind the whole “Sriniketan Experiment”. Sriniketan model: evaluation Santiniketan leather bag with batik design Recent studies have been highlighting the concepts and role of the institute in uplifting the local economy: “In the village of Surul, renamed Sriniketan, adjacent to Santiniketan, he (Rabindranath Tagore) started an Institute of Rural Reconstruction with the help of a Cornell-trained English agricultural expert, Leonard Elmhirst. The kind of work that was begun here has since been repeated and elaborated in many programmes of self-help in India. For instance, Sriniketan pioneered the manufacture of hand-crafted leather purses and handbags, a cottage industry which has, since then, taken off elsewhere as well and now exports products to many parts of the world.”Santiniketan Leather Goods have secured GI tag. “The small scale cottage industry and handicraft items of Sriniketan are identified as special ethnic and traditional products, recognised nationally and even internationally with high esteem. Students of Tagore’s art and craft centre at Sriniketan and the artists of Kala Bhavana are known for their extra-ordinary skill and craftsmanship. The surrounding part of the rural economy at this region is basically thriving on a plural economy, sometimes contributing to seasonal sustenance of village families. \\"A number of survey reports in the Surul village adjoining Sriniketan reveal that the dwelling units of this village are mostly living on traditional kantha stitch designing on silk and cotton sarees and other accessories, upholsteries continuing throughout the year. These items involve most of the women of the villages from mainly minority and backward classes who have developed unique skills through repetitive and voluminous productivity. The men of these families search for market outlets and help these products fetching a fair price. It is very interesting to note that now-a-days this particular occupation has taken a systematic mass engagement pattern where a number of self-help groups with cluster of at least 9 to 11 or more women together, earning their daily wages and even forming a co-operative for financial support through micro-finance. Local village handicrafts at the Saturday Haat at Sonajhuri \\"NIFT, the nation-level textile organisation has been working on this model and a good number of NGOs are also coming forward for utilising these rich resource of skilled artisans. These products fortunately earned reputation not only in the local and national markets, emporiums, shops and exhibitions but they are also exported outside to attract a special focus on ladies and gents fashion statements. \\"Kantha stitch occupies the centre stage of Sriniketan’s sustainable economy, there are many more which endowed value to develop Tagore’s dreams of turning Sriniketan as a hub of multi-dimensional artist…Leather goods and handicrafts are equally adorable. Terracota is another speciality masterpiece of the region. The modern architectural interiors, wall designing, roof and floor tiles and decoration pieces are mostly crafted with this material capturing the craze of the modern designers… the thermocole Durga, Ganesha, replica of temples of repute exhibit amazing signs of excellence and signature expertise… Plants and plantation export- based programmes are expanding due to the fertile soil and a number of people are working on it which may convert the important destination Sriniketan into a piece of Green Earth where florists and agriculturists tirelessly dedicate them into creating beautiful nurseries of plants and flowers of special types including orchids and medicinal plants and thus toiling on lush greenery of crops and harvests…\\" See also *Notable people associated with Santiniketan References Category:Rural development organisations in India Category:Visva-Bharati University Category:Educational institutions established in 1922 Category:Education in West Bengal Category:Rabindranath Tagore ","title":"Palli Samgathana Vibhaga"},{"id":"61768881","text":"Grant Alan Robins (born 1969), is a male former swimmer who competed for England.

The house had been acquired by Jeremiah Colman MP in 1877 and was demolished to make way for County Hall. The new county hall building was designed by Reginald Uren. Built with a steel and reinforced concrete frame and faced with glazed tiles and brick, it cost £2.5 million. Norfolk Police were accommodated within the building alongside the council chamber and committee rooms. The building was officially opened by the Queen on 24 May 1968.

No culprit was identified.\\"Poisoned Chocolade Drops for Peggy O'Neil\\" aus Washington Post vom 5. Dezember 1920 In the autumn of 1928, at the National Radio Exhibition she noticed John Logie Baird's television in the Olympia, London. There she was invited to perform some Irish songs, which helped to popularise the invention. This helped the new medium to gain additional popularity.R.F. Tiltman, \\"The entertainment value of television today\\", November 1928. Beleg: She was also the first person who has ever been interviewed on television. The conversation took place in April 1930 on the occasion of the Ideal Home Exhibition in Southampton. O'Neill appeared in small supporting roles in films from 1913, and by 1938 had played a role in 23 feature-length and short films. Roles in The Razor's Edge, Let's Dance and (body doubling for Ingrid Bergman) Joan of Arc followed. As a painter, she presented three oil paintings to the public Wertheim Gallery and Burlington Gardens. The 1930s, O'Neil suffered financially and physically. In 1935 she had to declare bankruptcy, which she put down to inexperience and carelessness.  Later years and death  From the mid-1940s, she were increasingly plagued by arthritic pain, which soon led to her being unable to leave home and relying on a wheelchair. She died impoverished on 7 January 1960 at Middlesex Hospital from heart failure. She was laid to rest in the St Pancras and Islington Cemetery. The \\"Actors' Benevolent Fund\\" paid for the funeral. However, there is no grave stone. which points to the grave. O'Neil died a spinster and had no children.  Peggy O'Neil song  In 1921, Harry Pease, Ed. G. Nelson and Gilbert Dodge wrote the waltz Peggy O'Neil (\\"Peggy O'Neil is a girl who could steal any heart, anywhere ...\\") published by Leo Feist. The song became very popular, and was covered several times.

Early on, she was brought under strong religious influences. After being widowed herself, she developed an affinity for the widows of the Crimean War, Indian Rebellion of 1857, and 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, and provided them with support. Her simple and graphic letters narrated her life's work. Early life and education Elizabeth Maria Lloyd was born in 1812/13. Her father was Hannibal Evans Lloyd (1770–1847), a Welsh philologist and translator. Her mother was Lucy Anna Margaretta von Schwartzkopff (1782/3–1855), from Hamburg. She read English classics under her father, and received education about morals from her mother. The paternal great-grandmother, a Highlander, and a Jacobite, and it was said in one source that she changed clothes with Prince Charlie and allowed herself to be taken in his stead, till he was well away. Her grandfather was a Welshman, General Lloyd, known as a tactician. The father, Hannibal, had visited Germany during the French period, and recited his perceptions of battles, sieges, and escapes. Career In 1850, in London, she married Dr. James Bowen Thompson, a Scottish physician and missionary of similar religious sympathies. He was the head of the British Syrian Hospital at Damascus from 1843 to 1848. He had large plans for Syria, and hoped to open it out by providing railways to India along the valley of the Euphrates. In pursuance of this scheme, the husband and wife went first to Constantinople, and then settled on some property which the doctor owned near Antioch. She soon mastered the language, and was sorry for the women and their degraded state. She formed several little schools. During the year and a half of their residence, they gave the schools a good start. When they left, they donated the work to a native Christian teacher and some Armenians, with the hope that it would be carried on. When the Crimean War broke out in 1853, Dr. Bowen Thompson offered his medical experience to the Government. He had gained much knowledge of Eastern epidemics, and he wanted to give his service to the English government. In Balaklava, Dr. Bowen Thompson was stricken with the endemic typhoid fever. He was also a victim of red tapeism: as a \\"civilian\\", he could not be taken into the military hospital, but was left on board ship on 5 August 1855. It was a horrible experience, and Bowne Thompson wrote to Queen Victoria, explaining what had happened. The Queen was said to have taken measures that no such mistake should be mad againe. After burying her husband, Bowen Thompson made her home with her sister in England. She became involved with social work projects. When the Indian Rebellion of 1857 (1857–58) followed the Crimean War, Bowen Thompson joined the Lady Mayoress' Committee at the Mansion House and threw herself into providing necessaries for the sufferers. She formed an Association for the Wives of Soldiers under the patronage of the Queen. The massacre of the Maronites by the Syrian Druses during the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war attracted Bowen Thompson's sympathy. All the males from 7–70 years of age had been killed. She gave generously providing stores and clothing but she wanted to be in Syria with the widows. She started in October 1860, intending to spend the next half-year at Beirut. There, she met some of these women to consult as to what could best be done for them. \\"We look,\\" they said, \\"to England to do us justice for the blood of our husbands and sons.\\" In 1860, the plan for an industrial refuge -an association for the improvement of the condition of the Syrian women- rapidly formed itself in her mind. 20,000 women were crowding the city eager to get work at even road-mending, destitute after the massacre. Ignorance and deeply-cherished revenge chiefly characterised them. She opened a class in her hotel. The landlord himself became the first pupil. She secured an Arabic teacher. The scheme began to run. Already she saw her future school at Beirut. It was to have a classroom for little children, an industrial department for women and girls, a department for obtaining work for the unemployed, and a store-room for the supplies which she confidently expected would flow in from England. In fact, the school was plain. She was very fortunate in securing, at this stage, the co-operation of Mr. and Mrs. Mott, who devoted themselves to carry out the same ends. By the end of 1861, a house was secured. It was at once occupied by some 30 Hasbeyan widows. The number increased so rapidly that within a month, three schools were in active operation. Subscriptions began to come in, and interest in the work grew. Soon a fourth school was started in a stable. Still, the number of applicants were greater than she could receive. Yet another school was filled with 90 children, and a few days later a fifth school was formed for young women. She also found it necessary to open a girls' school for the upper classes, who were willing to pay a fee for the privilege of having their daughters educated by an English woman rather than by the French nuns. Lord Shaftesbury was much interested in all that was being done, and gave the weight of hisname and influence to procure Bowen Thompson the financial help she required. But all on the spot were quite enthusiastic. The officers of the fleet anchored off Beirut used to send her all their washing to be done by her women in the laundry which she set up. One of the captains presented her with a mangle, and the ship's carpenters put up all the fittings. Once, when money ran short and she could not pay her widows for their work, she called them and bid them all join in prayer with her to ask for help. That day, a visit was paid by the harem of a Turkish Pasha. The women presented a purse of piastres on leaving the school, and when Bowen Thompson came to count the coins, she found that they totalled up to three Turkish liras, or exactly the sum which was needed to pay her widows. In the early summer of 1862, the schools were visited by the then Prince of Wales, His Majesty, King Edward VII. This was a great event. The Prince was greeted by the children with the British National Anthem, and was much pleased with all he saw. After some practical questions which proved how thoroughly he comprehended what was being done, the Prince contributed 25 Napoléons to the school, and gave a large order for embroidery. A school was soon started at Hasbaya, where one of the most terrible of the massacres had taken place. Bowen Thompson went throughout the whole district planning where best her centres of education might be planted. From Hasbeya, she ascended Mount Hermon, and from its summit, was able to down upon the land. When Canon Henry Baker Tristram visited the neighbourhood, some while after, the women inquired if he had any things which needed to be washed, or clothes to be mended. He noted, \\"... that the benefits of Mrs. Thompson's education descended to the very practical details of everyday life, and when I told them that Sitt (Mrs.) Thompson was a dear friend of mine, they clapped their hands for joy.\\" In 1864, there were already eighteen schools in full swing, and still more places asked for them. The seventh annual examination of scholars took place in 1867 at Beirut. During three days, everyone in Beirut society, came out to see the children. On one occasion there were about a thousand people present. In 1867, the governor of Mount Lebanon, Daoud Pasha was so impressed by Bowen Thompson that he gave her his confidence and support. The Pasha accompanied her to the village of Afn Zahalteh, where she wanted permission to open a school. He offered his arm and went with her to seek a suitable house, but they were defeated by the squalor. Bowen Thompson later received the offer of part of a dirty house. She therefore tied a handkerchief over her head, and set to work, till others followed her example. After a while carpenters and masons gave their help to put up partitions and stop holes, besides putting up shelves and benches. When the Pasha returned he found a transformation. He contributed 1000 francs toward the new school- house, to replace the temporary room. Later on, a school was started at Damascus by Pasha. As usual, Bowen Thompson did not stop to consider ways and means, but just commenced. Having found the right teacher, she arranged to pay her a monthly salary The Maronite priests were opposed to starting a school at Zachleh, but they protested in vain. The schoolhouse, built in Moorish style, was constructed on the steep side of the village hill. Bowen Thompson could not have set on foot so many branches of work had not her sister and brother- in-law (Mr. Mentor Mott) from England joined her. Their home in England having been burned down (all family records and correspondence were destroyed by the fire which consumed their mansion at East Coombe two months after Bowen Thompson left for Syria), they resolved, rather than rebuild, to put their means and their lives to work for the Syrian people. A younger sister had already been helping Bowen Thompson for some time, so that there were four members of her family in Syria. After nine years, she had established 23 schools, containing approximately 1,700 pupils under 56 teachers. These schools became centres of Gospel teaching and secular knowledge. Many settlements applied to have a school opened. Infant schools, orphanages, Sunday schools, schools for cripples, Moslem boarding schools, and schools for the blind were in proper working order throughout the Lebanon, supported by her sister and Bowen Thompson. Later years During the summer of 1869, Bowen Thompson suffered much from weakness. In the early autumn she returned to her sister at Blackheath. Toward the end, she asked them to telegraph Beirut and ask that the children might pray for her. She died on 14 November 1869. After her death her writings were edited and published in 1872 as \\"The Daughters of Syria\\".

It opened its main line in 1857, and was worked by the Great Northern Railway. The line shortened the GNR route to Leeds. The Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway system in 1857The BW&LR; later built a branch line from near Wakefield to Batley, opening in stages to 1863. In that year it changed its name to the West Yorkshire Railway, and planned a branch line from Lofthouse to Methley, forming an eastwards link to other companies' lines. It agreed to make the line jointly with the North Eastern Railway and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and the branch line became the Methley Joint Railway, opening in 1865. In that year the West Yorkshire Railway (former BW&LR;) was absorbed by the Great Northern Railway. The original main line is part of the present-day electrically operated Doncaster to Leeds main line. Origins At the conclusion of a Parliamentary struggle, the Great Northern Railway was authorised in 1846 to build a railway line from London to York. York was already reached from London by linked railways in the group controlled by George Hudson, the so-called Railway King. His business methods were tough and effective, but they were also underhand and dishonest, and eventually he was found out and disgraced. The Great Northern Railway promoters had wanted branches to Sheffield and Leeds, but these were cut out of the authorisation in Parliament. Leeds was an important commercial centre, and the GNR had to take alternative steps to reach it. For a time the only possibility was over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway from Askern Junction (north of Doncaster) to Knottingley and Methley, and from there over the Midland Railway to Gelderd Junction, immediately outside the Leeds Central station. GNR trains making that journey finally reached the station by reversing over a short length of the Leeds and Thirsk Railway. The first GNR trains reached Leeds by this route on 1 October 1849. The Midland Railway was firmly under the control of George Hudson and was therefore hostile to the GNR, but Hudson was at the final stage of his powers and his initial antagonism became ineffective.Martin Bairstow, The Great Northern Railway in West Yorkshire, Wyvern Publications, Skipton,1982, , page 4 On 1 August 1854, the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway opened its line between Leeds and Bowling, near Bradford. Great Northern Railway trains ran over it, reaching Halifax over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. For the first time a direct communication from Halifax to London without break of journey was created. Although the LB&HJR; was independent, the beginnings of a Great Northern Railway network in West Yorkshire were visible.Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 – 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, page 140 Authorisation Nevertheless, there were still some significant gaps in the railway system, and another independent company, the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway secured its authorising Act on 10 July 1854. Authorised share capital was £180,000.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 97Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 257 It was to be built from the Wakefield station of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, via Ardsley, to Wortley Junction on the LB&HJR;, near Leeds. Wortley Junction was to be formed as a triangular junction, enabling direct running from Wakefield towards Bradford and Halifax.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , pages 63 and 64 The originating point was Ings Road Junction, immediately west of the Wakefield station of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, later Wakefield Kirkgate station. The line was double track and stations were at Wakefield (Westgate), Lofthouse, and Ardsley.Wrottesley, page 98 Opening and train services The new line was opened on 5 October 1857, following a ceremonial opening on 3 October; it was worked by the Great Northern Railway which already worked the majority of trains on the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction line. GNR trains could already run from the south to Wakefield over the L&YR.; The opening of the BW&LR; gave the GNR direct access to Leeds without running over the rival Midland Railway, and without the necessity to reverse direction on the approach to Leeds itself. This was a very considerable advantage for the GNR, and from 12 November 1857 the company transferred most of its long-distance trains on to the route. Friction with the GNR; and possible amalgamation From November 1857 the GNR complained about poor permanent way conditions between Wakefield and Leeds, and threatened to transfer its traffic back to the Methley route of the Midland Railway. In October the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway gave notice that from 1 January 1858 it would appoint its own station staff. The GNR abruptly withdrew its engines and coal wagons, in effect ceasing to work the line. The BW&LR; hurriedly had to acquire engines and wagons of its own. For a few months it hired wagons from the GNR. In 1859 there was a proposal that the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway and the BW&LR; should amalgamate, but the idea came to nothing. In fact both lines were dependent on the Great Northern Railway for the majority of their income. Branch line to Ossett, and Batley The BW&LR; obtained an Act on 23 July 1860Wrottesley, pages 100 and 101 for a branch to Ossett. It was single line, and left the main line at Wrenthorpe [south] junction, just north of Wakefield. It ran as far as Roundwood colliery, carrying mineral traffic from 6 January 1862. Soon after it was extended to a station named \\"Ossett\\", in fact at Flushdyke, opening on 7 April 1862, but minerals had been carried between Roundwood Colliery sidings and Wrenthorpe since 6 January.Bairstow, page 63 Captain Rich of the Board of Trade inspected the new line on 12 March 1864 and found it satisfactory, and the remainder of the line to Ossett was opened for traffic on 2 April 1864. It was a single line, 65 chains long, and there was a viaduct with three brick arches of 30 feet span. A new platform at a higher level was provided at Flushdyke, although to reach it passengers had to cross the rails of the earlier line. The BW&LR; had obtained an Act on 17 May 1861 to further extend the line to Batley, a distance of 3 miles 55 chains. The new line was to make a junction with the LB&HJR; line at Batley.Wrottesley says that the line had its own station at Batley, just south of the junction with the LB&HJR.; In fact the Ossett line had its own platforms, forming an extension to the existing station. The works were considerable, including two tunnels: Chickenley Heath (47 yd) and Shaw Cross (209 yd). The single line route opened on 15 December 1864. The combined branches formed a third route between Wakefield and Bradford.Wrottesley, page 101 Change of name In the 1863 session of Parliament the BW&LR; sought powers to change its name to the West Yorkshire Railway, and this was sanctioned by an Act of 21 July 1863. Methley joint line Also in the 1863 session of Parliament the BW&LR; sought powers for a branch to Methley, and this too was sanctioned by the Act of 21 July 1863, giving running powers over the North Eastern Railway from Methley to Castleford. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the North Eastern Railway had opposed this line, but they had acquiesced on the promise of its being made joint with them. This was ratified by an Act of 23 June 1864, and the line became known as the Methley joint line, or the Methley Joint Railway. The railway diverged from the West Yorkshire Railway at Lofthouse North junction, and joined the North Eastern Railway at Methley Joint Line junction; there was a spur at Methley connecting to the L&YR.; The line opened in August 1865 for goods traffic, but passenger working was delayed until 1 June 1869.Wrottesley, page 102H C Casserley, Britain's Joint Lines, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1968, , page 156 The south curve at Lofthouse was brought into use on 1 May 1876.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 21 and 22 Amalgamation with the Great Northern Railway Great Northern Railway lines in West Yorkshire in 1921The West Yorkshire Railway, together with the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway, had become dominated by the Great Northern Railway, which operated their trains, and the occasional talk of absorption by the GNR became serious. In the face of strenuous L&YR; opposition, the West Yorkshire Railway (former BW&LR;) as well as the LB&HJR; passed into GNR possession. The GNR took over working of the WYR on 1 January 1865, ratified by an Act of 5 July; the one third share of the Methley Joint line became GNR property from 5 September. The WYR shareholders were guaranteed a minimum dividend of 6%.Wrottesley, page 103 West Riding and Grimsby Railway On 1 February 1866 the West Riding and Grimsby Railway was opened, jointly owned by the Great Northern Railway and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. Part of the line formed a direct link between Doncaster and Wakefield, leading on to the former BW&LR; line. At last the GNR had a direct route under its own control from Doncaster to Leeds.Wrottesley, volume 1, page 160Joy, page 220 Ossett to Batley via Dewsbury The West Yorkshire Railway network had become an integral part of the Great Northern Railway system in the area. Batley LNWR and GN station; the GNR trains used the right-hand island platform.The Ossett and Batley line passed Dewsbury by, and the GNR decided to make a new line connecting Dewsbury into the system. An Act of 24 July 1871 authorised this. Work started on 9 April 1872; the project included doubling the line from Wrenthorpe junction to Ossett; this was completed to Runtlings Lane junction by August 1873. A new north curve was made at Wrenthorpe, opened to goods trains from March 1875 and passenger trains from 1 May 1876. The new line was 2 miles 1 chain in length to a temporary Dewsbury terminus station. Goods traffic to Dewsbury began on 1 May 1874 and passenger trains on 9 September, when a service of 14 each way on weekdays and five each way on Sundays was put on between Wakefield and Dewsbury. On 1 May 1876 six trains each way on weekdays and three on Sundays began between Leeds and Dewsbury via the new Wrenthorpe curve, increased to eight each way on weekdays in June.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 20 A collapse in the financial markets caused the GNR to defer proceeding to Batley, and the Parliamentary powers to do so lapsed; they were authorised once again by an Act of 12 July 1877.Joy, page 125 An agreement was made with the London and North Western Railway to rebuild Batley station: the new station had two island platforms, the GNR using the two faces on the east side. A permanent station with an island platform was provided at Dewsbury. The new double-track line was 1 mile 74 chains in length, from a new Dewsbury junction on the Ossett-Dewsbury line, leaving the temporary Dewsbury terminus station at the end of a 31 chain branch, thereafter used only for goods and minerals. General traffic began on the new line on 12 April 1880; most of the trains which had used the old West Yorkshire single line between Ossett and Batley were diverted via Dewsbury. The old line was now referred to as the Chickenley Heath branch.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 118 A railmotor operated a shuttle service between Ossett and Chickenley Heath, but a parallel tram service killed that off: it closed on 1 July 1909.Joy, page 90Bairstow, page 64 Headfield spur A connecting line was built at Dewsbury from Dewsbury Goods junction (formerly Dewsbury junction) to Headfield junction on the L&YR.; There was a fourteen span viaduct in its 49 chain length. Goods traffic began in 1887; the curve was sanctioned by the Board of Trade for passenger operation in October 1887, but no regular service was run until 1893, when a joint GNR/L&YR; Leeds-Pudsey-Cleckheaton-Batley-Leeds circular service was introduced.Wrottesley, volume 2, pages 140 and 141 Post-nationalisation closures The passenger service from Wakefield to Dewsbury (and on to Drighlington) closed from 8 September 1964.

Thus wardship for males ended at the age of 21, on the obtaining by the ward of a \\"proof of age\\" writ, issued after a Proof of age inquisition had obtained evidence from a jury of witnesses. Until that time a ward could be forced to marry a person of the warder's choosing, often his own child, and the resultant progeny would inherit the property formerly subject to the wardship at their father's death, usually regulated by the marriage settlement.

She was the daughter of Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax.  Early life  Born Emily Charlotte Wood, she was the second eldest of six children born to Sir Charles Woods and Lady Mary Woods (formally known as Grey). The Woods family were an old gentry family who were respectable York merchants. They reached this level of respectability through the discovery of coal on their ancestral estate; the great Barnsley field which help some of the Britain's richest and finest coal. In addition to this Sir Charles Woods had a successful political career, owning many seats in Garrowby and Pocklington near York; Hickleton near Doncaster and a home in London in Belgrave Square. She spent her childhood between Hickleton and London, in her diaries she described herself as a \\"joyous and head strong spirit\\". In according to J.G Lockhart her brothers colleague and biographer described her as being clever, capable but spoilt by her father making it hard for to interact with strangers as she could be difficult and dictatorial She was largely involved in her father's political career As a child she would often visit Buckingham palace, she was friends with princess Victoria, Helena and Louise, often visiting for them to play together. She was particularly close to her older brother Charles, whom she would later rely on after the passing of her husband in 1871.  Marriage and Temple Newsam  In 1864 she married Hugo Meynell-Ingram, who was the last surviving descendant of Sir Arthur Ingram. He was eighteen years older than her and they met at through a mutual friend (Lady Harcourt) whilst Emily was visiting Chiswick. They came from two very politically different houses the Woods, Emily's side of the family were Whig's. Whereas Hugo Meynell-Ingrams family were Tory. Once Emily and Hugo were married they spent most of their married lives at Hoar Cross in Staffordshire, using Temple Newsam as a place to stay when they went hunting. Hoar Cross was specifically built for the married couple by Henry Clutton in 1862. When her husband died in 1871 from a hunting accident, she became a widow and childless at the age of 31 after 8 years of marriage. She was devastated by her husband's death, to commemorate his memory she built a church near Hoar Cross Hall. Known as Hoar Cross Holy Angels Church. She inherited all of the Meynell Ingram properties and wealth. After losing her husband she came to rely on her family, with her younger brother (Fredrick) and his wife (Mary) who moved into Temple Newsam with her. In addition to this, she found great comfort in her Anglo-Catholic faith, spending time and money building new churches in memory of her husband and investing in charitable institutions. During this period of mourning Emily Ingram devoted her time to renovating and improving Temple Newsam. She particularly spent time to Improving the Jacobean features of the house, between 1877-1900 the Library became a Chapel, she Jacobean-ised the Great Hall adding a grand oak staircase. Emily was an ardent lover of art and a practising artist. In her prime she was an accomplished sketcher and water colourist, with most of her work being passed down through the Meynell-Ingram descendants. She had acquired a large collection primarily from the 17th century. Coincidentally, prior to owning the collection, in a letter to her brother on 5th of June 1860 she wrote about her love of 17th Century art and how she hoped to own some paintings of her own from the period.https://leedsartfund.org/files/calendar/No%20-%20%20106%201990.pdf Due to the values of the time and her religious beliefs any pieces in her collection which were thought to be distasteful or erotic were either disposed of or cleaned up concealing any offensive elements. In addition to all the estates and wealth Emily inherited from her marriage, she became the proud owner of the a 360-ton schooner (yacht) with a full-time crew of over thirty people. She would take the yacht sailing for a few weeks every year, usually travelling through Europe and Mediterranean; with a party of friends and family to escape the formalities and restrictions of everyday. She would often bringing back artefacts from her travels for her homes or churches.https://www.achs.org.uk/Documents/Newsletter-Autumn2016.pdf Through her inheritance, charity work and renovations, Emily Ingram became one of the richest and most independent women in the country. Often throwing lavish dinners and shooting parties. One highlight of her social career was hosting King George V and Queen Mary in 1894 on their official visit to Leeds. Emily Charlotte Meynell-Ingram died in 1904 at Temple Newsam House, her funeral was held at Hoar Cross Hall and was buried next to her husband at Hoar Cross Holy Angels Church. Since she and Hugo did not have any children, the Meynell- Ingram estates and wealth were passed down to her nephew. Today Temple Newsam House is maintained by Leeds City Council under Leeds Museums and Galleries. Hoar Cross Hall is now a spa resort with parts of the grounds being used a car park.  Religion and Buildings Church of the Holy Angels, Hoar Cross Emily Ingram was a well known and prominent Anglo-catholic, her family were heavily involved in the Anglo-catholic religion and church. Her Brother Charles Lindley Wood was the president of the English Church Union from 1868 to 1919. Between 1972-1876, Emily Ingram had the Hoar Cross church of Holy angels built in remembrance of her husband. Within the church there is a chapel containing two marble effigies; one of Hugo Meynell- Ingram and the other of Emily Meynell Ingram lying next to each other. She hired the architect George Fredrick Bodley to build the church and was in charge of the furnishing within it. The church is decorated with marble flooring, reredos, screens and a front cover. Emily also added several souvenirs from her travels. She also commissioned the buildings of the churches St Edwards in Holbeck (Leeds) and Altofts using her own expenses. Additionally, she was involved in the restoration of churches in Laughton. Being a devoted Anglo Catholic she would hold services on her yacht, the Ariadne. In addition to the many churches Emily Ingram built or renovated, she built a church home for boys, near Hoar Cross. In 1963 a magazine called Our Waifs and Strays reported that some of the boys had seen sightings of a friendly and useful ally thought to be Emily Ingram's ghost. The home was later closed in 1983.

It took its name from the International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts held in Paris in 1925. It was characterized by bold geometric forms, bright colors, and highly stylized decoration, and symbolized modernity and luxury. Art Deco architecture, sculpture, and decoration reached its peak at 1939 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, and in movie theaters, department stores, other public buildings. It also featured in the work of Paris jewelers, graphic artists, furniture craftsmen, and jewelers, and glass and metal design. Many Art Deco landmarks, including the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and the Palais de Chaillot, can be seen today in Paris. Origins Art Deco was the result of a long campaign by French decorative artists to gain equal status with the creators of paintings and sculpture. The term \\"arts décoratifs\\" was invented in 1875 to give designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The Société des artistes décorateurs (Society of decorative artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including Arts et décoration and L'Art décoratif moderne. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Sociéte des artistes français, and later in the Salon d'automne, which played a major role in popularizing the style. Parisian department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art Déco. Established firms including the luggage maker Louis Vuitton, silverware firm Christofle, glass designer René Lalique, and the jewelers Louis Cartier and Boucheron, who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900, department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 Salon d'Automne had been entrusted to the department store Printemps.Salon d'Automne 2012, exhibition catalogue During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called \\"Primavera\\". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV, Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by Louis Süe and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers, including Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann and Paul Follot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony, and ivory and silk, very bright colors and stylized motifs, particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look.Laurent, Stephane, \\"L'artiste décorateur\\", in Art Deco, 1910–1939 by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislain Wood (2002), Renaissance du Livre, pages 165–171 In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as Déco. Art Deco in architecture was particularly the result of a new technology, the use of reinforced concrete, which allowed buildings to be taller, stronger, and with fewer supporting beams and columns, and to take almost any possible shape. The first reinforced concrete house had been built by François Coignet in 1853. In 1877, another Frenchman, Joseph Monier, received a patent for a system of strengthening concrete with a mesh of iron rods in a grid pattern. Two French architects, Auguste Perret made very innovative use of the new system. Perret used it to construct the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1911–1913), with its vast space without supporting columns; and later, Henri Sauvage used it to construct the first apartment building built like a staircase, each apartment with its own terrace, and another major project, the new building of the La Samaritaine department store. =Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–1913)= The first major building to be constructed in the Art Deco style was the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–1913). The first design for the building was made by the Belgian Henry van de Velde, who was a major figure of the German Werkbund, an association promoting modern decorative arts. He began work on the design in 1910. Its principal feature was the sober and geometric structure of reinforced concrete. Auguste Perret, the French architect commissioned to build the structure, argued that Van de Velde's design was \\"materially impossible\\" and made his own design. After a dispute with the theater owners, Van de Velde resigned and departed, and Perret completed the building following his own plan in April 2013.Texier (2019) pg. 7 The sober geometric forms of the building, decorated with a long frieze by the sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, and its facade of concrete covered with marble plaques, was the complete opposite of the ornate Palais Garnier opera house, and caused a scandal. The lobby and the theater interior were equally revolutionary, open and austere, without the columns that blocked the view in many theaters. The decoration by Bourdelle and other artists was stylized and modern. The theater hosted the premieres of newest forms of music and dance the music of the period, The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky and the revolutionary ballets of the Ballets Russes. \\"La Danse\\", bas-relief dAntoine Bourdelle (Théâtre des Champs Elysées, Paris) (3713880263).jpgAntoine Bourdelle, La Danse, facade of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris (1912) File:Théâtre des Champs-Élysées DSC09330.jpgThéâtre des Champs-Élysées, by Auguste Perret, 15 avenue Montaigne, Paris, (1910–13).

The International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts (1925) The International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts held in Paris in 1925, was the largest and most important exhibition of art Deco, and later gave its name to the style. It had first been proposed in 1906, then scheduled for 1912 by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, particularly as a response to the popularity of the designs of the German Werkbund but then was postponed because of the War.Texier (2019) pg. 10-14 The Exposition was enormous, located between Les Invalides and the Grand Palais, on both sides of the Seine. Even the Pont Alexandre III bridge over the Seine was covered with a row of exhibition halls. The chief architect was Charles Plumet. The Four Towers of the Crafts, by , marked the center of the Exposition, surrounded by national pavilions and especially pavilions of the major Paris designers and department stores, which had their own design departments, and produced their own furniture and decoration. The pavilions of the department stores were gathered around the esplanade of Les Invalides.

The original La Samaritaine store was built in 1905 by architect Frantz Jourdain in the Art Nouveau style. In 1925 the store was enlarged with an Art Deco building facing the Seine, designed by Henri Sauvage. Sauvage was one of the major figures of Paris Art Deco; his other important works included the Studio Building and the Majorelle Building, built for the furniture designer Louis Majorelle, as well as the innovative apartment building at 26 rue Vavin (6th arr.) (1912–1914), which arranged its apartments in steps, each having its own terrace. (1906). This design was used by Sauvage and other architects in the period.Poisson, Michel, 1000 immeubles et monuments de Paris (2009), pg. 38-39 File:La samaritaine as seen from the Pont Neuf.jpgArt Deco building of La Samaritaine department store (1926–28) File:Paris La Samaritaine 375.JPGLa Samaritaine, building 2 (1928) File:37SamaritaineMagasin3.JPGBuilding 3 of La Samaritaine (1930)  Churches  Several new churches were built in Paris between the wars, in styles that mixed Art Deco features, such as stylized towers, the use of reinforced concrete to create large open spaces, and decorative murals in a Deco style, frequently combined with features of Byzantine architecture, like that of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur, which was popular at the time. The Église du Saint-Esprit, (1928–32), located at 186 Avenue Daumesnil in the 12th arrondissement, was designed by Paul Tournon. It has a modern exterior, made of reinforced concrete covered with red brick and modern bell tower 75 meters high, but the central feature is a huge dome, 22 meters in diameter. The design, like that of the Basilica of Sacré-Cœur, was inspired by Byzantine churches. The interior was decorated with murals by several notable artists, including Maurice Denis. .Dumoulin, Aline, Églises de Paris (2010), Éditions Nassin, , pages 166–167. The Church of Sainte-Odile at 2 Avenue Stephane- Mallarmé (17th arrondissement), by Jacques Barges (1935–39) has a single nave, three neo-Byzantine cupolas, and the highest bell tower in Paris.

The interior features colorful neo-Egyptian mosaics by Amédée Tiberi. It was restored in 2013, and is now an historic monument. The largest and most Deco theater still existing from the period is the Grand Rex cinema1 (boulevard Poissonière no. 1, 2nd arr.)) built in 1932 by the French architect Auguste Bluysen with the American engineer John Eberson. It is one of the largest theaters in Europe, seating 3100 persons. The theater interior was decorated by a prominent Deco designer, Maurice Dufrêne. It seats 2100 persons. It has undergone a major renovation, and now is used for concerts and other events as well as films.Texier (2019) pp. 24-25 File:Folies Bergere after renovatation of facade 2013.jpgFolies Bergère (1926) after renovation to original appearance File:MK2 Gambetta.JPGThe MK2 Movie Theater at 4 rue Belgrande by Henri Sauvage (1920) File:Louxor - Movie theater - 2008.jpgLe Louxor movie theater at 150 Boulevard de Magenta by Henri Zipcy (1921) File:Le louxor-Paris 1.JPGMosaics with Egyptian motifs in Le Louxor movie theater (1921) Apartment buildings and residences Henri Sauvage was one of the most inventive of designers of apartment buildings. He was particularly adept at covering the reinforced concrete facades with ceramic tile. In 1911 he built the Majorelle Building for the furniture designer Louis Majorelle, with a reinforced concrete facade covered with ceramics, giving it a sleek, modern appearance. He introduced the stepped building to Paris, an apartment building where each apartment was set back from the one below, in order that each would have its own terrace. The Studio Building (65 rue La Fontaine, 16th arr.) (1926–28) was built as a group of duplexes as a residence for artists. The facade was entirely covered with glistening ceramic tiles.

The most famous example is an apartment building at 3 boulevard Victor (15th arrondissement), built in (1934–1935) by Pierre Patout, in the same period that he created the interior decor for the Normandie. The building was constructed on an unusually-shaped lot, which narrowed from twelve meters wide to just three meters at the \\"bow\\" of the building. Patout had his own apartment, on three floors, in this part of the building.Poisson (2009), pg. 292 Pierre Patout's own house and studio, built earlier in 1927–28 at 2 Rue Gambetta in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, also showed elements of Pacqueboat, including the railing around the top \\"deck\\" or terrace. He also contributed to the reconstruction of the Galeries Lafayette department store in 1932–1836.Poisson (2009), pg. 292 File:Boulogne-Billancourt - 2 rue Gambetta - Patout.JPGResidence and studio of Pierre Patout in Boulogne-Billancourt (1927–28) File:SS Normandie (ship, 1935) interior.jpgDining room of the designed by Pierre Patout (1934–35) File:Immeuble de Pierre Patout Bd Victor Paris XV.jpgApartment building by Pierre Patout in the Pacquebot or ocean liner style, 3 boulevard Victor (15th arrondissement), (1934–35)  Swimming pools  The most famous Art Deco swimming pool in Paris is the Piscine Molitor, next to the Bois de Boulogne park, and between Stade Roland Garros and Parc des Princes. The complex designed by architect Lucien Pollet to resemble the deck of ocean liner, with three levels of \\"cabins\\" around the outdoor pool. It was completed in 1929 and inaugurated by Olympic swimmers including Aileen Riggin and Johnny Weissmuller. It was also the site for the first unveiling of the French bikini swimsuit by designer Louis Réard in July 1946. In the winter it was transformed into an ice skiing rink. Besides its nautical architecture, it features Art Deco stained glass by Louis Barillet. The complex fell into disrepair and was closed in 1989 with the intention of building a housing project on the site. After years of disuse, dispute and vandalism, it was declared an historical site and underwent major renovation. It reopened in 2013, following the original style, as part of a larger commercial and hotel complex.

Buildings became less ornate, less extravagant, more streamlined, with a return to some elements of classicism and tradition, such as neoclassical colonnades. It was a period of strikes, turmoil and confrontation.Bony, Anne, L'Architecture Moderne (2012), pp. 110-111 = Deco vs. Modernism = In 1929, the Art Deco movement in France was split into two currents by the breakaway of the Union des Artistes Moderne (UAM) from the more traditional Société des Artistes Decorateurs This new group proposed more functional architecture, furniture and decoration, mas production, simpler materials and no decoration at all. The members included René Herbst, Jacques Le Chevalier, and Robert Mallet- Stevens, its first president. The movement was soon joined by other architects and designers, including Le Corbusier the silversmith Jean Puiforcat, Pierre Chareau, and Eileen Gray. The Paris houses built by Mallet-Stevens on what is now Rue Mallet-Stevens (XIVth arrondissement) (1927–29) and his very spare steel furniture, illustrate the aesthetics of the movement. The residence oThis, along the \\"Glass House\\" of Pierre Chareau (1928–31) was the beginning of movement of Modern architecture in Paris File:Villa des frères Martel construite par Robert Mallet-Stevens au 10 rue Mallet-Stevens (Paris), en 1927.jpgVilla Martel by Robert Mallet-Stevens on Rue Mallet-Stevens (1929) File:Maison de verre Chareau.jpgThe Glass House by Pierre Chareau 31, rue Saint-Guillaume VIIe arrondissement, (1928–31) File:Chaise Mallet Stevens 1929-1931.jpgChair by Robert Mallet-Stevens (1929–31) File:Eileen- gray-e1027-table.jpgE-1027 table by Eileen Gray = The 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition = The Paris Colonial Exposition, held for six months in 1931 in the Bois de Vincennes, was designed as a showcase of France's overseas colonies, their products and their culture, and was also a showcase of Art Deco. The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States all had pavilions. It was particularly celebrated for its extensive use of flood lights and colorful illumination, a novelty at the time, used to great effect in the \\"Cactus\\" fountain the centerpiece of the Exposition. The principal Art Deco legacy of the Expsotion is the Palais de la Porte Dorée, now the Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration, which was constructed from 1928 to 1931 by the architects Albert Laprade, Léon Bazin and Léon Jaussely. The facade has large bas-reliefs (by sculptor Alfred Janniot portraying ships, oceans, and the wildlife of Africa. The original ethnographic exhibits were transferred to the Musée du quai Branly in 2003, and it now houses the Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration, a museum of immigration and a major aquarium. The Palais de la Porte Dorée has housed a succession of ethnological museums, starting with the colonial exhibition of 1931, which was renamed in 1935 the Musée de la France d’Outre-mer, then in 1960 the Musée des Arts africains et océaniens, and finally in 1990 the Musée national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie. In 2003 these collections were merged into the Musée du quai Branly, and in its place the building now houses the Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration.

It was the seventh and last international exposition of its kind to be held in Paris. Fifty countries participated, including Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, whose pavilions faced each other. Some modernist architecture was on display, including the Spanish pavilion by Josep Lluís Sert, where Picasso's painting Guernica was presented; the Pavilion of Light and Electricity, by Robert Mallet-Stevens, and the pavilion of Finland, with wood-covered walls, by Alvar Aalto. Le Corbusier had a small pavilion of his own, made of canvas, at the edge of the Exposition.Bony (2012) pp. 110-115 The Palais de Chaillot, by Jacques Carlu, Louis Hippolyte Boileau and Léon Azéma, combined elements of classicism and modernism, as did the nearby Palais de Tokyo (now the Paris Museum of Modern Art}, by André Aubert, Paul Viard, and Marcel Dastugue. A third building of major importance was the Museum of Public Works (now the Economic Council, by Auguste Perret. They all had the major characteristics of this period of Art Deco architecture; smooth concrete walls covered with stone plaques, sculpture on the facade, and murals on the interior walls.Texier (2019) pg. 46 File:Paris 75016 Fontaines du Trocadéro 20090815.jpgThe Palais de Chaillot (1937) File by Alexander Baranov - Нетипичная парижская архитектура (9522783370).jpgThe Palais de Tokyo by André Aubert, Paul Viard, and Marcel Dastugue (1937) File:L'exposition Auguste Perret (Conseil économique, social et environnemental, Paris) (11872278295).jpgStairway of the Economic, Social and Environmental Council, by Auguste Perret (with his portrait over the stairs) (1937)  Furniture and decoration  =Color and exoticism (the 1920s)= Art Deco Furniture and decoration in Paris before 1914 featured bold colors and geometric floral designs, borrowed from diverse sources ranging from the Ballets Russes to cubism and Fauvism. The First World War put an end to the more lavish style, and stopped almost all construction and decoration. As soon as the war was over, two prominent artists, Louis Süe and André Mare, founded the Compagnie des Arts français, a collaborative venture of decorative artists, with Süe as artistic director and Mare as technical director. Their purpose was the renewal of French decorative arts. Other members included André Vera and his brother Paul Vera, and Charles Dufresne. They opened a gallery in 1920 on rue de Faubourg-Saint-Honoré which displayed furniture, lamps, glassware, textiles and other new products, including many designed to be produced in series. Later the group was joined by artists in more modernist styles, including Francis Jourdain and Charlotte Perriand. The Compagnie was a major promoter in the advance of Parisian Art Deco.Texier (2019) pg. 8-9 Designers in this period used the most exotic and expensive materials they could find. The painter and decorator Paul Iribe made a delicate commode in 1912 of mahogany black marble, and sharkskin. In about 1925 André Groult made a small cabinet in an organic shape, entirely covered with white sharkskin. He decorated the first-class cabins on the ocean liner {{SSNormandie2 Cabanne, Pierre, Encylopédie Art Deco(1986), pg. 82 The furniture designed by Louis Süe and Andre Mare of Compagnie des Arts Francais was finely crafted and lavish. The buffet pictured in the gallery below (1920–1921), now in the Musée des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, is made of Mahogany, gilded bronze, and marble. Another major figure in Paris interior decoration in the 1920s was Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann. He had his own pavilion at the 1925 Exposition. His furniture was noted for its use of rare and expensive woods and other materials, such as ivory. The simple-looking \\"Duval\\" cabinet, pictured below, designed in 1924 and probably made in 1926, is made of Brazilian rosewood, ivory, amboyna burl, mahogany, oak, and little plywood. The \\"Tibittant\\" desk by Ruhlmann illustrated below, made in 1923, is a fall- leaf desk with a core of plywood covered with oak, poplar, mahogany, and Macassar ebony veneers inside and out. It has ivory inlays, feet, and knobs, silk tassels, a leather interior writing surface, and aluminum leaf and silver gilding. It is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Description from the Metropolitan Museum site File:Display at Salon D'Automne (1913).jpgDisplay at Salon d'Autumne (1913) File:Paul Iribe, cassettiera, parigi 1919 ca..jpgCommode of mahogany, black marble and sharkskin by Paul Iribe (about 1919) File:André mare per compaignie des arts français, paravento les faune, parigi, 1920 ca..JPGParavent Les Faunes (c. 1920), by the Compagnie des Arts Francais, Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris File:Le salon de verre, designed by Paul Ruaud, furniture by Eileen Gray, for Madame Mathieu-Levy (boutique J.

Examples were the work of Pierre Chareau and Jules Leleu. The style broke into two parts, one devoted to more traditional forms, fine craftsmanship and luxurious materials, the other to more austere forms and experiments with new materials, such as aluminum and steel.

They were usually combined with carpets in a similar style. Most screens were painted on fabric or wood. A highly unusual Art Deco screen is Oasis, made of iron and copper by engineer and metal worker Edgar Brandt for display at the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. Another influential screen maker was Jean Dunand, who mastered the ancient art of Japanese lacquer painting, and also worked with copper and other unusual materials. His screen Fortissimo, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is made of lacquered wood, eggshell, mother-of-pearl, and gold leaf.

He had his first success in 1923 at the Salon des Decorateurs in Paris, where he combined silver with lapis lazuli. He made only individual items, not series, and often combined them with semi-precious stones.

Besides table glassware, he designed a wide variety of glass art objects, both practical and decorative, including glass hood ornaments for luxury automobiles. His major projects included decorating the dining room of the ocean liner Paris (1920), making table service for the French President (1922), and an illuminated glass fountain in a central position at the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts. Beginning in 1925 he modified his style from floral fantasies to more geometric and simpler designs. In the 1930s he decorated the dining room of the ocean liner .

Some Paris sculptors, such as Antoine Bourdelle, created both Deco sculpture and more traditional gallery or monumental pieces. Bourdelle was the first major Art Deco sculptor, for the friezes and other works he created to decorate the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, though much of his other work of the time was more traditional sculpture. Demétre Chiparus, born in Romania, became one of the most successful Deco sculptors in Paris, and showed his work regularly at the Salon des Artistes Français between 1914 and 1928. He specialized in small statuettes called chryselephantines, depicting women with face and hands made of ivory clad in costumes of bronze. He depicted dancers, acrobats, and other exotic figures. Monumental sculpture complemented the facade and parvis of the Palais de Chaillot of the 1937 Paris Exposition, including a statue of \\"The Fruit\\" by Félix-Alexandre Desruelles at the Palais de Chaillot (1937) File:Antoine Bourdelle, 1910-12, Apollon et sa méditation entourée des neuf muses, bas-relief, Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris DSC09314.jpgApollo and the Muses, a bas-relief for the facade of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1910–1912) File:Antoine Bourdelle, ca.1922, Monument La France, H. 9 m, bronze, Hohwiller founder, erected 18 June 1948, Palais de Tokyo, Paris.jpgLa France by Antoine Bourdelle (1922) File:Palais de Chaillot-Sculpture exterieur-DSC 2346w.jpgThe Fruit by Félix-Alexandre Desruelles at the Palais de Chaillot (1937) File:Art Deco Sculpture.jpgTanara by Demétre Chiparus File:Les girls.jpgLes Girls by Demétre Chiparus, of bronze and ivory, on a quartz and marble base (1920s) Art Deco Museum in Moscow  Murals  File:Maurice denis, modello per la decorazione interna della cupola del teatro degli champs-elysées, 1911-12, 03.JPGModel by Maurice Denis for the mural inside the dome of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées (1911–1912) File:Entrée du Théâtre National de Chaillot.jpgMurals in the entrance of the Théâtre national de Chaillot (1937)  Posters and graphic arts  The graphic arts, particularly fashion magazine covers and illustrations, played an important role in popularizing the style, as posters had earlier done for the Art Nouveau. Major illustrators included Paul Iribe and Georges Lepape, whose fashion illustrations for Vogue magazine helped popularize the designs of Paul Poiret. Lepape's illustrations were also a major feature of the fashion magazine Gazette de Bon Ton. Reproduced in the United States, the French fashion illustrations created a great demand for the new French styles. Lepape also designed costumes and sets for the theater and ballet. It is also the inspiration in official emblem of the 2024 Summer Olympics and 2024 Summer Paralympics in Paris.Cabanne, Pierre (1986), pg. 213 File:Iribe Les Robes de Paul Poiret p.17.jpgFashion illustration of designs of Paul Poiret by Paul Iribe (1908) File:Poiret1912.jpgIllustration of Poiret fashion by Paul Iribe (1912) File:Vanity Fair cover by Georges Lepape 1919.jpgCover of Vanity Fair by Georges Lepape (1919) File:Moulin Rouge Music-Hall.jpgMoulin Rouge Poster by Charles Gesmar (1925) File:Paris- Expo-1937-carte postale-00.jpgPostcard packet from the 1937 Paris Exposition  Art Deco in Paris museums  The following museums in Paris have notable collections of Art Deco furniture and decorative items. * Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris * Musée d'Orsay * Musée d'Art Moderne de Paris (Palais de Tokyo) - Art Deco Room * Musée des Années Trente in the western Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, Station Marcel Sembat (Paris Métro) Line Nine Notes and citations Bibliography  Category:Art Deco ","title":"Art Deco in Paris"},{"id":"61769235","text":"Nicole Höchst (born 10 February 1970) is a German politician for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and since 2017 member of the Bundestag.
