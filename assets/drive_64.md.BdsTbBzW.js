History In 1851, several companies of Mormon settlers were sent north from Salt Lake City to a northern bay of the Great Salt Lake, now Willard Bay. A company of nineteen located on North Willow Creek, south of the site where Brigham City would be established. Two years later, the infant community relocated two miles further south, and a fort wall was built due to the possibility of attacks by the Shohone and their allies. Willard's first settlers were mostly of Welsh, English, Scottish and Dutch descent. Most were farmers, but some were merchants, carpenters, blacksmiths and school teachers. Historically, the economy of Willard centered on agriculture, with fruit crops being the major product. Gravel excavation and worked stone have also been a significant source of income. Henry G. Sherwood surveyed North Willow Creek in 1851. The community was renamed Willard in honor of Willard Richards (1804-1854, a recently deceased Apostle of the LDS Church and counselor to Brigham Young, in 1859. Willard received its charter as a city in 1870.

A large portion of the town's population are dairy farmers, with many families owning their own herds. The town contains the Cache Valley Cheese plant. The overwhelming majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Nearby Smithfield shares its post office and library with the town. History Amalga was settled by Mormon settler Hans Jorgensen in 1869. Other settlers began arriving in 1891. By March 22, 1891, when the Alto Branch of the LDS Church was organized, the town had a schoolhouse that was used for social gatherings and church meetings. In 1916, the Amalgamated Sugar Company agreed to build a factory in town to process sugar beets, and the town name became Amalga. A spur line was established by the Utah Idaho Central Railroad, and a large hotel opened. The factory, built by Dyer Construction Company, was built by the 1917 season for $900,000. Coinciding with the organization of the city, the Amalga Ward of the LDS Church was established on March 10, 1918, choosing its name from the Amalgamated Sugar Company. The factory was shut down in 1929 due to the sugar beet blight. The equipment was dismantled and reassembled in Sacramento, California. The hotel was torn down, as were the workers' houses. The railroad was also removed, and sugar beets were shipped by truck to Smithfield, then taken to a factory in Lewiston for processing. The warehouse and land was sold to the \\"Tueller brothers\\" in late 1937. In 1941, the Cache Valley Dairy Association purchased the former sugar beet plant to allow the co-op to process their own milk into Swiss cheese. The co-op hired Edwin Gossner to produce the cheese, which he did from 1942 until 1966, when he left to form Gossner Foods in west Logan.

The water consists of the southern and eastern ends of Cutler Reservoir on the Little Bear and Bear rivers. Red Brick School House Schools Some of the earliest buildings built in Benson were for educational purposes. They were small log buildings of just one room, and later other rooms were added to some of them. These buildings were only temporary structures where the basic three \\"R's\\" were taught, and were later replaced by more permanent structures. In 1894 a brick school house was built in the east part of Benson called the Riverside School. It had two classrooms, with three grades taught in each room. At the Riverside School, the teacher, Mary Griffith, was paid $30 a month in 1896. In 1901 a janitor was hired for nine weeks for $4.50. One ton of coal cost $4.25. John Mathews bought the log building that was on the Riverside location and spent many hours directing cantatas. In 1897 a new brick school house was built in the west part of Benson. This school was built on a spot of land overlooking the Bear River. At first there were eight grades of school taught in two rooms. Later, as more children were enrolled, there were only grades one through six. After the construction of these school buildings, church was held in them for a time. These two schools served the educational needs of the first six grades until 1935 when a new modern school was built. This school was used for three decades. In 1968 it closed its doors, and the Cache County School Board felt it best to consolidate some of the smaller schools in the county to provide a wider curriculum while saving money at the same time. In the fall of 1969, all school-age children were transported by bus to other schools. Kindergarten to sixth grade went to Summit Elementary in Smithfield. Seventh to ninth grade went to Richmond North Cache Junior High and tenth through twelfth grades to Sky View High School in Smithfield.

The settlers originally settled east of modern day Clarkston in a spot known as the flat. Due to water quality concerns and sickness they moved the town a higher in elevation and closer to City Creek and other springs. They also experimented in dry farming mainly north of town.

The population was 3,833 at the 2010 census, with an estimated population of 4,700 in 2018. It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The first settlers were Latter-day Saints who moved from Lehi in 1860. Hyde Park was officially organized by Ezra T. Benson on July 1, 1860. The settlement was named in honor of William Hyde, one of the first settlers to arrive in the area on April 23, 1860. The name choice also evoked Hyde Park in London, England which was the homeland of many early settlers. It was at this same meeting that Hyde was also appointed as Bishop of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Hyde Park. Hyde served as branch president from 1860‚Äì1872 and then as bishop from 1872‚Äì1874, when he died.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History of the Church. p. 349. Hyde Park was surveyed in 1864 and homes on city lots began to replace the earlier fort- style dwellings. The first post office was established on June 15, 1864 and the first town elections were held on September 7, 1864. The first school and church meetings were held in a one-room log structure built in the summer of 1863. As the community grew, church meetings were moved to the new, larger Rock Meeting House constructed in 1866. Early settlers also had to deal with the problem of bringing water to the area for their crops. The first irrigation canal was built in the summer of 1860 and was known as the ‚ÄúOld Ditch.‚Äù A second canal known as the Logan-Richmond Canal was constructed in 1865 to help with the increasing demand for water.

Incorporated in 1935, it was named after Charles W. Nibley, a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The population was 5,438 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho (partial) Metropolitan Statistical Area and is a suburb or 'bedroom' community of Logan. Historically a rural area, Nibley has experienced significant growth within the last decade, more than doubling its population in under 10 years. Geography Nibley lies between the cities of Hyrum and Logan in the Cache Valley. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 4.03 square miles,10.4377 square kilometers, all land. History Cache Valley was occupied by the Shoshone Indians prior to its settlement by Mormon Pioneers. Trappers arrived in Cache Valley in 1824 under the leadership of John Weber of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Several trapping companies operated in the valley during the next 20 years. During that time, the beaver and bison were virtually eliminated. Nibley was a city in Utah. In 1849, the valley was surveyed by the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers. Reports of Cache Valley's abundant range and beautiful setting were conveyed to Brigham Young by army officers, trappers, and Mormon scouts. In 1855, the Utah Territorial Legislature granted Cache Valley to Brigham Young as a herd ground for his increasing numbers of cattle. A company of cattle owners was organized to take cattle to Cache Valley under the direction of Briant Stringham. The site they chose was located near the Blacksmith Fork River by some springs about a mile northwest of the Nibley Ward Chapel on Main Street and 3200 South. The ranch they established was named the Elk Horn Ranch and became the first Mormon settlement in the valley. A severe winter forced abandonment of most of this early settlement, except for a few settlers. Those left at the ranch suffered during this severe winter, as food became dangerously low. When spring came, barley was planted. This venture, like the ranching, was also unsuccessful. As settlers continued to enter Cache Valley, relations with the Shoshone deteriorated. Although little physical contact occurred, theft of stock and grain was commonplace. Tight settlement patterns were encouraged to help provide security for these early settlers. In 1860, settlers at and near Elk Horn Ranch were advised to move to the East side of the Blacksmith Fork River, where they would be safer in the event of an Indian attack. Serious threats from Indians ended in 1863 when a major battle was fought in Northern Cache Valley. In the 1870s, the remaining Indians were forced to enter reservations. Shortly after those early settlers gathered on the East side of the Blacksmith Fork River, the Millville Ward was organized. Once the Indian threat had diminished, some of the settlers moved back to the West side of the river to what was called West Millville. A variety of activities were operated in this area, including a blacksmith shop, a molasses and grain mill, a general merchandise store, a slaughter house, a dairy and a nursery. Water for the settlers in Millville Ward was supplied by the Millville Water Works Company. In 1915, as the population continued to grow, the company found its water supply inadequate and began to search for additional sources. Yeates Springs, located near the Blacksmith Fork River on the Southern boundary of present-day Nibley, was selected and purchased from John Yeates for $500.00. From these springs, 28,000 feet of redwood pipe was laid along the county road to service residents living west of the river. The system was paid for by selling stocks to those receivers for $262.50 per share. In 1920, the Millville Ward was divided. That area west of the river was Nibley Ward, named after Charles Wilson Nibley, presiding Bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in 1907. Nibley precinct was created in 1925 as a separate political entity by the Cache County Commissioners. In 1926, repairs were begun to replace leaking water pipelines. Also, at this time, a ward chapel was built in Nibley. In 1933, the Millville Public Works Company applied to the Public Works Administration (PWA) for a $2,500.00 loan to replace existing water pipelines. The loan was refused on grounds that the PWA did not make loans to private companies. Since loans to incorporated towns were permissible, the stockholders voted to dissolve the company and turn the water system over to the town of Millville. Consideration was also given to having Nibley incorporate as a town. On May 21, 1935, a mass meeting was called to discuss the incorporation of Nibley. A motion was made \\"that we do incorporate so as to be eligible to take over the water works and get the government grant.\\" The motion passed and town boundaries were drawn up which included all members of the Nibley Ward and extended 20 rods on both sides of all included roads. A petition was presented to the Cache County Board of Commissioners and on August 30, 1935, Nibley was incorporated. In the beginning of 2013, Nibley has grown to a population of about 6,000. Heritage Days Nibley celebrates many events in the city that have drawn the community closer. They have an Easter egg hunt, a live nativity, and other holiday celebrations yearly.

The population was 7,075 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Logan, Utah-Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. History Providence lies south of Logan on former State Route 238. Its 1990 census population was 3,344. Situated immediately east of the confluence of Spring Creek with the Logan River, the town lies astride a delta at the mouth of Providence Canyon and beneath Big Baldy Mountain. The settlement was located on Spring Creek to take advantage of water, arable land, timber resources, and existing trails. As directed by LDS President Brigham Young, on July 24, 1855, Captain Briant Stringham, Simon Baker, Andrew Moffat, and Brigham Young Jr., located headquarters for the Elkhorn Cattle Ranch on a spring of water near the west bank of the Blacksmith Fork River, immediately southwest of the present site of Providence. Subsequently, in the early spring of 1857, Samuel, Joseph, Aboile, and Nephi Campbell, and John Dunn, crossed the mountains from North Ogden into Cache Valley, seeking a new place to settle. To them, the town they called \\"Ogden's Hole\\" was becoming too crowded. They pitched camp at the present site of Providence, at a spring and pond where a creek from a canyon in the Bear River Range entered the alluvial lowland. To assess the fertility of the soil, the explorers broke sod and plowed a long furrow. Plans were made for the immediate resettlement from North Ogden to Cache Valley of the Campbell and other families, but the move was interrupted by the approach of the U.S. Army with orders to force a military occupation of Utah Territory. The Weber County settlers evacuated their homes and moved south for temporary sanctuary on the \\"Provo bottoms\\", and the Weber County brigade of the Nauvoo Legion passed through Cache Valley to conduct a defensive reconnoiter of the Bear River region. A number of these men subsequently returned to settle in Providence. Settlers finally came to Spring Creek on April 20, 1859. Arriving first were Ira Rice, a 65-year-old War of 1812 veteran from Massachusetts, and a 35-year-old Welsh coal miner, Hopkin Mathews, accompanied by his teenage daughter Elizabeth. They were joined by the English-speaking Bowen, Busenbark, Campbell, Clark, Clifford, Dees, Dunn, Durfey, Gates, Hall, Lane, Maddison, Rammell, Thompson, Williams, and Wright families, plus the Gassman, Lau, and Theurer families, whose native tongue was German. Douglas fir logs were cut and dragged from Spring Creek Canyon to build cabins. The houses faced one another across a narrow road, which could be closed with wagons at each end to make a fort. On April 25, 1859, Peter Maughan visited Spring Creek to establish a religious organization. He chose Samuel Campbell as presiding elder. The first indoor meetings were held in a log meeting-and-schoolhouse erected by John Maddison and William Fife. By August there were 16 families living at the fort; the following month, a child (Hannah Priscilla Thompson) was born at Spring Creek. On November 14, 1859, LDS apostles Orson Hyde and Ezra T. Benson organized the Providence Ward. Hyde chose the name: \\"Spring Creek settlement being situated in an elbow of the mountains and appearing to us somewhat of a providential place, we named Providence.\\" Robert Williams was ordained as bishop. Two years later, when a U.S. post office was established in Providence, Williams was also named postmaster. In 1860 John Theurer persuaded a number of fellow Swiss LDS converts (whose last names were Alder, Fuhriman, Kresie, Loosli, Naef, Stucki, and Trauber) to come to Spring Creek with its alpine setting. The Swiss tradition of community sauerkraut dinners continues to the present day in Providence. The village became a mix of Yankees, English, and Swiss, united by a common religious persuasion. As Providence was situated astride a Shoshoni trail from a winter camp on the Bear River to Bear Lake via Blacksmith Fork Canyon, church authorities advised that a more substantial fort be erected. A six-foot-high, two-and-one-half-foot-thick rock wall was built to enclose both the log houses and an open commons area. On November 23, 1862, in the foothills just outside Providence, a two-hour skirmish was fought by 60 soldiers under the command of Major Edward McGarry of the U.S. Second Cavalry against 30 or 40 Shoshonis under Chief Bear Hunter. The objective was to recover livestock and a ten-year-old white boy taken during the massacre of a wagon train on the Oregon Trail in August 1860. Three braves were killed and five others, including the chief, were captured. An exchange of the captives was made for the boy, Reuben Van Orman, who had been held for two years. In 1864 the town was laid out into square blocks, each divided into six lots of approximately one and one-third acres. East of Main Street the lots face north-south; they face east-west on the western side of town. The log structures, including the meeting/school building, were relocated from the fort onto the lots under the supervision of Bishop William Budge. On September 4, 1871 James Martineau completed his detailed official survey of Providence City. The cemetery was moved from the south end of town to a hill north of town. Construction was completed in 1871 on a rock meetinghouse and on a rock schoolhouse in 1877. The schoolhouse was replaced by a new building with a bell tower in 1904. For more than a hundred years, the major activity of most of the people of Providence was farming. Irrigation canals were dug from the Spring Creek and from the Blacksmith Fork and Logan rivers. The livestock industry included the raising of beef cattle (1859), honey bees (1866), horses (1870), dairy cattle (1874), poultry (1918), and foxes (1928). The horticulture industry included growing grain and alfalfa; apple, cherry, pear, and prune orchards; and peas, beans, and sugar beets. Beginning in 1886 Joseph Alastor Smith established Edgewood Hall as a nursery and dairy operation on the bench overlooking Providence. After its 28-room manor burned to the ground on Labor Day of 1935, the estate was acquired by Wall Street financier and Logan native L. Boyd Hatch. An elegant formal estate was created by Hatch, but he sold out in 1953 to cattleman Theron Bringhurst. The commercial activities of Providence included private mercantile shops of Rice, Hargraves, and Theurer plus a ZCMI Co-op store (1869‚Äì1912). Many years after the Co-op structure burned, Watkins and Sons Printing established a business in a remodeled and expanded facility. Other enterprises included molasses mills, a sawmill, lime kilns, brickyards, blacksmith shops, and an early automobile service station. The sugar factory of David Eccles and Charles Nibley began refining sugar beets in Providence in 1901 and operated for 25 years. Millions of tons of limestone for this and other refineries in the Pacific Northwest were quarried from Providence Canyon. The Utah Idaho Central Railroad Company extended its electric interurban line from Logan and established a depot in Providence in 1912. The railroad hauled limestone, farm produce, and passengers throughout Cache Valley as well as to Corinne, Ogden, and beyond via a connection with the Oregon Short Line Railroad company. Accompanying the UIC were electric lights, the telegraph, and the telephone. The last railroad train ran through town in 1947. With the coming of statehood to Utah and with the population exceeding 1,000 in the 1890s, Providence was organized as a town corporation. In 1897 Hopkin Mathews became town board president. Providence became a third-class city on 19 July 1929, with James Hansen elected mayor. Commencing with its first subdivision in 1962, Providence changed at an accelerating pace from a farming community into a \\"bedroom\\" suburb of Logan. Fields began to give way to developer tracts of individually owned, single-family houses on small lots. Although there is a spattering of home enterprises, most commercial activities have disappeared from Providence. A major employer of Providence citizens is Utah State University, which at its founding in 1888 seriously considered the Providence bench for its location. Other residents commute to Thiokol Corporation facilities or Hill Air Force Base as well as to smaller business firms and institutions in and around Logan.

Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. History Originally known as \\"Summit Creek\\", Smithfield was founded in 1857 by the brothers Robert and John Thornley along with their cousin Seth Langton who were sent north from Salt Lake City by Brigham Young to found a settlement on Summit Creek. After a preliminary scouting, Robert returned with his new wife Annie Brighton. The first winter was spent in a wagon box. By the next summer, with more settlers arriving, a small fort was built on the edge of the creek, one cabin of which remains. As the settlement grew, a bishop was named and the town took his name. By 1917 the town had planted trees on both sides of its Main Street and had acquired a Carnegie library and a Rotary club. Dependent for many years on dairying, a Del Monte canning factory, and the sugar beet industry, the town is now essentially a bedroom community for Logan and its Utah State University.

History East Carbon City had its beginnings in fall 1942, when the U.S. government ‚Äì through the Defense Plant Corporation ‚Äì awarded a contract to the W.E. Ryberg-Strong-Grant Corporation of Springville, Utah, to develop the town at a planned cost of $5 million. It was originally named \\"Drager\\", after W.L. Drager, chief engineer for the Defense Plant Corporation, who was raised in Utah and later moved to Washington, D.C. On September 9, 1942, the Post Office moved into its new building, and during the ceremonies, Postmistress Agnes Scow announced the U.S Post Office Department would not allow the name of Drager. Its contention was that Drager was too similar to the name Draper (another Utah community), and would create confusion and delays in mail delivery. A selected group of citizens gathered in the school auditorium to discuss a new name from the proposals of \\"Dragerville\\", \\"Dragervale\\" or \\"Drager Town\\" offered by the Post Office Department. \\"Dragerton\\", a derivative of \\"Drager-town\\", was selected. In 1959, with the area near its peak population, the Carbon School District built a high school in the area. The school was placed on land within the Sunnyside city limits that bordered Dragerton. The land was donated by Kaiser Steel, a local mining company. In 1958, during an assembly at East Carbon Junior High School, a vote was taken to give the new high school a name and mascot. The name selected was East Carbon High School and the mascot was a Viking. The school colors were blue, white and red. When the town was incorporated in 1973 the name was officially changed to \\"East Carbon City\\", matching the high school name. In 2005, the high school was closed and demolished before the beginning of the new school year. Bruin Point Elementary School was built the following year and is the only school serving the area of East Carbon. Columbia As part of East Carbon's incorporation, the nearby town of Columbia (approximately 4 miles to the southeast) became part of the new city. However, the area is still referred to as \\"Columbia\\" by local residents.

It is known as the \\"Hub of Carbon County\\". The population was 2,201 at the 2010 census. The city is located along U.S. Route 6/U.S. Route 191, a shortcut between Provo and Interstate 70, on the way from Salt Lake City to Grand Junction, Colorado. It is the location of the Western Mining and Railroad Museum, a tourist attraction that also contains household and commercial artifacts illustrating late 19th and early 20th-century living conditions. History With the arrival of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;) in 1881‚Äì82, Helper began to develop as a population center. By 1887 the D&RGW; had erected some twenty-seven frame residences, with more built later in the year. The railroad planned to make Helper a freight terminal after the rail lines were changed from narrow to standard gauge. The changeover process began in 1889 and was completed in 1891. In 1892, Helper was designated the division point between the eastern and western D&RGW; terminals in Grand Junction, Colorado, and Ogden, Utah, respectively, and a new depot, hotel, and other buildings were constructed. On April 21, 1897, Butch Cassidy and Elzy Lay robbed the Pleasant Valley Coal Company in nearby Castle Gate; they stayed in Helper the day before. It was said that Butch Cassidy later came back to Helper for occasional visits.TWMag, p-40, Adjacent to Helper is Spring Glen. It was first established in 1880, with Teancum Pratt being one of the first settlers. A Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized there in 1885 with Francis Marion Ewell as president. It was made a ward in 1889. As of 1930 less than 20% of the population in Spring Glen were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Andrew Jenson, Encyclopedia History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, p. 827 Helper's growth proceeded in a slow but deliberate fashion bearing little resemblance to booming metal-mining towns. The first amenities offered the few settlers and numerous railroad workers included three saloons, one grocery store, and one clothing establishment. A school was built in 1891. By 1895 the D&RGW; buildings and shops at Helper were lighted by electricity, and two reservoirs for water had been constructed. Big John\\" Muffler Man in Helper, December 2010 Ethnic diversity was destined to become a chief characteristic of Helper. Industrial expansion, coal mining, and railroading required a great amount of unskilled labor. In 1894 the railroad's passenger department established an immigration bureau to advertise Utah Territory. This move coincided with the influx of the numerous immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and from Asia. Chinese laborers were brought in at an early date to work the Carbon County mines and railroads. By the late 1890s, Italians and Austrians (primarily Slovenians, Croatians, and Serbians) began to arrive. In 1900 Helper's population was listed at 385 people. Sixteen different nationality groups were represented. \\"Merchant\\" and \\"laborer\\" comprised most of the occupations for these early immigrants. After the unsuccessful coal miners' strike of 1903‚Äì04, Italians, blacklisted from the mines at nearby Castle Gate, ventured into Helper to establish businesses and farms along the Price River. The influx of strikers into Helper accelerated its growth, with the newly established farms offering needed agricultural products. The twentieth century was launched in Carbon County (which had been formed in 1894 from Emery County) in a shroud of uncertainty, largely due to the strike situation. Greek and Japanese immigrants were brought in to break the strike, and thus new ethnic groups came onto the scene. Helper, along with Price, was fast becoming the center of the Carbon County coalfields, providing service functions to the outlying camps. A 1903-04 business directory listed sixteen separate businesses in Helper; by 1912-13 the number had grown to twenty-nine, with a population of about 850. Helper townsite was regularly organized and incorporated in 1907 with a president of the town board and members of the board serving the community. post office is one of three sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places By 1914-15 there were 71 businesses listed for Helper, with 84 in 1918‚Äì19, and 157 for the years 1924‚Äì25. Many of Helper's business enterprises were associated with specific ethnic groups, but this fact illustrated the business opportunities then available in the town, enabling immigrants to \\"break the ranks of labor.\\" Italian and Chinese-owned businesses were joined in the 1910s and 1920s by Slavic, Greek, and Japanese establishments. Specialty shops, cafes, coffeehouses, saloons, theaters, general mercantiles, and various service-oriented businesses formed Helper's commercial district. Some ventures, such as the Mutual Mercantile Company, were joint operations between different ethnic groups. Ethnic identities, the existence of both inter- and intra-group rivalries, new waves of immigration, and Helper's position as a neutral ground for labor influenced the town's social landscape. Helper became known as the area \\"hub\\" because it was nestled among various mining camps, and it served as a city of refuge where strikers and union organizers as well as national guardsmen could congregate during tense times. Customs and lifestyles associated with various ethnic groups continued; however, through interaction many eventually were changed and modified in the Helper environment. While the Great Depression hit the entire county, Helper's position as a railroad center provided some stability. Helper's city hall had been built in 1927, and a civic auditorium was constructed in 1936. The D&RGW; developed \\"bridge traffic,\\" acquiring trade from other major roads that wanted transcontinental connections. Coal production increased during World War II and continued strong through the 1960s, although with significant periods of uncertainty and temporary decline. Not all of the communities surrounding Helper were able to weather these difficult periods of economic instability, and the town is within a few miles of a large number of former coal mining settlements that were abandoned between the 1930s and 1970s, and are now ghost towns. These towns include Castle Gate, Coal City, Consumers, National, Peerless, Rains, Royal, and Standardville. Upturns and downswings plagued the industry in the 1970s, with new lows reached in the 1980s and early 1990s. Helper continues to ride the tide of these fluctuations and, as any town influenced by the mining industry, seeks to survive during bad economic times. Helper was named the top western town for 2006 by the True West Magazine, in the January/February 2007 issue. Power plant closure Approach of the compliance date of April 16, 2015, for enhanced EPA controls on emission of mercury resulted in a decision by Rocky Mountain Power, a subsidiary of PacifiCorp, to close down the Carbon power plant in Helper on April 15, 2015. It had been in operation since 1954. Name Helper is situated at the mouth of Price Canyon, alongside the Price River, on the eastern side of the Wasatch Plateau in Central Utah. Trains traveling westward from the Price side to the Salt Lake City side of the plateau required additional \\"helper\\" engines in order to make the steep (2.4% grade) climb up Price Canyon to the town of Soldier Summit. Helper was named after these helper engines, which the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad stationed in the city.

History Scofield Cemetery and some of its wooden gravestones The town of Scofield is situated on high ground two miles south of the reservoir of the same name, the oldest and largest of the major impoundments on the Wasatch Plateau. Once the most populous community in Carbon County, Scofield has shrunk to only a few permanent residents. What has slowed the continual decline has become outsiders constructing summer vacation homes. The old brick school stands empty at the upper end of town, and there are abandoned buildings scattered through what was once the business district. Only the cemetery on a hill to the east suggests that this was once a community of some size. Visitors to the cemetery quickly become aware of the diverse ethnicity that populated the town. Settlement Due to the luxuriant growth of the native grasses indigenous to this region, this valley was first utilized as pastures for the immense herds of cattle that came from Utah Valley. Among the first settlers of this region were S. J. Harkness, T. H. Thomas, William Burrows, O. G. Kimball, D. D. Green, A. H. Earll, R. McKecheney, who were attracted by the immense ranges for their cattle. Discovery of coal and coming of the railroad Coal was discovered in the valley in 1875, and two years later a small mine was opened on the western slopes of the canyon, with the coal transported out along narrow roads. The winter of 1877 came early and was very severe, stranding the miners in the coal pit and keeping them snowbound until the following February. The ordeal led the miners to name their forced camp \\"Winter Quarters\\". It became one of the first commercial coal mines in the state. Most of the first miners at the Winter Quarters were Mormon converts from the coal districts of Wales, England and Scotland. One of them, David Williams, leased the Winter Quarters Mine from the Pleasant Valley Coal Company from 1880 to 1885, operating in the dual capacity of mine manager and bishop of the local LDS ward. When the Rio Grande Western Railway acquired the coal company, they undertook the development of a new mine on Mud Creek, a mile from Winter Quarters, much to the chagrin of Williams, who protested that the new mine infringed on his lease. Because Bishop Williams controlled the Mormon miners, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company brought in Chinese laborers to work the Mud Creek mine. Soon a large contingent of Finns were recruited, along with Italian, Greek, and other Scandinavian workers. As coal veins commenced to be worked, it was not long before the discoverers found out that the supply seemed inexhaustible. The railway companies finding that the coal fields were of such magnitude and covered so much territory, began to survey for practicable routes to reach the coal. The route through Spanish Fork Canyon was finally decided upon, and a narrow-gauge railroad was built into Scofield. Before the railroad was completed, winter set in, and the last few miles were laid upon the ice and snow as it was impossible to find the ground due to the snow drifts. The Union Pacific Coal Company claimed all of the land on the town site, and those building a home were compelled to lease the spot of ground desired from this company. Not knowing how long they would be permitted to remain as laborers in the mines, the men did not build elaborate homes, as they knew that should the work cease, they would be compelled to sacrifice their homes. Log cabins were the order of the day, as lath and plaster was out of reach on account of high prices. The Union Pacific still continued to collect their ground rent, and the knowledge that the miners had of the company that was ruling the camp at that time deterred them from beautifying their homes as they desired. Scofield Utah's historic jail However, this state of affairs was not to continue for long, as the rights of the company to hold the land came to be questioned. Part of their land was jumped, and their title was found to be imperfect. In fact, they had no title whatever to the land now incorporated in the townsite. The business district was more than a mile long and boasted dozens of substantial stone buildings, including an Odd Fellows Hall. As the mine and the community grew, new and more efficient methods were sought to move the coal from the mines, and so the Utah & Pleasant Valley Railroad was constructed, running from Springville to Winter Quarters and Scofield. It connected with the Denver & Rio Grande line in Colton to the northeast. In 1882, the Utah Fuel Company took over the mine and town, and it soon became a subsidiary of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. The region continued to thrive until 1900, when there were several hundred men in the mines and residents that numbered as high as 1,800. The mine was considered to be the safest in the region and according to reports, was free from the gases that plagued so many other coal operations. Coffins waiting for transport to disaster site Disaster On May 1, 1900, an errant spark touched off the fine haze of coal dust deep underground, and the Winter Quarters #4 mine exploded with fury. Exactly 100 of the men were killed in an instant, and another 99 died from the poisonous afterdamp, making this one of the worst coal mine disasters in history. Death came so swiftly that some of the mineworkers were found still clutching their tools. That one moment of time left 105 widows and 270 fatherless children behind. Almost 150 of the slain miners were buried in the cemetery in nearby Scofield, and two special funeral trains carried the rest of the victims to burial grounds in Utah and in other states. Decline On May 28, just four weeks after the disaster in Number Four, coal mining resumed at Winter Quarters. While some of those who had escaped the explosion left the area for other work, many others returned to the mines. The dead were soon replaced, though production evidently suffered somewhat from the loss of more experienced miners. Despite declining profitability, the Winter Quarters mines continued to operate until the 1930s. The coal tipple and other large structures were dismantled for their salvage value during World War II; the chapel and the boarding house were leveled. Scofield, sustained by several mines in Pleasant Valley, was still the largest town in Carbon County in 1915, when its citizens made an attempt to have the county seat moved to their community from Price. By the 1920s, however, the coal industry in Pleasant Valley was clearly in decline and most mines ceased operation causing the town to lose nearly all its residents. Geography The town of Scofield lies in the bituminous coal field of Carbon County, Utah, about from the main line of the Rio Grande Western Railroad, and is nestled among the hills that surround the upper part of Pleasant Valley. The town is situated along Mud Creek, just south (upstream) of the Scofield Reservoir. The outlet of the reservoir is the Price River, which flows southeast to the Green River and is thus part of the Colorado River basin. According to the United States Census Bureau, Scofield has a total area of , all of it land. Utah State Route 96 passes through Scofield, leading north then east to U.S. Route 6 near Colton, and south to its end at Clear Creek. Climate Scofield has an alpine subarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc) with enormous yearly snowfall in its long, cold winters due to its location in the Wasatch Range. Summertime on the other hand is pleasant, with warm days and crisp, cool nights hovering not too far above freezing. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 28 people, 12 households, and 9 families residing in the town. The population density was 55.9 people per square mile (21.6/km2). There were 78 housing units at an average density of 155.6 per square mile (60.2/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White. There were 12 households, out of which 25.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, 8.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.7% were non-families. 16.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.50. In the town, the population was spread out, with 14.3% under the age of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 28.6% from 45 to 64, and 21.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 45 years. For every 100 females, there were 75.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males. The median income for a household in the town was $26,250, and the median income for a family was $28,750. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $14,375 for females. The per capita income for the town was $10,764. There were no families and 9.1% of the population living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64. Although the number of people living in Scofield is low, many own cabins, summer and winter homes, and fishing shacks around Scofield Reservoir. There is also a state park located by the lake. Scofield State Park right Scofield State Park surrounds Scofield Reservoir and has three different camping areas: Mountain View, Madsen Bay, and Lake Side. Mountain View is a 34-unit campground that includes restrooms, heated showers, fish cleaning and disposal stations, a group use pavilion, a boat launching ramp, and rental boats. Madsen Bay is a 40-unit campground with restrooms, fish cleaning and disposal areas, a boat ramp, and parking for day use. Lake Side has no camping areas and is strictly day use, offering restrooms, a group use pavilion and a fishing platform for the disabled. Clear Creek Camp Clear Creek Camp is an outdoor education center located south of the town of Scofield, for post-fifth grade students in the Alpine School District. Each summer, Clear Creek Camp hosts approximately 1,100 students. The summer camp experience is designed to educate students about the outdoors and help foster a deep appreciation for the abundant natural resources and beauty in their surroundings. The camp has its roots in an outdoor education program held at Central Elementary School in the 1940s. Between 1940 and the 1960s, the program eventually grew to be so successful that a summer camp was requested. It was held at various locations for many years, including the town of Clear Creek for which it is named. After being there for a few years, property became available from Questar (then Mountain Fuel) with six cabins and a multi-purpose facility in 1973. The facilities were ready to use for groups of students in 1974, and Alpine School District has used the same grounds since then.

History The area known as Sunnyside was founded in 1879, when George and James Whitmore arrived at the base of the Book Cliffs and established the Whitmore Cattle Ranch. In 1883, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW;) extended its line from the railhead at Deseret to Price. Along this stretch two additional railheads were added, one at Woodside, and another north at Sunnyside, named for its location on the sunny side of the Book Cliffs. For over a century, Sunnyside was the leader in coal production in Carbon County. The history of coal mining in Sunnyside began shortly after Jefferson Tidwell and his three sons discovered coal in Whitmore Canyon in 1896. By 1898, the Pleasant Valley Coal Company had acquired the rights to the coal from Tidwell. On July 4 of that year, the Sunnyside railhead was abandoned by the D&RGW;, and the coal camp located in Whitmore Canyon was named Sunnyside. By 1901, the D&RGW; and its subsidiary, Utah Fuel Coal Company, acquired the operation. Sunnyside was officially incorporated as a town in 1916, with a mayor and four trustees. July 1946 photographs of government-built homes in Sunnyside For fifty years, Utah Fuel operated the coal mines in Sunnyside, selling its interest to Kaiser Steel Corporation in 1949. The financial investments of these companies turned Tidwell's mining operation into a major coal industry, inextricably tied to Sunnyside. Until 1994, the Sunnyside's mayor was not an elected official. Instead, the office was held by the Superintendent of Mines for Utah Fuel, then later by Kaiser Steel Corporation when it took over in 1950. Education Sunnyside is located in the Carbon School District. It has one elementary school, which also accommodates students from East Carbon City. Students attend middle and high school in Price.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 42,552, a three percent increase over the 2000 figure of 41,301. The city grew rapidly during the suburb growth of the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s and was Davis County's largest city until 1985 when it was surpassed by Layton. Bountiful is Utah's 15th largest city. Although a part of the Ogden-Clearfield Metropolitan Statistical Area, it serves as a bedroom community to Salt Lake City and the surrounding area. However, due to the very narrow entrance into Salt Lake County, roads between the counties often reach near-gridlock traffic during rush hour. The FrontRunner commuter rail has been running since April 2008, and the Legacy Parkway was opened on September 13, 2008. These were built to help alleviate the traffic load on Interstate 15 through the Bountiful area. History A home in Bountiful's Historic District Bountiful was settled on September 27, 1847, by Perrigrine Sessions and his family. It was Utah's second settlement after Salt Lake City. It was known as both Sessions Settlement and North Canyon Ward before being named Bountiful in 1855. This city was so named both because of the city's reputation as a great place for gardening, and because \\"Bountiful\\" is the name of a city in the Book of Mormon (Alma 52:9). Most of the settlers, and also many of the present inhabitants, are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). The city also shares 14 other religious institutions including a Catholic school and church, Saint Olaf School, established in 1959. The Bountiful Utah Temple was dedicated in 1995 by the LDS Church. A tabernacle of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is also located in Bountiful. The city was incorporated in 1892 with Joseph L Holbrook as mayor.

The population was 30,112 at the 2010 census. The city grew drastically during the 1940s, with the formation of Hill Air Force Base, and in the 1950s with the nationwide increase in suburb and \\"bedroom\\" community populations and has been steadily growing since then. Clearfield is a principal city of the Ogden‚ÄìClearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Davis, Morgan, and Weber counties. History Clearfield was one of the last communities to be settled in the northern part of Davis County (1877). Hunters and Native American warriors knew this land before the first white man settled here. They referred to it as the land of wind and sand. It was the arrival of the railroad that first awakened the area in 1869 and stirred the sleeping Sand Ridge, which it was once known as until the name was later changed to Clearfield. There was no water for those early families until wells could be successfully dug. The only water available at first had to be hauled in large barrels from Kays Creek in East Layton. But the great event that did more to transform the bleak Sand Ridge into a fertile garden spot was the coming of the Davis and Weber Counties Canal in 1884. This caused an immediate population boom in the area as people plowed up the sagebrush, cactus, and prickly pears, and homes and farms began to appear throughout the area. Many Clearfield children went to school in nearby Syracuse by walking several miles a day. In 1907, the new Clearfield Elementary School opened its doors to those same children. The school taught first through eighth grades and operated until 1923 when it was destroyed by fire. The new building later acquired the name Pioneer School. North Davis Junior High School was built and opened its doors in 1939. The building cost approximately $170,000 to build. That first year, there were 18 faculty members and 585 students. Throughout the following years, Clearfield was known as a peaceful farming community. However, the addition of defense installations in the areas changed the agricultural community. Construction began on Hill Field (Hill Air Force Base) in 1940 and the facility eventually stretched along the eastern border of Clearfield. The base has since provided many jobs for civilians and is one of Utah's major employers. On the southwestern side of Clearfield, the U.S. Navy installed the Clearfield Naval Supply Depot in 1943. Clearfield was considered a prime location for the depot because of its relative security from enemy attack, nearby air transportation at Hill Air Force Base, and the proximity of railroads and highways. The dry climate was ideal for storage, and there was a good supply of manpower. Another more modern school, South Clearfield Elementary, was added during 1950 to help keep pace with the growing population. The early winter of 1959 saw the beginnings of Clearfield High School, the first high school in northern Davis County. The Clearfield Naval Supply Depot was eventually phased out by 1962 but the facility did not stay empty for long. Private firms soon began moving into the large warehouse buildings. The area became known as the Freeport Center and today is a major western hub for manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution. Hill Field Elementary opened in 1963 and is located just west of the west border of Hill Air Force Base. The Clearfield Job Corps Center was established in 1966. This facility is located west of the Freeport Center on Antelope Drive. It was established to provide training to unemployed and unskilled youth 16 to 24 years old. Clearfield City dedicated a new city hall building in 1969 and a new state-of-art Clearfield Fire Station opened in 1980, adjacent to city hall. In 1981, Holt Elementary opened at the northwest corner of the city, near Steed Park. The newest Clearfield City Municipal Building, located on 55 South State Street, was dedicated in December 1999. Clearfield's premier office and commercial center, Legend Hills, is also the largest office development space in north Davis County. The first phase of Legend Hills was built in 2002 on the city's east side, just east of the frontage road along Interstate 15. Clearfield Aquatic Center, built in 2006 In 2004, ground was broken for the Clearfield Aquatic Center. In 2005, the old Clearfield City Swimming Pool was demolished to make way for the new center, and for an updated Bernard Fisher Park. The new skate park at Fisher Park was also added the same year. The Clearfield Aquatic Center opened in 2005 adjacent to the newly built North Davis Junior High, which until 2005 had been the oldest standing junior high building in Davis County. An outdoor splash pad feature was added to the Clearfield Aquatic Center in 2006. Clearfield High School underwent a major renovation in 2006, including the main auditorium and computer upgrades. The opening of the Utah Transportation Association (UTA) FrontRunner commuter rail stop in Clearfield in 2008 helped the city emerge as a centralized location of business, public and community development. Davis County opened a three-story, 45,000 square foot office building housing the administrative offices of the Davis County Health Department in 2010. The Heritage Senior Activity Center closed its Clearfield Community Center location in 2011. It reopened as the North Davis Senior Center in its new location adjacent to the new county health building. In 2012, the former Clearfield Community Center was renamed, becoming the Clearfield Community Arts Center. Located east of the Clearfield City Municipal Building north parking lot, the center is expected to become a hub for arts classes, theatre productions, and more. Clearfield City FrontRunner UTA Station Geography Clearfield City has a total land area of 7.8 square miles (20.1 km2), and a population of 30,112 as of the 2010 Census, making it the third largest city in Davis County, behind Layton and Bountiful. This creates a population density of 1498.1 people per square kilometer, or 3860.5 people per square mile. Clearfield City has an average elevation of 4,327 feet (1,320 m) above sea level. The lowest point within the boundaries of the city is 4,314 feet (1,315 m) at the intersection of 1000 West and Antelope Drive on the city's western edge and the highest is 4,711 feet (1,436 m) at a point that is within the city's northeast corner, but physically located on Hill Air Force Base property along Constitution Way in their housing area. (AGRC) The city is located in the north central portion of Davis County. The county is surrounded by the Great Salt Lake to the west and the steep Wasatch Range on the east, although neither of these notable natural landmarks is physically within the city boundaries. Directly encircling Clearfield are the cities/areas of Sunset City to the north, Clinton City to the northwest, Syracuse City and West Point City to the west, Layton City to the south and east, and Hill Air Force Base military installation to the northeast. There are no major lakes or rivers within the city. There are a few small ponds, mostly at public parks or on privately owned property. The only significant waterway in the city is the Weber and Davis Canal along the east and northeast edge of the city that extends both north and south of the city boundaries. The Clearfield Canal Trail parallels the canal for a portion of its trip through Clearfield. The Great Salt Lake is separated from Clearfield City by marshlands, mudflats and the cities in between. The metabolic activities of bacteria in the lake result in a phenomenon known as \\"lake stink\\", a scent similar to sulfur, once or twice a year for a few hours. The highest mountaintops visible from Clearfield City are Deseret Peak in Tooele County at , Ben Lomond Peak in Weber County at , and Thurston Peak, just to the west of Clearfield at . Ben Lomond Peak and Thurston Peak are located in the Wasatch Range. The Wasatch Fault is found along the western base of the Wasatch Range and is considered overdue for an earthquake as large as 7.5. Catastrophic damage is predicted in the event of an earthquake with major damage resulting from the liquefaction of the clay- and sand-based soil. The largest earthquake that has occurred near Clearfield City in the recorded past occurred on 12/7/1967, and was away in Park City, Utah and registered at magnitude of 4.3. The Wasatch Front valley floor is the ancient lakebed of Lake Bonneville which existed at the end of the last Ice Age. Several Lake Bonneville shorelines can be distinctly seen on the foothills or benches of nearby mountains. Layout The streets of the city, along with the rest of Davis County north of Layton, are laid out on a unified grid plan. Most major streets run very nearly north‚Äìsouth and east‚Äìwest. Clearfield City is the farthest east on this grid, while Syracuse, West Point, Sunset, Clinton and Unincorporated Davis County all are located north, west and south on the same street grid. Neighborhoods Clearfield City has many informal neighborhoods, most of which are more business or industrial related than residential. In the southwestern portion of the city is a large industrial business center called The Freeport Center, and the Clearfield Job Corps. Having the Job Corps next to one of the largest industrial centers in Northern Utah allows for on the job training for many of the programs offered. The Freeport Center began life in the 1940s as the Clearfield Naval Supply Depot, but was phased out in 1962 and private firms began moving in. South Clearfield is a residential neighborhood that is of note due to its isolation as the southernmost section of the city. It is cut off from the rest of residential Clearfield by The Freeport Center and other businesses, as well as being surrounded by other cities on 3 of the 4 sides of the area. The presence of Hill Air Force Base has helped in creating two business neighborhoods. Falcon Hill is a 550-acre planned development underway on the west and southwest portion of the base that will be on leased federal government land, but all services and building will be public at any areas located outside the fence line of the base. It is a planned aerospace research complex with space both inside and outside of the base fence line. (Commercial) Legend Hills is an office and retail oriented business area located in the southeasternmost corner of the city. It contains many different retail spaces and business offices in the numerous office towers. All areas are easily accessed off Interstate 15, which runs north‚Äìsouth through the eastern edge of the city. Climate The climate of Clearfield City is characterized as semi-arid, with four distinct seasons. Both summer and winter are long, with hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters, and with spring and fall serving as brief but comfortable transition periods. The city receives 20.75 inches (527 mm) of precipitation annually. Spring is the wettest season (May is the wettest month), while summer is very dry. Snow occurs on average from November to April, producing a total average of 24 inches (61 cm) yearly. The primary source of precipitation in Clearfield City is massive Pacific storms that move in from the Pacific Ocean along the jet stream from approximately October through May. Particularly cold storms have brought measurable snow as early as September and as late as May. After the Pacific train of storms has shut off and the jet stream has retreated far to the north during summer, the primary source of precipitation is afternoon thunderstorms generated by monsoon moisture moving up from the Gulf of California during mid-to-late summer. Although rainfall can be heavy, these storms are usually scattered in coverage and rarely severe. Clearfield City features large variations in temperatures between seasons. The hottest month is July, and the coldest is January. The average temperature over the year is 53 ¬∞F. The record high temperature is 108 ¬∞F (42 ¬∞C), which occurred in July 2002, while the record low is ‚àí26 ¬∞F (‚àí32 ¬∞C), which occurred in January 1937. During mid- winter, strong areas of high pressure often situate themselves over the Great Basin, leading to strong temperature inversions. This causes air stagnation and thick smog in the valley from several days to weeks at a time and can result in the worst air-pollution levels in the U.S., reducing air quality to unhealthy levels. Aside from occasional heavy snows in winter, severe weather is very rare.

Legend Hills Legend Hills is an office development in northern Davis County. Located on the east side of Clearfield, and bordering Interstate 15. Government Clearfield City has a \\"six-member council\\" form of government, with a city manager by ordinance. In this form, the powers of municipal government are vested in a council consisting of six members, one of which is the mayor. The mayor is, except in limited circumstances, a nonvoting member of the council. The mayor votes only when there is a tie vote of the other council members present, when the council is voting on whether to appoint or dismiss the city manager, or on an ordinance that enlarges or restricts the mayor's powers, duties, or functions. The mayor is the chair of the council and presides at all council meetings. The mayor also exercises ceremonial functions for the municipality such as ribbon cuttings and municipal appearances. The mayor may not veto an ordinance, tax levy, or appropriation passed by the council. Other powers and duties of the mayor in a six-member council form of government can be taken from the mayor and given to either the council or city manager by the adoption of an ordinance by the council. In 1966, such an ordinance was passed in Clearfield City, giving the city manager such powers and duties. By ordinance, therefore, the city manager is the chief executive officer of Clearfield City. This means that the city manager oversees the city's day-to-day operations, and all employees of the city report to the city manager. The city council appoints and hires the city manager and the city manager reports to the mayor and council. In the six-member council form of government, the council is the legislative body and is therefore primarily responsible for setting policy and adopting a balanced budget. The council enacts laws, appropriates funds, and reviews municipal administration. The city council shall elect one of its members to act as mayor pro tempore during the temporary absence or disability of the mayor. During such absence or disability, the mayor pro tempore shall possess the powers of mayor, except that the mayor pro tempore shall continue to cast votes as a member of the city council. The election of a mayor pro tempore shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting. The most recent election was held in November, 2017.

Five more pioneering families migrated to this region in the autumn of 1849. The region developed into an undefined community originally called North Cottonwood Settlement. In 1852, the territorial legislature picked North Cottonwood as the county seat and officially named it Farmington. Following orders from Daniel H. Wells and Brigham Young, Farmington residents built a wall around the city in 1853 under the direction of Major Thomas S. Smith. This walled townsite became known as \\"the Fort\\". Early church meetings were held in a log school and then an adobe structure. The county courthouse was used for religious meetings from 1855 to 1863. The city's ward moved back to the schoolhouse and the first meetinghouse was dedicated in January 1864.

He had been sent north to find feed for the stock and soon thereafter constructed a cabin and brought his family to settle the area. Farmington, Utah also claims Hector Haight as its original settler. Two miles north of Haight's original settlement, Samuel Holmes built a cabin in 1849 and was soon joined by other settlers from Salt Lake, namely Edward Phillips, John Green, and William Kay.Kaysville history . - City of Kaysville Although settlement began in the 1840s, the name of Kaysville connects with the fact that in 1851 William Kay was made the bishop in the vicinity by Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball. After the move south in 1858 (see Utah War) there was an attempt to rename the community \\"Freedom\\", but Brigham Young convinced the residents to retain the old name. In 1868 Kaysville became the first city incorporated in Davis County. An adobe meetinghouse was built in 1863. It was replaced by the Kaysville Tabernacle in 1914. In 1930 Kaysville had 992 people. Of those residents who were Latter Day Saints, they all were in the Kaysville Ward which also covered most of the rest of the Kaysville Precinct.Jenson, Andrew.

It is part of the Ogden-Clearfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 67,311, rising to an estimated 78,014 by 2019. Layton is the most populous city in Davis County and the ninth most populous in Utah. Layton has direct access to Salt Lake City, Ogden, Salt Lake City International Airport, Antelope Island, and the FrontRunner commuter rail. Layton City is a leader in economic development for the region, with immediate adjacency to Hill Air Force Base, a large hospitality district (1,000+ hotel beds) and conference center, the Layton Hills Mall, multiple nationally recognized retail and food chains, the East Gate Business Park, and the Weber State University-Davis campus. In 2014, Layton contributed $1.34 billionhttp://www.tax.utah.gov/econstats/sales/yearly worth of retail sales activity, the second largest market north of Salt Lake City and seventh largest in Utah. History=Founding Layton was settled in the 1850s as an outgrowth of Kaysville, and is named after Christopher Layton, a Latter-day Saint colonizer and leader. It was included in the boundaries when Kaysville was incorporated as a city in 1868, but by the 1880s many Layton residents wanted to separate from the city. They challenged Kaysville's authority to tax their property, claiming they received no municipal services. This dispute reached the United States Supreme Court in 1894 as the case of Linford v. Ellison, which was decided in favor of the Layton property owners.Linford v. Ellison, 155 U.S. 503 (1894). The separatist movement finally succeeded in 1902, when Layton became an independent unincorporated area. After further growth it was made an incorporated town in 1920. Expansion The town's population increased slowly; up until 1940 it was about 600. The creation of Hill Air Force Base to the north in 1940, followed shortly by the United States' entry into World War II, led to a dramatic population increase. War workers streamed into the area; the 1950 census counted 3,456 people. Layton became a city, transformed from a farming town to a residential community. Growth slowed after the war, but Layton continued to develop as a suburban bedroom community, as those not employed at the Air Force base began commuting to the Salt Lake City or Ogden areas. The city continued to expand geographically, annexing surrounding parcels of land, including the adjacent town of Laytona and city of East Layton.

Flagstaff Peak, north of Emery, has abundant dinosaur bone material, prehistoric mammal remains, and petrified dinosaur footprints.David D. Gillette, Vertebrate paleontology in Utah (1999) The elevation is around 7000 Fremont people, the Old Spanish Trail, and exploration The Fremont culture or Fremont people is a pre-Columbian archeological culture who existed in the area from AD 700 to 1300. It was adjacent to, roughly contemporaneous with, but distinctly different from the Ancestral Pueblo peoples. The culture received its name from the Fremont River, where the first Fremont sites were discovered. The Fremont River in Utah flows from the Johnson Valley Reservoir near Fish Lake east through Capitol Reef National Park to Muddy Creek, whose headwaters begin just north of Emery. The Rochester Panel located northeast of Emery Two significant Fremont culture sites are located north and south of the town. Artifacts such as pottery, manos and metates (millingstones), and weaponry have been found along Muddy and Ivie creeks. Coil pottery, which is most often used to identify archaeological sites as Fremont, is not very different from that made by other Southwestern groups, nor are its vessel forms and designs distinct. What distinguishes Fremont pottery from other ceramic types is the material from which it is constructed. Variations in temper, the granular rock or sand added to wet clay to insure even drying and to prevent cracking, have been used to identify five major Fremont ceramic types. They include Snake Valley gray in the southwestern part of the Fremont region, Sevier gray in the central area, Great Salt Lake gray in the northwestern area, and Uinta and Emery gray in the northeast and southwestern regions. Sevier, Snake Valley, and Emery gray also occur in painted varieties. A unique and beautiful painted bowl form, Ivie Creek black-on-white, is found along either side of the southern Wasatch Plateau. In addition to these five major types found at Fremont villages, a variety of locally made pottery wares are found on the fringes of the Fremont region in areas occupied by people who seem to have been principally hunters and gatherers rather than farmers. The Rochester Rock Art Panel west of Emery is a significant rock art panel left by the Fremont People and has been the target of vandalism and relic thieves.David B. Madsen, Exploring the Fremont (1989) The earliest known entrance into the region known as Castle Valley by Europeans dates back to the Spanish explorers. The oldest names in Emery County are Spanish, not Native American ‚Äî San Rafael, Sinbad, and probably Castle Valley itself, are landmarks of that era when Spanish padres, Spanish American explorers, fur traders, trappers, and frontiersmen followed the Old Spanish Trail through Emery. From about 1776 to the mid-1850s the Old Spanish Trail came up from Santa Fe, New Mexico, crossed the Colorado River at Moab, then the Green River where the city of Green River now stands, across the San Rafael desert into Castle Valley, then crossed along the eastern part of the town.\\"Dramatics in Castle Valley, 1875 to 1925,\\" Elmo Geary, 1953 This became the established route of the Spanish slave traders who captured indigenous people along the route and were selling them as slaves. Map of the Old Spanish Trail through eastern Utah A sizable herd of wild horses are managed east of Emery. These wild horses and burros have occupied the San Rafael Swell area since the beginning of the Old Spanish Trail in the early 19th century. Early travelers would lose animals or have them run off by Indians or rustlers. Many of these animals were headed for California to be traded and sold and were of good stock. The herd was also augmented through the release of domestic horses from local ranches. By the early 20th century, wild horse and burro numbers had soared and were being captured and sold by local mustangers. This continued until the passage of the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971. Since the passage of this act, the horses and burros have been managed under federal law and Bureau of Land Management regulation.Utah Bureau of Land Management office In the summer of 1853 Captain John W. Gunnison was sent by the War Department of the United States to explore a railroad route to the Pacific coast. He was assisted by Lt. E. G. Beckwith. They entered Castle Valley and passed near the town in October 1853. Gunnison described the area as follows: \\"Except three or four small cottonwood trees, there is not a tree to be seen by the unassisted eye on any part of the horizon. The plain lying between us and the Wasatch Range, one hundred miles to the west, is a series of rocky, parallel chasms, and fantastic sandstone ridges. On the north, Roan Cliffs, ten miles from us, present bare masses miles back, a few scattering cedars may be distinguished with the glass. The surface around is whitened with fields of alkali resembling fields of snow. Unless this interior country possesses undiscovered minerals of great value, it can contribute but the merest trifle towards the maintenance of a railroad through it after it has been constructed.\\"Emery Town Historical Committee, Emery Town (1981) Settlement Muddy Creek Gorge, east of Emery in the San Rafael Swell The first settlers to Emery came from Sanpete County, Utah. This is unusually notable as the settlers headed east, instead of west (like most settlers at the time), even if it was over a mountain range. The first attempt at settlement was made at Muddy Creek, a stream following down a wide canyon, and eventually emptying into the Dirty Devil River. The Muddy Creek vegetation included tall grass, sage, greasewood, rabbit brush, tender shadscale or Castle Valley clover, prickly pear cacti, and yucca. Growing along the creek banks were giant cottonwood trees and patches of huge thorny bushes with long needle sharp spines called bull berry bushes. These berries, when beaten off onto a canvas could be dried, made into jams, jellies, or even eaten raw. Among these early settlers were Charles Johnson, Marenus and Joseph Lund families. Casper Christensen and Fred Acord also brought their families and began to build cabins and plant crops. Joseph Lund, the first to build a small one-room log cabin with a lean-to, became discouraged and left it for Casper Christensen (this building still survives and has been restored and relocated to This Is the Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City). Most travel came by way of Salina Canyon and Spring Canyon, which weren't much more than deer trails. Roads were bad at best and almost impassable most of the time. The modes of travel were by horseback, team and wagon, or on snowshoes in winter time. Another company settled farther up the canyon around this same date‚Äîfamilies who came from Beaver, Mayfield, and Sterling. They called themselves \\"The Beaver Brothers\\". Among these were Dan, Miles, and Samuel Miller, George Collier, Samuel Babbett and others. Some of these became discouraged and left the first year. The Millers moved farther down the lower part of the Muddy Creek canyon. This part has been called Miller's Canyon ever since that time. Several miles south, on Quitchupah Creek, several families were trying to homestead on land that was more barren than Muddy Creek. In the 1870s, Brigham Young called on several families from Sanpete County to settle on Muddy Creek. Most of the first homes on Muddy Creek were called a dugout. It was a room dug in the side of a hill or the bank of a wash. The front was very crude, sometimes the only door being a blanket hung over the opening, or a rough wooden door, hung with leather hinges. The windows were small openings made in the front wall and covered with heavy greased paper or white canvas. Each had a fireplace in one end, which served for heat, cooking and light. The heat from the fire made the dugout unbearably hot in summer, so then the cooking was done on an open fire outside. The roof of the dugout was made of poles, covered with willows and dirt. These roofs served well in dry weather, as they were warm and kept out the wind. However, they leaked badly in stormy weather. Another great inconvenience of these roofs was the fact that they were a home for snakes, rats, mice and spiders. The floors were usually dirt or sometimes rock. During the years from 1882 to 1885 quite a number of families moved into the Muddy Creek area. A few of them were Jedediah Knight, Joseph Nielson, Pleasant Minchey, Frank Foote, Charley and Ammon Foote, George Merrick, Oscar Beebe, Orson Davis, Heber C. K. Petty, Sr., Joseph Evans, Rasmus Johnson, Carl Magnus Olsen, Peter Nielson, Peter Hansen, Heber Broderick, Peter Christensen, George A. Whitlock, Peter Victor Bunderson, Rasmus Albrechtsen, Christian A. Larsen, Lafe Allred, Hyrum Strong, Peter Jensen, Isaac Kimball, William George Petty, Niels Jensen, Wiley Payne Allred, Andrew C. Anderson, Stephen Williams and David Pratt. Most of these families were Danish immigrants. By 1885, it was determined that the canyon itself was not wide enough for many farms and that more fertile land lay to the south of the Muddy. The settling of this land required bringing the waters of Muddy Creek through a tunnel that took nearly three years to dig. With no trained engineering assistance, the settlers made their calculations, started from opposite sides of the hill, dodged numerous cave-ins of the treacherous Mancos shale, maintained the correct level inside the tunnel and connected both tunnels nearly perfectly.Edward A. Geary, The Proper Edge of the Sky: The High Plateau Country of Utah The earliest remaining building from Emery, relocated to This Is the Place Heritage Park in Salt Lake City 1883 was a red-letter year for Casper Christensen. On April 15 he was set apart as the Presiding Elder of the Muddy Creek Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On the 26th of August his daughter, Bellette, was born, the first baby girl to be born on the Muddy Creek. September 2 the Emery Ward was organized with Casper Christensen as bishop. Then on November 19 he was officially appointed postmaster at Muddy, in the County of Emery in the Utah Territory. His daughter, Hannah, was appointed as his assistant. When Casper Christensen was first appointed postmaster and bishop, a postal inspector found him working in the field and tried to make him understand that he wanted to inspect his postal records. Finally in desperation he said, \\"You don't seem to know who I am. I am a postal inspector.\\" Brother Casper indignantly replied, \\"And YOU don't know who I am. I'm the Bishop on the Creek!\\" Town residents have continued to use this phrase when dealing with someone who was self-important. The town of Emery, circa 1950, taken from \\"the Mountain\\" northwest of the town Muddy Creek and Quitchupah residents consolidated on this new townsite. Log cabins were built as soon as logs could be hauled from the nearby mountains. The logs were smoothed on one side with grooves chopped in each end. They were then placed on top of each other with the smooth side facing inward. Chinks between the logs were filled with mud or clay. Willows were used for lath, nailed to the logs and plastered with mud. This mud was then rubbed smooth and painted with a whitewash of lime. The roofs were made of rough lumber, and covered with a layer of straw or brush and then a top layer of dirt. Later the roofs were greatly improved when cedar shingles became available. The town of Muddy would later change to \\"Emery\\", after Governor George W. Emery. However, both names would be synonymously used. Emery has always been an agricultural community. Ranching and farming is its major livelihood. The town would swell in population to have its own school, but after World War II, the population has decreased due to lack of economic opportunities and has generally hovered around 300 residents. The discovery of coal, south of the town, led to several mines being developed and the idea that the town could once again draw in new residents. However, with the decrease in coal prices, production has not required the initiation of new mining operations. On November 2, 1967, the Last Chance Motel was destroyed by a cone-shaped F2 tornado. Furniture and bedding were thrown hundreds of yards. The tornado occurred at the unusual time of 5:30 am, and no injuries were reported.Weather: The Ultimate Book of Meteorological Events.

Three families responded to a call from the LDS Church asking to settle in the Castle Valley. They started on November 15, 1877 and arrived about 21 days later. The group spent time creating dugouts and later made their living in farming. Although settled in late 1877 the town had received its name sometime in the late 1860s to early 1870s when a government surveyor was sent under the homestead act to survey the area. The surveyor's name was Augustus D Ferron and, as the tale goes, the agreed to name the creek they camped by Ferron's Creek if he would agree to a \\"dunking\\" in the creek.

The population was 2,129 at the 2010 census. It is the largest town in Emery County. History Huntington is named after Huntington Creek, and the creek was probably named for Huntington brothers (William, Oliver, and Dimick, sons of William Huntington) who led exploring parties into the region during the 1850s. The first settlers of European extraction in the area were four stockmen, Leander Lemmon, James McHadden, Bill Gentry, and Alfred Starr, who brought their herds to Huntington Creek in 1875. In the fall of 1877, in response to the same call from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that brought settlers to the other creeks in Castle Valley, a small group from Fairview, Utah, under the leadership of Elias Cox, established a dugout colony on the banks of Huntington Creek and began digging irrigation canals. The colony grew from 126 in 1880 to 738 in 1890 and 1,293 in 1910. A majority of the early settlers came from the Sanpete Valley, which by the late 1870s had outgrown its irrigable land, and many belonged to three or four interrelated kinship groups, making for an abundance of cousins in the community. In 1880 a mile-square townsite was surveyed on the Prickly Pear Flat, a bench south and west of the creek. The first structure erected on the new townsite was a log meetinghouse, which was completed in time for an all-night New Year's Eve party on 31 December 1880. Most of the townsite was without water until the completion of the Huntington Canal in 1882. Settlers drew town lots and built homes in town as they proved up on their homesteads. The first homes, some of which were still occupied until recent years, were typically of sawed log or plank construction or of adobe sheathed with lumber. The erection of a new LDS meetinghouse in 1896 inaugurated a twenty-year building boom that saw the completion of many brick homes, schools, and commercial buildings. Huntington's early economic base was agriculture and stockraising. Alfalfa seed was an important cash crop around the start of the 20th century, and honey produced by local apiarist Christian Ottesen won first prize at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1903. For most of its history, however, Huntington has drawn its main income from coal mining. Small \\"wagon mines\\" in Huntington Canyon provided limited employment. The coal camp of Mohrland, to the north, active from about 1909 to 1938, was virtually an extension of Huntington, with many residents dividing the year between the mine and the farm. With the coming of better highways in the 1940s and 1950s, many miners commuted daily from Huntington to Hiawatha and other Carbon County mines. The Huntington Roller Mill, February 2010 Its proximity to the regional commercial center of Price, and distance from a major highway, to the north, has prevented Huntington from developing extensive retail business. However, a flour mill erected in 1892 remained in operation into the 1980s, producing feeds for local farmers and flour and cereals marketed throughout Emery and Carbon counties. Huntington High School, established in 1915 and later renamed North Emery High, was a focal point of the community until the consolidation of Emery County schools in 1962. From its early years, Huntington has had a strong amateur arts tradition. A martial band was organized in 1884. Community theater groups produced as many as half a dozen plays a year between 1890 and 1910. A choir directed by Thomas L. Hardee and composed of singers from Huntington and neighboring Cleveland won an Eisteddfod competition hosted by the Scofield Welsh Choir in 1895, and later performed at an LDS general conference in Salt Lake City. A men's glee club organized in the early 1920s is still in existence, with third- and even fourth-generation members. The 1950 census found 1,442 residents in the Huntington precinct. The population fell by one- third in the next ten years as mining jobs disappeared. This economic decline was reversed in 1972 when construction began on Utah Power and Light Company's Huntington steam-electric generating plant in the mouth of the canyon. The construction plus development of coal-mining operations to supply the plant gave the town the character of an energy boom town for a few years. Industrial development not only enabled some former residents to return to the community but also attracted new permanent residents, bringing more diversity to the town's former character as a Mormon farm village. While the community is still predominantly Mormon, the Mission San Rafael was established in 1977 a few miles south of Huntington to serve Catholic families in western Emery County. Baptist, Assembly of God, and nondenominational Protestant religious services have also been held in the community. The 1990 population of Huntington was 1,875.

According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Antimony has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Antimony, Utah History A party of 22 men came to the Antimony area in 1873 on a mission to make peace with the local Fish Lake band of Indians. They caught several coyote pups here, and named the place Coyote. The first permanent settlement was established, with the name of Coyote, in 1878. In 1880, deposits of the antimony ore stibnite were found in Coyote Canyon, and a mining industry began. This resulted in the town's renaming, in 1921, to Antimony. Fireworks Antimony is known throughout Central Utah for its Fourth of July fireworks display which consists of three bottle rockets and free sparklers for anyone over the age of 3. Under the direction of visionary Mayor Shannon Allen, the town moved its annual fireworks display from the town park to the bluffs overlooking Otter Creek Reservoir. This allowed the town to take advantage of a unique water venue for the fireworks. The fireworks are shot over the lake, reflecting off the water. The fireworks have become so popular that hundreds of residents of nearby towns forgo their own towns' fireworks displays to see Antimony's display.

As of the 2010 census, there were 797 people living in the city. The city is named after Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante, a Franciscan missionary and a member of the first European expedition into southern Utah. The nearest towns are Boulder which is to the northeast on SR-12, and Henrieville which is to the southwest on SR-12. The Escalante Petrified Forest State Park is located to the west of the city. Sections of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) abut much of the city's limits. The Hole-in-the-Rock Road, which begins east of Escalante, is the main access road into the eastern section of GSENM. The road leads to the Canyons of the Escalante, the Devils Garden and the Hole-in-the-Rock. History In 1776, Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez left Santa Fe, New Mexico attempting to find a route to the missions of California. The Dominguez‚ÄìEscalante Expedition followed a route north through western Colorado, west across central Utah and then southwest through what is now called the Escalante Desert finally circling back to the east after reaching Arizona near the north rim of the Grand Canyon. They returned to Santa Fe having never entered California or the areas near the city of Escalante. In 1866, Captain James Andrus led members of the Southern Utah militia through the Escalante area during the Black Hawk Indian War. The valley east of the Escalante Mountains, where the city of Escalante is located, was named Potato Valley since the group had found wild potatoes growing there. Brick house on Main Street Settlers from Panguitch first visited the area in the 1870s, where they met members of the John Wesley Powell expedition. The settlement was named based on a suggestion of Powell's group to honor Escalante even though the expedition had not traveled into the valley. In June 1875, the settlers returned to survey the valley. Twenty acre parcels were staked out for farming while city lots were marked as well. After a winter spent back in Panguitch, the settlers returned again and the first home was built in March 1876 by William Alvey. The first settlers built many homes using native bricks and as a result those homes are still standing to this day. The primary industries of the new settlement of Escalante were cattle and sheep ranching, dairy farming, logging and mining. Farming and ranching continue to drive the local economy today, along with increasing tourist-related activities. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built improved roads to Posey Lake and Boulder. Federal government management of large tracts of surrounding lands had begun and stricter regulation of public lands combined with limited private land resources caused many people to leave Escalante in the 1940s. The exodus to look for work in larger communities resulted in a loss of 33% of the population by the 1950 census. The population continued to decline through the next two decades, dropping as low as 638 people, leaving only 15 more people than the very first census in 1880. An increase of 25% by the 1990 census was followed by no change in the 2000 census and a slight decline in the 2010 census. Since the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM) was established in 1996, Escalante has seen a large increase in the number of tourists, especially in the spring though fall months. A survey taken from March to October 2004 by Utah State University claims that the BLM has estimated 600,000 visitors to various parts of GSENM, many of whom pass through Escalante.

He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa, and President of the South African Republic (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed Oom Paul (\\"Uncle Paul\\"), he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause‚Äîthat of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State‚Äîagainst Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom, and remains a controversial and divisive figure; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero, and critics view him as the obstinate guardian of an unjust cause. Born near the eastern edge of the Cape Colony, Kruger took part in the Great Trek as a child during the late 1830s. He had almost no education apart from the Bible, and through his interpretation believed the Earth was flat. A prot√©g√© of the Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius, he witnessed the signing of the Sand River Convention with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its commandos and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected Commandant- General, a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers. Kruger was appointed Vice- President in March 1877, shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned. He became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the First Boer War of 1880‚Äì81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive triumvirate, then was elected President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the London Convention, under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state. Following the influx of thousands of predominantly British settlers with the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886, \\"uitlanders\\" (out- landers) provided almost all of the South African Republic's tax revenues but lacked civic representation; Boer burghers retained control of the government. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions with Britain dominated Kruger's attention for the rest of his presidency, to which he was re-elected in 1888, 1893 and 1898, and led to the Jameson Raid of 1895‚Äì96 and ultimately the Second Boer War. Kruger left for Europe as the war turned against the Boers in 1900 and spent the rest of his life in exile, refusing to return home following the British victory. After he died in Switzerland at the age of 78 in 1904, his body was returned to South Africa for a state funeral, and buried in the Heroes' Acre in Pretoria. Early life=Family and childhood Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger was born on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the Steynsburg area of the Cape Colony, the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger (1801‚Äì1852), a farmer, and his wife Elsje (Elisa; n√©e Steyn; 1806‚Äì1834). The family was of Dutch-speaking Afrikaner or Boer background, of German, French Huguenot and Dutch stock. His paternal ancestors had been in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Kr√ºger, from Berlin, arrived in Cape Town as a 17-year-old soldier in the Dutch East India Company's service. Jacob's children dropped the umlaut from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin. Over the following generations, Kruger's paternal forebears moved into the interior. His mother's family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards. Kruger's great-grand-uncle Hermanus Steyn had been president of the self-declared Republic of Swellendam that revolted against Company rule in 1795. Bulhoek, Kruger's birthplace, was the Steyn family farm and had been Elsie's home since early childhood; her father Douw Gerbrand Steyn had settled there in 1809. The Kruger and Steyn families were acquainted and Casper occasionally visited Bulhoek as a young man. He and Elsie married in Cradock in 1820, when he was 19 and she was 14. A girl, Sophia, and a boy, Douw Gerbrand, were born before Paul was born in 1825. His first two names, Stephanus Johannes, were chosen after his paternal grandfather, but rarely used. The provenance of the third given name, Paulus, \\"was to remain rather a mystery\\", Johannes Meintjes wrote in his 1974 biography of Kruger, \\"and yet the boy was always called Paul.\\" Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826. Soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to the north-west at Vaalbank, near Colesberg, in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony. His mother died when he was eight; his father Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (n√©e du Plessis). Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, the only education Kruger received was three months of study under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and Calvinist religious instruction from his father. In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible. Great Trek alt= In 1835 Casper Kruger, his father, and his brothers Gert and Theuns moved their families east and set up farms near the Caledon River, on the Cape Colony's far north-eastern frontier. The Cape had been under British sovereignty since 1814, when the Netherlands ceded it to Britain with the Convention of London. Boer discontent with aspects of British rule, such as the institution of English as the sole official language and the abolition of slavery in 1834, led to the Great Trek‚Äîa mass migration by Dutch- speaking \\"Voortrekkers\\" north-east from the Cape to the land on the far side of the Orange and Vaal rivers. Many Boers had been expressing displeasure with the British Cape administration for some time, but the Krugers were comparatively content. They had always co-operated with the British, and had not owned slaves. They had given little thought to the idea of leaving the Cape. A group of emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter passed through the Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer republic with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey, the trekkers made improvised classrooms, marking them with reeds and grass. The more educated emigrants took turns in teaching. alt=A romantic depiction of settlers in covered wagons, driving lifestock The Voortrekkers faced indigenous competition for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a branch from the Zulu Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger took part in the Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter's laager, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000‚Äì6,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting, while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age. During 1837 and 1838 Kruger's family was part of the Voortrekker group under Potgieter that trekked further east into Natal. Here they met the American missionary Daniel Lindley, who gave young Paul much spiritual invigoration. The Zulu King Dingane concluded a land treaty with Potgieter. But he reconsidered and massacred first Piet Retief's party of settlers, then others at Weenen. Kruger later recounted his family's group coming under attack from Zulus soon after the Retief massacre, describing \\"children pinioned to their mothers' breasts by spears, or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels\\". But \\"God heard our prayer\\", he recalled, and \\"we followed them and shot them down as they fled, until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack ... I could shoot moderately well for we lived, so to speak, among the game.\\" Because of the attacks, the Krugers returned to the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that forced Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the Limpopo River, to what became Matabeleland. Kruger and his father settled at the foot of the Magaliesberg mountains in the Transvaal. In Natal Andries Pretorius defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the Battle of Blood River on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as Dingaansdag (\\"Dingane's Day\\") or the Day of the Vow. Burgher Boer tradition of the time dictated that men were entitled to choose two farms‚Äîone for crops and one for grazing‚Äîupon becoming enfranchised burghers at the age of 16. Kruger set up his home at the farm Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg in the Magaliesberg area. Kruger later became the owner of a piece of farmland named Waterkloof, on 30 September 1842.Deed of Original Grant 825/1842 registered 14 October 1842, Deeds Office Pretoria This concluded, he wasted little time in pursuing the hand of Maria du Plessis, the daughter of a fellow Voortrekker south of the Vaal; she was only 14 years old when they married in Potchefstroom in 1842. The same year Kruger was elected a deputy field cornet‚Äî\\"a singular honour at seventeen\\", Meintjes comments. This role combined the civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior commissioned officer. Kruger was already an accomplished frontiersman, horseman and guerrilla fighter. In addition to his native Dutch, he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion for the first time when he was a boy‚Äîin old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions, Kruger was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four- pounder elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared on his arm up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success‚Äî\\"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less.\\" The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait that long to start hunting again. alt=A man in a dark suit with a white hat. His left arm seems to be in a sling. In his right hand he grasps the barrel of a rifle. Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' short-lived Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of Natal. Pretorius briefly led Boer resistance to this, but before long most of the Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to the area around the Orange and Vaal rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains was settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846.; . In 1847 Kruger married her cousin, Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year. Concerned by the exodus of so many whites from the Cape and Natal, and taking the view that the Boers remained British subjects, the British Governor Sir Harry Smith in 1848 annexed the area between the Orange and Vaal rivers as the \\"Orange River Sovereignty\\". Pretorius led a Boer commando raid against this, and they were defeated by Smith at the Battle of Boomplaats. Like the Krugers, Pretorius lived in the Magaliesberg mountains and often hosted the young Kruger, who greatly admired the elder man's resolve, sophistication and piety. A warm relationship developed. \\"Kruger's political awareness can be dated from 1850\\", Meintjes writes, \\"and it was in no small measure given to him by Pretorius.\\" Like Pretorius, Kruger wanted to centralise the emigrants under a single authority and win British recognition for their territory as an independent state. This last point was not due to hostility to Britain‚Äîneither Pretorius nor Kruger was particularly anti-British‚Äîbut because they perceived the emigrants' unity as under threat if the Cape administration continued to regard them as British subjects. Henry Douglas Warden, the British Resident in the Orange River area, advised Smith in 1851 that he thought a compromise should be attempted with Pretorius. Smith sent representatives to meet him at the Sand River. Kruger, aged 26, accompanied Pretorius and on 17 January 1852 was present at the conclusion of the Sand River Convention, under which Britain recognised \\"the Emigrant Farmers\\" in the Transvaal as independent: they called themselves the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (\\"South African Republic\\"). In exchange for the Boers' pledge not to introduce slavery in the Transvaal, the British agreed not to make an alliance with any \\"coloured nations\\" there. Kruger's uncle Gert was also present; his father Casper would have been as well but he was ill and unable to attend. Field cornet alt=A bearded man, apparently about 30 years old The Boers and the local Tswana and Basotho chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his district in 1852,; . and in August that year he took part in the Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy (edema). Kruger narrowly escaped death twice‚Äîfirst a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but knocked him out without cutting him; later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket but not wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone's mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.; . Livingstone and many others criticised the Boers for abducting women and children from tribal settlements and taking them home to work as slaves. The Boers argued that they did not keep these captives as slaves but as inboekelings‚Äîindentured \\"apprentices\\" who, having lost their families, were given bed, board and training in a Boer household until reaching adulthood.; ; . Modern scholarship widely dismisses this as a technical ruse by the Boers to enforce a means of inexpensive labour for them while avoiding overt slavery.; . Gezina Kruger had an inboekeling maid for whom she eventually arranged marriage, and paid her a dowry. Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant (between field cornet and commandant), Kruger formed part of a commando sent against the chief Montshiwa in December 1852 to recover some stolen cattle. Pretorius was still sick, and only nominally in command. Seven months later, on 23 July 1853, Pretorius died, aged 54. Just before the end he sent for Kruger, but the young man arrived too late. Meintjes says that Pretorius \\"was perhaps the first person to recognise that behind [Kruger's] rough exterior was a most singular person with an intellect all the more remarkable for being almost entirely self-developed\\". Commandant Pretorius did not name a successor as Commandant-General; his eldest son, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, was appointed in his stead. The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger to the rank of commandant. Pretorius, the son, claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area‚Äîhe said the British had promised it to his father‚Äîbut virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this. Following Sir George Cathcart's replacement of Smith as governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed to the extent that the British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was in spite of the fact that in addition to the Boer settlers, there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue. On 23 February 1854 Sir George Russell Clerk signed the Orange River Convention, ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the Oranje-Vrijstaat (\\"Orange Free State\\"). Bloemfontein, the former British garrison town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal seat of government became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius' supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was in the latter part of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan (\\"Makapansgat\\") with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself. Mediator M W Pretorius, who became the Transvaal's first President in 1857alt=A moustachioed man in a dark three-piece suit Marthinus Pretorius hoped to achieve either federation or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, but before he could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts. The constitution settled upon formalised a national volksraad (parliament) and created an executive council, headed by a president. Pretorius was sworn in as the first president of the South African Republic on 6 January 1857. Kruger successfully proposed Schoeman for the post of national Commandant-General, hoping to thereby end the factional disputes and foster unity, but Schoeman categorically refused to serve under this constitution or Pretorius. With the Transvaal on the verge of civil war, tensions also rose with the Orange Free State after Pretorius's ambitions of absorbing it became widely known. Kruger had strong personal reservations about Pretorius, not considering him his father's equal, but nevertheless remained steadfastly loyal to him. After the Free State government dismissed an ultimatum from Pretorius to cease what he regarded as the marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they would have to make terms. With Pretorius's approval, Kruger met Boshoff under a white flag. Kruger made clear that he personally disapproved of Pretorius's actions and the situation as a whole, but defended his president when the Free Staters began to speak harshly of him. A commission of 12 men from each republic, including Kruger, reached a compromise whereby Pretorius would drop his claim on the Free State, and a treaty was concluded on 2 June 1857. Over the next year Kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between the Free State and Moshoeshoe I of the Basotho, and persuaded Schoeman to take part in successful talks regarding constitutional revisions, after which Zoutpansberg accepted the central government with Schoeman as commandant-general. On 28 June 1858 Schoeman appointed Kruger Assistant Commandant-General of the South African Republic. \\"All in all\\", Kruger's biographer T R H Davenport comments, \\"he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes, devotion to duty as an officer, and a real capacity for power play.\\" Forming the \\"Dopper Church\\" Kruger considered Providence his guide in life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart. He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the Earth was flat, a belief he retained firmly to his dying day. At mealtimes he said grace twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become Afrikaans. In late 1858, when he returned to Boekenhoutskloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions of the past few years and in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish a personal relationship with God, he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him \\"nearly dead from hunger and thirst\\", Davenport records. The experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child. Kruger belonged to the \\"Doppers\\"‚Äîa group of about 6,000 that followed an extremely strict interpretation of traditional Calvinist doctrine. They based their theology almost entirely on the Old Testament and, among other things, wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from the Psalms. When the 1859 synod of the Nederduits Hervormde Kerk van Afrika (NHK), the main church in the Transvaal, decided to enforce the singing of modern hymns, Kruger led a group of Doppers that denounced the NHK as \\"deluded\\" and \\"false\\" and left its Rustenburg congregation.; They formed the Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika (GK), thereafter known informally as the \\"Dopper Church\\", and recruited the Reverend Dirk Postma, a like-minded traditionalist recently arrived from the Netherlands, to be their minister. This act also had secular ramifications as according to the 1858 constitution only NHK members could take part in public affairs. Civil war; Commandant-General In late 1859 Pretorius was invited to stand for president in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be acting president in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as president of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day. alt=An elderly man with a magnificent white beard Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts‚Äîto the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations. Kruger, photographed as Commandant-General of the alt=A confident-looking man of about 40 with a large dark beard. The thumb on his left hand is absent. Schoeman mustered a commando at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on the night of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant-general. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced‚ÄîVan Rensburg became president, with Kruger as commandant-general. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg's opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as commandant- general with a large majority. The civil war ended with Kruger's victory over Jan Viljoen's commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at the Crocodile River on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as commandant- general with over two-thirds of the vote. The civil war had led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus to the east and war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right. alt=A dark-haired man with a scruffy beard In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger to restore law and order in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching Schoemansdal, which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's Swazi allies. Pretorius stepped down as president in November 1871. In the 1872 election Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He did not believe in the Devil, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that \\"as a good republican\\" he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new president. He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours‚Äîin Kruger's view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of commandant-general was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs. Diamonds and deputations=Under Burgers alt= Burgers busied himself attempting to modernise the South African Republic along European lines, hoping to set in motion a process that would lead to a united, independent South Africa. Finding Boer officialdom inadequate, he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from the Netherlands. His ascent to the presidency came shortly after the realisation that the Boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth. Diamonds had been discovered in Griqua territory just north of the Orange River on the western edge of the Free State, arousing the interest of Britain and other countries; mostly British settlers, referred to by the Boers as uitlanders (\\"out-landers\\"), were flooding into the region. Britain began to pursue federation (at that time often referred to as \\"confederation\\") of the Boer republics with the Cape and Natal and in 1873, over Boer objections, annexed the area surrounding the huge diamond mine at Kimberley, dubbing it Griqualand West.; . Some Doppers preferred to embark on another trek, north- west across the Kalahari Desert towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the Dorsland Trek of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, but he refused to take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council. In 1876 hostilities broke out with the Bapedi people under Sekhukhune. Burgers had told the Acting President Piet Joubert not to fight a war in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile commandant-general refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail‚Äîparticularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do. \\"I cannot lead the commando if you come\\", Kruger said, \\"for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition.\\" Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of \\"volunteers\\" under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate. With Burgers due to stand for re- election the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured him that he would do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered pace, and the idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country. British annexation; first and second deputations Shepstone arrived in Pretoria in January 1877. He outlined criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and expressed support for federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances‚ÄîKruger and the State Attorney E J P Jorissen refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, one of which was that Pretoria tolerated slavery‚ÄîShepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of vice-president. The impression of Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 was one of an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant. Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom was one of the first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him \\"gigantically horrible\\", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to Martin Meredith, Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports \\"so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives\\". They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions. E J P Jorissen, Kruger's colleague in the first deputation to London, pictured in 1897alt=A grey-haired man with a dark jacket and a tie Shepstone had the Transvaal's annexation as a British territory formally announced in Pretoria on 11 April 1877. Burgers resigned and returned to the Cape to live in retirement‚Äîhis last act as president was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train for the first time in his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea. During the voyage to England Kruger encountered a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, in their eyes more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies and the structure of the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls \\"remarkable heights of oratory\\", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of \\"a handful of irreconcilables\\". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain. Kruger did not meet Queen Victoria, though such an audience is described in numerous anecdotes, depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact. Between August and October he visited the Netherlands and Germany, where he aroused little general public interest, but made a potent impact in the Reformed congregations he visited. After a brief sojourn back in England he returned to South Africa and arrived at Boekenhoutfontein shortly before Christmas 1877. He found a national awakening occurring. \\"Paradoxically\\", John Laband writes, \\"British occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in the Transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit.\\" When Kruger visited Pretoria in January 1878 he was greeted by a procession that took him to a mass gathering in Church Square. Attempting to stir up the crowd, Kruger said that since Carnarvon had told him the annexation would not be revoked he could not see what more they could do. The gambit worked; burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to the British. alt=A man with a huge beard and a dark jacket According to Meintjes, Kruger was still not particularly anti-British; he thought the British had made a mistake and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure‚Äî587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against‚Äîhe organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council. Carnarvon had been succeeded as colonial secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who received the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: \\"Have you ever heard of an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?\\" Kruger retorted: \\"Yes. The Orange Free State.\\" The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: \\"Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end.\\" Kruger was touched and wore it for the rest of his life. Like its predecessor, the second deputation went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany. In Paris, where the 1878 Exposition Universelle was in progress, Kruger saw a hot air balloon for the first time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. \\"High up in mid-air\\", he recalled, \\"I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home.\\" The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal \\"to remind me of my journey through the air\\". The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an open letter in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation. Drive for independence Kruger and Joubert returned home to find the British and the Zulus were close to war. Shepstone had supported the Zulus in a border dispute with the South African Republic, but then, after annexing the Transvaal, changed his mind and endorsed the Boer claim. Meeting Sir Bartle Frere and Lord Chelmsford at Pietermaritzburg on 28 November 1878, Kruger happily gave tactical guidance for the British campaign‚Äîhe advised the use of Boer tactics, making laagers at every stop and constantly scouting ahead‚Äîbut refused Frere's request that he accompany one of the British columns, saying he would only help if assurances were made regarding the Transvaal. Chelmsford thought the campaign would be a \\"promenade\\" and did not take Kruger's advice. Soon after he entered Zululand in January 1879, starting the Anglo-Zulu War, his unlaagered central column was surprised by Cetshwayo's Zulus at Isandlwana and almost totally destroyed. Sir Garnet Wolseley, who headed the British Transvaal administration from 1879 to 1880alt=A moustachioed man with closely cropped hair and a chest covered in military medals The war in Zululand effectively ended on 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive victory at the Zulu capital Ulundi. Around the same time the British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co- operate with Wolseley's new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council. At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, many of them bearing the republic's vierkleur (\\"four-colour\\") flag, voted to pursue a restored, independent republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then‚ÄîKruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign. In early 1880 Hicks Beach forwarded a scheme for South African federation to the Cape Parliament. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; by the time they arrived the Liberals had won an election victory in Britain and Gladstone was prime minister. In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the prime minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as governor and high commissioner by Sir George Pomeroy Colley. alt=A balding man with a large beard, wearing a dark suit In the last months of 1880, Lanyon began to pursue tax payments from burghers who were in arrears. Piet Cronj√©, a farmer in the Potchefstroom district, gave his local landdrost a written statement that the burghers would pay taxes to their \\"legal government\\"‚Äîthat of the South African Republic‚Äîbut not to the British \\"usurper\\" administration. Kruger and Cronj√© knew each other; the writer Johan Frederik van Oordt, who was acquainted with them both, suggested that Kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed. In November, when the British authorities in Potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher's wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute, Cronj√© and a group of armed Boers intervened, overcame the presiding officers and reclaimed the wagon. On hearing of this from Cronj√©, Kruger told Joubert: \\"I can no longer restrain the people, and the English government is entirely responsible for the present state of things.\\" Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the south-west of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated‚Äîthe largest recorded meeting of white people in South Africa up to that time. \\"I stand here before you\\", Kruger declared, \\"called by the people. In the voice of the people I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!\\" He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the vice-president of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility. To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger. The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic. Triumvirate=Transvaal rebellion: the First Boer War alt=A man of around 50 with a dark suit and a dark chinstrap beard At Kruger's suggestion Joubert was elected Commandant- General of the restored republic, though he had little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position. The provisional government set up a temporary capital at Heidelberg, a strategically placed town on the main road from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria. Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison. Kruger took part in the First Boer War in a civilian capacity only, playing a diplomatic and political role with the aid of Jorissen and Bok. The first major clash, a successful Boer ambush, took place on 20 December 1880 at Bronkhorstspruit. By the turn of the year the Transvaalers had all six British garrison outposts, including that in Pretoria, under siege. Colley assembled a field force in Natal, summoned reinforcements from India, and advanced towards the Transvaal. Joubert moved about 2,000 Boers south to the Drakensberg and repulsed Colley at Laing's Nek on 28 January 1881. After Colley retreated to Schuinshoogte, near Ingogo, he was attacked by Joubert's second-in-command Nicolaas Smit on 8 February and again defeated. Understanding that they could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a solution at the earliest opportunity. The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary Lord Kimberley, then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the Battle of Majuba Hill the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit.; . This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world. Colley's death horrified Kruger, who feared it might jeopardise the peace process. His reply to Colley's letter was delivered to his successor Sir Evelyn Wood on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce. Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces‚Äîhe expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted‚Äîbut Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks. Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, retrocession of the Transvaal under British suzerainty, a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs. Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly \\"suzerainty\\" meant. Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months. The final treaty was concluded on 23 March 1881. Pretoria Convention Kruger presented the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. \\"With a feeling of gratitude to the God of our fathers\\", he said, \\"who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty ... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled to show you a proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice.\\" This statement was to be ignored by many writers, but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as one of his \\"most notable utterances\\". Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson and the Cape's Chief Justice Sir Henry de Villiers, who convened for the first time in Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with pneumonia. Kruger was largely happy with the terms under which the republic would regain its sovereignty, but two points offended him. The first of these was that the British would recognise them as the \\"Transvaal Republic\\" and not the South African Republic; the second was that it was still not clear to him what British \\"suzerainty\\" was. The commission, in which De Villiers emerged as the dominant figure, defined it primarily as British purview over the Transvaal's external affairs. The final Pretoria Convention was signed on 3 August 1881 by Joubert, Pretorius and the members of the royal commission. Kruger was absent due to his illness, but he did attend the official retrocession five days later in Church Square. Kruger felt well enough to give only a short speech, after which Pretorius addressed the crowd and the vierkleur was raised. Kruger House, the family home in Pretoria (2008 photograph)alt=A Dutch colonial-style house with the flag of the South African Republic flying outside. By now aged nearly 56, Kruger resolved that he could no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884. A direct consequence of the end of British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy. The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad‚Äîapprove it or go back to Laing's Nek, said Kruger‚Äîbefore it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate's decision to grant industrial monopolies to raise money and appointed the Reverend S J du Toit to be Superintendent of Education. To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years. In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new president the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which \\"God's Word would be my rule of conduct\\"‚Äîas premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers's Delagoa Bay railway scheme, introduce an immigration policy that would \\"prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled\\", and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and \\"obedient native races in their appointed districts\\". He defeated Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171, and was inaugurated as president on 9 May 1883. President=Third deputation; London Convention Lord Derby, with whom the third deputation concluded the London Conventionalt=A dark-haired gentleman in a dark suit Kruger became president soon after the discovery of gold near what was to become Barberton, which prompted a fresh influx of uitlander diggers. \\"This gold is still going to soak our country in blood\\", said Joubert‚Äîa prediction he would repeat many times over the coming years. Joubert remained commandant- general under Kruger and also became vice-president. A convoluted situation developed on the Transvaal's western frontier, where burghers had crossed the border defined in the Pretoria Convention and formed two new Boer republics, Stellaland and Goshen, on former Tswana territory in 1882. These states were tiny but they occupied land of potentially huge importance‚Äîthe main road from the Cape to Matabeleland and the African interior. Kruger and the volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to London to renegotiate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue. The third deputation, comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with Ewald Esselen as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger spent part of the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary Lord Derby and Robinson progressed smoothly‚Äîapart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson‚Äîand on 27 February 1884 the London Convention, superseding that of Pretoria, was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal's national debt and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph. Bismarck, one of the many European leaders Kruger met in 1884alt=A balding man with a large moustache The deputation went on from London to mainland Europe, where according to Meintjes their reception \\"was beyond all expectations ... one banquet followed the other, the stand of a handful of Boers against the British Empire having caused a sensation\\". During a grand tour Kruger met William III of the Netherlands and his son the Prince of Orange, Leopold II of Belgium, President Jules Gr√©vy of France, Alfonso XII of Spain, Lu√≠s I of Portugal, and in Germany Kaiser Wilhelm I and his Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. His public appearances were attended by tens of thousands. The deputation discussed the bilateral aspects of the proposed Delagoa Bay railway with the Portuguese, and in the Netherlands laid the groundwork for the Netherlands-South African Railway Company, which would build and operate it. Kruger now held that Burgers had been \\"far ahead of his time\\"‚Äîwhile reviving his predecessor's railway scheme, he also brought back the policy of importing officials from the Netherlands, in his view a means to strengthen the Boer identity and keep the Transvaal \\"Dutch\\". Willem Johannes Leyds, a 24-year-old Dutchman, returned to South Africa with the deputation as the republic's new State Attorney. By late 1884 the Scramble for Africa was well underway. Competition on the western frontier rose after Germany annexed South-West Africa; at the behest of the mining magnate and Cape MP Cecil Rhodes, Britain proclaimed a protectorate over Bechuanaland, including the Stellaland‚ÄìGoshen corridor. While Joubert was in negotiations with Rhodes, Du Toit had Kruger proclaim Transvaal protection over the corridor on 18 September 1884. Joubert was outraged, as was Kruger when on 3 October Du Toit unilaterally hoisted the vierkleur in Goshen. Realising the implications of this‚Äîit clearly violated the London Convention‚ÄîKruger had the flag stricken immediately and retracted his proclamation of 18 September. Meeting Rhodes personally in late January 1885, Kruger insisted the \\"flag incident\\" had taken place without his consent and conceded the corridor to the British. Gold rush; burghers and uitlanders Gold mining at alt=Inside a gold mine; men stand in a rough underground passage. In July 1886 an Australian prospector reported to the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which within a few years was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight‚Äîthe South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority. The President was by this time widely nicknamed Oom Paul (\\"Uncle Paul\\"), both among the Boers and the uitlanders, who variously used it out of affection or contempt. He was perceived by some as a despot after he compromised the independence of the republic's judiciary to help his friend Alois Hugo Nellmapius, who had been found guilty of embezzlement‚ÄîKruger rejected the court's judgement and granted Nellmapius a full pardon, an act Nathan calls \\"completely indefensible\\". Kruger defeated Joubert again in the 1888 election, by 4,483 votes to 834, and was sworn in for a second time in May. Nicolaas Smit was elected vice-president, and Leyds was promoted to state secretary. President alt=A man with a huge black beard Much of Kruger's efforts over the next year were dedicated to attempts to acquire a sea outlet for the South African Republic. In July Pieter Grobler, who had just negotiated a treaty with King Lobengula of Matabeleland, was killed by Ngwato warriors on his way home; Kruger alleged that this was the work of \\"Cecil Rhodes and his clique\\". Kruger despised Rhodes, considering him corrupt and immoral‚Äîin his memoirs he called him \\"capital incarnate\\" and \\"the curse of South Africa\\". According to the editor of Kruger's memoirs, Rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting \\"we simply take\\" Delagoa Bay from Portugal; Kruger was appalled. Failing to make headway in talks with the Portuguese, Kruger switched his attention to Kosi Bay, next to Swaziland, in late 1888. In early 1889 Kruger and the new Orange Free State President Francis William Reitz enacted a common-defence pact and a customs treaty waiving most import duties. The same year the volksraad passed constitutional revisions to remove the Nederduits Hervormde Kerk's official status, open the legislature to members of other denominations and make all churches \\"sovereign in their own spheres\\". Kruger proposed to end the lack of higher education in the Boer republics by forming a university in Pretoria; enthusiastic support emerged for this but the Free University of Amsterdam expressed strong opposition, not wishing to lose the Afrikaner element of its student body. No university was built. Kruger was obsessed with the South African Republic's independence, the retention of which he perceived as under threat if the Transvaal became too British in character. The uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind. Taxation on their mining provided almost all of the republic's revenues, but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in the running of the country. Though the English language was dominant in the mining areas, only Dutch remained official. Kruger expressed great satisfaction at the new arrivals' industry and respect for the state's laws, but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause the Boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers, with the probable result of absorption into the British sphere. Agonising over how he \\"could meet the wishes of the new population for representation, without injuring the republic or prejudicing the interests of the older burghers\\", he thought he had solved the problem in 1889 when he tabled a \\"second volksraad\\" in which the uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them. Most deemed this inadequate, and even Kruger's own supporters were unenthusiastic. Rhodes and other British figures often contended that there were more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers. Kruger's administration recorded twice as many Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged that there were more uitlanders than enfranchised burghers. According to the British Liberal politician James Bryce, most uitlanders saw the country as \\"virtually English\\" and perceived \\"something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors\\". On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the vierkleur at the city landdrost's office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying.; . One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: \\"I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself.\\" The riot was broken up by police and the Chamber of Mines issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, saying only a few of the uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as \\"the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began\\". Early 1890s alt=A moustachioed man in a dark three-piece suit In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's legal adviser William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now attained a dominant position in the Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland‚Äîthe so-called Bowler Trek‚Äîand Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland. Rhodes became prime minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A month later the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without consulting the Swazis)‚Äîthe South African Republic could build a railway through it to Kosi Bay on the condition that the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs.; . Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service‚Äînow widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports‚Äîcaused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging. Kruger's second volksraad sat for the first time in 1891. Any resolution it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were naturalised as burghers‚Äîa process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old.; . During the close-run campaign for the 1893 election, in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice John Gilbert Kotz√© as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence. The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotz√©. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893. Raadsaal, the Transvaal government building in Church Square, Pretoriaalt=A stately three-storey building with a tower on top Kruger was by this time widely perceived as a personification of Afrikanerdom both at home and abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. \\"Once seen, he is not easily forgotten\\", wrote Lady Phillips. \\"His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number ... and I think his character is clearly to be read in his face‚Äîstrength of character and cunning.\\" Rising tensions: raiders and reformers By 1894 the Kosi Bay scheme had been abandoned and the Delagoa Bay line was almost complete, and the railways from Natal and the Cape had reached Johannesburg. Chief Malaboch's insurgency in the north compelled Joubert to call up a commando and the State Artillery in May 1894. Those drafted included British subjects, the large majority of whom indignantly refused to report, feeling that as foreigners they should be exempted. Kotz√©'s ruling that British nationality did not preclude one from conscription as a Transvaal resident prompted an outpouring of displeasure from the uitlanders that manifested itself when Loch visited Pretoria the following month. Protesters waited for Kruger and Loch to enter the presidential coach at the railway station, then unharnessed the horses, attached a Union Jack and raucously dragged the carriage to Loch's hotel. Embarrassed, Loch complied with Kruger's request that he should not go on to Johannesburg. Kruger announced that \\"the government will, in the meantime, provisionally, no more commandeer British subjects for personal military service\\". In his memoirs, he alleged that Loch secretly conferred with the uitlanders' National Union at this time about how long the miners could hold Johannesburg by arms without British help. alt=A man in a light suit with a hat in his hand The following year the National Union sent Kruger a petition bearing 38,500 signatures requesting electoral reform. Kruger dismissed all such entreaties with the assertion that enfranchising \\"these new-comers, these disobedient persons\\" might imperil the republic's independence. \\"Protest!\\" he shouted at one uitlander deputation; \\"What is the use of protesting? I have the guns, you haven't.\\" The Johannesburg press became intensely hostile to the President personally, using the term \\"Krugerism\\" to encapsulate all the republic's perceived injustices. In August 1895, after gauging burghers' views from across the country, the first volksraad rejected the opposition's bill to give all uitlanders the vote by 14 ballots to 10. Kruger said this did not extend to those who had \\"proved their trustworthiness\\", and conferred burgher rights on all uitlanders who had served in Transvaal commandos. The Delagoa Bay railway line was completed in December 1894‚Äîthe realisation of a great personal ambition for Kruger, who tightened the final bolt of \\"our national railway\\" personally. The formal opening in July 1895 was a gala affair with leading figures from all the neighbouring territories present, including Loch's successor Sir Hercules Robinson. \\"This railway changed the whole internal situation in the Transvaal\\", Kruger wrote in his autobiography. \\"Until that time, the Cape railway had enjoyed a monopoly, so to speak, of the Johannesburg traffic.\\" Difference of opinion between Kruger and Rhodes over the distribution of the profits from customs duties led to the Drifts Crisis of September‚ÄìOctober 1895: the Cape Colony avoided the Transvaal railway fees by using wagons instead. Kruger's closure of the drifts (fords) in the Vaal River where the wagons crossed prompted Rhodes to call for support from Britain on the grounds that the London Convention was being breached. The Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain told Kruger if he did not reopen the drifts Britain would do so by force; Kruger backed down. alt=A man with a moustache and a dark suit Understanding that renewed hostilities with Britain were now a real possibility, Kruger began to pursue armament. Relations with Germany had been warming for some time; when Leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895, he took with him an order from the Transvaal government for rifles and munitions. Conferring with the Colonial Office, Rhodes pondered the co- ordination of an uitlander revolt in Johannesburg with British military intervention, and had a force of about 500 marshalled on the Bechuanaland‚ÄìTransvaal frontier under Leander Starr Jameson, the Chartered Company's administrator in Matabeleland. On 29 December 1895, ostensibly following an urgent plea from the Johannesburg Reform Committee (as the National Union now called itself), these troops crossed the border and rode for the Witwatersrand‚Äîthe Jameson Raid had begun. Jameson's force failed to cut all of the telegraph wires, allowing a rural Transvaal official to raise the alarm early, though there are suggestions Kruger had been tipped off some days before. Joubert called up the burghers and rode west to meet Jameson. Robinson publicly repudiated Jameson's actions and ordered him back, but Jameson ignored him and pushed on towards Johannesburg; Robinson wired Kruger offering to come immediately for talks. The Reform Committee's efforts to rally the uitlanders for revolt floundered, partly because not all of the mine-owners (or \\"Randlords\\") were supportive, and by 31 December the conspirators had raised a makeshift vierkleur over their headquarters at the offices of Rhodes's Gold Fields company, signalling their capitulation. Unaware of this, Jameson continued until he was forced to surrender to Piet Cronj√© on 2 January 1896. A congratulatory telegram to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January prompted a storm of anti-Boer and anti-German feeling in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk of the death penalty for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders‚ÄîLionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)‚Äîpleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of ¬£25,000 each. Resurgence The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's political reputation in the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the Afrikaner Bond; he resigned as prime minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January. Kruger's handling of the affair made his name a household word across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers. The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as Olive Schreiner and Frank Harris, and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state. Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, field guns and howitzers, primarily from Germany and France. President alt=A man with an enormous dark beard wearing a sash of state In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, the young lawyer Kruger had encountered on the ship to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State. They quickly won each other's confidence; each man's memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms. Chamberlain began to take exception to the South African Republic's diplomatic actions, such as joining the Geneva Convention, which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except vis-a-vis the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called \\"nonsensical\\". Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other's independence. Two months later Sir Alfred Milner became the new high commissioner and governor in Cape Town. Kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever the volksraad did not give him his way. In the 1897 session there was much surprise when the new member Louis Botha reacted to the usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it. A constitutional crisis developed after the judiciary under Chief Justice Kotz√© abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over the constitution. \\"This decision would have upset the whole country\\", Kruger recalled, \\"for a number of rules concerning the goldfields, the franchise and so on depended on resolutions of the volksraad.\\" Chief Justice De Villiers of the Cape mediated, sided with Kruger and upheld the volksraad decrees. alt=A young man in a dark jacket with a dark bow tie Kruger was never more popular domestically than during the 1897‚Äì98 election campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier than he had been in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet‚Äî12,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and Schalk Willem Burger's 3,753‚Äîand was sworn in as president for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as president, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotz√©, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to the notion that he was a tyrant. Milner called Kotz√©'s dismissal \\"the end of real justice in the Transvaal\\" and a step that \\"threatened all British subjects and interests there\\". Kruger's final administration was, Meintjes suggests, the strongest in the history of the republic. He had the former Free State President F W Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in Brussels, as Envoy Extraordinary in Europe. The post of State Attorney was given to a young lawyer from the Cape called Jan Smuts, for whom Kruger presaged great things. The removal of Leyds to Europe marked the end of Kruger's longstanding policy of giving important government posts to Dutchmen; convinced of Cape Afrikaners' sympathy following the Jameson Raid, he preferred them from this point on. Road to war alt=A moustachioed man in a dark three-piece suit Anglo-German relations warmed during late 1898, with Berlin disavowing any interest in the Transvaal; this opened the way for Milner and Chamberlain to take a firmer line against Kruger. The so-called \\"Edgar case\\" of early 1899, in which a South African Republic Policeman was acquitted of manslaughter after shooting a British subject dead during an attempted arrest, prompted outcry from the British element in the Transvaal and is highlighted by Nathan as \\"the starting point of the final agitation which led to war\\". The South African League, a new uitlander movement, prepared two petitions, each with more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking on the role of mediator. \\"You must make concessions on the franchise issue\\", Steyn counselled. \\"Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede ... Should you not give in on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends.\\" Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was \\"prepared to do anything\\"‚Äî\\"but they must not touch my independence\\", he said. \\"They must be reasonable in their demands.\\" alt=A cartoon; see description. The uitlander is depicted as towering over Kruger, who has to stand on a ledge to reach the sign he is pointing to explaining the franchise law. alt= Milner wanted full voting rights after five years' residence, a revised naturalisation oath and increased legislative representation for the new burghers. Kruger offered naturalisation after two years' residence and full franchise after five more (seven years, effectively) along with increased representation and a new oath similar to that of the Free State. The High Commissioner declared his original request an \\"irreducible minimum\\" and said he would discuss nothing else until the franchise question was resolved. On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: \\"How can strangers rule my state? How is it possible!\\" When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying \\"It is our country you want\\". Milner ended the conference that evening, saying the further meetings Steyn and Kruger wanted were unnecessary. Back in Pretoria Kruger introduced a draft law to give the mining regions four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven-year residency period for voting rights. This would not be retroactive, but up to two years' prior residence would be counted towards the seven, and uitlanders already in the country for nine years or more would get the vote immediately. Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient. After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty. Chamberlain issued an ultimatum in September 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions, else the British would \\"formulate their own proposals for a final settlement\\". Kruger resolved that war was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position to that of a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. \\"Would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife?\\" he posited. Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift pre-emptive strike. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy Conyngham Greene an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899. The start of the Second Boer War was announced in Pretoria that day, at 17:00 local time. Second Boer War A Boer trench during the alt=Boer War scene. Men of all ages wearing hats and bandoleers crouch in a line, rifles pointed The outbreak of war raised Kruger's international profile even further. In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him this was a fantasy. Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health‚Äîhe turned 74 the week war broke out‚Äîbut perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured. His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly from his office in Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram. The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger's sons, six sons-in- law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced quickly into the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories and by the end of October were besieging Kimberley, Ladysmith and Mafeking. Soon thereafter, following a serious injury to Joubert, Kruger appointed Louis Botha to be acting commandant-general. The British relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning of the war against the Boers. Morale plummeted among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later. With the major towns and the railways under British control, the conventional phase of the war ended; Kruger wired Steyn pondering surrender, but the Free State President insisted they fight \\"to the bitter end\\". Kruger found new strength in Steyn and telegrammed all Transvaal officers forbidding the laying down of arms. Bittereinders (\\"bitter-enders\\") under Botha, Christiaan de Wet and Koos de la Rey took to the veld and waged a guerrilla campaign. The British under Lord Kitchener applied scorched earth policy in response, burning the farms of Boers still in the field; non-combatants (mostly women and children) were put into what the British Army dubbed concentration camps. Kruger moved to Waterval Onder, where his small house became the \\"Krugerhof\\", in late June. After Roberts announced the annexation of the South African Republic to the British Empire on 1 September 1900‚Äîthe Free State had been annexed on 24 May‚ÄîKruger proclaimed on 3 September that this was \\"not recognised\\" and \\"declared null and void\\". It was decided in the following days that to prevent his capture Kruger would leave for Louren√ßo Marques and there board ship for Europe. Officially he was to tour the continent, and perhaps America too, to raise support for the Boer cause. Exile and death alt=Kruger viewed in silhouette from behind, Bredell to his right. Kruger is wearing his top hat. Kruger left the Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900‚Äîhe wept as the train crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first outgoing steamer, the Herzog of the German East Africa Line, but was prevented from doing so when, at the behest of the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under house arrest. About a month later Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, HNLMS Gelderland, and convey him through non- British waters to Marseille. Kruger was delighted to hear of this but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. Gelderland departed on 20 October 1900. He received a rapturous welcome in Marseille on 22 November‚Äî60,000 people turned out to see him disembark. Accompanied by Leyds, he went on to an exuberant reception in Paris, then continued to Cologne on 1 December. Here the public greeted him with similar excitement, but Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to receive him in Berlin. Having apparently still harboured hopes of German assistance in the war, Kruger was deeply shocked. \\"The Kaiser has betrayed us\\", he told Leyds. They went on to the Netherlands, which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily, but would feel more like home. After another buoyant reception from the general public Kruger was cordially received by Wilhelmina and her family in The Hague, but it soon became clear to Leyds that it embarrassed the Dutch authorities to have them staying in the seat of government. The Kruger party moved to Hilversum in April 1901. Gezina, with whom Kruger had had 16 children‚Äînine sons, seven daughters (of whom some died young)‚Äîhad eight sickly grandchildren transferred to her from the concentration camp at Krugersdorp, where their mother had died, in July 1901. Five of the eight children died within nine days, and two weeks later Gezina also died. Meintjes writes that a \\"strange silence\\" enveloped Kruger thereafter. By now partially blind and almost totally deaf, he dictated his memoirs to his secretary Hermanus Christiaan \\"Madie\\" Bredell and Pieter Grobler during the latter part of 1901, and the following year they were published. Kruger and his entourage relocated in December 1901 to Utrecht, where he took a comfortable villa called \\"Oranjelust\\" and was joined by his daughter Elsje Eloff and her family. alt=An elegant white two-storey house of European appearance, \\"ORANJELUST\\" written over the door. Rhodes died in March 1902, bequeathing Groote Schuur to be the official residence for future premiers of a unified South Africa. Kruger quipped to Bredell: \\"Perhaps I'll be the first.\\" The war formally ended on 31 May 1902 with the Treaty of Vereeniging; the Boer republics became the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies. Kruger accepted it was all over only when Bredell had the flags of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State removed from outside Oranjelust two weeks later. In reply to condolences from Germany, Kruger would only say: \\"My grief is beyond expression.\\" Kruger would not countenance the idea of returning home, partly because of personal reluctance to become a British subject again, and partly because he thought he could better serve his people by remaining in exile. Steyn similarly refused to accept the new order and joined Kruger in Europe, though he did later return. Botha, De Wet and De la Rey visited Oranjelust in August 1902 and, according to hearsay, were berated by Kruger for \\"signing away independence\\"‚Äîrumours of such a scene were widespread enough that the generals issued a statement denying them. After passing October 1902 to May 1903 at Menton on the French Riviera, Kruger moved back to Hilversum, then returned to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to Clarens, a small village in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland where he spent the rest of his days looking over Lake Geneva and the Alps from his balcony. \\"He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past\\", he wrote in his final letter, addressed to the people of the Transvaal. \\"Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again.\\" After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him. Kruger's body was initially buried in The Hague, but was soon repatriated with British permission. After ceremonial lying in state, he was accorded a state funeral in Pretoria on 16 December 1904, the vierkleur of the South African Republic draped over his coffin, and buried in what is now called the Heroes' Acre in the Church Street Cemetery.; ; . Appraisal and legacy alt=An impressive monument. A statue of Kruger stands on a tall plinth; he is wearing his top hat. Each of the plinth's four sides has a statue of a crouching Boer next to it. Academic opinion on Kruger is divided. To admirers he was an astute reader of people, events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero; to critics he was \\"an anachronistic throwback\\", the stubborn, slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black Africans. \\"More nonsense has been written about him than anybody I know of\\", writes Meintjes, in whose view the true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his image‚Äî\\"a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment, prejudice and deification\\", depicting Kruger as anything \\"from saint to stuffy mendacious savage\\". Rights and wrongs aside, Meintjes asserts, Kruger is the central figure of Boer history and one of the \\"most extraordinary\\" of South Africans. Following the Union of South Africa under Botha in 1910, Kruger remained \\"a vital force in South African politics and Afrikaner culture\\". The government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed Kruger National Park in 1926. In 1954, over half a century after its construction by Anton van Wouw, a bronze statue of Kruger in his characteristic Dopper suit and top hat was erected in Church Square, Pretoria; Kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching Boers from different time periods. Thirteen years later the South African Mint put his likeness on the Krugerrand, a gold bullion coin still produced and exported in the 21st century.; . His home in Pretoria and farm at Boekenhoutfontein are provincial heritage sites,; . the former of which is preserved to appear as in his time. Kruger gives his name to the town of Krugersdorp, and to many streets and squares in South Africa and other countries, especially the Netherlands and Belgium. This has, on occasion, led to controversy; in 2009 local authorities in St Gallen, Switzerland renamed Kr√ºgerstrasse \\"because of racist associations\\".; . Clarens, Free State is named after Kruger's last home in Switzerland. During the Second World War Kruger's life story and image were appropriated by propagandists in Nazi Germany, who produced the biographical film Ohm Kr√ºger (\\"Uncle Kr√ºger\\", 1941) to attack the British, with Emil Jannings in the title role.; ; . The underdevelopment of South African administrative law until the late 20th century was, Davenport asserts, the direct result of Kruger's censure and dismissal of Chief Justice Kotz√© in 1898 over the question of judicial review. \\"Paul Kruger's name and fame he made himself\\", Leyds said. \\"It is sometimes said that he was illiterate. This is of course nonsense ... He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things.\\" \\"In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master\\", E B Iwan-M√ºller asserted. \\"He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them. He was what I believe soldiers would call a brilliant tactician, but a hopeless strategist.\\" Soon after Kruger's death, Smuts told the British humanitarian campaigner Emily Hobhouse: \\"He typified the Boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects, and was no doubt the greatest man‚Äîboth morally and intellectually‚Äîwhom the Boer race has so far produced. In his iron will and tenacity, his 'never say die' attitude towards fate, his mystic faith in another world, he represented what is best in all of us.\\" Notes and references Footnotes References Newspaper and journal articles * * Online sources  * * Bibliography          * * Further reading * * Gordon, Cecil Theodore.

The population was 1,520 at the 2010 census, and was estimated in 2018 to be 1,691. The name Panguitch comes from a Southern Paiute word meaning ‚ÄúBig Fish,‚Äù likely named after the plentiful nearby lakes hosting rainbow trout year-round. Geography Aerial photo of Panguitch, November 2010 Panguitch is located on the western edge of Garfield County at (37.822234, -112.434650), in the valley of the Sevier River. U.S. Route 89 passes through the center of town, leading north to Junction and south to Orderville. Utah State Route 143 leads southwest from Panguitch to Panguitch Lake in Dixie National Forest. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Climate Panguitch has a cool semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSk) with summers featuring hot afternoons and cold mornings, and cold, dry winters. The high altitude and relatively high latitude means that mornings are cold throughout the year and freezing for most of it: between 1971 and 2000 an average of 227.7 mornings fell below freezing and 16.5 mornings fell to or below . Maxima, however, can be expected to top freezing on all but fourteen afternoons during an average year, and the winters are so dry that snowfall is light, averaging only with median cover never much above . The most snowfall in a month has been in the famously cold January 1949, and the most in a season from July 1951 to June 1952. Mild, dry winters like 1976/1977 and 1980/1981 can in contrast see negligible snowfall for an entire season. In a manner more akin to Arizona than northern Utah, most of the limited precipitation occurs during the July to October monsoon season, but Garfield County is usually too far north to receive the monsoon's full benefit. The wettest month on record has been August 1987 with , and the wettest day was August 18, 1984, with . 1967 with has been the wettest calendar year, whereas in 1989 only fell. History Panguitch was first settled in March 1864, when Jens Nielsen, a Danish convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, led a group of 54 families eastward from Parowan and Beaver to the Sevier River. Due to the area's high elevation, above sea level, winter's cold weather arrived early in the year, and the most of the settlers' initial crops were killed by frost before they could mature.Pesek, Margo Bartlett (August 31, 2014). \\"Panguitch, Utah, a hub for outdoor exploration\\". Las Vegas Review-Journal. p. E2. At a crisis point, seven men left the community to seek flour and foodstuffs from surrounding communities. Heavy snow forced the abandonment of wagons and teams, and the men finished their rescue mission on foot, reportedly by laying one quilt after another upon the snow to maintain their footing. Due to the Black Hawk War to the north, church officials decided the settlers should abandon the area, and they did so in May 1865. Five years later, Brigham Young decided it was time to try again, and new settlers arrived in 1871. The settlers built a fort, where they lived until more housing could be built and the fields could be replanted. They harvested a lot of grain, so much that they built a grist mill. The settlers cut lumber from the forests and processed it in sawmills and shingle mills. They had a tannery to produce leather from local cattle. The settlers used kilns to process local clay into rose-colored bricks. Workers were paid in bricks, which they used to build their own houses. Rose- colored brick houses still stand in Panguitch. Panguitch was incorporated in 1899. A social hall was built in 1900, but it burned down in 1920. A new social hall replaced it, and it continues to stand, as the Panguitch Playhouse.Bonham, Nicole A.

The Biblical name Moab refers to an area of land located on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Some historians believe the city in Utah came to use this name because of William Andrew Peirce, the first postmaster, believing that the biblical Moab and this part of Utah were both \\"the far country\\". However, others believe the name has Paiute origins, referring to the word moapa, meaning \\"mosquito\\". Some of the area's early residents attempted to change the city's name, because in the Christian Bible, Moabites are demeaned as incestuous and idolatrous (but note, Ruth was a Moabitess). One petition in 1890 had 59 signatures and requested a name change to \\"Vina\\". Another effort attempted to change the name to \\"Uvadalia\\". Both attempts failed. During the period between 1829 and the early 1850s, the area around what is now Moab served as the Colorado River crossing along the Old Spanish Trail. Latter-day Saint settlers attempted to establish a trading fort at the river crossing called the Elk Mountain Mission in April 1855 to trade with travellers attempting to cross the river. Forty men were called on this mission. There were repeated Indian attacks, including one on September 23, 1855, in which James Hunt, companion to Peter Stubbs, was shot and killed by a Native American.http://stubbstervorthistory.50megs.com/Peter_Stubbs_1824.htm After this last attack, the fort was abandoned. A new group of settlers from Rich County, led by Randolph Hockaday Stewart, established a permanent settlement in 1878 under the direction of Brigham Young.National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form for Moab cabin Moab was incorporated as a town on December 20, 1902. In 1883 the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad main line was constructed across eastern Utah. The rail line did not pass through Moab, instead passing through the towns of Thompson Springs and Cisco, to the north. Later, other places to cross the Colorado were constructed, such as Lee's Ferry, Navajo Bridge and Boulder Dam. These changes shifted the trade routes away from Moab. Moab farmers and merchants had to adapt from trading with passing travelers to shipping their goods to distant markets. Soon Moab's origins as one of the few natural crossings of the Colorado River were forgotten. Nevertheless, the U.S. military deemed the bridge over the Colorado River at Moab important enough to place it under guard as late as World War II. In 1943, a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp outside Moab was used to confine Japanese American internees labeled \\"troublemakers\\" by authorities in the War Relocation Authority, the government body responsible for overseeing the wartime incarceration program. The Moab Isolation Center for \\"noncompliant\\" Japanese Americans was created in response to growing resistance to WRA policies within the camps; a December 1942 clash between guards and inmates known as the \\"Manzanar Riot,\\" in which two were killed and ten injured, was the final push.Hansen, Arthur A. \\"Moab/Leupp Isolation Centers\\" Densho Encyclopedia (accessed 18 Jun 2014). On January 11, 1943, the sixteen men who had initiated the two-day protests were transferred to Moab from the town jails where they were booked (without charges or access to hearings) after the riot. Having closed just fifteen months prior, all 18 military-style structures of the CCC camp were in good condition, and the site was converted to its new use with minimal renovation.Burton, Jeffery. Confinement and Ethnicity: An Overview of World War II Japanese American Relocation Sites (National Park Service, 2011) p. 325. 150 military police guarded the camp, and director Raymond Best and head of security Francis Frederick presided over administration. On February 18, thirteen transfers from Gila River, Arizona, were brought to Moab, and six days later, ten more arrived from Manzanar. An additional fifteen Tule Lake inmates were transferred on April 2. Most of these new arrivals were removed from the general camp population because of their resistance to the WRA's attempts to determine the loyalty of incarcerated Japanese Americans, met largely with confusion and anger because of a lack of explanation as to how and why internees would be assessed. The Moab Isolation Center remained open until April 27, when most of its inmates were bused to the larger and more secure Leupp Isolation Center. (Five men, serving sentences in the Grand County Jail after protesting conditions in Moab, were transported to Leupp in a five-by- six-foot box on the back of a truck. Their separate transfer was arranged by Francis Frederick, who had also handed down their prison sentences, using a law he later rescinded to charge them with unlawful assembly.)Redsteer, Debra. \\"Leupp, Arizona: A Shared Historic Space for the Navajo Nation and Japanese Americans\\" Discover Nikkei, 28 Jun 2008 (accessed 18 Jun 2014). In 1994, the \\"Dalton Wells CCC Camp/Moab Relocation Center\\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and, although no marker exists on the site, an information plaque at the current site entrance and a photograph on display at the Dan O'Laurie Museum in Moab mention the former isolation center.Burton, Jeffery.

Later years County-sponsored sign promoting manufacturing in Moab during the early 1970s Fisher Towers at sunset Moab's economy was originally based on agriculture, but gradually shifted to mining. Uranium and vanadium were discovered in the area in the 1910s and 1920s. Potash and manganese came next, and then oil and gas were discovered. In the 1950s Moab became the so-called \\"Uranium Capital of the World\\" after geologist Charles Steen found a rich deposit of uranium ore south of the city. This discovery coincided with the advent of the era of nuclear weapons and nuclear power in the United States, and Moab's boom years began. The city population grew nearly 500% over the next few years, bringing the population to near 6,000 people. The explosion in population caused much construction of houses and schools. Charles Steen donated a great deal of money and land to create new houses and churches in Moab.http://moabtimes.com/view/full_story/2795539/article--Charles-Steen-- 1919-2006 With the winding down of the Cold War, Moab's uranium boom was over, and the city's population drastically declined. By the early 1980s a number of homes stood empty, and nearly all of the uranium mines had closed. In 1949, Western movie director John Ford was persuaded to use the area for the movie Wagon Master.https://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/20/entertainment/ca- secondlook20 Ford had been using the area in Monument Valley around Mexican Hat, Utah, south of Moab, since he filmed Stagecoach there 10 years earlier in 1939. A local Moab rancher (George White) found Ford and persuaded him to come take a look at Moab.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/45170/MOAB-MOVIES-- RESIDENT-HAD-LEADING-ROLE-IN-ATTRACTING-FILMMAKERS.html There have been numerous movies filmed in the area since then, using Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park as backdrops. Since the 1970s, tourism has played an increasing role in the local economy. Partly due to the John Ford movies, partly due to magazine articles, the area has become a favorite of photographers, rafters, hikers, rock climbers, and most recently mountain bikers. Moab is also an increasingly popular destination for four-wheelers as well as for BASE jumpers and those rigging highlining, who are allowed to practice their sport in the area. About south of Moab is the \\"Hole N' The Rock\\", a 14-room home carved into a rock wall which National Geographic has ranked as one of the top 10 roadside attractions in the United States. Moab's population swells temporarily in the spring and summer months with the arrival of numerous people employed seasonally in the outdoor recreation and tourism industries. In recent years, Moab has experienced a surge of second-home owners. The relatively mild winters and enjoyable summers have attracted many people to build such homes throughout the area. In a situation mirroring that of other resort towns in the American West, controversy has arisen over these new residents and their houses, which in many cases remain unoccupied for most of the year. Many Moab citizens are concerned that the town is seeing changes similar to those experienced in Vail and Aspen in neighboring Colorado: skyrocketing property values, a rising cost of living, and corresponding effects on local low- and middle-income workers.Stiles, Jim. Brave New West: Morphing Moab at the Speed of Greed. Tucson, Arizona: University of Arizona Press, 2007\\"Luxury looms over Moab\\" High Country News, March 26, 2001 Sunset Magazines March 2009 issue listed Moab as one of the \\"20 best small towns in the West,\\" a distinction corroborated by similar articles in other magazines. Since 2011 Moab has hosted an LGBT Pride festival. The first festival included a march which drew more than 350 people. The second year's festival had over 600 in attendance.

A toll ferry service across the river ended when a permanent bridge was built in 1911. This bridge was replaced with a new bridge in 1955, which was in turn replaced by another new bridge in 2010. The 1955 bridge was subsequently demolished. The highway that uses this bridge has been renumbered multiple times and is now numbered U.S. Route 191. Moab gained freight railroad access in 1962, when a spur railroad line (now the Union Pacific Railroad's Cane Creek Subdivision) was built to serve the Cane Creek potash mine. Moab has never had passenger rail service, although the California Zephyr has advertised service to Moab in the past via stops at Thompson Springs (no longer a scheduled stop), Green River or Grand Junction, Colorado.

Summer weather in Brian Head is influenced by the tail end of the North American Monsoon, which provides frequent thunderstorms in July and August, though convection is inhibited by the cool temperatures at Brian Head's extreme altitude. After the monsoon retreats, temperatures rapidly fall during September and October, when snow cover is permanently re-established.

History Paragonah was settled by residents from the nearby town of Parowan in the early 1850s. Parowan residents found meadows next to Red Creek that provided ideal locations for farming. The settlement was first known as Red Creek, but the name was later changed to Paragoonah and then Paragonah. There are conflicting sources as to the name's precise meaning, but it is of Southern Paiute origin and apparently is a reference to the red color of the water found in the area. Paragonah was incorporated as a town in 1916.

The population was 2,790 at the 2010 census, and in 2018 the estimated population was 3,100. Parowan became the first incorporated city in Iron County in 1851. A fort that had been constructed on the east side of Center Creek the previous year was an initial hub in the development of ironworks in the region. Parowan served as the agricultural support base for the local iron industry, whose blast furnace was located in nearby Cedar City. Eventually, the ironworks were decommissioned. Despite occasional successes, the mission failed to produce a consistent and sustained supply of pig iron. By 1858, most of the area's mining operations had ceased due to disappointing yields. Today, the area's chief industries are recreation and tourism. Geography Parowan sits on the southeastern edge of Parowan Valley, at the mouth of Parowan Canyon. A distinct red-top mountain known as Valentine Peak () overlooks the valley and is used as a common landmark for the city. Interstate 15 runs along the northwest edge of the city, with access from Exits 75 and 78. I-15 leads north to Cove Fort and Interstate 70, and southwest to Cedar City. Utah State Route 143 leads south up Parowan Canyon to Cedar Breaks National Monument. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. History Fremont culture and Anasazi people were the first known inhabitants of Parowan. Petroglyphs, pithouses, arrowheads, pottery, and manos dating from A.D. 750 to 1250 found in the area are evidence that it was on a major thoroughfare of early indigenous peoples. At Parowan Gap, a mountain pass northwest of Parowan, ancient people inscribed petroglyphs on smooth-surfaced boulders that feature snakes, lizards, mouse-men, bear claws, and mountain sheep. Located near the Parowan Gap there are dinosaur tracks. East of the Gap and petroglyphs hikers can discover Hadrosaurs tracks that were originally formed in non-resistant mudstone. The tracks have three toes and can be found on the side of 12800 N. Later, the Old Spanish Trail passed through the area. Parowan was founded on January 13, 1851, twelve months after Parley P. Pratt and members of his exploring party discovered the Little Salt Lake Valley and nearby deposits of iron ore in the Iron Mountain District. On January 8, 1850, Pratt had raised a liberty pole at Heap's Spring and dedicated the site as \\"The City of Little Salt Lake\\". Based on Pratt's exploration report, Brigham Young called for the establishment of settlements in the area to produce much-needed iron implements for the pioneer state. Mormon apostle George A. Smith was appointed to head the establishment of this \\"Iron Mission\\" in 1850. The first company of 120 men, 31 women, and 18 children braved winter weather traveling south from Provo during December. They sometimes built roads and bridges as they traveled, and they finally reached Center Creek on January 13, 1851. After enduring two bitterly cold nights, they moved across the creek and circled their wagons by Heap's Spring and Pratt's liberty pole, seeking the protection of the hills. Within days, the settlement organization was completed: companies of men were dispatched to build a road up the canyon, a town site was surveyed and laid into lots, and a fort and a log council house were begun. The council house was used as church, schoolhouse, theater, and community recreation center for many years. In 1861 construction was begun on a large church building to stand in the center of the public square. The pioneers envisioned a building of three stories, built from the abundant yellow sandstone and massive timbers in nearby canyons. Known as the \\"Old Rock Church\\", the building was completed in 1867 and served as a place of worship, town council hall, school building, social hall, and tourist camp. In 1939 it was restored through the efforts of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers and a Parowan-sponsored WPA project. It is now a museum of Parowan's early history. Parowan has been called the \\"Mother Town of the Southwest\\" because of the many pioneers who left from there to start other communities in southern Utah, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and even Oregon and Wyoming. In its first year, colonists were asked to settle Johnson Fort, now Enoch, where a stockade was built, and were also sent to settle along Coal Creek, site of the settlement to manufacture iron which became Cedar City. Parowan's first settlers were instructed to plant crops so that following immigrants could open up the coal and iron ore deposits, but local industries were also developed. Self-sufficiency was envisioned, and local industries included a tannery, sawmill, cotton mill, and factories for making saddles and harnesses, furniture and cabinets, shoes, and guns; there also were carpentry and blacksmith shops. In the early 1900s sheep and dairy industries were well established. Local farms were noted for their quality Rambouillet sheep, and the Southern Utah Dairy Company, a cooperative venture begun in 1900, produced dairy products and was known for its \\"Pardale Cheese\\". The first attempts at iron manufacturing were unsuccessful, but mining in the twentieth century brought prosperity to Iron County. When the closure of the mines and the completion of Interstate 15 threatened economic depression in the early 1980s, Parowan citizens developed an economic plan to keep the community viable. Businesses now support Brian Head, a year-round resort south of town featuring downhill and cross-country skiing in the winter and numerous summer mountain activities. Significant growth has occurred in the 1990s in Parowan; it has been attributed to affordable utility fees and a positive economic climate. Parowan is the site of the annual Iron County Fair on Labor Day weekend; it also is a host community for the Utah Summer Games and sponsor of the annual \\"Christmas in the Country\\" celebration each November. In 1993 the city began development of Heritage Park. This site includes a park, a grotto and pond, and statues commemorating the founders of Parowan. Other local historic sites include the original town square with the Old Rock Church, the War Memorial and Rose Garden, the Third/Fourth Ward LDS chapel built in 1915, and the Jesse N. Smith Home Museum. Parowan City supports the Parowan Community Theatre, which produces theatrical productions throughout the year. Notable people *Jesse N.

Mining history Eureka was originally known as Ruby Hollow before it developed into a bustling mining town. Incorporated as a city in 1892, Eureka became the financial center for the Tintic Mining District, a wealthy gold and silver mining area in Utah and Juab counties. The district was organized in 1869 and by 1899 became one of the top mineral-producing areas in Utah. The Eureka Micropolitan Statistical Area housed the \\"Big Four\\" mines‚ÄîBullion Beck and Champion, Centennial Eureka, Eureka Hill, and Gemini- and later the Chief Consolidated Mining Company. Plaque explaining a mining headframe, August 2009 Eureka's role as the central financial point for the district ensured its survival. It housed business establishments, including the second-ever JCPenney store (then called the Golden Rule Store), financial institutions, local and county governmental buildings including Eureka City Hall (1899) and a Juab County Courthouse (1892), various churches, and the meeting places for numerous labor, social, and fraternal organizations. Mining entrepreneurs such as John Q. Packard, John Beck, Jesse Knight, and Walter Fitch Sr. were important figures in Eureka and Tintic history. In 1979, Eureka was placed in the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Tintic Mining District Multiple Resource Area, recognizing the importance of remaining buildings and sites.

The town is located on the northern edge of the Juab Valley in the eastern foothills of the Wasatch Range, but entirely west of Interstate 15 (I‚Äë15). Note: While the town is not labeled on the map, the search for \\"Rocky Ridge Town, UT, USA\\" centers on the location of the town. It is part of the Provo-Orem, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. While there is a \\"Rocky Ridge\\" and a \\"Rocky Ridge Canyon\\" in northeastern Juab County (both located east of the city of Nephi, approximately south‚Äësoutheast of the community), the town was named for \\"the rocks, in a bountiful array of types and colors, strewn plentifully across the surrounding ridges separating Juab and Utah counties,\\" according to the town website. History The original community in the area was known as York and was the southern terminus of the Utah Southern Railroad from February 1875 to May 1979. (The Utah Southern Railroad was controlled by the Union Pacific Railroad.) However, after the railroad was extended further south, the community of York was essentially abandoned. A post office had been established in the community in 1875, but it closed in 1879. Nearly a century passed without much change, but by 1971 Marvin L. Allred had purchased in the area and I‚Äë15 had been completed to just north of the Juab‚ÄëUtah county line. Over the next quarter century the community (which had become known as locally as Allred Ranch) continued growing, with the completion of I‚Äë15 through the valley and the addition of more than to the community. In May 1996, the Juab County Commissioners received a petition to incorporate the area under the name \\"Rocky Ridge\\". (A few years prior some residents of the area had petitioned unsuccessfully for incorporation under the name \\"York\\".) The later petition indicated that the population of the area had reached 210. By October of that year, the petition for incorporation was approved. Geography Rocky Ridge is in the northeast corner of Juab County, at the northern end of the Juab Valley. It is bordered to the north by the city of Santaquin. Interstate 15 runs just east of the town limits, with access from the north at Exit 242 (Summit Ridge Parkway) in Santaquin. Payson is to the north, and Mona is to the south. Nephi, the Juab County seat, is south of Rocky Ridge. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all of it land.

History In 1862 ranchers came to Long Valley, land east of the future Zion National Park, to graze cattle along the East Fork of the Virgin River. Robert and Isabella Berry named the area \\"Berryville\\". In 1866 after the Berrys were killed by Indians, the other settlers left. In 1871 Mormons from the Muddy River settlement in Nevada came to settle, naming their town \\"Glendale\\". The people of St. Thomas, Nevada, relocated en masse to Glendale in that year, preserving their old ward organization in the new location.Andrew Jenson, LDS Biographical Enclyclopedia, Vol. 1, p. 378 By the late 1800s the Mormon communities in the area had grown in the nearby towns of Orderville and Mt Carmel Junction, and Glendale became part of the United Order, a program of economic and moral reform that began in 1874 under Brigham Young. On March 29, 1935, Glendale became an incorporated town. The towns of Mount Carmel, Orderville, and Glendale are known as Long Valley.

The population was 577 at the 2010 census. The town was founded and operated under the United Order of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This system allowed the community to flourish for some time, but ultimately ended in 1885. History US‚Äë89 in Orderville, with the Elkhart Cliffs in the background, October 2017 Distribution of goods and services Orderville was established at the direction of LDS Church president Brigham Young in 1875 specifically to live the United Order, a voluntary form of communalism defined by Joseph Smith. Orderville was settled primarily by destitute refugees from failed settlements on the Muddy River in Nevada. When it was settled, Orderville included of land and contained 18 houses, 19 oxen, 103 cows, 43 horses, 500 sheep, 30 hogs, 400 chickens, and 30,000 feet of lumber. The settlement began completely debt free. Homes were one- or two-room apartment units arranged around the town square. Community dining halls and public buildings were constructed. The dining hall began operation for the town on July 24, 1875, and prepared meals for more than 80 families. Men ate first, followed by women and children. Meal times were scheduled at 7 am, 12 pm, and 6 pm. Under the United Order, no person in Orderville could have private property, as it was all considered to be God's land. Each person was made a steward over some personal effects, and every family a steward over a home. During the first two years, the settlers worked without receiving income. They were allowed to use supplies and take food as needed. The bishop of Orderville oversaw the distribution of goods. Credits were recorded for all work done by men, women, and children and used to obtain needed materials and keep track of the labor done in the settlement. In 1877, the Order began a price system to replace the credit system, and monetary values were assigned to all labor and goods. At the beginning of each year, debts were forgiven, and those who had earned a surplus voluntarily gave it back to the Order. The settlers there grew their own crops in Orderville and had some small farms surrounding the settlement. They also used local materials to make their own soap, brooms, buckets, furniture, etc. Orderville settlers produced silk thread and wove it into articles of clothing. They later opened up their own tannery. Orderville had blacksmiths, clerks, artists, musicians, and other professions. Priddy Meeks came to Orderville to serve as the settlement's doctor in 1876. Ten percent of the net increase of Orderville was paid to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to follow the law of tithing. Management The group was managed by an annually-elected Board of Management consisting of nine men who bought and sold goods on behalf of the entire settlement. They also directed labor performed by the settlers. The president was the bishop, and the vice presidents were usually his counselors. Thus, there was a very close connection between spiritual and secular. Orderville was divided into 33 departments, and each year members of the board met with the department directors to determine what the needs were and how many workers would be proportioned to the department. In order for new members to join, the entire community had to vote. A new member was welcomed into Orderville only if the admission vote was a two-thirds majority. All newcomers were interviewed to determine their motives for wanting to join the society. They were also asked a number of questions regarding their moral and spiritual habits. New members had to agree to follow the strict standards and conditions of the settlement, including no swearing and giving up tobacco, tea, and coffee. Brigham Young cautioned against \\"allowing those whom might become parasites on the body from becoming members.\\" When members wanted to leave, they were given back the capital they had initially invested along with their surplus credits for that year. If the members leaving had debts, they were usually forgiven. Success Although the United Order was practiced in many Utah communities during the late 1870s, Orderville was unique in both the level of success it experienced under the communal living style, and in the duration of the experiment. In the course of a few years, Orderville grew into a thriving, self-sufficient community. The success and relative wealth of the community attracted more settlers, and Orderville grew to about 700 people. Orderville not only provided for the needs of its population, but produced a significant surplus for sale to other communities, which was used to purchase additional land and equipment. The extreme poverty of these settlers likely contributed significantly to their devotion to the principles of the United Order. End of the Order The Order continued in Orderville for approximately 10 years. During the early 1870s, the economic environment improved in southern Utah. The discovery of silver nearby led to railroad facilities and an influx of people to the area. Local farmers were able to find a market for their goods and gained more profit. The neighboring towns that had once bought the goods from Orderville, now found themselves able to import materials from other regions. Orderville goods became \\"old fashioned\\". The youth of Orderville envied the youth in other communities, creating a friction within the community. Due to this friction, the communal dining system was abandoned in 1880. Three years later the value system assigned to labor was adjusted, introducing a level of inequality that had not existed before. Families were also given their own spending money. These changes led to tension and much internal disruption of the Order. While these internal conflicts and changes eventually would have led to the end of the practice of the United Order in Orderville, national legislation ensured it. In 1885, the enforcement of the Edmunds Anti-Polygamy Act of 1882 effectively ended the Order by jailing many of the Order's leaders and driving many of the others underground. Members of the community held an auction using their credits as payment. Orderville continued its tannery, wool factory, and sheep enterprise, which were overseen by the Board of Management until 1889.

Delta is located at the north eastern end of Millard County along the Sevier River and is surrounded by farm land. The population was 3,436 at the 2010 census. History Delta was originally a railroad switch called Aiken. In 1905 Aiken was renamed Melville when Millard County began plans to set up irrigation and a dam. People purchased land for 50 cents an acre as long as they agreed to develop a 40-acre lot. The name was changed again because of the similarities between Melville and Millville, another town in Utah. The name was changed on May 12, 1908 to Burtner. The name was finally changed to Delta on May 11, 1911. The name is quite fitting as the area was a delta of the Sevier River.

Fillmore was the capital of the Utah Territory from 1851 to 1856, although the territorial legislature met in Fillmore only one term (1855). The original Utah Territorial Statehouse building still stands. History Fillmore, located near the geographic center of the territory, was originally built as the capital of Utah Territory. The Utah Territorial Legislature approved a plan to locate the capital in the Pahvant Valley. On October 28, 1851, Utah governor Brigham Young chose the specific site for Fillmore. Jesse W. Fox, that same day, surveyed the town. Anson Call headed the colonizing company that shortly followed; they built houses, a grist mill and a sawmill. The capitol building was begun in 1852. In the following years some disagreements developed with the Native Americans in the area, but Brigham Young sent Dimick B. Huntington to the area and he managed to negotiate a peace. The region was considered as a route, along the 38th parallel, for the transcontinental railroad. Captain John W. Gunnison, leading a military party surveying the region, was attacked by a band of Pahvants (Ute) west of Fillmore. Gunnison and seven of his men were killed (October 1853). During the 1860s two forts, Fort Deseret and Cove Fort were constructed nearby as protection from Indian unrest. In 1855, the territorial legislature met in Fillmore. However, in 1856, the legislature decided to move the Territorial Capital to the larger community of Salt Lake City.Jenson, Andew.

History  Chief Kanosh began a small farm in this area before the arrival of the Mormons in Utah. His band of the Pahvants were based in this vicinity.Jenson, Andrew. 'Encyclopedia History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1941) p. 390 In 1859, Peter Robison and Peter Boyce began the aptly named settlement of Petersburg. This was not far from the current site of Kanosh.Jenson. Encyclopedic History, p. 390 The town of Kanosh dates back to April 28, 1867 when Brigham Young, with the approval of Chief Kanosh, advised the pioneers to move from Petersburg (later Hatton, Utah) to the area then known as the campground of the Pahvant band of the Ute Tribe. When this move took place (1867‚Äì68) there were approximately 100 pioneers and 500 Native Americans living here. At that time the Chief Kanosh and many of his tribe were baptized members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Mortimer Wilson Warner, a local pioneer, is credited with having suggested that the town be named Kanosh in honor of the wise tribal chief. Chief Kanosh (1812?‚Äì1884), was the leader of the Pahvant Utes from the 1850s until the time of his death. According to Mormon records, he was the son of Kashe Bats and Wah Goots. The Pahvant band ranged the deserts surrounding Sevier Lake. With the intrusion of whites into this area, Kanosh struggled to insure the hegemony and survival of his people through negotiation rather than conflict. Kanosh was settled by Mormon pioneers and Chief Kanosh himself became an early convert to the faith. It is thought that Kanosh's willingness to work with non-Utes came out of his experiences working in the Spanish missions in California. Whether that work was voluntary or part of the long-standing slave trade of Indians into the Spanish settlements is not known. Certainly, the physical characteristics of Kanosh and others of the \\"Bearded Utes\\", as Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante had called the Pahvants in the 1770s, suggest generations of contact with the Spaniards. Kanosh spoke Spanish and seems to have had a facility for languages, as he also easily picked up English. Over time, the Kanosh tribe dwindled both due to difficulty in adapting to a farming culture from a hunter-gathering culture and in intermarriage with the local settlers. Even though many of the natives were deeded farmland, most chose to abandon the lifestyle and accept a government offer to move into the Uinta reservation where they would receive economic assistance. However, the Pahvants at Corn Creek, a settlement established near Kanosh, continued to farm. Surrounding Mormon settlers gave them some assistance. And although Kanosh was involved in the negotiations of the 1865 Spanish Fork treaty in which Utes agreed to move to the Uinta Basin, Kanosh and his group continued at Corn Creek until a grasshopper invasion in 1868 destroyed most of their crops. Even then, Kanosh and his people did not always remain in the Uinta Basin; they returned often to Corn Creek to farm, forage, and beg from Mormon settlers. Though Chief Kanosh still has a headstone in an honored location of the city cemetery, it was not until 1929 that the U.S. Government granted official recognition of the tribe and deeded them a small reserve near their ancestral lands at Corn Creek. (The actual location of Kanosh's remains is still unknown but is rumored to be in the foothills surrounding Kanosh.) Those few tribal members that remain today have now been almost fully assimilated into the local culture shaped by agriculture, ranching and the Mormon faith. The Kanosh surname is quite common in the area, including among female descendants who retain it as a middle name. Some of Kanosh's descendants have earned university degrees and returned from successful careers elsewhere to contribute to a comeback in the local economy. The town of Kanosh was organized as a ward of the Fillmore Stake in 1877. The population of the Kanosh precinct was 565 in 1930. Kanosh was adversely affected by atomic testing in the Nevada desert in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with many residents and former residents developing cancerous symptoms years later. In response and after years of effort by Utah's congressional delegation, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 2000 to provide minimal compensation for those thus affected. The government has taken positive steps to clean up the area so that many former residents have begun to return, adding or refurbishing businesses such as a motel, service station and eating places which were once closed or barely surviving. New homes have been or are being constructed on the north side of town. The south side of town has a stone \\"Welcome to Kanosh\\" monument at the junction of the new state highway which connects to I-15 southbound and the old highway which leads to the town cemetery. Thus, the once new interstate which once hastened the town's exodus has breathed new life into the town since the new state road connects to either the northbound or southbound I-15 interchanges within a few miles in either direction and also greatly reduces the driving time to Fillmore, Utah, county seat and one-time territorial capitol.

The population was 217 at the 2000 census. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), all of it land. History In 1871 settlers of Oak City, Utah built a dam at what is now Leamington. The town itself was settled in 1873 by Thomas Morgan. He was the first branch president when the Leamington Branch of the LDS Church was organized in 1876. In 1880 a log meetinghouse was built and by this time the town had an LDS Ward with Mary Goble Pay as president of the Primary Organization. Bengt Textorius was hired to bring a spur of the railroad down from SLC through Leamington past Lynndyl Junction. His wife Josephine talked her sister Anna and her son Abe, to come over from Sweden. She brought with her Bertha Rorstrum. Hans Olaus Sorenson married both of these women and started rearing families. He followed Bengt down to Leamington in 1883. Hans purchased a farm south east of town. He helped build the canal up on the ridge which helped water the valley. Rodney Ashby was bishop for many years and Bengt was one of his counselors. Hans had four surviving children with Bertha: Hyrum, Louisa Marie, Alice, & Heber and Anna had: Hilma, Joseph, & Annie Bertina. Hans found that sugar cane grew better than wheat so he produced molasses. He also got a cream separator and worked with the neighbors to take the cream and make butter. He took trips to the mining town Eureka up north to sell, butter, eggs, meat, and flour goods, plus fruit and vegetables in season. Life was not easy. He made an adobe mill for bricks to make small homes. They would go up into the canyons to gather firewood for home and for the cone kilns to make charcoal for the trains. In winter they would heat bricks on the pot belly stove and wrap burlap around for their beds. In winter, they would cut blocks of ice from the Sevier River and place them in small caves covered with straw to serve as refrigerators.

Founding Oak City, 2010 The settlement of Oak City was begun in late summer of 1868, when a few families moved there from the community of Deseret, Utah. They had become discouraged after eight years of unsuccessful attempts to dam the Sevier River to provide water for their crops, and had left the area. The early settlers were familiar with the Oak City area because they had pastured their cattle there in the spring and fall. They chose this area to settle because of the reliable creek and the quality of the land for farming. The town was settled in two phases. The first phase took place in July 1868 and consisted of a few families and young men to survey the town site, clear the land for farming, and provide shelter for the coming winter. Twenty-three more families came in October and November of that year.Shadows of the Past: A Book about Homes and Historical Places of Interest in Oak City, Utah, Copyright 2001, Oak City Town Council. The A-Bomb Project Oak City in Millard County, Utah, was the search director's first choice for the atomic weapons laboratory. Maj. John Dudley of the Manhattan District Staff was assigned to survey the West and find potential sites for an atomic laboratory in October 1942. His first choice for the laboratory site was Oak City, Utah, according to the Los Alamos history. \\"It was a delightful little oasis in south central Utah,\\" Dudley wrote. \\"The railroad was only 16 miles away over a nice, easy road. The airport was not too distant. The water supply was good. It was surrounded by hills, and beyond there was mostly desert. However, I noticed one thing: If we took over this area we would evict several dozen families and we would also take a large amount of farm acreage out of production.\\" Because of the potential loss of farmland, Dudley recommended his second choice ‚Äî Jemez Springs, New Mexico. In the end, Dudley's choice was overruled by J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist and the scientific director of the Manhattan Project. He favored Los Alamos.http://www.lanl.gov/history/road/choosing-site.shtml.

Notable residents  Utah's most notorious native son, the elusive international cowboy outlaw, Robert Leroy Parker, better known as Butch Cassidy, grew up in Circle Valley just a mile from Circleville (but he was born considerably further to the west, across the Tushar Mountains, in the town of Beaver, Utah). His family's small cabin, on the outskirts of town, is still standing on the land they homesteaded. It can be seen on the west side of the road almost exactly one mile to the south of Circleville on what is now US Highway 89. The cabin's location is also just south of the smaller town of Junction, the county seat, and about north of Panguitch. Charlie Siringo visited Circleville while in pursuit of the Wild Bunch. Siringo wrote, \\"a week was spent in the straggling village of Circleville, and I found out all about 'Butch's' early life and much about his late doings. His true name was Parker, his nickname being 'Sallie' Parker when a boy. This nickname of itself was enough to drive a sensitive boy to the 'bad'. I had hard work to keep from falling in love with Miss Parker, the pretty young sister of 'Butch' Casiday. She was the deputy postmistress in Circleville, and I made her acquaintance.\\" Lula Parker Betenson (b. 1884), sister of \\"Butch\\" Cassidy, lived in Circleville, dying aged 96 in 1980.http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/parker/17196/ Betenson's 1975 book Butch Cassidy, My Brother,Betenson, Lula Parker; Flack, Dora.

In the 1870s Brigham Young was encouraging communal living in United Order communities. The King families' United Order functioned from 1876 to 1883. Kingston became an incorporated town in 1935. The members of the United Order built the village of Kingston on ten acres of land east of Circleville. \\"The town consisted of a central community building for school, dances, church and other meetings. A blacksmith shop, milk house, bakery, tailor shop, post office, carpenter shop and store surrounded the meetinghouse. Homes built in like style formed a fort around a ten-acre block. These first log houses had dirt floors and roofs. A communal kitchen and dining hall about seventy feet long stood in the center, with a large vegetable garden close by.\\" Just east of Kingston the community had their industrial center in which buildings such as a flour mill, tannery, sawmill, and woolen mill were located. Isaac Riddle had previously built a burr mill in the area, however, it could not meet the needs of the people and so they built a gristmill at the mouth of Kingston Canyon.

It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 383 at the 2010 census, a slight increase from the 2000 figure of 370. Alta is also the location of Alta Ski Area, a ski resort that has 500,000 visitors a year. It is known for its powder skiing and its decision to not allow snowboarding. History The Emma Silver Mine and the City (c.1875) Cecret Lake near Alta Alta has been important to the development of skiing in Utah. Alta was founded about 1865 to house miners from the Emma mine, the Flagstaff mine, and other silver mines in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Sensationally rich silver ore in the Emma mine enabled its owners to sell the mine at an inflated price to British investors in 1871. The subsequent exhaustion of the Emma ore body led to the recall of the American ambassador to Great Britain, who was a director of the company, and Congressional hearings in Washington.Dan Plazak, A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top, Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 2006, , p.39-77. An incident that occurred in the town in 1873 was adapted by Rod Serling for the episode entitled \\"Mr. Garrity and the Graves\\" of his television series The Twilight Zone. An 1878 fire and an 1885 avalanche destroyed most of the original mining town, though some mining activity persisted into the 20th century. By the 1930s, only one resident, George Watson, remained in the town. Facing back taxes on mining claims he owned, Watson donated much of the land in Alta to the U.S. Forest Service. Watson stipulated that the Forest Service use the land to construct a ski area. In 1935, Norwegian skiing legend Alf Engen was hired to help develop the area, and Alta opened its first ski lift in 1938. Today, Alta is a small town, centered around the Alta Ski Area. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.1 square miles (10.5 km2), of which, 4.1 square miles (10.5 km2) of it is land and 0.25% is water.

The population was 4.7 percent under the age of 18 and 2.6 percent was 65 or older. Climate Alta experiences a high altitude humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb), which borders on a subalpine climate (Dfc), due to its high elevation. Due to its proximity to the Great Salt Lake, the town receives very heavy snows, averaging over per year. During the very wet season of 1982/1983, Alta received as much as of snow, leading to record flooding of Wasatch streams as the snow melted during May and June that year.\\"Utah Battles Floods, Mud\\"; in Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; June 3, 1983; p. 30 Alta's total precipitation of during 1983 is a record for a calendar year in any state of the Mountain West; \\"Weather Extremes\\" strangely Villanueva only away recorded only , which is a record low for New Mexico, in that same year.

The city was incorporated on November 29, 1999 as Holladay-Cottonwood, and the name was shortened to Holladay on December 14 of that year. It was reported in the 1990 census as the Holladay-Cottonwood CDP. History On July 29, 1847 a group of Mormon pioneers (members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) known as the Mississippi Company, among them John Holladay of Alabama, entered the Salt Lake Valley. Within weeks after their arrival, they discovered a free-flowing, spring-fed stream, which they called Spring Creek (near what is now Kentucky Avenue). While most of the group returned to the main settlement in Great Salt Lake for the winter, two or three men built dugouts along this stream and wintered over. Thus, this became the first village established away from Great Salt Lake City itself. In the spring, a number of families hurried out to build homes and tame the land. There were numerous springs and ponds here and grasses and wild flowers were abundant, making this a desirable area for settlement. When John Holladay was named as the branch president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the village took upon itself the name of Holladay's Settlement or Holladay's Burgh. John Holladay's family dates to the early 18th century in Virginia. His ancestors were signers of the South Carolina Declaration of Independence and fought in the Revolutionary War. He is a cousin to Ben Holladay, The Stagecoach King, who traded with the LDS and ran his Denver-San Francisco stage line through Salt Lake. It is not known if they were in contact. John and his father Daniel, a Revolutionary War veteran, pioneered in Alabama before John's conversion to Mormonism. A year before the first LDS migration, in the spring of 1846, he departed west with his extended family joining other converts that made up the Mississippi Company led by John Brown. They had been led to expect to meet the main party on the trail but after going as far as Laramie without a sign of them they went south and wintered at Pueblo, Colorado where they were later joined by the Mormon Battalion sick detachments. They had not gotten the word that Brigham Young's departure had been delayed by a year. Holladay is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in Utah, since Salt Lake City was abandoned for a time in 1857 when Johnston's Army occupied the city. Cottonwood, a nearby settlement, was always associated with \\"Holladay's Burgh,\\" and the area was first designated \\"Big Cottonwood,\\" and later, as one of Salt Lake County's unincorporated communities, as \\"Holladay-Cottonwood\\". Another center of settlement is the area settled in the mid-19th century by Rasmus Knudsen, now known as Knudsen's Corner. This area lies in the extreme southeastern corner of the city and is split with neighboring Cottonwood Heights. In the 1960s the Cottonwood Mall was constructed in Holladay, it being Utah's first enclosed shopping mall. The mall was closed down in 2007 after a plan to turn the mall into a European-style outdoor shopping village was announced. The city was incorporated on November 29, 1999 as Holladay-Cottonwood, and the name was shortened to Holladay on December 14 of that year. Holladay City operated under the \\"strong mayor\\" form of government from 1999 until 2003, when the \\"council-manager\\" form was adopted. The mayors of Holladay have been Liane Stillman (1999 to 2001), Dennis Larkin (2001 to 2003), Dennis Webb (2003 to 2014) and Robert Dahle (2014 to present). The city's first manager was Randy Fitts (2003 to 2016). Members of the City Council have included Edward D.P. Lunt, Sandy Thackeray, Steven Peterson, Jim Palmer, Grant Orton, Daniel Bay Gibbons, Jeffrey Fishman, Hugo Diederich, Lynn Pace and Patricia Pignanelli. Known for its fine old homes, heavily wooded lots, the controlling of commercial development and the preservation of open space have been the chief political issues in Holladay's recent history. It has also expanded its borders several times, the most significant expansion of which was in 2002. Demographics According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2017, there were 30,709 people in Holladay. The racial makeup of the county was 89.4% non-Hispanic White, 1.4% Black, 0.1% Native American, 2.0% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and 1.4% from two or more races. 5.7% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

History : See also: Kearns Army Airfield for information about the military use of the facility  WWII  map of camp Kearns Kearns came into existence 1 May 1942 as a World War II United States Army Air Forces training facility known as Kearns Army Air Base (also known as Kearns Center; redesignated: Camp Kearns, 1 January 1944). Before the base was built, the area consisted of dry farms on land reserved for universities and colleges. Construction of the base involved building airplane runways and hangars, with several taxiways and a large parking apron and a control tower. Several hundred buildings were also constructed and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi- permanent materials. Most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper. The thousands of soldiers and airmen stationed there temporarily made the base one of the largest cities in the state. On 15 August 1946, the Air Force deactivated the base and turned the facility over to the State of Utah. The presence of roads and other infrastructure made the area attractive to developers. Houses and businesses sprang up rapidly on what had just a few years earlier been farmland. A theater for \\"colored personnel\\" became part of Kearns Junior High School. A base chapel is now part of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church. The base train station is a day-care center. A cannon that had stood next to the headquarters' flagpole stood for many years at the corner of 40th West and 54th South.

The population was 26,505 at the 2010 census, a moderate increase over the 2000 figure of 22,770. History=Settlement Settlement of the area began in 1851 shortly after pioneers reached the Salt Lake Valley. Early farmers settled in 1868 at the base of the northern Oquirrh Mountains and called their community Pleasant Green. By 1900, there were about 20 families in the area. One of the first Pleasant Green farmers was Abraham Coon, who established a livestock ranch and settlement called Coonville in a canyon mouth at about 5400 South. The canyon is now known as Coon Canyon, and Coon Creek flowing out of it, is one of the major Oquirrh Mountain drainages. Coon Creek flows north and west through Magna to the Great Salt Lake. The Pleasant Green Cemetery located in the Oquirrh foothills, at about 3500 South, was established in 1883. In 1890, in response to a law requiring all children to receive free public education, the first school was built in the community. 1900-1960 In the early 1900s, copper mining activity in the Oquirrhs began transforming the Pleasant Green area from an agricultural hamlet to an industrial community. D.C. Jackling established the Utah Copper Company, which later became Kennecott Copper Corp. In 1906, the company began constructing its Magna Mill. He chose the name ‚ÄúMagna‚Äù from the Latin word meaning ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúsuperior\\". Boston Consolidated Copper constructed a second mill in the area in 1909. In 1911, the companies merged and the mill was renamed Arthur Mill. Construction workers lived in a temporary settlement known as Ragtown. Several substantial homes were built in the tent city and later moved to the present community. As the mills began operating, some local farmers traded in their plows for a steady company paycheck and began moving in to work at the mills. In 1906, the community's name was changed from \\"Pleasant Green\\" to \\"Magna\\", because postal officials were uncomfortable with the old name's similarity to Pleasant Grove, another Utah community. By 1909, the Hawthorne School (no longer standing) had been built in the eastern Magna area. In 1908, the Webster School (destroyed by fire and demolished in June 2004) was built at the west end of what is now Main Street. In 1924, the first building of the present Cyprus High School was completed. Over the years, buildings and additions have been constructed on the campus. At the time, commuting to work by automobile was not practical. Few mine workers had cars and cross valley roads were in marginal condition. Workers lived in the town and walked to the mills. Downtown Magna included churches, saloons, fraternal halls, and stores. Several small neighborhoods, such as Japtown, Snaketown, and Little Italy, developed around Main Street. Many early residents were immigrants, primarily from Eastern Europe but Magna was not a mining town. Between 1915 and 1960, the town's fortunes fluctuated with the copper industry. During the Great Depression, the mills shut down for a period and workers were laid off. About 1940, there was a resurgence as the pending war boosted copper demand. Growth continued after World War II, through the 1960s. 1960-1980 By the 1960s, the community was experiencing the first signs of a suburban transition. The Hercules Powder Co., once a small dynamite manufacturing firm, had begun producing rocket motors at its Bacchus Works south of the Magna community, named after 1912 founder T.W. Bacchus. The increased jobs were one factor encouraging subdivision development in the Magna, Kearns, and West Valley City areas. In 1961, the voters in the Magna Improvement District (now the Magna Water and Sewer District) approved a bond that financed a sewage treatment plant, water storage tanks, pumps and well development. The improvements created sufficient capacity to serve more than double the population at the time and helped open the way for development. Not only did Magna's population begin shifting southward during the 1960s, but also automobile commuting, both to work and shopping, became common. As business activity moved to other areas, Main Street slowly began to deteriorate. Presently, some of the commercial space there is vacant. During the 1970s, as part of a general west valley suburbanization trend, the community experienced more dramatic growth. Inexpensive land south and east of the historic town center began being developed into moderately priced single-family homes. The new neighborhoods tended to attract middle-income working class couples with younger families. While the community had grown from approximately 8,900 in 1960 to 10,000 in 1970, the population had increased to over 23,000 by 2000. This increase is about double the countywide growth rate. 1980-present The process for Magna to become a township took over 10 years. Growth and development continue to define Magna. The West Bench plan for redevelopment of mining land should have a major impact on the future of Magna. Kennecott Land plans major development in the areas immediately surrounding Magna. The area west of Magna along I-80 is currently slated to become one of 2 major \\"urban centers\\" for Kennecott Land's west bench development plan. The Historic Main Street underwent a major remodel in 2006. Main Street has also become a popular location for film makers. including the Disney corporation, and films such as Disney Channel's TV movie, Dadnapped, and some of the Halloweentown movies filmed on Magna Main Street. A two part episode (and series finale) of the TV series Touched by an Angel, \\"I'll Walk with You\\". The popular TV series Granite Flats also uses some of the Magna locations in part of the series. Disney's series 'Andi Mack' is also filmed in Magna. On March 18th, 2020, Magna was the site of the epicenter for the 5.7 magnitude 2020 Salt Lake City Earthquake. The quake was followed by more than 850 aftershocks. The temblor struck at approximately 7:10 am, and was felt strongly across the Wasatch Front. Damage was light, although several historic buildings with unreinforced brick walls suffered damage. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the metro township has a total area of , all of it land. The community lies just to the northeast of the Oquirrh Mountains and is directly south of the Great Salt Lake. Demographics According to estimates from the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute of the University of Utah, as of 2015, there were 27,451 people in Magna.

It also has Matheson Junior High, and Cyprus High School, whose sport teams compete in 5A-level competition (1A being the lowest and 5A the highest). The former Brockbank Junior High was closed in 2016 and combined with the Cyprus High campus. Transportation Magna lies on the grid system of the Salt Lake Valley, between 7200 and 9200 West and 2100 and 4100 South. SR-201 runs along the northern border as an expressway and intersects with I-80 to the west. West 3500 South (SR-171) is the major east-west local road, while South 8400 West (SR-111) is the major north-south road. The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates a local bus route and bus rapid transit (BRT) line within the community, both follow roughly the same route and enter from West Valley City. The BRT line is called 3500 South MAX and was the first and, as of April 2016, still the only BRT route operated by UTA. The bus system goes from UTA's Millcreek TRAX station on West 3300 South all the way to South 8400 South in Magna, between which it passes by the beginning of the TRAX Green Line (which connects with the Salt Lake City International Airport, via Downtown Salt Lake City the West Valley Central station by the Valley Fair Mall. Although the bus route of the 3500 South MAX stops at South 8400 South in Magna, the bus also loops around other places in Magna, including the majority of Magna Main Street. The 3500 South MAX runs every 15 minutes on the weekdays, as opposed to a majority of the UTA bus routes which run every half-hour to an hour. Mass media The Magna Times is a local weekly broadsheet community newspaper that is based and published in Magna. In 2009, it had a circulation of 4,000.  Culture  Magna is home to The Empress Theatre. Due to its historical significance, the theatre was added to the National Register for Historic Places on May 9, 1985 (National Register #85000962).

History Located in the central part of the Salt Lake Valley, and next to the Jordan River, Midvale was an early target for settlers in Utah. Permanent homes began as early as the 1850s, with one of the earliest homes still preserved today. The population grew quickly in the 1870s thanks to its central location, the use of railroad, and its connection to the mining in Bingham Canyon, the western area of present-day Midvale became an important industrial area for Utah. To support this growth, the eastern area of present-day Midvale provided agriculture and housing. Incorporation - People in the area, presumably, started calling the area Midvale, due to its central location in the valley. In 1909 Midvale officially became a city and in the 1910 census had a population of 1,760. Growth - Fort Union Area Fort Union, historically Union, was an early settlement area on the eastern edge of present-day Midvale. When Midvale annexed the Fort Union Area, it brought an established housing population. However, it did not just provide the city with a much larger population base, it also brought the city the shops of Fort Union. The shops provide both shopping and office space for Midvale. Bingham Junction Area Bingham Junction, originally known as the Sharon Steel site, is on the western border of Midvale and is roughly 446 acres in size. The area originally started seeing economic development as early as 1871 as a slag site for minning, which operated as such until 1958. Upon testing, it appeared to have large amounts of lead, arsenic and heavy metals, rendering the property unusable. Through mediation, help from the EPA and other parties, the area underwent a major cleanup and restoration project that saw its name removed from the NPL in 2006. Since Bingham Junction's removal from the NPL, the area underwent major changes. It brought about thousands of new households to the city. In connection with the added residential, major corporations moved to the area, where Overstock, CHG, and Savage now use as their headquarters. Also other major companies have brought their operation to the area, including Marriott, Zagg and IHC. Entertainment followed with the first ever Top Golf in Utah resides in the Bingham Junction area. As other important shopping centers such as Winco and other dining options. The EPA now considers this a success story and estimates as of 2018 there are 56 on site businesses with at least 2,646 employees. Bingham Junction is also home to a stop on the red line, that goes from the western edges of Salt Lake County to the University of Utah, Utah's flagship university. Jordan Bluffs Area Following in the success of the Bingham Junction Area, the area known as Jordan Bluffs is beginning the early phase of similar redevelopment. Jordan Bluffs is situated south of Bingham Junction and was originally part of the Sharon Steel slag site. It compromises 351 acres in the south west region of Midvale. Jordan Bluffs is in the beginning phases of redevelopment, but current proposals could see an additional 3,500 housing units and over 1,000,000 square feet of office space within the next ten years.  Transportation = Roadways  Midvale operates under a grid system as the rest of Salt Lake County. However, as most cities originally operated under their own grid system, Midvale City was one of the last to transition to the county. I-15 runs down the center of Midvale, with I215's interchange with I15 meeting in the 7200 and state region in Midvale.  Bus  The Utah Transit Authority (UTA) operates a bus system that reaches into the city including a sky service bus route. Bus routes serve nearby light rail stations, multiple commercial districts (including the Shops at Fort Union and the State Street commercial district), office parks, and government offices. The ski bus route operates along the 7200 south corridor. Rail UTA's TRAX light rail operates two separate rails in Midvale. The city is home to three light rail stations: The red line has Bingham Junction, the Blue line has Midvale Fort Union and Midvale Center station. Trax both serves the red line and blue line routes in Midvale. Economy Ally Bank (the banking subsidiary of Ally Financial), CHG Healthcare Services, Arctic Circle Restaurants, Veritas Funding, LLC, Sportmans' Warehouse, ZAGG, and Overstock.com are headquartered in Midvale. School Improvement Network, an education consulting company, moved its national headquarters to Midvale in 2011. Utopia Fiber, a publicly created fiber network is available in Midvale city, which allows for residents and businesses to have cheap and reliable gigabit and faster internet speeds.

Prior to its incorporation on December 28, 2016, Millcreek was a census-designated place (CDP) and township. History The first settlers of the Millcreek area in 1848 included Mary Fielding Smith (widow of Hyrum Smith) and her children, including Joseph F. Smith.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History of the Church. p. 503 The area remained essentially rural in character until after World War II. As postwar suburban growth spilled south over the Salt Lake City limits, the area was not annexed by the city and remained unincorporated. By the 1980s, most of the area now in Millcreek was built out and known by various names, including East Mill Creek, Canyon Rim and Mount Olympus. In the 2000 census, the area was divided among four CDPs, the westernmost of which was designated Millcreek CDP. The population of this CDP was 30,377 at the 2000 census, and had a total area of 4.9 square miles (12.8 km¬≤). Canyon Rim CDP, East Millcreek CDP, and Mount Olympus CDP were consolidated with Millcreek CDP in the 2010 census, doubling its population to 62,139.Utah Trend Report 2: State and Complete Places (Sub-state 2010 Census Data). Missouri Census Data Center. Accessed 2011-02-26. Salt Lake County created Millcreek Township in 2002 as an administrative subentity that included the populated CDPs as well as undeveloped Mill Creek Canyon in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest immediately to the east. The township was created to give residents of the area more local control over planning and prevent annexations by neighboring cities. As other communities south of Salt Lake City were incorporated in the 1990s and 2000s, Millcreek remained as the most populous unincorporated area of Salt Lake County. Residents considered a number of options for their future, including incorporation, which would make it the county's fifth- largest city. Amalgamation with neighboring South Salt Lake was also proposed, which would have combined South Salt Lake's commercial and industrial base with Millcreek‚Äôs heavily residential character, creating a city of over 80,000. The incorporation of Millcreek was the subject of a contentious 2012 ballot question, which set the boundaries of the proposed city identical to that of Millcreek Township, and asked voters what form of municipal government should be implemented. The initiative failed with only 40 percent of the vote, leaving Millcreek under the jurisdiction of the Salt Lake County Mayor and Council, as are other unincorporated areas of the county. Despite the failure of the initiative in 2012, the question was put on the ballot again three years later, and Millcreek residents voted for incorporation on November 3, 2015. In the 2016 election, residents voted for a mayor and city council members in advance of incorporation, which was recorded at 9:30 a.m. on December 28, 2016. Geography Suburban in character, Millcreek is wedged between Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake on the north and Murray and Holladay on the south. Millcreek residents typically identify with Salt Lake City, which is designated by the U.S. Postal Service as the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù place name for mailing addresses in the area. However, ‚ÄúMillcreek‚Äù is a recognized place name for addresses in the ZIP codes 84106, 84107, 84109, 84117, and 84124. The city is organized into four community councils, Canyon Rim, East Mill Creek, Millcreek, and Mount Olympus, roughly corresponding to the former CDPs. Climate This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Millcreek has a humid continental climate, abbreviated \\"Dfb\\" on climate maps. Demographics According to estimates from the Kem C.

Many students from Riverton do attend schools in Bluffdale, Herriman and South Jordan, as school boundaries do not coincide with city boundaries. Geography Riverton shares city borders with South Jordan to the north, Draper to the east, Bluffdale to the south, and Herriman to the west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 12.6 square miles (32.6 km2). The city is located in the southwestern corner of the Salt Lake Valley about twenty miles (32 km) south and slightly west of Salt Lake City. Riverton receives an average of in precipitation each year. Snow can be seen in the winter, while during the summer temperatures occasionally break . Riverton has grown rapidly in the last few years, transforming it from a rural farming town into a suburban city. Governance Riverton City is a city of the 3rd class as defined by Utah Code. Riverton City operates under a ‚Äúsix-member council\\" form of government, which means there are six elected officials that make up the governing body: a mayor and five council members. Riverton's council members each represent a distinct geographical district and the mayor represents the city at large. The city council has delegated the operational and day-to-day responsibilities of managing the city, its employees and services to a professional, full-time city manager. The city manager oversees all city departments and reports directly to the mayor and city council. History Located in the southern end of Salt Lake Valley, the first people of European descent to live in the area that is now Riverton settled in the mid-1850s. These early settlers scattered widely along the river bottom in crude dugout homes. Although the early accounts disagree, Archibald Gardner may have been the first to settle Riverton land. The town was originally referred to as ‚ÄúGardnerville‚Äù prior to changing its name to Riverton. Riverton's initial growth was slow because of the lack of water for irrigation. When more water became available, the town began to grow. Eventually three canals were built to extend water from the nearby Jordan River to the benchland areas, providing irrigation for agricultural uses to the larger area. By the beginning of World War I in 1914, with its additional irrigation water and influx of people, Riverton prospered as an agricultural community. Its thriving business district was also evident at this time.  Commercial Development History  The Page-Pixon store was built around the start of the 20th century, west of Redwood Road at 12760 South. The large department store sold everything from building materials, coal and dry goods to groceries, grain and housewares. This building was set back off the road and had a tie rail in front of it for tying up horses. The Jordan Valley Bank was started in 1905 as a community bank. This bank was first housed in the Page-Hansen Store then the Commercial Building. In 1920 it moved across the street, to the south. Other businesses coming to Riverton in the ten-year period before and after the First World War included Bill's Meat Market, Gilbert Lloyd's Blacksmith Shop, Riverton Motors, the Riverton, Utah Canning Factory, the Riverton Alfalfa Mill, Utah Poultry Company and numerous others ranging from theaters to mercantile stores. Farming was also a major Riverton business. Just before the turn of the century, the farmers in Riverton gradually began to change from self-sufficient farming to commercial farming. In its early years Riverton's farmers were mostly self-sufficient, producing almost everything they needed. This was no longer the case when farming became a business. Riverton farmers were becoming specialists concentrating mostly on alfalfa, wheat, sugar beets, tomatoes, poultry, sheep or dairy cows. At this time, on land purchased from Samuel Howard in 1886, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began to store tithed produce and livestock. It was not long until the hill that this enterprise was located on, at 1150 West 12400 South, became known as Tithing Yard Hill, which is now a residential planned development under the same name. Electricity first came to Riverton in 1912. In 1913 the Salt Lake and Utah Railroad (Orem Line) was started and went through Riverton west of Redwood Road. It was used as a commuter and freight line and stretched from Salt Lake to Payson in Utah County. Trains used this line from 1914 to 1945 after which the rails and ties were removed. Riverton had its own train depot which was also torn down when the line was closed.  Educational Development History  The community's first school had only one room. It was located in the old adobe meetinghouse used by the LDS branch on 1300 West. In 1892 a new two-story brick schoolhouse was built at 12830 South on Redwood Road, This structure had four rooms, two upstairs and two down and was built in January 1893. It was used by grades one through eight, two grades to a classroom. John Hansen was the first principal of this school. As the population grew additional classrooms were needed and another building for elementary grades was erected to the north of the four- room schoolhouse. In 1925 the south building was torn down and the north building remodeled. However, before the remodeling was completed, a fire struck-completely destroying the school on July 30, 1926. A junior high continued to be built on the south lot and the new elementary school which matched the junior high in brick color and design was erected on the site of the fire-destroyed building. Both these structures eventually became the Riverton Elementary School complex. The increased population of the 1970s and 1980s necessitated the construction of two new Riverton elementary schools. Southland Elementary was built on 2700 West and 12675 South and Rosamond Elementary at 1975 West and 12195 South. By 1948 Riverton had grown sufficiently to be incorporated into a city. However, the city's progress was temporarily halted by World War II, the final stage of the farming community's evolution occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. Land prices skyrocketed and Riverton's subdivisions expanded. Farmers sold land at prices many times the price they paid for it. Land was out of reach for your farmers, many of whom moved to Idaho and other neighboring states. This was mirrored throughout Salt Lake county as the number of farms decreased from 2,595 in 1950 to 798 in 1969. Nevertheless, Riverton's population more than tripled between 1970 when it totaled 2,820 inhabitants, and the mid-1980s when it reached around 10,000.  Community Development History  A photo of Riverton City Park. During this time a new City Hall was constructed at the edge of the Riverton City Park at 12800 South and 1400 West. In 1996 the city purchased the old Riverton Elementary School and its surrounding of land from the Jordan School District for $225,000. The city initially put a ballot measure out to fund the school through a general revenue bond, but the measure failed to gain support because it would have raised property taxes for residents of Riverton. Instead the city put together a multi-year plan to convert the old school house to the Riverton Community Center, and some of the land was sold to the County Library System for a new, state of the art library. By 2005‚Äì06, the city had successfully renovated the old elementary School into a new Community Center and City hall, which now houses all of the city's administrative offices. The often contentious city boundaries were in flux between the time of incorporation until the year 2000. At incorporation the boundaries were set from the Jordan River westward to what is now known as the coordinates of 3600 West, and from 11800 South to approximately 13800 South. In 1970, the town of Bluffdale was incorporated, taking in all of the land between 13800 South, southward to the Salt Lake/Utah County Line. 1982 saw the incorporation of the city of Draper, a town once situated at the south-east end of the Salt Lake Valley, their incorporated boundaries, uncontested by Riverton, took area all of the area eastward from the Jordan River to the I-15 freeway, an area that was once \\"loosely\\" considered or referred to as Riverton or \\"Riverton Siding.\\" In 1996 the city boundaries grew, virtually doubling the physical size of the city, through the annexation of land between Riverton and what was then known as the town of Herriman (now an incorporated city), extending its boundaries from 3600 West to roughly 4800 West, and to 5600 West from 13400 South to 14200 South and points southward beyond the city limits of Bluffdale. Included in the 1996 annexation was the ‚ÄúFoothills‚Äù development which had previously been annexed into Riverton during the 1980s, and then later de-annexed after the original developer filed for bankruptcy. The final solidification of Riverton's boundaries came when the city of Herriman incorporated in 2000, halting any possible further expansion westward by Riverton. Hospital The Intermountain Riverton Hospital, funded and operated by Intermountain Healthcare, opened in November 2009. The hospital serves the fastest growing portion of the Salt Lake Valley with surrounding cities of Riverton, Herriman, Bluffdale, and South Jordan. The hospital also provides services to cities in northern Utah County. Services include a complete in-and-out patient care center, a 24-hour emergency department, a state-of-art-women's center, a surgical center, radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, physical therapy, 40 physician offices, and a helicopter pad. Perhaps the most notable service the hospital features is the children's out-patient center run by Primary Children's Medical Center. The design of the hospital allows it to expand as the southwest part of the valley continues to see rapid growth. Transportation Riverton provides easy-access to Bangerter Highway, Mountain View Corridor, and Redwood Road; as all pass directly through the city. The city is also easily accessible from Interstate 15 via the 12300 S or Bangerter Highway exits. Demographics According to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, as July 1, 2019, there were 44,419 people in Riverton. The racial makeup of the county was 90.3% non-Hispanic White, 0.4% Black, 0.2% Native American, 1.0% Asian, 0.8% Pacific Islander, and 1.3% from two or more races. 6.5% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

The population was 23,617 at the 2010 census. History Balloons with the South Salt Lake City Logo and Motto Jesse Fox Jr. developed the area South Salt Lake referred to as Central Park around 1890. Mr. Fox chose the name after visiting New York and seeing Central Park there. He was impressed by the park and its design within an urban environment. Despite South Salt Lake being rural at the time, he decided to name the area Central Park. In 1925 the LDS Central Park Ward was created and named after the development. In 1936, an attempted annexation by Salt Lake City failed due to concerns over funding and implementation of a sewer system. On August 14, 1936 a resolution creating the Town of Central Park was approved by the Board of County Commissioners - however, this did last long, as voters then decided to disincorporate the town in 1937. In a close vote, voters then approved incorporation of South Salt Lake. On September 29, 1938, still in need of a sewer system, South Salt Lake voted to incorporate as the Town of South Salt Lake, with Robert R. Fitts as the first town president. The town was also lacking many other basic amenities at the time that would be easier to implement with incorporation, such as a post office and fire department. In 1939, the Works Progress Administration finally began construction of a sewer system, with a cost of $462,000. The original boundary of South Salt Lake was from 500 East to 300 West and 2100 South to Mill Creek on the south. On August 1, 1950 the population had increased enough for South Salt Lake to be designated as a third class city. This changed the form of government to a mayor and city council. The town president of the time, Marlow Callahan, became the first mayor of the City of South Salt Lake.http://www.southsaltlakecity.com/department-listings/history In the 1990s, South Salt Lake annexed portions of an unincorporated portion of Salt Lake County to the south, and nearly doubled in land area and population. On January 4, 2010, Cherie Wood became South Salt Lake's first female mayor. During her administration, South Salt Lake has seen extensive redevelopment efforts. In 2012, a Chinatown development opened on a lot in the city near 3500 South and State Street. It is the only Chinatown in the Intermountain West. In addition to having many Asian-themed restaurants, it has a large Asian-themed supermarket. In 2017, after nearly 7 years of planning, ground was broken on a new mixed-use development known as The Crossing (formerly called Market Station) between State St. and Main St. just south of 2100 South, intended to serve as South Salt Lake's \\"downtown\\". This development is oriented around mass transit, with an S-Line streetcar stop adjacent to the development, and 1 stop away from the Central Pointe TRAX Station. The first phase includes a WinCo Foods and a townhome development. Ultimately, this downtown development is planned to have 2,500 family housing units, 1.5 million square feet of retail, 3 million square feet of office and commercial space, and additional greenspace and trails. Geography Bridge at Fitts Park in the City of South Salt Lake, UT According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Chinatown According to the Deseret News, ground breaking on the new Chinatown occurred in 2011Wendy Leonard, \\"South Salt Lake breaks ground for Utah's first Chinatown\\", Deseret News, March 21, 2011 for a Chinese-themed shopping mall with a \\"... 27,000 square foot Asian grocery store, 65,000 square foot indoor mall including 38 Asian-themed shops and 12,000 square feet Asian-themed strip mall\\". The strip mall is now open. Margaret Yee, a 1962 graduate said that \\"... 10,000-plus Chinese nationals living in the area have wanted [a Chinatown] for a long time....\\"Wendy Leonard and Nkoyo Iyamba, \\"South Salt Lake breaks ground for Utah's Chinatown\\", ksl.com, March 21, 2011 By late 2012, the Chinatown has experienced an upsurge of Chinese immigrants and the businesses are now filling up the Chinatown.Heather L. King, \\"Diverse Asian options surround South Salt Lake's Chinatown\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, November 6, 2012 Crime Public Safety Officers hoisting the flag on the 4th of July, South Salt Lake City, UT Since 2007, crime in South Salt Lake has been reduced by 30%. Former SSL Police Chief Chris Snyder attributes the drop in crime to 4 factors: 1) Increased attention to code enforcement, 2) Crime Free Rental Housing program that results in greater landlord scrutiny of potential renters, 3) Partnerships, such as that with United Way of Salt Lake, combined with community organizing, such as the Promise South Salt Lake initiative, South Salt Lake Community Connection that address resident needs and improve neighborhoods, and 4) Extensive youth development efforts, such as Promise afterschool programs delivered in nine Neighborhood Centers across the city, and urban/neighborhood revitalization projects. There is a new emphasis on redevelopment (including the Market Station development) and a reduction in the number of liquor licenses allowed to be issued is anticipated to reduce crime in the city. The Motovo Real Estate Blog ranked South Salt Lake as the \\"Most Dangerous Place in Utah\\" citing data from the 2012 FBI Uniform Crime Report. Their report found that South Salt Lake had the most violent crimes per capita in Utah, with the second highest non-violent crime rate as well. Transportation I‚Äë15, I‚Äë80, and SR‚Äë201 intersect in the northwestern portion of the city. This interchange is known locally as the \\"Spaghetti Bowl\\" due to its complex array of on and off ramps, which extend to several other city roads in the area. US‚Äë89 runs north-to-south along State Street through the heart of South Salt Lake, serving as the primary commercial corridor and includes an interchange at I‚Äë80. SR‚Äë171 (3300 South) traverses the city east-to-west, with an interchange at I‚Äë15. SR‚Äë71 (South 700 East) runs along the southern part of the east border of the city and also has an interchange at I‚Äë80. S Line streetcar at the South Salt Lake City station, December 2013 Utah Transit Authority's (UTA) TRAX light rail runs through the city at about 200 West, with 3 stations located within the city limits. All three of the TRAX lines (Blue, Red, and Green) enter the city from the north at Central Pointe station. (The UTA Police Department was located at the Central Pointe station until it moved to its new location at the Murray Central station in July 2016.) From Central Pointe station the Green Line heads west to West Valley City while both the Blue and Red lines continue south to stop at the Millcreek station before leaving the city just south of the Meadowbrook station. UTA also has several local bus routes that run through the city, many of which stop every fifteen minutes. In December 2013, the S Line streetcar (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) opened for service. The S Line was built along an existing rail line just south of 2100 South (the northern border of the city) from the Central Pointe station to the Sugar House neighborhood in southeastern Salt Lake City. In addition to Central Pointe station, the S Line will include stops at South Main Street (South Salt Lake City station), South 300 East (300 East station), and South 500 East (500 East station) before leaving the city. Although operated by UTA, the S Line is a joint project between South Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, and UTA. Sites One of South Salt Lake's most notable and historic buildings is the Columbus Center. Originally a school around the turn of the 20th century, it was later used as a daycare center beginning in the 1950s. After being condemned in the late 1980s, it was renovated and expanded to include a branch of the Salt Lake County Library System as well as an auditorium, senior center and several other facilities.The Columbus Center in South Salt Lake City, UT Education South Salt Lake lies within the Granite School District. The city is served by three public elementary schools (Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Roosevelt) (pre K-6th grade), and one junior high school (Granite Park Junior High). With Mayor Wood's emphasis on education, two charter schools have located in South Salt Lake, Alianza (K-8) and the Utah International Charter School (7-12). The Salt Lake City campus of Broadview University is located next to the South Salt Lake city offices, and the city also has strong ties and partnerships with local institutions of higher education, Salt Lake Community College and Westminster College. Utah State University has a satellite campus located within the Granite District Offices at 2500 South State Street, also in South Salt Lake.

It is part of the Salt Lake City, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 58,657 at the 2010 census. Taylorsville was incorporated from the Taylorsville-Bennion CDP and portions of the Kearns metro township on July 1, 1996. The city is located adjacent to Interstate 215 and Bangerter Highway. It is centrally located in the middle of the Salt Lake Valley. History The area called Taylorsville today is made up of two historic communities in the central part of Salt Lake County: Taylorsville and Bennion. These communities incorporated through a vote of the people with over 70 percent approval in September 1995. The city officially became the City of Taylorsville during the centennial anniversary of Utah's statehood in 1996. The land on which Taylorsville is located is part of an interconnected alluvial plain that was formed by the wearing down of the Wasatch and Oquirrh Mountains to the east and west. Beneath the surface, Taylorsville sits on more than a kilometer of unconsolidated rock, sand, and clay. The inactive Taylorsville Fault has been traced down the center of the Salt Lake Valley. Lake Bonneville shaped the topography of the area and deposited lake bottom clay and sand. As Lake Bonneville dried up over the past 14,000 years, the salt from the breakdown of rock remains, making the soil alkaline. Like most desert soils, it has little organic material and is hard to work. A broad, east-west running ridge called \\"Bennion Hill\\" rises perhaps a hundred and fifty feet above the surrounding area. Bennion Hill is the eastern end of a wide ridge that rises toward Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains to the west. The first (unnamed) people in the region appeared during or after the last ice age on the shores of what remained of Lake Bonneville. Less than five miles (8 km) from Taylorsville evidence of people killing and eating a mammoth have been found. Some of this region's first named visitors were Fremont people who used the area to hunt and gather food along the Jordan River more than a thousand years ago. A large Fremont settlement on City Creek used the land where Taylorsville is located as hunting and foraging especially along the river. In more recent times Ute bands passed through the valley between the marshes of the Great Salt Lake and Utah Valley. Most of the area was dry sagebrush-covered land without any natural water sources except the Jordan River. A well-used Ute trail wound along the west side of the river at approximately 1300 West which the Ute used in spring and fall. Early settlers observed small encampments of Ute in the cottonwoods along the Jordan River. At least one local settler called these people the \\"Yo-No'\\". Whether the name is his creation or an approximation of something they said is unknown. There are poorly documented suggestions that Spanish missionaries, soldiers, and explorers came through the area beginning in the mid-1600s. The whole region was called \\"Teguayo\\" and \\"Lake Copalla\\" (Utah Lake) appear on maps of Spanish Nuevo Mexico.Miera, Bernardo. Dominguez Escalante Map Spanish and then Mexican land claims remained until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which ended the Mexican War in 1853 and ceded the whole of northern Mexico to the United States including a few thousand Mormon settlers who had taken up residence in July 1847.  Mormon settlement  The first Mormon pioneer settlers, Joseph and Susanna Harker from England built a log cabin on the west side of the Jordan River in November 1848 on what was called then ‚Äúthe Church Farm‚Äù near 3300 South. In 1849 Samuel and John Bennion and several other families moved south crossing the river on the ice in January. There was little in the way of building materials, so the families dug into the bluffs of the Jordan River for shelter. The tiny settlement, the first \\"over Jordan,\\" was called Harker's Settlement, and they began the difficult work of digging ditches to move water out of the Jordan River and onto the land on the west side. The soil was hard to work and they kept looking for better land to farm. The infamous crickets destroyed much of that year's crop and so the group moved farther south to where Big Cottonwood Creek flowed into the Jordan River about 4800 South known then as Field's Bottom. By working together, eight families managed to bring in the first successful crop in 1851 using water brought down from Bingham Creek by what was later called Gardner's Millrace. John and Esther Bennion's daughter, Rachael, was the first pioneer child to be born in Field's Bottom. Despite the struggle to get food and shelter in those early days, John Bennion described Field's Bottom in these words: > if peace dwells upon this earth it is here and here are the happiest and > most prosperous people in the world, enjoying free soil, pure air, liberty > to worship our God just as we please‚Ä¶ By 1851 more families settled in or near Field's Bottom where they dug the \\"lower ditch\\" and cleared land for small farms and pastures. In January 1852 Harker's Settlement was organized as a part of the West Jordan LDS Ward that included the Salt Lake Valley west of the Jordan River. Some families returned to cabins they had built earlier and dismantled them and brought the logs across the river and reassembled the cabins. In 1853 the continued threat of attack by angry Utes, locally called the \\"Walker War\\" or the \\"Utah Valley War\\", forced the settlers to build an adobe fort called the English Fort just north of the North Jordan Burying Ground in 1854. Stories about \\"Indian depredations\\" in Utah and Sanpete Counties and the massacre of John W. Gunnison and his surveying party caused such fear that Salt Lake City fortified itself. Two livestock herders were killed in Cedar Valley, just over \\"South Mountain\\" and the Ute attacked cattle herds in Tooele County just over the Oquirrh Mountains. Isolated settlements either built forts or were abandoned. Locals nicknamed the fort in North Jordan, \\"Fort Hardscrabble,\\" because it was built on what they considered a useless piece of ground. About 30 families moved into or near the fort for protection for the winter, but as the threat of attack faded, families spread out once again and part of the fort was converted into an LDS meeting house which also served as the school. Hickman Fort, farther south in Bennion, was built by William Hickman. It was located about 5800 South on the bluff above the west side of the river. Between 1853 and 1857 Gardner's Millrace was extended north to the Bennion area and called the North Jordan Canal, the first important canal on the west side of the Jordan River.Taylorsville a Short History. author unknown Up until 1859 the West Jordan Ward was headquartered in what is today Taylorsville.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History. p. 863 By 1860 Harker's Settlement, as the area was called, had 178 residents. The first post office was established with the name Taylorsville which was the name of the LDS branch in that part of the North Jordan, perhaps to distinguish it from Granger. The post office was discontinued later. Elizabeth Harker's home was used for the first school classes. In 1858 the threat of Johnston's Army marching down Emigration Canyon forced many settlers to pack up everything they could and move south until the situation could be resolved. Most residents ended up in Spanish Fork or camped out at Pondtown (Salem) near Utah Lake. The home guard who remained behind to watch over the settlement observed the ‚ÄúJohnston‚Äôs Army‚Äù camp the first night after passing through Salt Lake on the \\"flats' above the North Jordan farms. Its large livestock herd ate everything to within an inch of the ground. The US Army continued on its way the next morning. In July 1858 Taylorsville residents returned and settled back into the interrupted routine of summertime chores. By 1859 the adobe fort was dissolving into the mud from which it was created. It was decided to build a log school on top of the ‚Äúhill‚Äù on 4800 South which was closer to where most people in Taylorsville lived.Schools of the Granite School District. Granite School District In 1859 the West Jordan Ward included all of Salt Lake County west of the Jordan River and even had a section east of the river. The North Jordan dependent branch of the West Jordan stake was organized in 1859. Its first president was John Bennion. He was succeeded in 1863 by Samuel Bennion. He was later succeeded by Heber Bennion so that until 1907 the presiding LDS authority in Taylorsville was a Bennion., Jenson. Encyclopedic History. 863 The area west of Jordan was divided into the West Jordan, South Jordan, North Jordan, and Herriman LDS Wards. North Jordan, also known as Taylorsville, had a dependent branch at Bennion. The first business in Taylorsville was a small store located near the school and a blacksmith's shop across the street. John Webster, the blacksmith, was appointed postmaster and once a week carried mail from Murray in a clothes basket. In 1867 the log school was replaced by a three-room school made of rock and brick called \\"the Rock Schoolhouse\\" that was used until 1898. By 1876 the South Jordan Canal and the North Jordan Canal were joined to carry water from the Jordan River above the bluffs west of the Jordan and brought land from South Jordan to Granger under cultivation. This brought more families to the area, almost all of them farmers. Land west of the canals was cleared for dry farms that were planted in the fall and harvested in early summer. A few families moved just north of Taylorsville near 6200 South and Redwood Road. John Bennion, one of the early settlers, gave this area its name, Bennion. A tiny blue schoolhouse was built on the corner of Redwood Road and 6200 South for the children to attend. In the 1880s LDS Church president, John Taylor, hid from US marshals at a home on the west side of the Jordan River near 4800 South. John Taylor's association with Taylorsville has often been used to explain its name. The name, Taylorsville, used before the 1880s seems to call the John Taylor explanation for the town's name into question. However, since Taylor was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve before the Mormons even arrived in Utah, and was the wounded survivor of the mob attack that killed Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and served at various times as speaker of the Utah Territorial Legislature, naming the town after Taylor at any point from 1847 on is quite believable. In 1881 the Utah and Salt Lake Canal was built which allowed irrigation farming to expand even farther west above the river between Bluffdale and Granger. Un-irrigated land to the west was cleared and planted as dry farms. The 1880s saw a sawmill, gristmill, and woolen mill built in West Jordan. Rawlings shoe repair store was constructed. The Bennion brothers built a grist mill at 4800 South and the Jordan River. In 1894 a three-room schoolhouse was built out of red brick, called the 64 District School. It sat on two acres on the corner of 6200 South and Redwood Road. The name of the school was later changed to Madison School. Enough musicians lived in the area to establish a brass band. People in Taylorsville and Bennion depended on growing corn, wheat, oats, and alfalfa. In the 1890s sugar beets became big business and many farmers started to clear additional land to grow them. The beets were hauled to the West Jordan cutting station until 1916 when the West Jordan Sugar Factory was completed. Taylorsville and Bennion remained very small farming towns. The 1890s saw increased growth and the establishment of a small business district at the intersection of Redwood Road and 4800 South. The largest store was Lindsay and Company which was later called the Taylorsville Mercantile Company. In 1894 the Taylorsville LDS Meetinghouse was built to house the Taylorsville Ward of the LDS church. In 1905 Bennion was made a separate ward from Taylorsville. Before this point, it was often referred to as South Taylorsville.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History of the Church. (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941) p. 58  Twentieth Century  The territorial legislature passed Utah's first Compulsory Education Law in 1890 which gradually brought most children off the farms and into the classroom. It had little effect until the early 1900s when small local school districts, seen as a roadblock to raising the standard of Utah education, were consolidated. In December 1904 the Salt Lake County Commission voted to combine 22 of the 36 local school districts into the Granite School District with boundaries that matched the LDS Granite Stake boundaries. Schools which up to that time were often numbered were given names. In 1905 600 people lived in Bennion, enough to split from the Taylorsville LDS Ward and create the Bennion Ward to the south. Meetings were held in the red brick schoolhouse for a time until the Bennion meetinghouse was built in 1907 at the corner of 6200 South and Redwood Road next to the school. The need for a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô school and the establishment of compulsory tax-supported public schools throughout Utah gave rise to the old Plymouth Elementary School on Redwood Road and 4800 South. By 1907 there were so many children in the Bennion school that the upper grades were sent to the two-story red brick Plymouth School in Taylorsville. In 1909 an amusement hall and classrooms were added to the Taylorsville Chapel. Electricity came to the Taylorsville area during the early 1900s but had little effect on the life of most people who saw little use for it outside lighting their homes. It was considered a luxury and many families chose not to connect to the ‚Äúnew- fangled‚Äù wires until the 1920s or 1930s when rural electrification made power available to everyone. Two railroads were important to Taylorsville, the Rio Grande, and Western to Bingham Junction (Midvale), and the Bingham-Garfield Railroad was added through the area in 1910. A well was dug at 4700 South and 5400 West where a locomotive watering station was built. In 1913 the electric Salt Lake Inter-Urban, often call the ‚ÄúOrem Line,‚Äù was built to make it possible to ride into Salt Lake or as far as Payson on the ‚ÄúRed Arrow‚Äù in from the Francklyn Station in Murray or at the Bennion Station. The line ran parallel to Redwood Road about 1800 West. In 1915 the first water system was built by private subscription. People who wanted clean water piped to their homes paid to have it delivered to them. Later this system was bought and expanded by the Taylorsville-Bennion Improvement District. Electricity came to the area in 1916 along Redwood Road. During World War I four young men from Taylorsville lost their lives and sixteen served in the armed forces. By the 1920s two canals were built to carry water to farms farther and farther west. Redwood Road was finally rebuilt using concrete making it faster and easier to travel for the mixture of automobiles, wagons, and horses that used it. How Redwood Road got its name has been the subject of much debate but, when there are no redwoods in the valley, the following explanation rings truest. A line parallel to the base meridian was surveyed on the west side of the Jordan River for use in measuring property lines. Redwood stakes that did not decay in the ground were used for the \\"Redwood Line\\". It remained the Redwood Line until 1895 when Redwood Road was built as the main thoroughfare for the west side of Salt Lake County. In 1927 the \\"Pole Line Road\\" 2700 West was constructed.  World War II  In World War II, 75 men from Taylorsville served and two lost their lives overseas. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US Army Air Corps wanted an isolated place to build a training base safe from any attacks by the Japanese and on the main rail routes to the Pacific Coast. The War Department bought of dry farmland in the western part of Salt Lake Valley. The land originally was part of a federal land grant to the state of Utah to be used to benefit schools and universities in Utah. But it had long since passed into private hands and was used for dry farms. Camp Kearns went through renamings as the focus and mission of the base changed; Camp Kearns was the name which stuck. It opened in 1942 but took about a year to gain its final size. The base was named for Senator Thomas Kearns of Utah who had made his fortune in the silver mines at Park City. Camp Kearns was not in Taylorsville. Just a year later, Camp Kearns had 40,000 residents and was Utah's third-largest city at the time. It had two main missions. It served as a basic training facility for replacement troops headed for the war against Japan. Camp Kearns included a 600-target practice range, the largest in the US, a difficult, mile-long obstacle course, a grenade practice ground, and barracks for thousands of men on their way to the Pacific coast. The motor pool hired more than 80 local women just to drive trucks; in all about 1200 civilians worked at the base at any given time. Camp Kearns had the largest hospital in Utah at the time which spread into ten buildings. A camp newspaper called the Valley View News provided information and entertainment to the troops stationed there. The base had a water system and one of two water treatment plants in the state. The streets were laid out in a huge grid pattern lined with over 900 wooden buildings covered with tar paper. A railroad spur from the Denver and the Rio Grande was built to transport equipment and personnel to the base. By August 21, 1942, the Kearns had of warehouse space, two all-purpose theaters, gyms, two firehouses, several dusty parade grounds, a post office, a lending library, and a bank. Thousands of trees and shrubs were planted to keep the dust down. The second mission of Camp Kearns was a practice air force base for Army Air Corps ground crews. In time, technical training of air force ground crews became Camp Kearns's main objective. This included many kinds of schools: navigation, intelligence, radio, teleprinter, clerical, and many others. It was not an air force base with airplanes landing and taking off, ground crews were trained on planes scattered around the base. The base had five chapels, three stores, and three theaters, one of them for African-American servicemen. It still exists as part of Kearns Junior High School. The USO brought many entertainers to the base to keep the troops from getting homesick. The Band Wagon Committee raised more than $15,000,000 in war bonds from the communities around Salt Lake and the men and women in uniform. Camp Kearns gave an indirect boost to Taylorsville in that a huge water pipe brought water from the east side of Salt Lake to the camp. Once Camp Kearns closed, the presence of clean drinking water and a sewer treatment plant made it possible for people to move to Kearns and live in some of the first large subdivisions built in western Salt Lake County in the 1950s. But the camp is not in the Taylorsville city limits but the Kearns metro township. Taylorsville and Bennion joined to form their own water and sewer district to provide clean water. The large water tank on the hill at 3200 west and 6200 South and the other ones buried inside the hill are a part of the work to provide the clean water. Salt Lake County's rapidly growing population began expanding west in the early 1970s and farmers found they could sell their land to developers for a lot more than they were making on the farms.Subdivisions began springing up.  Incorporation  In the 1980s the intersection at Redwood Road 5400 South began to be developed into a regional retail center with Harmons, Grand Central, Wal-mart, and the Family Center. Taylorsville, Bennion, and Kearns continued rapid growth into the early 1990s. Some people felt that the Salt Lake County Commission, which governed the area, was allowing too much growth too fast, especially apartment complexes. The county seemed unwilling to listen to residents which resulted in the first drive to incorporate Taylorsville City. It failed by a narrow margin. In 1995 voters approved the creation of a new city due to the rising costs of county services, a feeling that the county was not giving residents their money's worth revolving around insufficient law enforcement, a lack of input in how Taylorsville and Bennion were developing, and the seemingly unlimited apartment developments. Many of Kearns residents were upset when Taylorsville's proposed boundary extended its western border to 4000 West which was considered by residents in that area to be part of Kearns. But residents there approved Taylorsville's incorporation by a significant margin, (as they were given large tax breaks) and that is where the border remains. After incorporation, there was a lively discussion about what the new city should be called. Midvalley City, Oquirrh City, Centennial, and Taylorsville- Bennion were all discussed. Eventually, Taylorsville was chosen. Taylorsville's nickname is ‚ÄúUtah‚Äôs Centennial City‚Äù because it officially came into existence one hundred years after Utah became a state. Governance Taylorsville is governed by a five-member city council, mayor, and presiding judge representing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. City council members and the mayor are elected to staggered four- year terms of office. The election of city council members and the mayor are non-partisan, contested elections. The presiding judge and other judges serve six-year terms of office. Every six years, the judges must stand for retention in an unopposed, non-partisan election. The retention election of the judges is county-wide and are the only municipal elected positions to permit voters from outside of the city boundaries to vote for or against a city official. The city has been divided into five districts each with its own city council member. There are no \\"at-large\\" seats. The mayor is the only elected position that runs citywide. The city council elects from its members a chairperson and vice-chairperson who are responsible for the organization and operation of the city council. In addition to its mayor, the executive branch is managed by a full-time city administrator. The city administrator is appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council. While the city contracts for many of its services (public works, garbage collection, street and road maintenance, and police), it has its own code enforcement, economic development, and community development departments. Unified Fire Authority is managed and funded separately from the city of which the City has a seat on the UFA board. The judicial branch is vested in a municipal justice court which is administered by a presiding judge. The presiding judge is elected from amongst the judges of the court and confirmed by the city council. The presiding judge, with the input of all of the judges of the court, oversees the hiring and training of all court personnel and manages the court budget. The Taylorsville Court is notable by establishing the second DUI (drunk driving) court in the nation and the first misdemeanor Drug/DUI hybrid court in Utah. In addition, the Court has a dedicated Domestic Violence calendar and a Dual Focus program for Drug/Alcohol abusers with a history of violence.

Bicknell, offered a thousand-volume library to any town that would adopt his name. Grayson competed with Thurber, Utah (renamed Bicknell) for the prize. Grayson was renamed Blanding after the maiden name of Bicknell's wife, and each of the towns received 500 books. On the morning of June 10, 2009, sixteen Blanding residents were arrested in more than a dozen raids performed by federal agents and indicted as part of an undercover investigation of violations of the Archeological Resources Protection Act.

Monticello rests at the base of the Abajo Mountains on the Colorado Plateau. History The Old Spanish Trail trade route passed through the area of Monticello from 1829 into the 1850s. Monticello was one of the many cities established by Mormon pioneers in the Utah Territory, which became the State of Utah. Farming, ranching, and uranium mining have all played an important role in the economy and history of the town. Settlement Early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints began the first full-scale settling of what is now known as San Juan County, Utah. Few white residents had settled along the San Juan River before the arrival of the Mormon pioneers from the San Juan Expedition. After passing through Hole-In-The-Rock, the pioneers arrived in the San Juan County area and settled in Bluff on 6 April 1880. In that year, on a journey to northern Utah from the San Juan River settlements, Apostles Erastus Snow and Brigham Young, Jr. passed through the current site of Monticello. They were quite impressed by it, and this encounter was one of the key factors behind LDS settlement there a few years later.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (Salt Lake City: Deseret news Press, 1941) p. 528 After struggling to farm along the unpredictable San Juan River, leaders began to look to settle the higher country at the base of the Abajo Mountains, also known as the Blue Mountains, where several streams and springs descended from the mountain. Piute Springs, Soldier's Spring, and Montezuma Creek were a few of the water sources in the area named by passersby. In March 1886, Francis A. Hammond, the LDS Stake President (the leading LDS regional authority) of San Juan County, sent scouts from Bluff to identify possible locations for settlements near the water sources of the Blue Mountains. The scouts found that a few people had already begun to utilize the land. The first white man to build a cabin in the Monticello area was likely cattleman Patrick O'Donnell in 1879. The North and South Forks of Montezuma Canyon, through which Montezuma Creek flows, were being utilized when the scouts arrived. The Kansas and New Mexico Cattle and Land Company, operated by Edmund and Harold Carlisle, was located a few miles north of what is now Monticello, and the L.C. outfit was headquartered in the South Fork of Montezuma Canyon. Notwithstanding the fact that others were utilizing the land, Hammond sent the families of George A. Adams, Frederick I. Jones, Parley R. Butt and Charles E. Walton from Bluff to establish a new settlement at what is now Monticello.Historical marker placed at Verdure, UT, by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, 8/16/1995. Accessed 28 Oct. 2009. They first set up camp at Verdure near the South Fork of Montezuma Creek on March 11, 1887, six miles (10 km) south of what is now Monticello. By the first part of July 1887, the men had begun to plant crops, survey an irrigation ditch, and layout a townsite in the present-day Monticello area. Conflicts soon began with the Carlisle cowboys and Ute Indians over water and land rights, resulting in warning shots, heated disputes, and legal battles. Learning from lawyers that the Carlisles had very little legal claim to any of the region, the Mormons claimed all the water from the South Fork and three-fourths of the water from the North Fork. In the spring of 1888, the Adams and Butt families remained in Verdure while the rest of the settlers moved to North Montezuma and began construction of the town. Early names for the settlement were North Montezuma Creek, Piute Springs, and Hammond, after the stake president. In a formal meeting in 1888, three names were under consideration: North Montezuma, Hammond, and the biblical name, Antioch. None of the names were approved by the younger members of the community. When Hammond recommended Monticello, in honor of Thomas Jefferson's estate, everyone approved and it was accepted. 1900 to 1940 In 1903 the Utah State Agricultural College in Logan established an experimental station in Verdure where various dry-farming techniques were tested for thirteen years. This information spurred the growth of the farming industry in the area. In 1909, the Enlarged Homestead Act was passed, which provided of non-irrigable land for a small price. New farms began to cover the sagebrush lands north and east of Monticello. Dry farming was a major occupation in the area up through the 1930s and is a vital part of the local economy today. The first phone lines were installed in the community in 1906, tying into Colorado circuits. The Blue Mountain Irrigation Company organized construction of a combined water and power system in 1917. The San Juan Record, the county newspaper, was established in Monticello by Oscar Walter McConkie in 1915, where it remains to this day. Uranium mining Monticello, Utah, where a uranium mill was operated by Vanadium Corp., was among the U.S. sites important to the Manhattan Project. The Vanadium Corporation of America (VCA) began construction of a vanadium mill in Monticello in 1941 in response to the increased demand for radioactive material brought about by World War II.\\"Public Health Assessment: Monticello Mill Tailings (DOE) and Monticello Radioactively Contaminated Properties,\\" Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (ATSDR), Department of Health and Human Services. Accessed 28 Oct. 2009. In 1943, VCA began producing a uranium-vanadium sludge for the Manhattan Engineer District. It employed 200 workers until it closed in 1946. In 1948, the U.S. Federal Government purchased the mill and reopened it in 1949 as a converted uranium and vanadium processing plant. Monticello and the San Juan County area experienced significant growth during the uranium boom of the 1950s. The uranium mines in San Juan County were among the richest in the nation. The Happy Jack Mine, located in White Canyon, San Juan County, was founded by Monticello natives Fletch Bronson and Joe Cooper. The Happy Jack Mine was the second richest deposit of high-grade uranium ore in the nation, the first being the MiVida Mine, also in San Juan County.\\"The Bronsons, Joe Cooper and the Fabled Happy Jack,\\" The San Juan Record, Oct 14, 2009. Accessed 28 Oct. 2009. During these years the mill at Monticello processed large amounts of ore taken from the canyons of southeastern Utah. The population of Monticello more than doubled during this time as a result of the activity at the processing plant and the mining activity in the region. County assessed valuation jumped from $1 million in the 1940s to $132 million in 1959. Oil and mining accounted for 94 percent of the property tax in San Juan County during those years, and the San Juan School District became the state's highest paying district. Demand for uranium subsided in the early 1960s. On January 1, 1960, the mill was closed permanently by the Atomic Energy Commission. The mill tailings were stabilized by 1962, and the mill was dismantled in 1964. A massive cleanup project was conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy from 1989 to 2004 to remove radioactive material from lands and buildings and to restore the land formerly occupied by the mill. All radioactive material was removed and placed in a controlled repository near Monticello. Funding was provided to restore the former mill site and roughly of surrounding land to a usable condition. In a deal with the Federal Government, the City of Monticello reseeded and restored the reclaimed land; upon completion, the city received roughly $7 million from the government. With the remaining cleanup funds, the city decided to expand the existing 9-hole golf course into an 18-hole course. The course site is adjacent to the mill site. Longtime resident Rex Jensen donated land to the city to be used for expanding the course towards the mountain. The course was designed by Forrest Richardson & Assoc. Golf Course Architects and construction was completed in 2001. Many Monticello residents claim that the exposure to the radioactive mill tailings caused cancer in residents and mill workers.\\"Monticello, San Juan County, Utah,\\" Decommissioning Projects, UMTRA Title 1.

History Welcome to Centerfield sign, November 2015 Centerfield was first known as Skin Town. It seems that about 1880, a new method for tanning cowhides was discovered and implemented in New York. At the same time, Sanpete suffered a terrible winter with such deep snow that many cattle couldn't find enough forage and died. In order to keep their operations from being a total loss, the ranchers skinned the cows, used the new tanning method on the hides, and hung them out on their fences to dry. The fact that all the fences were draped with cow hides led to the name ‚ÄúSkin Town‚Äù. It was also called South Gunnison or Twin Town. When the town was incorporated in 1907, the residents chose the more dignified name of Centerfield because of the community's central location. Centerfield is an 1860s offshoot of Gunnison that evolved two miles south on US 89. Gunnison Field or Gunnison South was a natural site for farmers who worked small ‚Äúsquatters rights‚Äù plots of about five acres with oxen and hand plows. After the Indian troubles subsided, log and adobe houses began to appear. A late 1876 petition to ‚Äòbuild a school convenient to our location‚Äô was an early sign of independence from the mother colony. In 1882 a log cabin was built to serve as school, church and social hall. The 1886-87 church was built of stone and a front tower was added in 1897. Community spirit was strong by that time, and Canute Peterson chose a committee of four who named the place for its location in the fields between Gunnison and Axtell. Gunnison Valley Sugar Company The Gunnison Valley Sugar Company built a 500-ton factory in Centerfield, Utah in 1918. The Centerfield factory equipment came from the Washington State Sugar Company plant in Waverly, Washington. The Waverly factory, opened in December 1899, was considered unprofitable and inferior. The Utah Sugar management, including Cutler, advised Washington Sugar in 1901 for the 1902 season, but the factory closed in 1910. It was sold to Gunnison Sugar for $100,000, installed in Centerfield in 1917, and was ready for the 1918 campaign. U-I went on an aggressive anticompetitive campaign (including spreading rumors, leading to U-I's investigation by the FTC) against Gunnison Valley Sugar Company. In 1920, the William Wrigley Jr. Company purchased the factory to supply their chewing gum production. U-I acquired the Centerfield factory and company in 1940. They proceeded to close the factory in 1956, re-opened from 1958 to 1961, then sold it as scrap in April, 1966.

The population was 1,247 at the 2010 census. History Located at the confluence of the San Pitch River and Cottonwood Creek, Fairview is the largest town in the northeast end of the Sanpete Valley. Founded in 1859, soon after the resettlement of nearby Mount Pleasant, Fairview was one of the first new towns established during the second wave of Mormon settlement in Sanpete County. Pioneer-era house in Fairview, December 2004 Impressed with the possibilities of the area while gathering wild hay there in early 1859, James Naylor Jones, Isaac Young Vance, Warren P. Brady and Jehu Cox wrote to Brigham Young asking for permission to create a settlement. The pragmatic church president responded, \\"If there is water for thirty families, you have my permission.\\" At an organizing meeting held on October 1, 1859 in Mt. Pleasant, James N. Jones was chosen to lead a band of about twenty families interested in the new colonizing opportunity. The town site was surveyed and by the end of 1860 a large log meeting house had been completed to house church, school, and social functions. Rows of poplars were planted, streets were graded, and fences were constructed as Fairview took on the appearance of the ubiquitous \\"Mormon Village.\\" In 1864 the town obtained a post office and forsook its original name of North Bend in favor of the more descriptive name Fairview, because it \\"commands an excellent view of the great granary extending south even beyond Manti, thirty miles distant.\\" During the Black Hawk War of the mid-1860s, some Fairview residents moved to Mt. Pleasant for protection after a few men were killed in deadly skirmishes. Those who remained complied with Brigham Young's instructions to build a fort. By the end of 1866 a thick rock wall ten feet high enclosed the center of town. Within a few years, the conflict was essentially over and aggressive settlement and community development commenced. In the course of the ensuing decade, Fairview's population burgeoned to more than 1,000, making it the fourth largest in Sanpete by 1880. In 1900 and again in 1940 the town exceeded 1,700 people; however in 1980 the population was just 900, ranking Fairview sixth in size among the county's nineteen communities. Fairview shared with its neighboring villages the fact of its Mormon origin and governance, together with its significant ethnic makeup. Yet by 1880 Fairview had the smallest percentage of foreign-born, married adults (50.3 percent) of any of the major towns in a county which averaged 72.2 percent foreign-born. Fairview was distinctive in other ways as well. Initially the \\"child\\" of larger Mt. Pleasant, only six miles to the south, Fairview eventually became its rival, competing vigorously for land, water, timber, grazing rights, and a fair share of church and government funds. The town's Mormon bishops sometimes found themselves in the center of bitter disputes with leaders of other communities, much to the dismay of local apostle and stake president Orson Hyde, who was assigned to arbitrate disputes and settle contentions. Fairview Utah Tithing Office, July 2011 Yet despite their strong-willed and independent natures, the people of Fairview took full part in the cooperative society of their times. In 1874 they enthusiastically followed church counsel and established a united order. Stock certificates (7,500 shares) were sold at $10 a share to fund the venture. But like most of the other united orders in the territory, Fairview's was doomed to rapid failure. Poor crops and undercapitalization nearly forced its demise in 1874 after only a few months of existence. Despite gallant and creative efforts to keep it alive, the order was discontinued in 1876. Fairview's economic base has always depended on agriculture and the livestock industry. Following trapper Barney Ward's lead, irrigation ditches were dug and reservoir sites identified soon after settlement. Food crops, hay, and grains were planted and, in 1870, the town's first flour mill was constructed south of town. Livestock raising, ranging from beef and sheep to chickens and turkeys, has persisted throughout Fairview's history. Because of its proximity to canyon forests, sawmills were established in the early decades to support a lumber industry. By the start of the 20th century, there were half a dozen steam sawmills in the mountains east of town. Beginning in the late 1860s, Fairview developed a one-street commercial district along the old territorial road running through the middle of town. In 1869 a Zion's Cooperative Mercantile Institution was started in Fairview. Other stores and businesses followed, so that by 1900 Fairview's downtown could boast of a public library, several general stores, a furniture store, a creamery, a harness shop, a butcher shop, and two hotels. In 1881 a Presbyterian mission school was funded, with a chapel being erected in 1894. A good public school system was established in the 1890s; 497 of Fairview's 1,800 population in 1898 were students. Recreational needs were accommodated in a social hall and the Eclipse Pavilion. The arrival of the Rio Grande Western Railroad in the 1890s bolstered Fairview's ability to import equipment and export its surplus goods, immensely benefiting the town's economic strength as it also did for other Sanpete cities. Fairview's fortunes rose and fell with the cycle of the regional economy after the railroad-enhanced boom and its population high- water mark in 1900, however. US‚Äë89) in Fairview, September 2010 The 20th century brought diversified businesses and industries, including dairies, roller mills, coal mining, and fur ranches. The Fairview State Bank was organized in 1914, reflecting the optimism of the local economy. Yet, in the 21st century, agriculture and livestock raising remain the dominant ways of making a living. Unlike other parts of the county where cattle and turkey raising are the leading cash producers, sheep continue to outpace all other economies in Fairview, accounting for 46 percent of the farm and ranch operations in northeast Sanpete County. Like most of the other towns in Sanpete County, Fairview has a rich architectural legacy. The many remaining historic structures not only inform us of the varied types of materials, crafts, and styles employed by Fairview's forebears, they also remind us of many kinds of activities that gave the town its past and present nature. The two 1920s-30s masonry LDS meetinghouses, replacing simpler, earlier edifices, speak of the continuing Mormon presence, while the two-story rock school (now a museum) and brick town hall suggest something of the town's bygone stature. The Fairview Roller Mills, one of the most picturesque industrial buildings in the county, is a monument to the agrarian foundation of Fairview's existence. Impressive business buildings remain clustered along Main Street, while houses and outbuildings of every type, style, and material dot the blocks to the east and west. Long gone are the log meetinghouse, stone fort, tall rows of poplars, and the Sanpete infirmary (or \\"Poor House\\"), but many other remnants of the rural landscape remain which identify key elements of Fairview's history and present character.

The gasoline leaked throughout the soil beneath South Main Street and eventually throughout the southwest side of town, contaminating businesses and homes. On August 10, 2007, local and state officials ordered the temporary evacuation of an entire Main Street block, heavily populated with businesses, because of the fumes from the gasoline leak. In the weeks following, Wasatch Environmental installed underground soil-ventilation systems. Several businesses, including the Top Stop, permanently closed, and some homes were evacuated. Gunnison City, along with a number of businesses and residents, filed suit against Wind River Petroleum over the handling of the gas leak.

The population was 3,276 at the 2010 United States Census. Description Manti is the first community to be settled outside the Wasatch Front and served as the hub for the formation of many other communities in Central Utah. The Manti Utah Temple, the fifth temple built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is found in Manti and dominates the area's skyline. Manti formerly hosted the two-week-long Mormon Miracle Pageant. History A view of Manti Cemetery from Temple Hill, August 2006 Manti was one of the first communities settled in what was to become Utah. Chief Walkara (or Walker), a Ute Tribe leader, invited Brigham Young to send pioneers to the area to teach his people the techniques of successful farming. In 1849, Brigham Young dispatched a company of about 225 settlers, consisting of several families, to the Sanpitch (now Sanpete) Valley. Under the direction of Isaac Morley and George Washington Bradley, the settlers arrived at the present location of Manti in November. They endured a severe winter by living in temporary shelters dug into the south side of the hill on which the Manti Temple now stands. Brigham Young named the new community Manti, after a city mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Manti was incorporated in 1851. The first mayor of Manti was Dan Jones. Manti served as a hub city for the settlement of other communities in the valley. Relations with the local Native Americans deteriorated rapidly and the Walker War soon ensued. The war consisted primarily of various raids conducted by the Native Americans against Mormon outposts in Central and Southern Utah. The Walker War ended in the mid-1850s in an understanding negotiated between Brigham Young and Wakara. Shortly thereafter, Welcome Chapman and Wakara oversaw the baptism of scores of Wakara's tribe members. Although immediate hostilities ended, none of the underlying conflicts were resolved.Findlay, Linnie T.M. \\"Welcome Chapman\\". Saga of the Sanpitch. 1989. Vol. 21, pp. 111‚Äì118. In 1865 Utah's Black Hawk War erupted when an incident between a Manti resident and a young chieftain exploded into open warfare between the Mormon settlers and the local Native Americans. Forts were built in Manti and other nearby communities. Smaller settlements in the area were temporarily abandoned for the duration of the war. In the fall of 1867, Chief Black Hawk made peace with the settlers, but sporadic violence occurred until 1872 when federal troops intervened. Many Mormon settlers who fought and died in the wars are buried in the Manti Cemetery. Most of the Utes were eventually relocated to the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation in Eastern Utah. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.0 square miles (5.1 km2), all of it land. Manti has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb) with warm summers and cold winters, receiving barely enough rainfall to avoid a semi- arid classification (BSk). Its high elevation means that the climate is cooler than other populated areas of Utah, especially during summer. Summers highs average in the mid-80s¬∞F, with winter highs in the mid-30s¬∞F. Winter lows, however, dip to around 15‚Äì20 ¬∞F. Pacific storms move through the region from October through May and spring is the wettest season. However, summer, which is the driest season, primarily relies on precipitation from scattered diurnal thunderstorm activity and the Gulf of California monsoon. Winter and spring see frequent snowfall. Precipitation averages 12.70 inches and snowfall 52.2 inches. The record high temperature is 110 ¬∞F (43 ¬∞C), set on August 6, 1895, while the record low is ‚àí27 ¬∞F (‚àí33 ¬∞C), set on January 22, 1937.Utah climate summaries ‚Äì Manti temperature table Although Utah as a whole only averages 2‚Äì3 tornadoes per year, Manti was hit directly by an F2 tornado on September 8, 2002.

Mt. Pleasant is known for its 19th-century main street buildings, for being home to Wasatch Academy, and for being the largest city in the northern half of the county. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 3,260. History After taking lumber out of Pleasant Creek Canyon in late 1851, a band of Mormon colonists from Manti led by Madison D. Hambleton returned in the spring of 1852 to establish the Hambleton Settlement near the present site of Mt. Pleasant. During the Walkara (Walker) Indian War, the small group of settlers relocated to Spring Town (Spring City) and later to Manti for protection. The old settlement was burned down by local Native Americans, so when a large colonizing party from Ephraim and Manti returned to the area in 1859, a new, permanent townsite was laid out in its present location‚Äîone hundred miles south of Salt Lake City and twenty-two miles northeast of Manti. Among the founding settlers were Mormon converts from Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and the eastern United States. By 1880, at which time Mt. Pleasant was the county's largest city, with a population of 2,000, more than 72 percent of its married adults were foreign born. This ethnic diversity had an important impact on village life during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For decades, five languages were commonly spoken in town, creating confusing and sometimes amusing communication problems. The settlement and development of Mt. Pleasant followed the typical pattern for Mormon towns of the period. A square-shaped townsite was surveyed (eventually containing about 100 city blocks), lots were drawn, and the land was distributed among the population. Under the direction of James Russell Ivie(1802‚Äì1866), a fort of adobe walls and log cabins was built. Pleasant Creek ran through the fort and farming was done outside of its walls. Around the time that Ivie was killed in the Ute Black Hawk War, by Indians who had declined to participate in the settlement of the earlier Wakara War, the town had acquired its present name. By the time the final peace treaty with the Indians was signed in Bishop Seeley's house on Main Street in 1872, bringing to an end to this conflict, many settlers had already erected homesteads outside of the fort. Although the townsite is large in scale, the density is relatively low due to the original layout allowing for only four lots per block. Mormon influence was felt in all religious, political, economic, educational, and social aspects of life in early Mt. Pleasant. Self-sufficiency was a virtue and home-grown and home-manufactured food, clothing, and furnishings were far more available than rarely found imported items. Some of the first industries included tanning, shoemaking, blacksmithing, basketmaking, and freighting. Eventual modernization brought such improvements as the Deseret Telegraph in 1869, The Pyramid Newspaper in 1890 and a telephone system in 1891. Sawmills and flour mills were built, irrigation systems were dug, and a municipal government was created to oversee public laws and improvements. The city was incorporated in 1868, a year after the first co-operative store was founded, starting what became a burgeoning commercial district. Upon the arrival of the Rio Grande Western Railway in 1890, both the local population and the city's prosperity increased dramatically. By 1900 Mt. Pleasant had grown to nearly 3,000 persons, the largest size reached by any city in Sanpete County to that time, and the city had earned one of its nicknames, \\"Hub City.\\" The town's newfound wealth became immediately apparent in a building boom which saw the replacement of small, wood-frame commercial buildings with much more impressive, architect-designed stone and brick structures such as the 1888 Sanpete County Co-op. The resulting Main Street district is today so architecturally distinctive that the two-block-long area has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Equally striking were the Victorian churches, schools, and residences which replaced the simpler adobe and log buildings of the pioneer period. Mt. Pleasant has long been considered the most diverse city in the county, in part because of the liberal Mormons and the Protestant groups which challenged the dominant Mormon population in the late nineteenth century. Liberal Hall, built on Main Street in 1875, and Wasatch Academy, Utah's oldest surviving private boarding school, established by Presbyterians in the same year, remain as visible and functional testaments of the city's historic and ongoing diversity. Mt. Pleasant has been culturally diverse as well, with numerous musical, theatrical, and artistic groups, varied local industries, secret societies and saloons, and one of Utah's largest local historic societies, founded in 1909 and still active. The twentieth century brought continued changes and improvements to the face of the \\"Queen City,\\" its most popular nickname. The commercial and residential districts continued to fill with fine buildings bespeaking the prosperity of the community. By 1912 the first high school--North Sanpete High School‚Äîhad been completed. The year 1912 also brought the Armory Hall, while the Elite Theater was constructed as a \\"fireproof\\" building in 1913. It burned down seven decades later. In 1917 a fine Carnegie Library was built in a modern architectural style. The Marie Hotel was erected in 1920 and a large cheese factory came on the scene in 1930, the same year that bus service came to town. The completion of U. S. Highway 89 in 1936 was a boon needed to soften the impact of Great Depression. A city hall in 1939 and hospital in 1945, together with new schools and churches, gave Mt. Pleasant a full complement of public buildings. Growth has increased in recent decades, as is evidenced by the small new shopping center on the south edge of town. The northernmost of the county's \\"big three\\" cities, Mt. Pleasant was well situated near forested mountains, vast, fertile fields, and a good supply of water. While several commercial and small industrial enterprises have flourished in or near the city since the nineteenth century, agriculture and stock raising have always been the area's economic staples. Currently, nearly half of all the farms and ranches are involved in wool growing, while thirty percent raise cattle. Dairy farming, turkeys, grain, and hay are other significant contributors to the local economy. Rambouillet sheep and shorthorn cattle were prominent around the start of the 20th century, while modern livestock breeds and food strains dominate today. Mt. Pleasant remains a thriving, steadily growing city. New buildings exist side by side with many remaining historic structures such as the Carnegie library, Liberal Hall, Sanpete County Co-op, Jensen, Rasmussen, and Seely homes, and the campus of Wasatch Academy. The relic hall and adjoining Peter Madsen Peel blacksmith shopMt. Pleasant Pioneer give a flavor of the city's heritage. Geography Panoramic view of Mt.

When an LDS ward was organized there in 1853, Ruben W. Allred was appointed the first bishop. The settlement was abandoned in the summer of 1853 because of ongoing conflict with the indigenous people of the area, the Ute people, including San Pitch Utes, from which Sanpete County derives its name. The village was reestablished as \\"Springtown\\" in 1859 by William Black, George Black and Joseph S. Black. Christen G. Larsen was made bishop of a new LDS ward in 1860. Beginning in 1853, the Allred family and other church leaders began to encourage Danish immigrants to settle in Sanpete County, and, particularly after the community was reestablished in 1859, to join the Allred Settlement. By the mid-1860s locals referred to the north side of town as \\"Little Copenhagen\\" or \\"Little Denmark\\".

It does have a park, fire station, library and cemetery. The small mining town of Wales was named for the country of the immigrants that were sent there by Brigham Young in 1854 to mine the \\"rock that burns\\". A Native American named Tabison, a prominent Ute, had shown Young, then president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a small sample. Young recognized it as coal and asked if any of his group knew how to mine the coal. Some Welsh immigrants including John Evans Rees and his cousin John Price, having experience with coal mining in the U.K., volunteered and were sent to the west side hills to set up mines. The community's original name was Coal Bed, but was changed to Wales in 1857. There once was a railroad depot and it was an important and busy mining center.

Joseph Powell is undocumented and unfortunately has been copied through time. The first name given to the settlement was Omni Point, because Richfield was called Omni. The \\"Point\\" was a high rise in the terrain, five miles directly south of Richfield. The town of Annabella was settled shortly thereafter, 3 miles to the North East of Omni Point by John Gleave and Edward Killick Roberts along 2 creeks, which were named Cottonwood Creek and Annabella Springs. The town name was named \\"Annabella\\", after two of the first women who settled there: Ann S. Roberts and Isabella Dalton. Isabella Dalton lived at Omni Point and died in 1873 just 2 years after settlement. There is no memorial to her burial. She was likely buried at the Omni Point homestead.

Aurora's settling came under the direction of Brigham Young. He called on families to settle South Central Utah. Originally named Willow Bend, the name was changed to Aurora due to the presence of the Northern Lights. The city was moved west two to three miles along the Rocky Ford Canal to avoid the spring flooding accompanied life along the Sevier. This location also enabled significant cultivation of the foothills. Those families that settled the region often left comfortable surroundings of Northern Utah to settle what one original resident described as a desolate region without a green tree in sight. Over time however, settlers planted crops, trees, and utilized irrigation to create a very beautiful and livable community. Nestled in the fertile Sevier Valley, Aurora slowly grew as greater numbers of settlers moved west. While growth occurred more rapidly in the accompanying communities of Salina and Richfield, Aurora grew largely due to the settling of children of many of the large families in the city. Most current residents are able to track their lineage to one of the four founding families of the city.

The settlement's original name was Glencoe or Glen Cove, but was changed in November 1864 when Orson Hyde (an LDS Church leader) visited the settlement and recommended Glenwood. A stone fort was constructed in April 1866. Glenwood Coop Store The Black Hawk War of 1867 between the settlers and the local Indians left Glenwood deserted for one year, but it was later resettled in 1868 after peace resumed. Glenwood was an excellent site for a settlement, owing to fresh springs that naturally bubbled from the hills east of town. The springs still feed Glenwood's culinary water supply, and supply water for a State of Utah fish hatchery southeast of town. A gristmill was built in Glenwood that became the first of its kind in the county. A ZCMI co-operative building was built on the intersection of Main and Center streets in 1878. For several years it was the largest building in the county. As families moved out of Glenwood, Isaac Washington Pierce Jr., a resident of Glenwood, bought out all shares in the store and ran the store as a privately owned business for many years.(Issac Washington Pierce Jr Families Histories, p19, compiled by Ruby Taylor Gourley).

History In late 1863, a few exploratory settlers came to Monroe. This small group included George Wilson, his son David, and two others who were seeking to settle in this valley. They made a dugout and spent the winter at what is now considered near the center of the town. They were followed by the first permanent group of settlers, who arrived in Monroe on 20 February 1864. Most, if not all, of the first Settlers were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), who had immigrated to Utah. Around 4 to 5 months before the first small group of men entered Monroe valley to begin settlement, an advanced team, also lead by George Wilson, began to lay some foundation work to help prepare the settlement. At first the town was called South Bend (due to the proximity to a bend in the Sevier River), but soon after its settlement it was renamed Alma, in honor of the Book of Mormon prophet. It is estimated that by the end of 1864 around 20 families were living in Alma. They spent the first year building small homes and dugouts, along with clearing space for fields and pastures. Initially settling in the Salt Lake Valley did not provoke the Native Americans to war, but further settlement outside of Salt Lake provoked the Native Americans to more aggressive behavior. As settlement in these valleys increased, the Native Americans were pushed back into the mountains. In April 1865 the Black Hawk War broke out between local Native Americans and the Settlers of both the Sevier and Sanpete Counties. The war drastically ended the progress which was being made in creating farms and homes in and around Alma. On the night of the 21st of April, 1866, Walter Barney and Sidney Robinson were on guard watching the public corral when they spotted something lying on the fence when making their nightly rounds. When approached, they realized that it was two Native Americans. After chasing them away, they went back to the fence and realized that they had been digging around the poles to break the boundary around the corral. Alma had been settled in the middle of the Native American's hunting grounds and as a result they started to go hungry. During the war Native Americans were constantly trying to steal the Settler's stock for food, and they were successful during several raids. An artist's interpretation of what Fort Alma may have looked like. Sometime during 1865 work began on a fort to provide protection for both the Setters and their stock. The fort was completed and contained several homes, a blacksmith shop, along with a corral and stockyard for the animals. This fort, named Fort Alma, provided protection for about two years, but things continued to get more dangerous and in April 1867 the Settlers of Alma were evacuated. Most of the evacuees made temporary homes in Sanpete County, until they could return home. An attempt to resettle Alma was made during 1868, but the Settlers ran into Native Americans near Cedar Ridge (now Vermillion, Utah) and a battle ensued. They were unsuccessful in resettling Alma, and it was not until March 1871 that Settlers were finally able to return to Alma. The following year they applied for a Post Office under the city name of Monroe, in honor of U.S. President James Monroe. By the end of 1872 the telegraph had been extended through Monroe, which connected it with the rest of Utah. In 1889 Monroe was incorporated as a town and remained that way until 1921 when it was incorporated as a city. In 1882, Thomas Cooper and his wife homesteaded the area on the east side of town where hot springs water emerged. They built a wood box to collect the water and offered it as a soaking pool. Later, around 1905, a building was erected. There was a dance floor, an indoor swimming pool, and many dressing rooms. Many people came from miles around by horse and buggy to enjoy soaking and dancing. In 1930 Farnsworth bought the hot springs. He was the leader of a band, and it became the house band. The slogan for the Monroe hot springs was, \\"the home of mirth and merriment\\". The hot springs enjoyed many years of prosperity until around 1950. It was revitalized in the 1970s. The name was changed to Mystic Hot Springs in 1995.  Present day  Monroe City Library Monroe has many subdivisions and is nicknamed \\"The Little Green Valley\\" due to the many fields that surround the city. Education The schools for most of the surrounding areas are also located in Monroe, which has Monroe Elementary (K-5), South Sevier Middle School (6-8), and South Sevier High School (9-12). School-age children are traditionally bused from the neighboring towns of Central Valley, Annabella, Elsinore, Joseph, and Sevier to Monroe to attend school.

History Prehistoric people occupied the Richfield area for more than 7,000 years. Fremont culture remains are found near most community sites in the Sevier area and are dated from approximately CE 1 to CE 1000. In the late summer of 1776, Father Escalante and his party of Spanish explorers passed through the general vicinity, looking for a trail to link Nuevo Mexico and California. During the late 1820s, Jedediah Smith and other fur traders crossed the area. Sevier County lies on one of the variants on the Old Spanish Trail between Santa Fe, New Mexico and California and was used by travelers between 1830 and 1850. In the early part of January 1864, a party of ten men under the leadership of Albert Lewis came from Sanpete County, Utah and arrived in what is now Richfield. The Mormon settlers found fertile soil, good water and wood in the nearby hills. They decided that it was a desirable site for a settlement. These pioneers made a dwelling place for all ten men, which they called 'The Hole in the Ground.' They carefully covered this hole with brush willows and other materials and made a crude chimney of rocks. This dugout was located on today's Main Street. These men spent the remainder of the winter in this dwelling, planning and preparing for the time when they could bring their families. The early Mormon settlements were abandoned in 1867 due to the conflict known as the Black Hawk War. But, when resettled in 1871, Richfield grew to become a regional center. The coming of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1891 opened the valley for expanded agricultural commerce and mining. In 1939, Utah Governor Henry H. Blood vetoed a proposal for a junior college in Richfield. Fifty-seven years later, Snow College opened a Richfield campus, which serves about 600 students per year. Religion As in most settled areas of rural Utah, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) plays a prominent role. The Mormons were highly industrious colonizers. From 1847, when they founded Salt Lake City, until 1877, they founded 360 towns.Jim Kjelgaard, The Coming of the Mormons, New York, Random House, 1953, p. 174. Following direction from Brigham Young, Latter-day Saints founded the town and outlying hamlets about 150 years ago. Members of the LDS Church are predominant among the residents.Leonard Arrington, Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints: 1830-1900. Even in this heart of Mormon country, non- Mormons and non-participating Mormons, the latter euphemistically called \\"less-actives,\\" fill a percentage of elected offices.Wallace Stegner, Mormon Country, about 1940. Due largely to combined influences of conservative rural culture and the Latter-day Saints, the voters of the city and the surrounding county are predominately Republican. The Richfield area has 20 major denominational churches including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, St. Elizabeth Catholic Church, First Baptist Church, Sister of Holy Cross, Jehovah's Witnesses, Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, Assembly of God, and others.

The population was 2,489 at the 2010 census. History The first permanent settlers (about 30 families) moved into the area in 1864 at the direction of leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They found abundant salt deposits nearby so they named the area \\"Salina\\". In 1866 troubles with Native Americans who used the area as their hunting ground (the Black Hawk War (Utah)) forced the white settlers to retreat to the Manti area. They returned to Salina in 1871, organized a militia, and constructed a fort and buildings for a school and a church. At that time they discovered coal deposits in \\"almost inexhaustible quantities\\" in the canyon east of the settlement. A creek north of the settlement was tapped to provide water for irrigation, domestic purposes, and to power various enterprises such as sawmills, grist mills, salt refineries and generation of electricity. The Sevier River was tapped in 1874, and by 1908 the area west of the settlement was being fully cultivated. In June 1891 the settlement was connected to the state's railroad system, and that year the central area was incorporated as a town. It soon became the shipping terminal between the area settlements and the rest of the state. In 1913 the town was re-incorporated as a city. Media Solutions, the University of Utah's Office of Information Technology, accessed 29 July 2009 During World War II, Salina contained a POW camp, housing 250 German prisoners, most of them members of Erwin Rommel's Afrikakorps.Valrie Plaza American Mass Murderers On the night of July 8, 1945, Private Clarence Bertucci climbed one of the guard towers and took aim at the tents where the prisoners were sleeping. He fired 250 rounds from a light machine gun and managed to hit some thirty tents in his fifteen-second rampage. By the time a corporal managed to disarm Bertucci, six prisoners were dead and an additional twenty-two were wounded (three would later die of their wounds). This incident was called the Salina Massacre. Bertucci, who was from New Orleans, was declared insane and spent the remainder of his life in an institution.Salina Utah Massacre author= Mike Rose Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.2 square miles (15.9 km2), all of it land.

Economy The primary effort of the first settlers was agriculture, primarily to sustain themselves. However, other commercial activities were soon started. In the 1870s a telegraph line, regular postal service, and coal mines were operating. In June 1891 a railway began operating to the area, and soon the town was the transportation terminus between the area and the rest of Utah, which caused a boom in the town's businesses and its population size. By the end of the nineteenth century the town had a newspaper (the Central Utah Press), a city hall and library, and an eight-room elementary schoolhouse, along with a plethora of saloons, boarding houses and dancehalls.Media Solutions During the Great Depression a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established in the area east of Salina, and its attendees worked on dams, roads and recreation sites.

Interstate 80 runs through the town, as well as the Weber River which runs into Echo Reservoir, just north of Coalville. History 237x237px 257x257px Coalville originally began as a settlement known as Chalk Creek. In 1854, the territorial government in Utah offered a $1000 reward to anyone who could find coal within 40 miles of Salt Lake City. Four years later, Thomas Rhodes found a coal vein in the Chalk Creek area, and coal mining began in earnest.Thompson, Norma Eileen Pyper, A Community Study of Coalville, Utah 1859-1914, pg 42 and 47 - as quoted at Hundreds of tons of coal were shipped to Salt Lake City, and soon a narrow gauge railroad was built.Peterson, Marie Ross and Pearson, Mary M., Echoes of Yesterday, Daughters of Utah Pioneers of Summit County 1947, pg 89 - as quoted at The settlement was then renamed Coalville, as a result of this early success. Coalville was officially founded in 1859 by William Henderson Smith, an early Mormon freighter. He noticed that wheat, spilled by other wagons moving through the area, would grow to maturity without being tended. He subsequently convinced four families to settle in the area with him.Utah Guide to the State - American Guide Series, Hastings House Publishers 1941, pg 367 - as quoted at Early life in Coalville was difficult, and during winters the settlers dealt with a constant scarcity of food. When food ran out, they would travel to Salt Lake City for supplies. The local Indian tribes were also hostile for a time, and the settlers built a fort on advice of Brigham Young.Thompson, Norma Eileen Pyper, A Community Study of Coalville, Utah 1859-1914, pg 18 - as quoted at By 1880, success in the coal industry led to the extension of the railroad into Park City. Then known as the Summit County Railway, the railroad continued to transport coal, and was also used for Park City's silver mines. Unlike most Mormon settlements in Utah and the intermountain west, Coalville city streets are not aligned to true north. Main Street in Coalville is offset such that it runs slightly north-northwest, and Center street runs slightly east-northeast. Summit Stake Tabernacle Both the Thomas L. Allen House and the Summit Stake Tabernacle in Coalville are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography and climate According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (12.27%) is water. Coalville has a high-altitude, warm- summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfb), characterized by extreme diurnal temperature ranges that range from extremely cold winter nights to hot afternoons in the summer. However, the high altitude and low humidity means that mornings in the summer remain very cool, and frosts have occasionally occurred‚Äîeven in July. Precipitation is moderate throughout the year, though with a minimum in summer, and snow accumulation is generally heavy due to the very cold nights between November and March, with a median of for the year. Coalville is located at the intersection of two narrow valleys‚Äîformed by Chalk Creek and the Weber River. Like other valley locations in northern Utah, Coalville experiences pronounced temperature inversions associated with high pressure systems during winter months, with low temperatures below 0 ¬∞F relatively common. Owing to this localized phenomenon, observed low temperatures are often significantly lower than those forecasted by national agencies.

History South Summit Fire District Kamas Station in, Kamas, Utah, April 16 Kamas derives its name from Camassia quamash, a source of food for Native Americans. Kamas was inhabited intermittently by several Native American ethnic groups, including members of the Ute, Shoshone, and Snake tribes. The first permanent settlements in the valley are believed to have been built by Mormon pioneers including Abraham Marchant, John Lambert, and John Pack who settled under the direction of Brigham Young. One prominent figure in Kamas folklore history is Thomas Rhoads. According to legend, Indian guides from an area Ute Tribe revealed to Rhoads the location of a gold mine from which he was allowed to take gold to assist in the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. The only condition the Ute guides gave for revealing the location of this mine was that Rhoads agreed not to reveal the location of the mine to any other person. Rhoads adhered to the terms of this agreement until his eventual death from an illness. The \\"Rhoads Mine\\" is now considered lost, but its legend survives in several books which have been published on the topic.

History  The valley was inhabited by Ute Indians before the coming of Mormon pioneers. A historical monument erected in 1939 across the street from the current town hall by the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, honors the habitation of the Utes. \\"INDIAN TRAIL This valley, settled by Thomas Rhoades in 1858, was a summer paradise for Indians who came to hunt, fish and gather wild fruit and sego bulbs. The Weber River Indian Trail skirted the east foothills to Oakley Canyon, crossed the river at the Old Kamas Ford, 3 1/2 miles east of here, running thence to Henry's Fork, and to Brush Creek, in the eastern Uinta Mountains. This trail was used by Indians, Scouts and Pioneers, and is marked in part by roads today.\\" A Mormon pioneer, Parley P. Pratt, was sent to this valley from Salt Lake City by Brigham Young in 1850 to check on the possibility of establishing settlements along the Weber River and the nearby Provo River. His report was, \\". . . a good valley, abundant grass and plenty of water\\". The first white man to winter there, in 1853, was Thomas Rhodes. An explorer, trapper, prospector, part-time farmer, and close friend of Brigham Young, he was occasionally called from his California prospecting by Brigham Young when there was a need for money for the church. Rhodes would disappear for a week or so into the Uinta Mountains and return with a supply of gold. The first settlers in Oakley were William Stevens and wife, Emma Crowden Stevens; they moved there in 1868. Soon to follow were relatives and friends, among them the Fraziers, Johnsons, Hortins, Richards, Wildes and Gibbons, to name a few; all these names are still prominent in the town. Oakley's original name was \\"Oak Creek\\", derived from the name of a creek that ran just east of the present town site and that was thickly overgrown with oak trees. The town changed its name to \\"Oakley\\" in late 1886 or early 1887; the new name was chosen from many names submitted by the settlers in a contest. The current town hall was built as a LDS church in 1903, followed by a schoolhouse in 1904. Incorporated in 1933 on land originally purchased from the Union Pacific Company by the early settlers in the land sale of the 1880s, Oakley has maintained its small town charm as primarily an agricultural community. At one time, it was a large producer of dairy products. More recently, it has focused on cattle- and horse-feeding, \\"haying\\", and still some dairy production. In addition, it is a base for recreational activities, which abound‚Äîhiking, fishing, horseback riding, camping, hunting, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing‚Äîall within a very short distance from town. Memories of early residents can give a real feeling for the town in its early days of the 20th century. Charles Reed Seymour, son of LDS Bishop John Heber Seymour, wrote the following: Lifelong resident Ken Woolstenhulme bought the small local grocery store then named The Merc in 1971 and ran it as Ken's Kash until selling it to Larry Devey in 2008. https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=10079515&itype;=NGPSID&keyword;=&qtype;= Then and now, the store is a gathering place for locals looking for the last ingredient for dinner. Those who grew up locally remember it fondly as one of the last places to offer penny candy. For a time, the store served as the local post office, but increased demand from summer homes up Weber Canyon led the federal government in 1985 to build the present post-office building across the street from the store.https://cdm.weber.edu/digital/collection/WEBDA_OH/id/262/ Ken Woolstenhulme has been involved in all aspects of the town's life, including serving as postmaster, county commissioner, school board member and town mayor at various times in his life. https://cdm.weber.edu/digital/collection/WEBDA_OH/id/262/ In 1998, Mayor Doug Evans and the town of Oakley discovered an underground aquifer containing water that had not seen the surface in at least 18,000 years, according to carbon testing. Found nearly 1900 feet below the surface in a layer of Mississippian limestone, the water proved among the purest ever tested, free of tritium and any other contamination from the nuclear age. Requiring little treatment, the water is free of pesticides and herbicides and the town now uses this water from the Humbug Well for its municipal water supply. Local businessmen have also bought the rights to bottle the water and sell it under different labels.http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991212&slug;=3001093  Local attractions  Oakley is most famous for its annual rodeo, held each year on the Fourth of July weekend. This rodeo, sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2005 with the opening of a $3 million, 6,000-seat arena. A large town park surrounds the rodeo grounds, hosting softball, baseball and soccer tournaments throughout the summer, with Ute League football in the fall and recreational soccer in the spring. Oakley has two eating establishments, the locally owned Polar King and the Road Island Diner, a former train car made into a restaurant that is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Oakley School, a boarding school for high school students, was formerly located in Oakley. It closed in 2017.

The population was 5,145 at the 2010 Census; it was 2,385 at the 2000 census; the 1990 census population was 1,049. Stansbury Park is located in the northern end of Tooele Valley at the base of the Oquirrh Mountains. Traveling by Interstate 80, Stansbury Park is 35 minutes from downtown Salt Lake City. Stansbury Park was proposed by the original developer (Terracor) as a planned community with a lake for sailing and canoeing, an eighteen-hole golf course, clubhouse, swimming pool, and parks. Although the original developer withdrew from the scene in the 1980s due to bankruptcy, that plan has generally been followed. The parks throughout Stansbury Park include baseball diamonds, soccer fields, basketball courts, tennis courts, play areas for children, skateboard park, and an astronomical observatory. A large park northwest of Utah State Route 138 is being developed.Tooele Transcript-Bulletin website. The opening was planned for late 2011, but the transplanted trees were not sufficiently established at that time, delaying the opening to public access. A natural lake (The Mill Pond) exists on the northern edge of the area; it is fed by a spring at its southeast end. The outflow water from this lake is piped around the Oquirrh Mountain Range (east of Stansbury Park) to the Kennecott Company's copper mine refinery operation (the runoff water from the lake enters a large pipe NW of the Benson Grist Mill for transport to the Kennecott operation). Recreation The 18-hole public golf course runs through the center of Stansbury Park. It contains 14 lakes. All the par 3 holes are over water and 16 of the holes have water hazards. During the winter, Stansbury Park is often the only course open in the greater Salt Lake City area. The course has a clubhouse with food service, a pro shop, putting green and driving range. The Harmon's astronomical observatory,In 2002 the Harmons grocery store chain made a substantial donation toward construction of the modern facility; thus in some literature the observatory is called The Harmon Observatory. the Stansbury Park Observing Complex, is at the north end near the skateboard park. The observatory boasts a 40 cm (16\\") Ealing reflector, an 81 cm (32\\") reflector and a 200 mm (8\\") refractor along with computerized tracking and CCD imaging capabilities. The facility is owned and operated by the Salt Lake Astronomical Society.Salt Lake Astronomical Society website In 2017 another building was erected north of the original complex buildings, to house the world's largest amateur-built reflector telescope.Bauman, Joe. The Salt Lake Astronomical Society invites its members to a ground-breaking for the building that will house this planet‚Äôs largest amateur telescope, a behemoth with a mirror 70 inches in diameter and a frame 35 feet long. The informal session begins 5 p.m. on Saturday, 18 March 2017, at the group‚Äôs observatory in Stansbury Park, Tooele County. Schools and churches Stansbury Park has four public-education schools and one charter school. There are three public elementary schools (K through 6th grades) and one high school. Stansbury Elementary opened in 1979, Rose Springs Elementary opened in 2005, and Old Mill opened in 2017.Service Agency Sees Plans for Old Mill Elementary. Tooele Transcript (February 25, 2016) Stansbury High School (9th through 12th), Stansbury High School website just southwest of Rose Springs Elementary School, opened in August 2009. Bonneville Academy, on the west edge of Stansbury Park, is a K-8 Charter school with a focus on STEM education. As of 2009, there were five church buildings in Stansbury Park, all units of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). An LDS meetinghouse northwest of the Benson Grist Mill was placed into service in early 2009; that area was not part of the original Stansbury Park proposal, but since its water and sewer are provided by the Stansbury Park Improvement District, it is now considered an integral part of the development. The area includes several businesses, clustered in two developments at the southeast and northeast corners of the area along Utah State Route 36. As of 2019, the community is not incorporated; thus all municipal services (except for water and sewer service) are provided by Tooele County. A proposal to incorporate was voted down in November 2016. Miscellaneous Stansbury Park receives mail service from the Tooele (Utah) Post Office, ZIP 84074. Drinking water for Stansbury Park comes from deep wells about two miles southeast of the park, east of Utah State Route 36. Originally, the golf course was watered from another deep well within the Park boundary at the southeast corner, but that water had such a high level of hardness that it was abandoned in 1985 and the potable-water well is now also used to serve the golf course. Sewer service is provided by a lagoon complex northwest of the community (north of Utah State Route 138). These services are administered by the Stansbury Park Improvement District. The golf course, swimming pool, and common areas within Stansbury Park were originally administered by two separate service districts (Stansbury Greenbelt Service Area #1 and SGSA #2), but since August 1992 have been administered by a combined district, the Stansbury Service Agency, whose volunteer, unpaid board members are elected by the population. Woodland Park, near the southeast end of Stansbury Park, contains trees which existed before the development started. The park area was the site of a large horse stable complex before and during the first part of the area's present development. It presently contains a children's playground and a basketball court. Benson Grist Mill, north of the original area of Stansbury Park, is a restoration of an actual nineteenth- century water-powered (powered by waterflow from The Mill Pond) wheat-grinding mill built on that site, and has grown into a recreational and historical interest area. Stansbury Lake, southwest of The Mill Pond, is a manmade lake. A peninsula which extends into the lake, called Captain's Island, contains 178 houses, and there are another 143 houses along the lake's shores. The lake is noted for its boating (non-motor-powered boats only, although electric motors are now allowed), swimming, and fishing. Resident fish include bluegill, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, grass carp, and yellow perch. Black crappie were planted at one time but have apparently not continued. Carp have been introduced at times in attempts to control weed growth in the lake. The original addressing scheme for Stansbury Park was to divide the area into neighborhoods, each with a name and with the houses therein to be numbered from 1 to XXX. The three original neighborhoods were Country Club, Lake View, and Mill Pond (which consisted of blocks of condominiums rather than individual houses). This addressing system is confusing to resident and outsider alike, and areas developed since 1990 have abandoned that concept, instead using individual street names and house numbers which integrate into the Tooele City numbering system (although the starting point of Tooele City's numbering system is some seven miles distant). Stansbury Park has an active community association, originally named the Stansbury Park Homeowners Association, but now named the Stansbury Park Community Association. This organization grants preliminary approval to housing and remodeling plans within the service area (Tooele County Engineering Department grants final approval), and organizes outdoor activities such as Stansbury Days every third Saturday in August, Easter Egg hunts, gardening classes and other local celebrations such as fireworks displays on holidays. In its early days it published an annual telephone/address directory covering the area. Geography Stansbury Park is located on State Route 36 about north of the city of Tooele.

Connor wanted to counterbalance his perceived dominance of Mormon leaders in the area by exploring and developing the territory's mineral wealth. He posited that if precious metals could be discovered in Utah, the resulting flood of miners into the territory would overwhelm the Mormons, and outsiders would balance the Church's power. So he sent the men under his command out to prospect, and they almost singlehandedly opened the precious metals industry in Utah in 1863 by locating deposits, staking claims, and establishing mining districts.History To Go, utah.gov Mines were dug on the western slopes of the Oquirrh Mountains, and Stockton became a base camp for some these operations. The small town was first settled in 1863. Under the growing influence of the mining industry, the population swelled to 4,000 residents. It was the first town in the Utah Territories to have its streets surveyed and named, and it later gained the distinction of being the first to get electric lights, and the first to get a telephone.Tooele Transcript-Bulletin, 150 Years of Stockton, Jewel Punzalan Allen, April 25, 2013, p. B1 A town cemetery (northwest of the settlement) was created shortly into the twentieth century. Other amenities were slowly addressed, and they now include a ball diamond, a city park, a city hall, a fire station, a municipal water system, and a centralized wastewater collection/disposal system. A sesquicentennial commemoration was held on April 27, 2013 to mark the town's founding. Part of the ceremony was the unveiling of a welcome sign, mounted on the north end town and visible from the main highway through the town's business district, SR-36.Tooele Transcript-Bulletin, April 30, 2013, p.

The population was 22,502 at the 2000 census, and 32,115 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Tooele County. About 30 minutes southwest of Salt Lake City, Tooele is known for Tooele Army Depot, for its views of the nearby Oquirrh Mountains and the Great Salt Lake. History The Tooele Valley had no permanent settlement when Mormon pioneers entered the Great Salt Lake Valley in July 1847; it was covered with abundant tall grass. The Mormons first used the valley as wintering grounds for their herds.As reported by Capt. Howard Stansbury, who surveyed the Great Salt Lake Valley and surrounding areas for the US Army beginning in 1849. He entered \\"Tuilla Valley\\" on 6 November 1849 (, Exploration and survey of the valley of the Great Salt Lake of Utah, p. 118) and departed on the following day. In September 1849, three families settled on a small stream south of present-day Tooele City. Other families slowly joined them, and by 1853 Tooele City Corporation was organized. During the nineteenth century, the town was primarily an agricultural community; by the century's end its population was about 1,200. The 20th century brought more industrialization; in 1904 the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad built a line through the city, and in 1909 the International Smelting and Refining Company smelter was built in Carr Fork/Pine Canyon east of the city . The Tooele Valley Railway, a seven-mile line, ran from the smelter west to the Union Pacific Railroad main line. This line brought ore from various area mines to the smelter; later a 20,000 ft aerial tramway was also used to transport ore from the mine to the smelter. By 1941 a 22,000 ft tunnel had been completed through the mountain, to move ore to the smelter entirely underground. The smelter began processing copper in 1910, with lead and zinc processing commencing in 1912. In 1946 the copper smelter ceased operation, the zinc operation halted in 1968, and the lead processing was halted in 1972. The entire site was demolished during 1972‚Äì74. However, consideration was being given during this latter period to extracting ore from Carr Fork Canyon, rather than relying on the ore from the east face of the mountain range. In 1969 the mining company began exploration drilling. In 1974 a copper mine and mill (\\"Carr Fork Operations\\") was started; it began processing ore in 1979, and ran until 1981. The Tooele Valley Railway was used to haul away the scrap when the International smelter was torn down, and remained to serve the Pine Canyon mill. It was shut down and abandoned when the Pine Canyon ‚ÄúCarr Fork‚Äù mine and mill shut down; its last day of operation was 28 August 1982. International Smelter at Tooele Anaconda In Utah, UtahRails.net (accessed 23 November 2014) In the eastern section of Tooele, ‚ÄúNew Town‚Äù was built for many of the 1,000 smelter workers. Families from the Balkans, Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor lived in this area and formed their own community. New Town included its own school, church, culture and numerous languages. History of Tooele (Tooele City website; accessed 23 November 2014) When World War II started, the federal government obtained 25,000 acres in the southwestern part of the Tooele Valley to establish an ordnance depot (\\"Tooele Ordnance Depot\\").In the same year, a storage depot for chemical weapons was also begun 20 miles south of Tooele City; the \\"Deseret Chemical Depot\\". In 1993 the scope and mission of the Tooele Army Depot (as the previous Ordnance Depot was now called) was reduced, and about 1,700 acres of its area including many buildings were annexed to Tooele City. The US Army conveyed 40 acres of land, including a newly constructed large-vehicle maintenance structure (\\"Consolidated Maintenance Facility\\") to the City, who converted it into an industrial complex (\\"Utah Industrial Depot\\", UID). In 2013 the UID was purchased by another company and is presently known as \\"Ninigret Depot.\\" Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 21.2 square miles (54.8 km2), of which 21.1 square miles (54.8 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km2) (0.09%) is water. Tooele is located on the western slope of the Oquirrh Mountains in the Tooele Valley, the next valley west of the well-known Salt Lake Valley. Many popular camping and picnic areas surround the city. Name The unusual name for the town is thought by some to have evolved from an old Ute Indian word for tumbleweed. This is one of many unverified explanations, as the name's usage predated the introduction of the Russian thistle to the United States. Other explanations include that the name derives from a Native American chief, but controversy exists about whether such a chief existed. Others hypothesize that the name comes from \\"tuu-w…®…®ta\\", the Goshute word for \\"black bear\\", or from \\"tule\\", a Spanish word of Aztec origin meaning \\"bulrush.\\" Climate Tooele has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cfa).

Arts festival The Tooele Arts Festival, an annual three-day event, hosts vendors of one-of-a-kind artwork, including paintings, jewelry, ceramics, photographs, and sculptures. The event includes live musical entertainment, children's playground equipment and entertainment. There is no admission fee for the festival, which is held at a city-owned park west of the city center. It began in 1985; for the first several years of its existence the Festival was held near the end of May, but it seemed to coincide with late-spring cold spells, which were disastrous given the Festival's open-air setting. Due to this unpredictability, sponsors decided in 1998 to move it to the final weekend of June, although this puts it in direct competition with the much larger Utah Arts Festival, held in Salt Lake City on the same dates. The 2011 Tooele Arts Festival was cancelled due to lack of volunteers; this was the first time since 1985 that no arts festival was held in Tooele City. The Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in June 2016. County fair Until 2000, the annual Tooele County Fair was held during the first week of August at the Tooele County Fairgrounds, inside Tooele City.

Today it serves as a frontage road between Wendover and Knolls just to the south of the Interstate. History The town was established in 1908 as a station stop on the Western Pacific Railroad, then under construction. The transcontinental telephone line was completed as workers raised the final pole at Wendover, Utah on June 27, 1914, after construction of of telephone line. However, the line was not utilized until January 25, 1915, when the first transcontinental telephone call was made to coincide with the opening of the Panama Pacific Exposition. From 1917 to 1939, a Western Pacific subsidiary known as the Deep Creek Railroad also operated into Wendover. The Western Pacific became part of the larger Union Pacific Railroad in 1983.

Smith Secretary of the Interior, October 3, 1861 1868 Amos Reed, a government clerk in the employment of the Indian Service, made a trip to White Rocks. His guide, Chief Antero, said that since he was to be moved to the Uintah Reservation he would choose White Rocks for his home, and he suggested to Mr. Reed that the Indian Agency be established at that place. His reason for his choice was the fact that White Rocks was located in the center of the Basin. Here the local Utes were used to staying. Here traders and trappers had established posts and headquarters. Many trails led to and from it, and here the site had a lovely natural setting. On the recommendation of Chief Antero the agency was moved from Rock Creek to Whiterocks on Christmas Day 1868.

Forbes , Jacobson Family, Retrieved May 15, 2008 In the 1870s, American Fork served as a rail access point for mining activities in American Fork Canyon. American Fork had \\"a literal social feud\\" with the town of Lehi due to the Utah Sugar Company choosing Lehi as the factory building site in 1890, instead of American Fork. There were several mercantile businesses in American Fork, such as the American Fork Co-operative Association and Chipman Mercantile. For several decades in the 1900s, raising chickens (and eggs) was an important industry in the city. In 1892, Joseph Forbes organized the schools in American Fork, and the Forbes school is named after him. During World War II the town population expanded when the Columbia Steel plant was built. An annual summer celebration in the city is still called \\"Steel Days\\" in honor of the economic importance of the mill, which closed in November 2001.Geneva Steel The steel mill was located approximately six miles (10 km) southeast from town, on land on the east shore of Utah Lake. American Fork built a city hospital in 1937. A new facility was built in 1950, which was sold to Intermountain Healthcare in 1977, which in turn replaced that hospital with a new facility in 1980. The 1992 film The Sandlot was mostly filmed on the Wasatch Front. The carnival scene was filmed in American Fork on State Street by Robinson Park.Internet Movie Database Several scenes from the 1984 movie Footloose were also filmed in American Fork, including the opening scene inside the church, the front porch scene with Kevin Bacon and his family, and the gas station scene in which Bacon refuels his Volkswagen. Geography The elevation is above sea level.Idcide.com According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.2 square miles (23.9 km), all of it land.

Since response time, complexity, and capacity are related, the levels may also be distinguished by their performance and controlling technologies. Memory hierarchy affects performance in computer architectural design, algorithm predictions, and lower level programming constructs involving locality of reference. Designing for high performance requires considering the restrictions of the memory hierarchy, i.e. the size and capabilities of each component. Each of the various components can be viewed as part of a hierarchy of memories (m1,m2,...,mn) in which each member mi is typically smaller and faster than the next highest member mi+1 of the hierarchy. To limit waiting by higher levels, a lower level will respond by filling a buffer and then signaling for activating the transfer. There are four major storage levels. # Internal - Processor registers and cache. # Main - the system RAM and controller cards. # On-line mass storage - Secondary storage. # Off-line bulk storage - Tertiary and Off-line storage. This is a general memory hierarchy structuring. Many other structures are useful. For example, a paging algorithm may be considered as a level for virtual memory when designing a computer architecture, and one can include a level of nearline storage between online and offline storage. Properties of the technologies in the memory hierarchy * Adding complexity slows down the memory hierarchy.Write- combining * CMOx memory technology stretches the Flash space in the memory hierarchy * One of the main ways to increase system performance is minimising how far down the memory hierarchy one has to go to manipulate data. * Latency and bandwidth are two metrics associated with caches. Neither of them is uniform, but is specific to a particular component of the memory hierarchy. * Predicting where in the memory hierarchy the data resides is difficult. * ...the location in the memory hierarchy dictates the time required for the prefetch to occur. Examples Memory hierarchy of an AMD Bulldozer server. The number of levels in the memory hierarchy and the performance at each level has increased over time. The type of memory or storage components also change historically. For example, the memory hierarchy of an Intel Haswell Mobile processor circa 2013 is: * Processor registers - the fastest possible access (usually 1 CPU cycle). A few thousand bytes in size * Cache ** Level 0 (L0) Micro operations cache - 6 KiB in size ** Level 1 (L1) Instruction cache - 128 KiB in size ** Level 1 (L1) Data cache - 128 KiB in size. Best access speed is around 700 GiB/second ** Level 2 (L2) Instruction and data (shared) - 1 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 200 GiB/second ** Level 3 (L3) Shared cache - 6 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 100 GB/second ** Level 4 (L4) Shared cache - 128 MiB in size. Best access speed is around 40 GB/second * Main memory (Primary storage) - Gigabytes in size. Best access speed is around 10 GB/second. In the case of a NUMA machine, access times may not be uniform * Disk storage (Secondary storage) - Terabytes in size. As of 2017, best access speed is from a consumer solid state drive is about 2000 MB/second * Nearline storage (Tertiary storage) - Up to exabytes in size. As of 2013, best access speed is about 160 MB/second * Offline storage The lower levels of the hierarchy ‚Äì from disks downwards ‚Äì are also known as tiered storage. The formal distinction between online, nearline, and offline storage is: * Online storage is immediately available for I/O. * Nearline storage is not immediately available, but can be made online quickly without human intervention. * Offline storage is not immediately available, and requires some human intervention to bring online. For example, always-on spinning disks are online, while spinning disks that spin-down, such as massive array of idle disk (MAID), are nearline. Removable media such as tape cartridges that can be automatically loaded, as in a tape library, are nearline, while cartridges that must be manually loaded are offline. Most modern CPUs are so fast that for most program workloads, the bottleneck is the locality of reference of memory accesses and the efficiency of the caching and memory transfer between different levels of the hierarchy. As a result, the CPU spends much of its time idling, waiting for memory I/O to complete. This is sometimes called the space cost, as a larger memory object is more likely to overflow a small/fast level and require use of a larger/slower level. The resulting load on memory use is known as pressure (respectively register pressure, cache pressure, and (main) memory pressure). Terms for data being missing from a higher level and needing to be fetched from a lower level are, respectively: register spilling (due to register pressure: register to cache), cache miss (cache to main memory), and (hard) page fault (main memory to disk). Modern programming languages mainly assume two levels of memory, main memory and disk storage, though in assembly language and inline assemblers in languages such as C, registers can be directly accessed. Taking optimal advantage of the memory hierarchy requires the cooperation of programmers, hardware, and compilers (as well as underlying support from the operating system): *Programmers are responsible for moving data between disk and memory through file I/O. *Hardware is responsible for moving data between memory and caches. *Optimizing compilers are responsible for generating code that, when executed, will cause the hardware to use caches and registers efficiently. Many programmers assume one level of memory. This works fine until the application hits a performance wall. Then the memory hierarchy will be assessed during code refactoring.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  Climate  Eagle Mountain's climate varies drastically between the northeastern Ranches area and southwestern City Center area. Despite being further south than Salt Lake City, both areas have cooler temperatures due to sitting at a higher elevation. The Ranches section of the city has slightly milder temperatures since it is closer to the moderating impact of the Salt Lake Valley and Great Salt Lake which gives it a climate closer to Salt Lake City. The City Center area near Fairfield lies in the Cedar Valley which cuts that area off from the moderating influence of the Salt Lake Valley and Great Salt lake. This causes nights to get significantly colder than in the Ranches but also puts it in a rain shadow causing less precipitation and more sunshine than the Ranches part of the city. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, the climate of the Ranches area is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) or hot-summer humid continental (Dfa) depending on which variant of the system is used. The City Center area is drier and cooler. The K√∂ppen classification for this area is cold semi-arid (BSk), although rainfall is nearly enough to classify the area as warm-summer humid continental (Dfb). {{Weather box location = Eagle Mountain (Ranches), Utah (1980-2010 Averages) single line = Y  Jan high F = 37.1  Feb high F = 41.9  Mar high F = 52.5  Apr high F = 61.1  May high F = 71.0  Jun high F = 82.0  Jul high F = 90.7  Aug high F = 89.0  Sep high F = 78.2  Oct high F = 63.6  Nov high F = 49.3  Dec high F = 38.6  year high F = 62.9  Jan low F = 18.9  Feb low F = 22.4  Mar low F = 30.3  Apr low F = 36.3  May low F = 45.2  Jun low F = 54.3  Jul low F = 62.5  Aug low F = 61.5  Sep low F = 51.5  Oct low F = 39.2  Nov low F = 28.9  Dec low F = 20.6  year low F = 39.3  Jan precipitation inch = 1.0  Feb precipitation inch = 1.1  Mar precipitation inch = 1.8  Apr precipitation inch = 1.9  May precipitation inch = 2.2  Jun precipitation inch = 1.0  Jul precipitation inch = 1.0  Aug precipitation inch = 0.9  Sep precipitation inch = 1.4  Oct precipitation inch = 1.6  Nov precipitation inch = 1.6  Dec precipitation inch = 1.3  year precipitation inch = 16.75  Jan snow inch = 8.0  Feb snow inch = 7.0  Mar snow inch = 3.9  Apr snow inch = 2.8  May snow inch = 0.2  Jun snow inch = 0.0  Jul snow inch = 0.0  Aug snow inch = 0.0  Sep snow inch = 0.0  Oct snow inch = 0.7  Nov snow inch = 4.2  Dec snow inch = 8.8  year snow inch = 35.48 source 1 = {{Weather box location = Fairfield (near Eagle Mountain City Center), Utah (1950-2005 Averages) single line = Y  Jan high F = 38.6  Feb high F = 43.6  Mar high F = 53.0  Apr high F = 62.2  May high F = 71.8  Jun high F = 81.7  Jul high F = 89.3  Aug high F = 87.7  Sep high F = 79.3  Oct high F = 66.7  Nov high F = 50.6  Dec high F = 39.7  year high F = 63.7  Jan low F = 12.4  Feb low F = 16.9  Mar low F = 24.0  Apr low F = 29.6  May low F = 36.9  Jun low F = 43.9  Jul low F = 50.7  Aug low F = 49.4  Sep low F = 39.7  Oct low F = 29.0  Nov low F = 20.3  Dec low F = 13.2  year low F = 30.5  Jan precipitation inch = 1.04  Feb precipitation inch = 0.99  Mar precipitation inch = 1.11  Apr precipitation inch = 1.06  May precipitation inch = 1.21  Jun precipitation inch = 0.73  Jul precipitation inch = 0.94  Aug precipitation inch = 0.99  Sep precipitation inch = 0.92  Oct precipitation inch = 1.09  Nov precipitation inch = 0.95  Dec precipitation inch = 0.93  year precipitation inch = 11.95  Jan snow inch = 9.2  Feb snow inch = 6.5  Mar snow inch = 4.6  Apr snow inch = 1.9  May snow inch = 0.3  Jun snow inch = 0.0  Jul snow inch = 0.0  Aug snow inch = 0.0  Sep snow inch = 0.0  Oct snow inch = 0.9  Nov snow inch = 4.3  Dec snow inch = 8.0  year snow inch = 35.9 source 1 =  Demographics  Eagle Mountain from the air, winter 2016 As of the census of 2010, there were 21,415 people, 5,111 households, and 4,741 families residing in the town.

It is similar in purpose to USB, in that it allows low-speed devices to be added or removed from a computer on the fly. While it was made available earlier than USB, it never became popular as USB gained in popularity. History Apple Computer's Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), introduced in the mid-1980s, allowed all sorts of low-speed devices like mice and keyboards to be daisy-chained into a single port on the computer, greatly reducing the number of ports needed, as well as the resulting cable clutter. ADB was universal on the Macintosh line by the late 1980s, and offered a clear advantage over the profusion of standards being used on PCs. A.b was an attempt to reproduce these qualities in a new standard for the PC and workstation market. It had two additional advantages over ADB; hot plugging (plug-n-play) and the ability for the devices to have their own host controllers so devices could be plugged together without the need for a host computer to control the communications. Philips also suggested that the ability to plug any A.b device into any computer meant that people with special devices, like mice designed for people with disabilities, might carry their device from machine to machine. An industry group, the ACCESS.bus Industry Group, or ABIG, was created in 1993 to control the development of the standard. There were 29 voting members of the group, including Microsoft. By this point DEC had introduced A.b on some of their workstations and a number of peripherals had been introduced by a variety of companies. Development of USB began the next year, in 1994, and the consortium included a number of the members of the A.b group, notably DEC and Microsoft. Interest in A.b waned, leaving Philips as the primary supporter. A.b had a number of technical advantages over USB, which would not re-appear on that system until years later, and it was also easier and less expensive to implement. However, it was also much slower than USB, ten to a hundred times. USB fit neatly into the performance niche between A.b and FireWire, which made it practical to design a system with USB alone. Intel's backing was another deciding factor; the company began including USB controllers in the standard motherboard control chips, making the cost of implementation roughly that of the connector. The only widespread use of the A.b system was DDC2Ab interface by the VESA group. They needed a standardized bus for communicating device abilities and status between monitors and computers, and selected I¬≤C because it required only two pins; by re-using existing reserved pins in the standard VGA cable they could implement a complete A.b bus (including power). The bus could then be offered as an external expansion port simply by adding a socket on the monitor case. A number of monitors with A.b connectors started appearing in the mid-1990s, notably those by NEC, but this was at about the same time USB was being heavily promoted and few devices were available to plug into them, mostly mice and keyboards. The bus remained the standard way for a monitor to communicate setup information to the host graphics card. Technical standard A.b is a physical layer definition that describes the physical cabling and connectors used in the network. The higher layers, namely the signaling and protocol issues, are already defined to be the same as Philips' Inter-Integrated Circuit (I¬≤C) bus. Compared to I¬≤C, A.b: * adds two additional pins to provide power to the devices (+5V and GND) * allows for only 125 devices out of I¬≤C's 1024 * supports only the 100 kbit/s \\"standard mode\\" and 10 kbit/s \\"low-speed mode\\" The idea was to define a single standard that could be used both inside and outside a computer. A single I¬≤C/A.b controller chip would be used inside the machine, connected on the motherboard to internal devices like the clock and battery power monitor. An A.b connector on the outside would then allow additional devices to be plugged into the bus. This way all of the low- and medium-speed devices on the machine would be driven by a single controller and protocol stack. A.b also defined a small set of standardized device classes. These included monitors, keyboards, \\"locators\\" (pointing devices like mice and joysticks), battery monitors, and \\"text devices\\" (modems, etc.). Depending on how much intelligence the device needed, the interface in the device could leave almost all of the work to the driver. This allows A.b to scale down to price points low enough for devices like mice. Compared to USB, A.b had several advantages. Any device on the bus could be a master or a slave, and a protocol is defined for selecting which one a device should use under any particular circumstance. This allows devices to be plugged together with A.b without a host computer. For instance, a digital camera could be plugged directly into a printer and become the master. Under (standard) USB the computer is always the master and the devices are always slaves. In order to support the same sort of device-to-device connection, USB requires additional support in dual-role devices to emulate a host and provide similar functionality. This was only standardized years later as part of USB On-The-Go system. Another advantage of A.b is that devices can be strung together into a single daisy-chain--A.b can support, but does not require, the use of hubs. This can reduce cable-clutter significantly.

History Old Lehi Train Station on State Street A group of Mormon pioneers settled the area now known as Lehi in the fall of 1850 at a place called Dry Creek in the northernmost part of Utah Valley. It was renamed Evansville in 1851 after David Evans, a local bishop in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other historical names include Sulphur Springs and Snow's Springs. The land was organized into parcels of , and new settlers received a plot of this size until the entire tract was exhausted. There was little water to irrigate the rich soil, so it became necessary to divert a portion of American Fork Creek. Evansville consumed up to one-third of the creek's water, as authorized by the Utah Territorial Legislature. The settlement grew so rapidly that in early 1852, Bishop David Evans petitioned the Utah Territorial Legislature to incorporate the settlement. Lehi City was incorporated by legislative act on February 5, 1852. It was the sixth city incorporated in Utah. The legislature also approved a request to call the new city Lehi after a Book of Mormon prophet of the same name.

ClimateAttractions=Lehi Roller Mills Lehi Roller Mills is a landmark in Lehi and famous for being featured in the movie Footloose. Lehi Roller Mills was founded in 1906 by a co-op of farmers. George G. Robinson purchased the mill in 1910, and it has since remained in the Robinson family, currently run by George's grandson, R. Sherman Robinson. At the turn of the 21st century, Lehi Roller Mills was among thousands of such family-owned mills operating in the United States. Fewer than fifty remain today. High demand keeps the mill grinding around the clock, six days a week, and the mill produces some 100,000 pounds of flour each day. However, in 2012, the Mills filed for bankruptcy with the intention of continuing to operate during the proceedings. Lehi Roller Mills was featured in the 1984 film Footloose as Ren McCormack's (Kevin Bacon) workplace and as the site of the dance. The iconic turkey and peacock flour paintings of Lehi Roller Mills were painted on the silos about 1930 by Stan Russon of Lehi, Utah. He used a rope and pulley system to manually raise and lower himself to be able to paint. At the time the film was made, Lehi Roller Mills was surrounded by nothing but vacant fields. In one scene, the Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) and his wife Vi Moore (Dianne Wiest) keep a wary eye on the proceedings while standing in a field some distance away. The area is now home to a variety of fast food restaurants and a shopping center.‚ÄúFlour mill grows up after 'Footloose'‚Äù, by Jesse Hyde, Deseret News website, retrieved December 8, 2005 The Lehi Roller Mills were listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1994. and Lobby area in the Museum of Ancient Life (dinosaur skeletal mounts seen in the photograph: Othnielosaurus fleeing from Torvosaurus).

Peteetneet Town. p. 30 When the Strawberry Valley Reclamation Project was completed in 1912, the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company decided to place a sugar beet processing factory in the area. The plant was completed in October 1913. By 1915, the biggest year for the factory, were planted, yielding 36,915 tons of sugar beets, which were processed into 7,722 tons of sugar. In 1897, the beet leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus, the only known vector of the beet curly top virus (BCTV), invaded Utah County. Its transmission of the disease caused serious crop losses in Payson, Lehi and other areas of the County. As the disease grew worse, Payson farmers reduced beet acreage and planted other crops. Those willing to take a chance with beet contracts experienced declining yields. In 1924, beet growers all over Utah County experienced a complete crop failure. The end result was that in 1924, Utah-Idaho Sugar closed its Payson and Lehi sugar factories. The factory was dismantled and demolished in 1940, leaving only the sugar warehouse. Beet contracts continued to be signed in the Payson area, and harvests were processed in the Utah-Idaho Sugar factory in Spanish Fork. In 1940, the sugar factory property, which included only the sugar warehouse, was sold to the Utah Poultry Producers Co-operative Association (now Intermountain Farmers Association = IFA Country Stores), which used the building for grain storage until 1978.Wairen, P. 2016.

Farnsworth as the inventor born in 1906. See also, Philo T. Farnsworth's witness testimony in regard to the Mountain Meadows Massacre Mormon pioneers sent by Brigham Young, arrived at the area now known as Pleasant Grove and staked out farms in what is now the southwest corner of the city. A small community was established September 13, 1850, consisting of George S. Clark and his wife, Susannah Dalley Clark, Richard and Ann Elizabeth Sheffer Clark, John Greenleaf Holman and Nancy Clark Holman, Lewis Harvey and his wife Lucinda Clark Harvey, Johnathan Harvey and Sarah Herbert Harvey, Charles Price and wife and child, Widow Harriet Marler and children, John Wilson, Ezekiel Holman, and possibly one or two others, relatives of those mentioned. Of note, Bro William Fletcher and Sis Anne Hawley Reynolds in 1852 brought Ellis Reynolds Shipp to live, which Shipp became the legendary MD, Obstetrician, and Pediatrician, through the young women's midwife training program of Dr. Richards and Eliza Snow, beginning her training in young women's MIA in Pleasant Grove.Ellis Reynolds Shipp: Autobiography, E>R>S, 1898 Deseret Book Pleasant Grove was officially incorporated as a town January 18, 1855, by which time the settlement had grown to 623 people. Early relations with Native Americans The original name of the city was Battle Creek. It was named for a battle which took place there in 1849 between Mormon settlers and a small band of Ute Indians, wherein all the male Utes were massacred because Brigham Young believed they had stolen some of his horses (which were found before the attack on the Utes occurred).http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/battle_creek_massacre The settlers later decided they needed a more uplifting name and began calling their town Pleasant Grove after a grove of cottonwood trees located between Battle Creek and Grove Creek, near the current-day intersection of Locust Avenue and Battle Creek Drive. A monument with a plaque describing this battle is located at Kiwanis Park, at the mouth of Battle Creek Canyon. During the Walker Indian War in the 1850s, citizens built a fort with walls two or three feet thick and six feet tall that occupied an area the size of sixteen city blocks. The settlers in the area at the time built homes inside the fort. While the fort no longer stands, memorial cornerstones were erected by local historians. The northeast monument was erected near the intersection of 100 North and 300 East streets. The northwest monument was erected four blocks west of that point at 100 West Street and the southeast monument erected four blocks south at 300 South Street. The southwest monument would have been located near 300 South 100 West, the area is now occupied by a large parking lot and retail store.

The first annual ‚ÄúStrawberry Day‚Äù (initially a single-day event) was held on June 21, 1922, with 10,000-15,000 people in attendance. The festival was organized by the Wasatch Club, a forerunner of today‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce. This first celebration included strawberries and cream and a parade; both remain staples of modern-day Strawberry Days. The festival‚Äôs name originated when strawberry farming was a major economic activity in the city. (Approximately 250 acres of strawberries were being grown in the area when the first festival was held in 1922.) The festival retains the traditional name, even though large-scale commercial growing of the fruit no longer occurs in the city. The festival is Utah‚Äôs second oldest community harvest festival, younger only than Brigham City's Peach Days‚Äìa festival Strawberry Days‚Äô founders hoped to rival. Today, a rodeo held in conjunction with this festival brings competitors and spectators from throughout the West. The festival includes parades, a carnival, pageants and other activities. The festival is usually held the third week of June, a period chosen in 1922, which would generally correspond with the end of the strawberry harvest for the area. First amendment case In November 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of Pleasant Grove City v. Summum. The case regarded whether Pleasant Grove, which allowed the display of a privately- donated Ten Commandments on public property, must also allow the religion of Summum to display a monument to its \\"Seven Aphorisms\\" alongside. Pleasant Grove had declined the Summum offer in 2003. The city lost in the Tenth Circuit. However, the city appealed to the Supreme Court which overturned the Court of Appeals decision, citing the permanence of monuments as opposed to forms of constitutionally-protected free speech as well as the fact that governments take ownership of monuments on their properties and thus must \\"take some care in accepting donated monuments.\\" Education Pleasant Grove with Utah Lake in the background.

It was incorporated on December 31, 1997 and has been growing rapidly since then.

Saratoga Springs became a city in 2001. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 16.61 square miles (26.8 km2), of which 16.51 square miles (26.4 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.3 km2) (1.26%) is water. History The natural hot springs near the source of the Jordan River inspired early European-American settlers to create a resort known as Beck's Saratoga Springs, named after the original New York resort and owner John Beck. The Beck family opened their resort in 1884 and used it as their residence. With several lodge buildings and amusement park facilities, the resort became a popular location for tourists and visitors. The original buildings were taken down. The resort area has now been redeveloped privately, containing an outdoor pool, clubhouse, bowery, and kitchen facility for groups and parties. In the early 1990s, landowners began to investigate the possibilities of developing the land around the hot springs and in the foothill locations of the nearby Lake Mountains range. The Utah County land development ordinances were not sufficiently urban in nature, so several landowners sought incorporation as a town. Subsequently, Saratoga Springs incorporated in December 1997. Several hundred acres have since been annexed into the City limits and the City now occupies a somewhat narrow strip running north and south between Utah Lake and the Jordan River on the East and the foothills to the west.

It is part of the Provo-Orem Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 40,913 as of a 2019 estimate. Spanish Fork, Utah is the 20th largest city in Utah based on official 2017 estimates from the US Census Bureau.http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/spanish-fork-ut-population/ Spanish Fork lies in the Utah Valley, with the Wasatch Range to the east and Utah Lake to the northwest. I-15 passes the northwest side of the city. Payson is approximately six miles to the southwest, Springville lies about four miles to the northeast, and Salem is approximately 4.5 miles to the south.Utah Atlas & Gazetteer, DeLorme, 9th ed., 2014, p.25 https://www.distance- cities.com/distance-salem-ut-to-spanish-fork-ut History Spanish Fork was settled in 1851 by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as part of the Mormon Pioneers' settlement of Utah Territory. Its name derives from a visit to the area by two Franciscan friars from Spain, Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez in 1776, who followed the stream down Spanish Fork canyon with the objective of opening a new trail from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to the Spanish missions in California, along a route later followed by fur trappers. They described the area inhabited by Native Americans as having \\"spreading meadows, where there is sufficient irrigable land for two good settlements. Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.\\" In 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement.Jenson. Encyclopedic History. p. 823 However, a larger group congregated at what became known as the Lower Settlement just over a mile northwest of the present center of Spanish Fork along the Spanish Fork river. In December 1851, Stephen Markham, who was severely wounded outside Carthage Jail in Carthage, Illinois while attempting to defend Joseph Smith and other church leaders from a mob in 1844, became the president of the first church congregation (branch) at the Lower Settlement. In 1852, Latter-day Saints founded a settlement called Palmyra west of the historic center of Spanish Fork. George A. Smith supervised the laying out of a townsite, including a temple square in that year.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1941) p. 631-632 A fort and a school were built at the Palmyra site in 1852.Jenson. Encyclopedic History. p. 824 With the onset of the Walker War in 1853, most of the farmers in the region who were not yet in the Palmyra fort moved in.Jenson. Encyclopedic History. p. 631 Some of the people did not like this site and so moved to a different site at the mouth of Spanish Fork Canyon, where they built a structure they called \\"Fort St. Luke\\".Jenson. Encyclopedic History. p. 256-257 Also in 1854 there was a fort founded approximately south of the center of Spanish Fork that later was known as the \\"Old Fort\\". Between 1855 and 1860, the arrival of pioneers from Iceland made Spanish Fork the first permanent Icelandic settlement in the United States.Thorstina Jackson, \\"Icelandic Communities in America: Cultural Backgrounds and Early Settlements,\\" 681. The city also lent its name to the 1865 Treaty of Spanish Fork, where the Utes were forced by an Executive Order of President Abraham Lincoln to relocate to the Uintah Basin.

Icelandic Days The Icelandic Association of Utah was founded in 1897 and hosts Iceland Days every year. The association picked June because Icelandic Independence Day, or National Day, is June 17. Spanish Fork was the first Icelandic settlement in the United States, after Icelanders who joined the Church of Jesus Christ were expelled from that country, according to association spokesman Glenn Grossman. Although other nationalities helped found the town, under colonizer Brigham Young, Icelanders kept their identity and celebrate it with their culture every year during the three-day event. Harvest Moon Hurrah The Harvest Moon Hurrah is sponsored by the Spanish Fork Arts Council and takes place on a Saturday in September closest to the date of the full moon. Activities include children's crafts and activities, a giant paint-it-yourself mural, storyteller, old-fashioned family photos, caricature artist, clown and balloon animals, hay rides with live bluegrass band, and live entertainment.

Community South across Spring Lake in Spring Lake, May 2016 Much of Spring Lake consists of farms and ranches, with many people owning horses, cattle, and raising alfalfa and hay for their animals. Being located between Payson and Santaquin, the rural area may give way to more homes in the coming years, but as there is no city water for many, wells are needed which place a limit of one house per of land. Only when city water is provided will greater housing density be possible. The main transportation route through the city is Utah State Route 198 (South State Street), which follows the former routing of U.S. Route 6 and the pre-1974 routing of U.S. Route 91. Although Interstate 15 forms the western border of Spring Lake, there is no direct access to the freeway within the community. There are no businesses or stoplights in Spring Lake as of 2018. Spring Lake was the birthplace of Antonga Black Hawk, the famous Ute leader. Antonga led many raids on settlements during Utah's Black Hawk War. After his death in 1870 he was buried in Spring Lake. In 1911 his body was discovered by miners, and moved to an LDS Church museum in Salt Lake City, but was later returned to Spring Lake.Peterson, John Alton.

The original Heber City town square is located on the west side of Main Street between Center Street and 100 North and currently houses city offices as well as the historic Wasatch Stake Tabernacle and Heber Amusement Hall. The city was largely pastoral, focusing largely on dairy farms and cattle ranching, and has since become a bedroom community for Orem, Provo, Park City and Salt Lake City. Heber City is currently governed by Mayor Kelleen Potter along with City Council Members. Within the city limits are Heber Valley, Old Mill, Daniels Canyon and J.R. Smith Elementary Schools, Timpanogos Middle School, Rocky Mountain Middle School, Wasatch High School, and Wasatch Alternative High School.

Its population was 13,748 at the 2010 U.S. Census. Along with several other areas of southwestern Utah, the Hurricane area has undergone large population growth since the 1970s. Because of this, it has become a suburb of St. George, while retaining its rural character. History Hurricane was first settled in 1896, and received its name after a whirlwind blew the top off a buggy in which Erastus Snow was riding. Snow exclaimed, \\"Well, that was a Hurricane. We'll name this 'Hurricane Hill'.\\"Daughters of the Utah Pioneers historic marker dated September 25, 1931, currently located at Heritage Park at 35 W. State Street, Hurricane, Utah.

Hurricane, which is pronounced \\"Her-ah-kun\\" by local residents (mimicking the accent of early Liverpudlian settlers), is in eastern Washington County. The community was settled as part of LDS Church President Brigham Young's \\"Cotton Mission\\", intended to establish the southern end of Utah for agricultural purposes. The town once operated a large peach and apricot orchard for the LDS Church, and is historically known for growing peaches, pecans and pistachio nuts on small farms. The 1992 St. George earthquake destroyed three houses as well as above- and below-ground utilities, causing about in damage. Places of interest The town boasts multiple parks, a new dog park, a city pool and large community center, several ranked golf courses, two reservoir lakes noted for bass fishing (Sand Hollow Recreation Area and Quail Creek State Park), as well as a small municipal airfield. There are several medical clinics in the area. Hurricane Canal and Canal Trail For approximately 80 years, the Hurricane Canal was the lifeblood of the Hurricane Valley. It was built over a period of 11 years (1893‚Äì1904), mostly by pick and shovel. Since 1985, the canal has lain empty. In 2000, special interest groups came together to preserve the canal, receiving grants and volunteering time to construct a trail to stand as a tribute to the early settlers put forth to make the canal a reality. A monument at the trailhead recounts the canal story in brief. Much of the trail, which only covers a small section of the canal, is the actual west bank of the canal, which ‚Äúcanal riders‚Äù rode every day when the canal was in operation to ensure there were no leaks or other problems since the bank was somewhat unstable. Two of the trail's unique aspects are walking in the canal itself ‚Äì on a steel flume across a wash and through a tunnel immediately thereafter. The trail provides excellent views of the towns of Hurricane and La Verkin throughout. The trail ends before reaching the Virgin River Gorge, approximately five miles from the canal's former headwaters.  State Route 59 crash  On December 30, 2006, an Arizona driver on the Utah State Route 59 just outside Hurricane lost control and crashed through the guardrail at around 80 mph. The truck struck the culvert, flipped over, and rotated 180 degrees before landing on the opposite side of a ravine. Due to the rare nature of the event, photos of the crash were suspected to be a hoax, but the Hurricane City Police department confirmed the entire sequence of events.

It is a part of the St. George Metropolitan Area as a suburb or \\"bedroom\\" community. The population was 6,753 at the 2010 census, and it was estimated at 8,913 in 2018.https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/ivinscityutah/PST045218 Although Ivins was listed as a town in the 2000 census, it became a city in 1998. In recent years, the culture of Ivins has transitioned from that of a sleepy farming community to a more affluent bedroom community and resort town. This is due to adjacent attractive scenery and recreation opportunities, such as Snow Canyon State Park. History Prior to the arrival of Mormon settlers, this area was inhabited for thousands of years by the Paiute people and their ancestors. The Shivwits Band of Paiutes reservation is located immediately west of Ivins City. Ivins was born out of the fulfilled dream of several men to bring water to the Santa Clara bench. An eight-mile canal had to be built from the Santa Clara creek near the Shem smelter to the bench. This was a major undertaking because the route took them over steep mountain sides and through deep ravines that needed to be siphoned or flumed. Work began in 1911 and the canal was completed in 1914. The Ivins Reservoir was built to store the water in 1918. Civil engineers Leo A. Snow and Clarence S. Jarvis first conceived the idea in 1909. The first couple to move onto the project site were Mr. and Mrs. Alden Gray, who arrived there January 15, 1922. Mr. and Mrs. Edward Tobler came a week later. Mr and Mrs. Samuel Gubler came in the spring along with Mr. and Mrs. Clement Gubler, Mr. and Mrs. Edward R. Frei, Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Leo F. Reber, and Mr. and Mrs. Reuben Ence. In 1924 Mr. and Mrs. Milo Ence, Mr. and Mrs. Rulon Stucki, Mr. and Mrs. Martin J. Gubler, Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Reber, and Mr. and Mrs. Loren Stucki joined the group. The irrigation company offered a lot to the first ten families to move to the new town, but since two came on the same day they gave eleven lots instead. These families were all young and willing to live in humble circumstances and work hard to make this new town a reality. Their children had to ride a horse to Santa Clara to school each day. When residents decided they wanted a different name for their town than \\"Santa Clara Bench,\\" they chose \\"Ivins\\" after the Mormon Apostle Anthony W. Ivins. He was asked and did not object as long as they spelled it correctly. Ivins then donated $100 toward a chapel and later sent a bell for it.

History In 1854, Jacob Hamblin was called by Brigham Young to serve a mission to the southern Paiute and settled at Santa Clara in the vicinity of the modern city of St. George, Utah. The town is among the oldest in the area. The first settlers built Fort Clara or Fort Santa Clara, in the winter of 1855‚Äì1856. In the fall of 1861, Swiss Mormon colonists arrived at the new settlement, but shortly afterward were victims of the large flood in the Clara River that wiped out the fort and most other buildings, its irrigation dams and ditches, in early in 1862. This flood was part of the Great Flood of 1862. FORT CLARA, (aka FORT SANTA CLARA), from wchsutah.org accessed September 24, 2015 Hamblin's first home there was included in the destruction of this flood. His second wife Rachael saved one of their young children from drowning, but the child soon after died from exposure. Rachael never fully recovered from the exposure she got from the flood. Swearing to avoid the risk of flood, Hamblin built a new home on a hill in Santa Clara. Owned today by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, it is operated as a house museum, where Mormon missionaries give daily tours. 19th-century Santa Clara was largely inhabited by Mormon immigrants from Switzerland. Among these was Daniel Bonelli, who after the destruction of the flood went on to be a pioneer colonist of St. Thomas, Nevada in the Moapa Valley, a farmer, later a salt miner and the owner of Bonelli's Ferry, at Rioville, Nevada on the road between southwestern Utah and Arizona on the Colorado River at its confluence with the Virgin River.

A History of Wayne County (Salt Lake City: Utah Historical Society and Daggett County Commission, 1999) as reviewed in Journal of Mormon History, v27 n2, Fall 2001. The town is generally held to be named after Jay L. Torrey from Pittsfield, Illinois. Torrey was a member of the Wyoming legislature, who, upon the advent of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, achieved national attention by proposing the creation of what became three volunteer cavalry regiments, made up of cowboys and stockmen. Torrey was commissioned Colonel of the 2nd Regiment, the \\"Rocky Mountain Riders\\"; the 1st Regiment, the only regiment to see action, was better known as the Rough Riders.

The population was 5,928 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ogden- Clearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current mayor is Z.Lee Dickamore. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 5.8 square miles (15.1 km2), all of it land. Farr West is bordered by Plain City to the west, Willard to the north, Pleasant View to the north east, Harrisville to the east, and Marriott-Slaterville to the south.  History  Farr West City is located on the north end of Weber County. It is bordered on the east by Pleasant View and by Harrisville, on the south by Slaterville, and on the west by Plain City, and was first settled by Mormon pioneers. In 1858 Joseph Taylor settled in the area that later became Farr West. In 1868 the area was included as a part of Harrisville when a precinct was organized. On November 30, 1890 western Harrisville was organized into a separate LDS ward and given the name Farr West in honor of Lorin Farr, former president of the Weber LDS stake, and Chauncey W. West, who had served as presiding bishop of Weber County, and who was the son-in-law of Abraham Hoagland.Tullidge, Edward W. Tullidge's Histories: Containing the History of All the Northern, Eastern and Western Counties of Utah; also the Counties of Southern Idaho. Press of the Juvenile Instructor, Salt Lake City, Volume II, p. 55. The name echoes \\"Far West\\", an important early Mormon settlement in frontier Missouri. The earliest settlers engaged in agriculture for their livelihood, and it received a great boost when the sugar beet industry was introduced in 1898. In 1923 further benefits were available to farmers when the Utah Packing Corporation installed a pea viner to help process field-grown peas. Early settlers had to be quite self-sufficient. They primarily raised hay and grain and kept a few farm animals for work and for food. As the population grew, some farmers furnished milk and butter to customers in the city. Later, farmers branched into dairy or poultry operations to augment family income; a few raised cash crops like onions, tomatoes, and potatoes. Since World War II, most of the local small farms have gone out of business and only a few large farms specializing in dairy or beef production remain in operation. In the early 1990s, only one farm raised garden fruits and vegetables on a commercial basis. Irrigation for farming is still obtained through the western Irrigation Company Canal, constructed in 1858 and enlarged in 1884. The Willard Bay Canal, constructed through Farr West in 1965, may in time serve part of the community. Education has always assumed a vital role in community life. The first frame school building in western Harrisville was built in 1872. It was replaced in 1880 with a new red brick schoolhouse. In 1914 a yellow brick school building was erected in the center of town. Through the consolidation of area schools, this building was taken out of service in 1938. In 1941 the Walquist Elementary School began serving the public and in 1950 was converted to a junior high school. In 2014, Wahlquist Junior High was rebuilt and moved to another location in Farr West. The new Farr West Elementary School began operation in the northwestern part of the community in 1983. The first LDS church building was completed in 1891, serving as the center of church and community activities for fifty-three years until it was destroyed by fire in 1944. Other LDS chapels were constructed in 1926 and in 1981. The growth of services in the community has significantly affected life in Farr West. In 1900 the first post office was established in Farr West. Rural free mail delivery began in 1905. Also in 1905, phone service was brought into the community. Electricity was made available on May 29, 1916. The Farr West Sewer Improvement District was established on January 4, 1968. Natural gas was brought into the community in August 1958. Bona Vista Water Improvement District provided culinary water in 1958; Pine View Water Systems brought a secondary water system to the area in 1982. The earliest business in Farr West was built in 1862. It was called the Prairie House, and was a tavern that primarily served travelers who were on their way to the gold mines in Montana. In 1869 the Union Pacific Railroad laid a line through the eastern part of Farr West, a line later called the Ogden Shoreline. In 1874 William Rawson opened the first general merchandise store in the town. For many years, new businesses remained in operation only a relatively short time. Only in recent years have more permanent business activities become established. At the end of 1992 the city had issued licenses to sixty-one business, which range in size from the large Smith and Edwards variety store to small businesses operating from home sites. Road improvements have had a significant impact on community development. The earliest unimproved roads were dusty in dry weather and filled with ruts and difficult to traverse in bad weather. Applying gravel to the roads improved their condition markedly, but asphalt and concrete were not used in local roads until around 1930 (the year West Harrisville Road was paved). Farr West residents have exhibited intense interest in controlling the various influences on community growth. Before incorporating, the community elected a town planning committee in 1962, and then elected a town committee in 1972. These groups worked with the Weber County Planning Commission to effect a desirable growth pattern in the community. However, town residents became increasingly fearful that they would lose the ability to effectively convey their desires to the county planners. The concern eventually led to incorporation of Farr West City in 1980. Becoming the twelfth city in Weber County, it began formal operation on January 1, 1981. Jimmie Papageorge was elected as the first mayor. City officials operated out of their homes until city offices were constructed. The first meeting was held in the new town hall on November 4, 1982.

History North Ogden was originally settled during the winter of 1850 by two sets of cattle ranchers from Ogden. The Campbells and the Riddles had been warned by Brigham Young not to venture from the fort in Ogden due to the troubles with the local Shoshone. After a few months wintering their cattle, they were forced to return to Ogden in fear of Shoshone reprisals. The following year, after the trouble with the Shoshone had been partially settled, Jonathan Campbell returned with a number of other families to permanently settle the spot.genealogybuff.comNorth Ogden p. 11 One important early industry in the mid to late 19th century was the sugar beet industry, and a processing and canning plant was built in the town for this. The owner of the canning plant during its operation was David Ephriam Randall. North Ogden also built a spur from the Union Pacific Station in Ogden, called the \\"Dummy Line\\". Large fruit orchards were developed and their harvest became an economic staple for the community, with the establishment of the North Ogden Fruit Exchange in 1924. This became the region's first fruit cooperative, using the railroad to sell fruit on the interstate market. In the 1930s, increasing demand for water led the city to officially incorporate on February 1, 1934.http://www.northogdencity.com/ David Gilbert Randall was elected the first mayor. He served in this position for ten years. That same decade saw the creation of the Cherry Days celebration on July 4. As North Ogden grew after World War II, it became a primary suburb for Ogden and other larger cities.

The population was 87,773 in 2019, according to the US Census Bureau, making it Utah's 7th largest city. The city served as a major railway hub through much of its history,Maia Armaleo \\"Grand Junction: Where Two Lines Raced to Drive the Last Spike in Transcontinental Track,\\" American Heritage, June/July 2006. and still handles a great deal of freight rail traffic which makes it a convenient location for manufacturing and commerce. Ogden is also known for its many historic buildings, proximity to the Wasatch Mountains, and as the location of Weber State University. Ogden is a principal city of the Ogden‚ÄìClearfield, Utah Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes all of Weber, Morgan, Davis, and Box Elder counties. The 2010 Census placed the Metro population at 597,159. In 2010, Forbes rated the Ogden-Clearfield MSA as the 6th best place to raise a family. Ogden has had a sister city relationship to Hof (Germany) since 1954. The current mayor is Mike Caldwell. History Ogden in 1874. Originally named Fort Buenaventura, Ogden was the first permanent settlement by people of European descent in what is now Utah. It was established by the trapper Miles Goodyear in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today. In November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico. The settlement was then called Brownsville, after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the Hudson's Bay Company, Peter Skene Ogden, who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which \\"Ogden\\" was the first to set foot in the area. A Samuel Ogden traveled though the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park. Westbound passengers changed cars at Ogden, from Union Pacific to Southern Pacific, which took them to California Ogden is the closest sizable city to the Golden Spike location at Promontory Summit, Utah, where the First Transcontinental Railroad was joined in 1869. It was known as a major passenger railroad junction owing to its location along major east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth routes, prompting the local chamber of commerce to adopt the motto, \\"You can't get anywhere without coming to Ogden.\\" Railroad passengers traveling west to San Francisco from the eastern United States typically passed through Ogden (and not through the larger Salt Lake City to the south). However, Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, no longer serves Ogden. Passengers who want to travel to and from Ogden by rail must travel via FrontRunner commuter rail to Salt Lake City and Provo. In 1972, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints completed construction of and dedicated the Ogden Utah Temple in Ogden. The temple was built to serve the area's large LDS population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle. The work which began in 2011 includes an update to the exterior, the removal of the Tabernacle's steeple to make the Temple's steeple a main focus and a new underground parking garage and gardens. The Temple was rededicated in 2014. Because Ogden has historically been Utah's second largest city, it is home to a large number of historic buildings. However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and Provo had surpassed Ogden in population. The Defense Depot Ogden Utah operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some of its have been converted into a commercial and industrial park called the Business Depot Ogden. Geography=Topography Ogden is located at (41.2196, ‚àí111.9712), at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains. This is at about the same latitude as Benevent in Campania in southern Italy.

In the center of the city, the blocks from Union Station along 25th Street, the west-to-east oriented cross streets are named after former U.S. presidents such as Lincoln Avenue, Grant Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Adam Avenue, Jefferson Avenue or Madison Avenue. The central connecting street in north‚Äìsouth orientation is Harrison-Boulevard.

All these elected officials serve four-year terms, with elections occurring in odd-numbered years and terms beginning in January of even-numbered years. The mayor is Mike Caldwell, who took office in January 2012. The city council members are Marcia White, Richard Hyer, Bart Blair, Ben Nadolski, Luis Lopez, Angela Choberka, and Doug Stephens. Four of the council members represent the city's four municipal districts,https://www.ogdencity.com/DocumentCenter/View/5395/Municipal- Districts-Press-Release while the other three (Lopez, White, and Blair) are elected at-large by voters from the entire city. The Ogden City government operates on a budget of $190 million per year and employs nearly 600 full-time workers. In addition to providing the usual municipal services, the government promotes business and economic development. The city operates a redevelopment agency (RDA), with the city council acting as the RDA governing board and the mayor as its executive director. The RDA's activity has increased since its establishment in 1969, with tax increment revenues at about $10 million per year and an outstanding debt of over $50 million. Designated redevelopment districts now cover nearly all of Ogden's central business districts, as are Business Depot Ogden and several other industrial areas in the western parts of the city. Much of the recent political discourse in Ogden has focused on controversial government-sponsored development projects in the downtown area, including the Ogden Eccles Conference Center, Lindquist Field, The Junction, the Ogden River Project, and other proposals that have not moved forward. A proposed streetcar connecting downtown to Weber State University has attracted considerable attention but only limited support. A major controversy flared up in 2005‚Äì07 when the mayor and many others pushed unsuccessfully for construction of a luxury residential development on public land in Ogden's foothills and a new ski resort in the mountains above the city, to be accessed by a pair of aerial gondolas. Other local political concerns include Ogden's relatively high tax and utility rates, efforts to fight crime, allegations of government corruption, and challenges facing the Ogden City schools.

History The Salt Lake Valley settlement began when wagon trains of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began arriving in 1847. By 1858, farmers from the then-settled towns of Lehi and Kay's Creek, looking for a new place to homestead, began considering the area now known as Plain City. On 17 March 1859, led by Lorin Farr, a group arrived to begin homesteading.Plain City History. - Daughters of Utah Pioneers. - (c/o Plain City Website) Soon after arriving, the group surveyed a townsite and assigned building lots. The town layout used an organized grid system of blocks and streets, originally six blocks north-to-south and three blocks east-to-west. Each block was in area, divided into 4 lots. The first settlers were allowed their choice in selection of a lot.

The FrontRunner at Pleasant View station, July 2014 Points of interest The area became a popular tourist stop because of the natural hot springs located in its north western corner that lies adjacent to Box Elder County. The Utah Hot Springs Resort was created at the site in the 1880s. During its peak, the facility offered visitors bathing and swimming pools, a hotel with 40 rooms, a dance hall, and a saloon where a mug of beer could be bought for five cents. The facility no longer exists. Since 2008 until 2018 (until future line extension), the Pleasant View station has been (although for limited service) the northern end of Utah Transit Authority's commuter rail service, the FrontRunner.

History The area was settled by members of the Mormon pioneers. Daniel Burch and his family arrived in Brownsville (Ogden) in 1848. Burch came from Kentucky with the Lorenzo Snow company of Utah pioneers. In 1850 the area was named Burch Creek in his honor. In 1852 the Weber Canal was built and Burch built a gristmill near its source in what is now Riverdale. The Ogden City Council founded a six-room isolation facility for smallpox patients in Burch Creek in 1882. The area was a farming community with several dairy farms. There was little development until 1890 when extensive investments in land, both residential and commercial, took place. Burch Creek Elementary and Junior High School was built in 1897. It was the first school in the area and was considered one of the most modern in the state. The first church building, the Ogden LDS 14th Ward, was erected in 1925. In the 1930s Burch Creek was a farming community of about 800 people in need of more water. The water supply was augmented in 1934, a year of serious drought, when the Federal Drought Relief Agency financed the installation of a water supply line from Burch Creek Canyon. The question of annexing Burch Creek to Ogden was raised many times, but each time the proposal was rejected by a majority of the people. Burch Creek was in need of a sewer system, more water, roads, and sidewalks. In 1936 a committee petitioned Weber County commissioners to allow incorporation. The petition was granted and on July 6, 1936 the town of South Ogden was established. South Ogden's close location to Hill Air Force Base and the Ogden Arsenal led to a housing boom in the 1940s. By 1946 the population exceeded 3,600, and South Ogden became known as the \\"City of Homes.\\" The largest growth for the city came in the 1950s, at which time it grew by 150 percent. Because of this new growth, a new municipal building was constructed. The building also housed a fire station, and a new 1953 fire truck was purchased. Washington Boulevard was widened to four lanes south of 40th Street. Throughout the past forty years, residential growth has continued in the \\"City of Homes.\\" Businesses, schools, churches, fire and police departments, sewer and water lines continued to grow or to be expanded to serve the growing population. A new city hall was dedicated on December 8, 1983. Today, South Ogden boasts a comfortable balance of residential areas and business districts. Several small shopping centers, stores, movie theaters, medical offices, and dental offices are scattered throughout the city. The Frank M. Browning Center for the Boy Scouts of America, the Kiwanis Club, Utah Highway Patrol, and a division of the Utah Driver's License Bureau are located in South Ogden. Mormon pioneers settled the area, and the LDS Church is still well represented, with several chapels located in the city. The Greek Orthodox Church of the Transfiguration was consecrated on December 18, 1969; the Holy Family Catholic Church was dedicated on May 26, 1981; and a few smaller denominations are also housed in the city.

Much of the city is zoned for commercial development, particularly along the state highway on 1900 West (directly north of the larger community of Roy, Utah, for which 1900 West is the primary north‚Äìsouth main street), and around the 21st Street/Wilson Lane I-15 exit for Ogden and West Haven. A growing number of businesses are located in the commercial areas (including Wilson Lane and part of Midland Drive) from small shops, larger stores, vehicle sales, repair and service businesses, to small manufacturing operations to substantial enterprises such as steel fabrication. In general, the size and scope of new development projects has tended to increase since the city's founding. The predominant single-family home nature of the residential areas - many of which have been created as developments of various sizes - is being joined by more multi-story multi-family dwellings and condominiums. Some of the old rural nature survives in patches, including farm homes dating back well into the 19th Century, and there are still some working farms raising both crops and animals.

History The site that would eventually become Ferrisburgh was originally called Varenbrug, or 'Fern Bridge' by Dutch explorers from the colony of New Amsterdam.The Vermont Encyclopedia, p. 121 The Dutch operated a trading post at the site, doing business with French voyageurs and Native American merchants until it was abandoned during the course of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1673. The English burned the old Dutch trading post, and did not settle the area, which eventually became a meeting site for diverse peoples. The Abenaki and Iroquois nations maintained friendly relations at the site in the absence of European power.The Western Abenakis of Vermont, Collin G. Calloway, Norman: Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Press, p.92-4 The site would not be contested militarily again until the American Revolution, where it saw ancillary action leading up to the Battle of Hubbardton. Ferrisburgh was named for Benjamin Ferris, who applied for a charter in 1762. Although the Rokeby Museum tells the story of Ferrisburgh's long history in the abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad, Ferrisburgh sent many of its sons off to war during the American Civil War. Ferrisburghers made up roughly 10% of the \\"Old Brigade.\\"Gottfried, Bradley M., Brigades of Gettysburg, Da Capo Press, 2002, . Many wives and sisters from Ferrisburgh joined their husbands and brothers on the front lines as camp followers. Ferrisburgh women found themselves involved in rear guard action during the Battle of Gettysburg, as Confederate soldiers stormed Big Round Top. As Confederate pickets fired upon Union positions, Vermont women from Ferrisburgh were in the line of fire. Laura Fitzgerald, an Irish immigrant to Ferrisburgh, fired a musket towards the Confederate lines, causing the snipers to scatter. From 1917-1924, an art colony was formed in the town of Ferrisburgh, mostly consisting of dissident Middlebury College and University of Vermont faculty of arts members who disapproved of their respective administrations lack of funding for \\"degenerate arts,\\" associated with dadaism including photography of sculpture- making, portraiture of nude sculptors, portraiture of photography of still life, and post-revisionist allegorical thoughtscapes.Steve Shipp, American Art Colonies, 1850-1930: A Historical Guide to America's Original Art Colonies and their Artists, pp. 21-25. The art colony went by several lengthy and increasingly bizarre names, and is colloquially known as the Ferrisburgh Art Colony. Artists and provocateurs from around the greater New England region came to the colony to express appreciation for the more esoteric arts, as well as to hold more than one rally in support of radical politics.Ferrisburgh Beacon, Nov 7, 1922, \\"Artists Cheer New Italian Prime Minister.\\" Notable residents *Rachael Robinson Elmer, artist *Rowland Robinson, author Schools Ferrisburgh has one school, Ferrisburgh Central School, which has grades K to 6. Students then attend Vergennes Union High School. In 1961, Ferrisburgh was mentioned as a possible site for the relocation of Johnson State College, which had swelled to nearly 8,000 undergraduates. The plan was abandoned when the Town Clerk of Ferrisburgh, Walter Munger-Foy, held up the sale of 10 Acres of land in the western part of the town by purchasing it himself.

History Lincoln was chartered to Colonel Benjamin Simonds and 64 associates on November 9, 1780. Simonds, as commander of the Massachusetts militia, fought at the Battle of Bennington in 1777. He named the new town in honor of his commanding officer, Major General Benjamin Lincoln (1733‚Äì1810), who had played a vital role in getting the militia to Vermont. General Lincoln was respected and well liked by his contemporaries. Lincoln, like Ferrisburgh and several other Addison County towns, was settled by members of the Society of Friends, or Quakers. The first Quakers settled in an area known as Mud Flat about 1795. As time went by and other Quakers joined the original group, the area became known as Quaker Stand. The meeting house is gone and the Society has dispersed, but one part of Lincoln village is still called Quaker Street. Lincoln's town government was officially organized in 1798, when the first town meeting was held in the log cabin of early settler Jedediah Durfee. The Lincoln General Store in Lincoln Center, a main community hub. Until the latter part of the 20th century, Lincoln's economy had been centered around smallholder agriculture, ironworks, and mills. The earliest export products were potash and timber, sold by homesteading farmers after clearing their land. The town's population and economy peaked in the 1880s, when there were 15 lumber mills making shingles and clapboard operational in the town, employing around 100 men. Dairies and potato farming comprised a large remainder of the town's industry. Lincoln also grew to comprise the previous settlements of Downingsville and West, South, and Center Lincoln, bringing it to its present area of 44 square miles. The town's proximity to the New Haven River has caused numerous destructive floods in its history, in 1830, 1869, 1938, 1976 and 1998. In 1919, Lincoln-born businessman Walter S. Burnham left a significant endowment to the town in his will, resulting in the creation of the Burnham Trust, a fund intended to \\"be expended for educational, charitable, and musical purposes.\\" The Trust provided funding for the construction of Burnham Hall, a community meeting place and formerly the town library, as well as establishing a scholarship fund for future Lincoln students. Burnham Hall continues to be the site of Lincoln's town meeting. Burnham Hall in Lincoln, the town's central meeting place. Lincoln underwent a significant contraction in the mid-20th century, as its resource-based livelihoods dried up and families moved away. Dairy farms were unable to compete with larger, centralized enterprises elsewhere in the state and country. For Lincoln, the industry's death knell came in the 1980s, when the federal government offered to buy out smaller farms in an attempt to raise the price of milk and therefore make the industry more profitable; Lincoln's last dairy closed in 1992. Most of the mills and other industry also closed by the end of the century, though one pallet mill remains in operation. In 1968 Lincoln lost its post office (and thus its ZIP code) when postal services were transferred to Bristol. Today, Lincoln's population has rebounded almost to its historic peak. Its proximity to the Green Mountains, tranquility, and well-supported community services have made it attractive as a residential community. Most working age adults commute to jobs in neighboring towns, but Lincoln is still home to a general store, hotel, and multiple small-batch maple syrup producers.

History First Congregational Church in Orwell village After the construction of Fort Independence on Mount Independence in 1775, rebel soldiers bravely manned the lesser fortifications of the Vermont-side defenses. While those soldiers billeted at Fort Ticonderoga enjoyed comparatively splendid conditions in the French-style fort, Mount Independence proved a trying and difficult environment for its small cadre of revolutionary defenders, who frequently returned to their farms in the surrounding countryside to tend to their homesteads.The Vermont Encyclopedia, \\"Fort Independence\\" The fortress was passed between the British and Colonials, until it was eventually abandoned at the cessation of hostilities on the northern front of the war. Orwell enjoyed a time of peace and prosperity after the war's conclusion, marking a time of great emotional uprising and town glee. However, these bright times would be marred by several major tragedies that coincided with the attempted industrialization of the area's farmlands in the 1870s, when several young men were lost in a thresher accident near what is now the intersection of Main Street and Route 22A. This tragedy was keenly remembered by the community, which banned industrial farming later that year in a special town meeting. Industrialized farm equipment was only allowed back into Orwell after the economic collapse of the early 1900s, and even then, special restrictions were placed to limit the capabilities of such farm instruments. The town's law against the use of \\"Modern Farm Machinery of All Kinds\\" was never actually repealed, and continues to be a curio law on the books that the town refuses to repeal. Orwell attempted in the late 1990s to obtain a franchised fast-food restaurant, as a vital link in the food availability between Whitehall, New York, and Vergennes, Vermont, but the residents of the surrounding townships blocked the move, claiming it would upset the rural beauty of the western Vermont countryside.Orwell Examiner, June 9, 1998 Orwell is known as the Fortress of America.

It is the smallest of Vermont's nine cities in terms of population, though the city of Winooski covers a smaller area. It was the first city chartered in the state of Vermont. History Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes Vergennes was settled in 1766 by Donald MacIntosh. It was established as a city in 1788, the only one in Vermont not to have been first chartered as a town or independent village. Instead, intersecting portions of the pre-existing towns of New Haven, Panton and Ferrisburg at the Otter Creek Falls were combined to form Vergennes. It is the smallest city by population in Vermont. The city is named for Frenchman Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, who greatly aided the rebel colonial effort in the American Revolutionary War.City of Vergennes. (n.d.). City of Vergennes. Retrieved January 2, 2010. Here, Thomas Macdonough built and armed the fleet that defeated the British on Lake Champlain during the War of 1812. The Monkton Iron Company (which was at the time the largest iron works in the nation) manufactured the fittings for Macdonough's fleet, as well as most of the cannon shot used by the United States Army in the north. The ore used was mined in nearby Monkton. , , , and were built or refitted in Vergennes as a part of that fleet. Organizers chose a city form of municipal government in anticipation of developing the area as an industrial center. The Otter Creek Falls provided power for mills and factories, and the close access to the Lake Champlain waterway was ideal for transportation both north and south. Industry boomed in the late nineteenth century; in particular, shipping connected to the Champlain Canal and wood-finishing related to lumber imported from Canada. As railways supplanted and bypassed the canal system, manufacturing declined in the city. A railroad spur from Ferrisburgh to the base of the falls proved a failure, as the grades were too steep for practical operations. Commercial decline continued in the twentieth century, narrowing down to a few surviving companies. In the early years of the 21st century, a group of civic boosters and merchants improved the downtown area along Main Street and reconnected the city to its waterways. The resulting development, catering to tourists and transients, is hampered by centralization of land ownership and escalation of commercial rents.

The population was 2,031 at the 2010 census. Dorset is famous for being the location of Cephas Kent's Inn, where four meetings of the Convention that signed the Dorset Accords led to the independent Vermont Republic and future statehood. Dorset is the site of America's oldest marble quarry and is the birthplace of Bill W., co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. East Dorset is the site of the Wilson House and the Griffith Library. The town is named after the English county of Dorset. The East Dorset marble quarry had been established by Bill W.'s great grandfather and stayed in the family for three generations.

History The East Dorset Congregational Church in East Dorset, Vermont. Marble quarry in Dorset, Vermont, where some of the stones for the New York Public Library were quarried. Through a series of treaties, native tribes had surrendered title to large areas of land. Subsequently, the Provincial Governor of New Hampshire had provided land grants west of the Connecticut River in land that was also claimed by the Province of New York. Strife was created by New York attempting to enforce its legitimate claim to government on settlers who had in good faith purchased land titles from New Hampshire. The King upon the advice of the Privy Council decreed a settlement that was not followed by the Governor and Legislature of New York. Sandwiched between New York and New Hampshire, the area was constantly in dispute and claimed by both. New York claimed it was included in its 1664 grant from Charles II, but had made no effort to settle it. New Hampshire, desiring to expand its frontier to the west, simply expropriated the land and proceeded to grant 131 charters in the territory, which then became known as the New Hampshire Grants. New York retaliated by declaring the Grants null and void and telling the settlers they would have to repurchase the land from New York (at a much higher price) if they wished to stay. The New Hampshire Grantees countered by organizing the \\"Green Mountain Boys\\", an informal alliance of civilian soldiers who successfully prevented the settlers from being evicted. To protect their investments in the land and improvements, and the health and security of their families, farms and towns, the people of the New Hampshire Grants formed Committees of Safety to coordinate protection of their society. These committees predated those of the 13 colonies formed to protect themselves from the crown by eight years, yet had precedents in similar organizations during the French and Indian War. Born in Connecticut, Cephas Kent moved himself and his family to Dorset in 1773. He was a deacon in a local church. He owned and operated a small tavern, destined to play a part in Vermont's history. By 1775, the land control controversy had reached the point that the Grantees decided to take official action, and they held a general convention in Cephas Kent's tavern. Matters discussed at that meeting were not limited to their internal affairs but also included the general cause of American independence. The Continental Congress had voted to pay the Green Mountain Boys for their services and had asked that a regiment be formed in the New Hampshire Grants. The Grantees wanted to join in the general rebellion but not as a part of New Hampshire and certainly not as a part of New York. So they petitioned the Continental Congress to intervene in their behalf against New York and permit the Grantees to serve independently in the war of rebellion. The Grantees met three more times during the course of the next year, always in Cephas Kent's tavern, and on 25 June 1776 voted \\"that application be made to the inhabitants of said Grants to form the same into a separate district.\\" Later that day the convention bound itself \\"to defend by arms the United American States against the hostile attempts of the British fleet and armies until the present unhappy controversy between the two countries shall be settled.\\" This was the first official step toward Vermont's independence. Thus, the future state of Vermont was underway. The town of Windsor claims to be the birthplace of Vermont, and, indeed, it was there, on 2 July 1777, that the constitution was adopted and the name chosen. But it was in Dorset at Cephas Kent's tavern that the idea of Vermont was born; and, as Zephine Humphrey put it, \\"The idea is the dynamic reality and the fact its shadow.\\" In 1790, New York finally relinquished her claims and, on 18 February 1791, Congress admitted Vermont as the fourteenth state. In 1912 the Vermont Society of Colonial Dames erected an historical marker at the site of the Cephas Kent Inn in Dorset. The agreements made at Cephas Kent's tavern are commonly known as the Dorset Accords. Geography Dorset is located along the northern border of Bennington County, with Rutland County on the north. The Taconic Mountains occupy the central and western 3/4 of the town, with the Valley of Vermont on the east side of town separating the Taconics from the Green Mountains to the east. The communities of East Dorset, Freedleyville, and North Dorset are all in the Valley of Vermont, along U.S. Route 7, as is Emerald Lake State Park. Dorset and South Dorset are located in the western and southern parts of the town, respectively, along Vermont Route 30 in a valley between two portions of the Taconic Range. Mount Aeolus is located in the southern part of the town between South Dorset and East Dorset. Dorset Mountain rises in the northern part of the town, with its summit (Dorset Peak) located just north of the town line in Danby. A subsidiary peak is located in Dorset proper. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.27%, is water. The height of land in the Valley of Vermont between the Hudson River and Lake Champlain watersheds is located in Dorset. The Batten Kill rises just north of East Dorset and flows south into Manchester, then west to the Hudson in New York. The Otter Creek, one of the longest rivers entirely in Vermont, rises a short distance north of the Batten Kill's source and flows north through Emerald Lake and into Rutland County, eventually reaching Lake Champlain north of Vergennes.

The town was unincorporated by an act of the state legislature in 1937, and is now essentially a ghost town. The population was eight at the 2010 census. Along with Somerset, Glastenbury is one of two Vermont towns where the population levels have dropped so low that the town is unincorporated. The town has no local government and the town's affairs are handled by a state-appointed supervisor. Geography Glastenbury is located in central Bennington County and is bordered by the town of Sunderland to the north, Shaftsbury to the west, Woodford to the south, and Somerset in Windham County to the east. Most of the town is part of the Green Mountain National Forest. The highest point in town, near the town's geographic center, is Glastenbury Mountain. The Long Trail and Appalachian Trail traverse the town from its north to south border, following the crest of the Green Mountains. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History Glastenbury was first chartered in 1761 by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth, but settlers did not begin trickling into this rocky, forbidding mountainous area for some years after. At the time of Vermont's first census as a new state in 1791, only six families inhabited it. These first settlers found life on Glastenbury Mountain difficult, as would residents ever after, and by 1800 they had been replaced by eight entirely different families. Of these eight, only three would stay on until the next census ten years later, and only one of these would remain in later decades. Despite the many hardships that greeted Glastenbury settlers, newcomers continued to arrive in small numbers, and the population grew slowly to 76 in 1810. But the years following 1810 were hard ones for all of Vermont, and by 1840 there were only 53 left in Glastenbury. After the Civil War, Glastenbury finally began to experience more rapid growth. Business interests in nearby Bennington were eager to take advantage of the vast timber resources there, and by 1872 had finally begun construction on a railroad (trolley) which ran up the mountain. The line ran along Bolles Brook and terminated at the place where the brook forked. It was an improbable achievement, with some parts of the line climbing as much as in altitude per mile. Remains of the old trolley tracks can still be seen today. Meanwhile, the population had grown to 199 in 1870, and to 241 in 1880. This includes only the enumerated population; there were many more transient workers who were drawn to the mountain to work in the then-booming logging business. Two additional sawmills were built in the 1870s, one at the original settlement, called Fayville, and one at the new settlement at the railroad terminus, which became known as South Glastenbury. Dozens of kilns were built at South Glastenbury for converting the lumber to charcoal; at this time Glastenbury was one of the three foremost sites in Vermont for producing the charcoal which was feeding iron production in nearby Shaftsbury and in Troy, New York. By the late 1880s, however, the mountain had been cleared of nearly all of its mature trees, and the town's economy dipped dramatically. In 1889 the railroad operation ceased. It was revived briefly in 1894 as an electric passenger trolley run by the Bennington & Woodford Railroad, and a brief and initially promising effort was made to convert South Glastenbury to a tourist attraction. A small fortune was spent to convert the area into a mountain resort area which opened in the summer of 1898. Unfortunately, a freshet wiped out the railroad tracks that winter, marking the beginning of the end of Glastenbury as a functioning town. Population dwindled in the early twentieth century, down to only seven in 1937, when the legislature unincorporated the town. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 16 people, 6 households, and 4 families residing in the town. The population density was 0.4 people per square mile (0.1/km2). There were 11 housing units at an average density of 0.2 per square mile (0.1/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 93.75% White and 6.25% from two or more races.

The population was 375 at the 2010 census. Originally known as Bromley, the town name was changed to \\"Peru\\" by the land grantees as a way of attracting land buyers to an area that had been described as of \\"trees, bears and mountain lions\\".  History  The town was chartered with the name Bromley in 1761 by Benning Wentworth, governor of the Province of New Hampshire. The first white settlement is said to have been in 1773, by William Barlow of Woodstock, Connecticut. The town of Bromley was organized at a town meeting in March 1802. As of the autumn of 1802 there were 14 families living in the town. In late 1803 or early 1804 the name of the town was changed to Peru. The new name was adopted to attract more people to the town by associating it with the South American province of Peru, which was considered to be a place of great wealth, apparently due to the rich silver mining industry there. Geography Peru is located in northeastern Bennington County, bordered by Rutland County to the north. The crest of the Green Mountains runs from north to the south through the western half of the town, traversed by the Long Trail/Appalachian Trail. Bromley Mountain and its ski area are in the southern part of the town, and Styles Peak and Peru Peak are to the north.

As of the 2010 census, the town population was 3,527. The town of Pownal includes the villages of Pownal, North Pownal, and Pownal Center. History During the Woodland period, the area was settled by the Mahican people, with others, such as the Mohawks, traveling across it. By the late 17th century, Europeans may have entered the area as a result of the establishment of the Dutch patroonship owned by Kiliaen van Rensselaer, the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, which extended west and east out of Albany and the fur trading community of Beverwyck. The southwestern corner of Pownal was part of the patroonship. Rensselaerswyck passed into English control in 1664. The first European settlers may have entered the area in the 1730s.Hayward's New England Gazetteer of 1839 Those settlers may have been Dutch or other Europeans who leased land within Rensselaerwyck. On January 28, 1760, New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth chartered Pownal, which he named after his fellow royal governor, Thomas Pownall of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 Thereafter, settlers, primarily of English descent, began to arrive from Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. In 1766, 185 male heads of households in Pownal sent a petition to George III, asking that their land claims be recognized and that the fees required to do so be waived. Since Wentworth had granted to settlers land that the Province of New York also claimed, legal and physical conflicts broke out between \\"Yorkers\\" and settlers in the New Hampshire Grants (or \\"The Grants\\"). As a result, a number of Pownal residents joined the Green Mountain Boys under Ethan Allen. By the American Revolution, the town was deeply divided between \\"Yankees\\" and the Tories, those sympathetic to England, each of whom considered himself or herself a Loyalist. Tories were often arrested and imprisoned. These tensions were strong enough that when British General John Burgoyne's Saratoga campaign brought conflict to the area, Vermonters fought on both sides. William Card, originally of Rhode Island, fought for the British at the Battle of Bennington along with four of his sons: Jonathan, Elisha, Philo (or possible Peleg), and Stephen.National Archives of Canada, WO 28/10, Reel B-2867, pp. 17‚Äì18. Found on the NY GenWeb Rensselaer County, The Loyalist Muster Roll of 1777 by Capt Samuel McKay at Chateauguay, Quebec, 20TH DECEMBER 1777. The battle, a virtually complete American victory, resulted in the capture of the elder Card and all four of his sons, but they were soon released. Three years later, William Card's grandsons Thomas and Jonathan would serve in a Vermont Patriot regiment.HeritageQuest Revolutionary War Papers Series: M805 Roll: 160 Image: 31 File: S12447 Pages: 1-7 and Series: M805 Roll: 160 Image: 89 File: S10430 Pages: 1-8 By the end of the Revolution, most Tories had fled Pownal for safety among the United Empire Loyalists who resettled in Canada. The novel Memoir of a Green Mountain Boy starts and ends in Pownal during the early years of the Revolution. The Mooar-Wright House in 1909, one of the oldest houses in Vermont The oldest house in both Pownal and Vermont is the Mooar- Wright House, possibly built in the 1750s. Some think it may have been built by John Defoe (or DeVoet), a Tory who was imprisoned in 1776, escaped, fought on the side of the British and Hessian forces at the Battle of Bennington, was captured, escaped again, and settled in Canada. Others believe the Mooar- Wright house was built by Charles Wright in 1765. Pownal citizens have long prided themselves on their independent spirit. In 1789, a touring minister, the Rev. Nathan Perkins, described the town this way: \\" . . . Pawnal ye first town, poor land ‚Äì very unpleasant ‚Äì very uneven ‚Äì miserable set of inhabitants ‚Äì no religion, Rhode Island haters of religion ‚Äì Baptists, quakers, & some Presbyterians ‚Äì no meeting house.\\" Today Pownal has five churches. The oldest church, Pownal Center Community Church, was organized in 1794 as the Union Church, serving both Baptists and Methodists, and open to any denomination. The first church was a log structure. It was replaced in 1849 by the present church, jointly owned by the town and church. This church has a unique history as it was deeded to the Town and three members of the church as part of gleebe lands by the King of England. Addie Card, child laborer, from a 1910 photograph by Lewis Hine. In 1851, Chester Arthur (later to become President of the United States), was appointed principal to an academy for boys. The academy prepared boys for college (and became the foundation for Arthur's future path to study law).New York Times Future President James Garfield also taught in North Pownal. Both cotton mills and woolen mills operated during the 19th century. The wool industry reached its peak between 1820 and 1840, though farmers continued to raise sheep until the 20th century. On the Hoosic River in North Pownal, an 18th-century gristmill was replaced by a woolen mill that operated from 1849 until 1863, when it burned. The Plunkett & Barber Co. Mill, built in 1866, served as a cotton mill until 1930, becoming a tannery in 1937. It closed in 1988. Remediated as a Superfund site, the mill site is planned to become a recreation area. During the early part of the 20th century, Lewis Hine documented child labor in the mills. His photograph of twelve-year-old Addie Card, entitled \\"Anemic Little Spinner in North Pownal Cotton Mill, North Pownal, Vermont, August 1910\\", was featured on the U.S. stamp commemorating the passage of the first child labor laws (see the Keating‚ÄìOwen Act). Elizabeth Winthrop has written a novel, Counting on Grace, inspired by Addie's photograph and life. The Berkshire Street Railway Company began trolley service from Williamstown to Bennington via Pownal on June 27, 1907. Service was discontinued in 1927. The brick power station still stands along Route 7. Lime quarries operated in North Pownal until 1936. A rail car line extended from the southernmost quarry to the mill on the west side of Route 346, where the stone was crushed and packaged for shipment. The Green Mountain Race Track opened in 1963. The track offered both thoroughbred and standardbred horse racing until 1977, and greyhound racing from 1976 to 1992. Since closing as a racetrack, the site has hosted live events occasionally, including a rock concert in the Lollapalooza series in 1996, and antique car shows from 2005 to 2008. Camp Ilium The YMCA's Camp Ilium was in Pownal. Ilium is notable because on September 10, 1910, S. F. Lester of Troy, New York, became the very first person to hold the Scouting leadership position of Scoutmaster (approved by the BSA). He received his certification from the BSA headquarters in New York City. In 1910 he led a group of 30 scouts to the camp. Camp Ilium was the starting point of the Boy Scout Movement for Pownal and Troy, New York.

History Erastus FairbanksHorace Fairbanks The town of Barnet, Vermont, originally took its name from the town of Barnet, England. On September 16, 1763, the town received its charter from the royal governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth. The first European descendants to work the land and stay in the town were three brothers, Daniel, Jacob, and Elijah Hall, along with Jonathan Fowler. Their homestead was built along the Connecticut River and to the north near McIndoe Falls. Elijah Hall built the first house in Caledonia County in Barnet, near the base of Stevens Falls. Colonel Alexander Harvey came from Dundee, Scotland, for those in the town who wished to find new land in the American colonies. Despite losing contact with almost all of them after the American Revolution broke out, he decided to stay, claiming of land and a lake, now known as Harvey's Lake. Two governors of the state of Vermont were from Barnet: Erastus Fairbanks, who served two terms from 1852‚Äì1853 and 1860‚Äì1861, and his son, Horace Fairbanks, who served from 1876 to 1878. The Fairbanks family left Barnet for nearby St. Johnsbury, where they were known for manufacturing the first platform scale. Ocean explorer and scuba inventor Jacques Cousteau had influential experiences on Harvey's Lake as a young boy in the early 1920s. While attending a summer camp he experimented with staying underwater by breathing through hollow reeds found in the lake shallows. Though he could not yet swim well, this allowed him to stay underwater for extended periods. ReligionChristianity= On January 24, 1784, the town of Barnet voted unanimously to make the Presbyterian denomination the official one of the town, as it was \\"founded on the word of God as expressed in the Confession of Faith, Catechisms Longer and Shorter, with the form of church government agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, and practiced by the Church of Scotland.\\" The United Presbyterian Church was established by Reverend John Huston in 1786. The Passumpsic Calvinistic Baptist church was first created by a council of neighboring churches on July 1, 1812. The village of Passumpsic was chosen due to its centralized location. The First Congregational Church of Barnet was created by Reverend David Sutherland in September 1829 after a new brick church had been built. Its first permanent minister was the Reverend Henry Fairbanks. The church which stands now was constructed in 1854. The earliest Reformed Presbyterian Church in Vermont was organized in Ryegate in October 1798. In the early part of the nineteenth century, a group of members in Barnet built a new meeting house on the land formerly owned by Walter Harvey, and the property has gone by that name since then. The longest-tenured minister was Daniel C. Faris, who served the congregation from 1873 until 1923.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~vtcbarne/barnet_churches.htm#WH Ecclesiastical History of the town of Barnet, Vermont The congregation's Barnet branch became a separate congregation on July 9, 1872,Glasgow, W.

He spent most of his life working as a civil servant in various capacities. After the death of poet Nikolay Nekrasov he acted as editor of the well-known Russian magazine, Otechestvenniye Zapiski, until the government banned it in 1884. His best-known work, the novel The Golovlyov Family, appeared in 1876. Biography Mikhail Saltykov was born on 27 January 1826 in the village of Spas-Ugol (modern-day Taldomsky District of the Moscow Oblast of Russia) as one of the eight children (five brothers and three sisters) in the large Russian noble family of Yevgraf Vasilievich Saltykov (1776‚Äî1851) and Olga Mikhaylovna Saltykova (n√©e Zabelina) (1801‚Äî1874). His father belonged to an ancient Saltykov noble house that originated as one of the branches of the Morozov boyar family.Princes, Grafs and noble Saltykov families article from Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1890‚Äî1907 (in Russian) According to the Velvet Book, it was founded by Mikhail Ignatievich Morozov nicknamed Saltyk (from the Old Church Slavonic word \\"saltyk\\" meaning \\"one's own way/taste\\"Saltyk from the Dahl's Explanatory Dictionary.

October 4, 1803 (in Russian) It gave birth to many important political figures throughout history, including the tsaritsa of Russia Praskovia Saltykova and her daughter, the Empress of Russia Anna Ioannovna.

Collection of Works in 20 Volumes. Volume 17. ‚Äî Leningrad: Khudozhestvennaya Literatura, p. 548, 9Vladimir Saitov, Boris Modzalevskiy (1907). Moscow Necropolis. Volume 1. ‚Äî Saint Petersburg, p. 454 (in Russian) At the time of Mikhail Saltykov's birth, Yevgraf was fifty years old, while Olga was twenty five. Mikhail spent his early years on his parents' large estate in Spasskoye on the border of the Tver and Yaroslavl governorates, in the Poshekhonye region. \\"In my childhood and teenage years I witnessed serfdom at its worst. It saturated all strata of social life, not just the landlords and the enslaved masses, degrading all classes, privileged or otherwise, with its atmosphere of a total lack of rights, when fraud and trickery were the order of the day, and there was an all-pervading fear of being crushed and destroyed at any moment,\\" he remembered, speaking through one of the characters of his later work Old Years in Poshekhonye. Life in the Saltykov family was equally difficult. Dominating the weak, religious father was despotic mother whose intimidating persona horrified the servants and her own children. This atmosphere was later recreated in Shchedrin's novel The Golovlyov Family, and the idea of \\"the devastating effect of legalized slavery upon the human psyche\\" would become one of the prominent motifs of his prose. Olga Mikhaylovna, though, was a woman of many talents; having perceived some in Mikhail, she treated him as her favorite. The Saltykovs often quarreled; they gave their children neither love nor care and Mikhail, despite enjoying relative freedom in the house, remembered feeling lonely and neglected. Another thing Saltykov later regretted was his having been completely shut out from nature in his early years: the children lived in the main house and were rarely allowed to go out, knowing their \\"animals and birds only as boiled and fried.\\" Characteristically, there were few descriptions of nature in the author's works. Education 19th century drawing of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where Saltykov studied Mikhail's early education was desultory, but, being an extraordinarily perceptive boy, by the age of six he spoke French and German fluently. He was taught to read and write Russian by the serf painter Pavel Sokolov and a local clergyman, and became an avid reader, later citing the Gospel, which he read at the age of eight, as a major influence. Among his childhood friends was Sergey Yuriev, the son of a neighbouring landlord and later a prominent literary figure, editor and publisher of the magazines Russkaya Mysl and Beseda. In 1834 his elder sister Nadezhda graduated from the Moscow Ekaterininsky college, and Mikhail's education from then on was the prerogative of her friend Avdotya Vasilevskaya, a graduate of the same institute who had been invited to the house as a governess. Mikhail's other tutors included the local clergyman Ivan Vasilievich who taught the boy Latin and the student Matvey Salmin. At the age of ten Saltykov joined the third class of the Moscow Institute for sons of the nobility (Dvoryansky institute), skipping the first two classes, where he studied until 1838. He then enrolled in the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in Saint Petersburg, spending the next six years there. Prince Aleksey Lobanov-Rostovsky, afterwards the Minister Of Foreign Affairs, was one of his schoolfellows. In the lyceum the quality of education was poor. \\"The information taught to us was scant, sporadic and all but meaningless... It was not so much an education as such, but a part of social privilege, the one that draws the line through life: above are you and me, people of leisure and power, beneath - just one single word: muzhik,\\" Saltykov wrote in his Letters to Auntie.Goryachkina, –ú.S. –ú.–ï.Saltykov-Shchedrin. The Selected Works. Critical and biographical essay. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow. 1954. Pp. 5-24 While at the lyceum Saltykov started writing poetry and translated works from Lord Byron and Heinrich Heine. He was proclaimed an 'heir to Pushkin' - after the local tradition which demanded that each course should have one. His first poem, \\"The Lyre\\", a hymn to the great Russian poet, was published by Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya in 1841. Eight more of Saltykov's verses made their way into Sovremennik in 1844-1845. At the time he was attending Mikhail Yazykov's literary circle, which was occasionally visited by Vissarion Belinsky. The latter's articles and essays made a great impression on Mikhail. Upon graduating the Lyceum in 1844, Saltykov, who was one of the best students, was promoted directly to the chancellery of the Ministry of Defense. This success upset Mikhail, as it ended his dream of attending Saint Petersburg University. The same year he became involved with Otechestvennye zapiski and Sovremennik, reviewing for both magazines children's literature and textbooks. His criticism was sharp, and Belinsky's influence on it was evident.The Works of M.E.Saltykov-Shedrin in 20 Volumes. Moscow, 1975. Vol. 17. P.331 At this time Saltykov became a follower of the Socialist ideas coming from France. \\"Brought up by Belinsky's articles, I naturally drifted towards the Westernizers' camp, but not to the major trend of it which was dominant in Russian literature at the time, promoting German philosophy, but to this tiny circle that felt instinctively drawn towards France - the country of Saint-Simon, Fourier... and, in particular, George Sand... Such sympathies only grew stronger after 1848,\\" he later remembered. Saltykov befriended literary critic Valerian Maykov and economist and publicist Vladimir Milyutin, and became close to the Petrashevsky circle. \\"How easily we lived and what deep faith we had in the future, what single-mindedness and unity of hopes there was, giving us life!\\" he later remembered, calling Mikhail Petrashevsky \\"a dear, unforgettable friend and teacher.\\"The Works of M.E.Saltykov-Shedrin in 20 Volumes. Moscow, 1975. Vol. 17. P.228 Literary career Saltykov's house in Vyatka (now a museum in Kirov) In 1847 Saltykov debuted with his first novella Contradictions (under the pseudonym M.Nepanov), the title referring to the piece's main motif: the contrast between one's noble ideals and the horrors of real life. It was followed by A Complicated Affair (1848), a social novella, reminiscent of Gogol, both in its plotlines and the natures of its characters, dealing with social injustice and the inability of an individual to cope with social issues. The novella was praised by Nikolai Dobrolyubov who wrote: \\"It is full of heartfelt sympathy for destitute men... awakening in one humane feelings and manly thoughts,\\" and Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who referred to it as a book \\"that has created a stir and is of much interest to people of the new generation.\\" It was the publication of Contradictions that caused Saltykov's banishment to Vyatka, - apparently the result of overreaction from the authorities in response to the French Revolution of 1848. On 26 April 1848, Tsar Nicholas I signed the order for the author's arrest and deportation. In his first few months of exile Saltykov was mainly occupied with copying official documents. Then he was made a special envoy of the Vyatka governor; his major duty in this capacity was making inquiries concerning brawls, cases of minor bribery, embezzlement and police misdoings. Saltykov made desperate attempts to break free from what he called his 'Vyatka captivity', but after each of his requests he received the standard reply: \\"would be premature.\\" He became more and more aware of the possibility that he'd have to spend the rest of his life there. \\"The very thought of that is so repellent that it makes by hair bristle,\\" he complained in a letter to his brother.The Works of M.E.Saltykov-Shchedrin in 20 Volumes. Moscow, 1975. Vol. 1. P.111 It helped that the local elite treated Saltykov with great warmth and sympathy; he was made a welcome guest in many respectable houses, including that of vice- governor Boltin whose daughter Elizaveta Apollonovna later became Saltykov's wife. While in Vyatka Saltykov got carried away by the idea of radically improving the quality of education for young women and girls. There were no decent history textbooks at the time in Russia, so he decided to write one himself. Called A Brief History of Russia, it amounted to 40 handwritten pages of compact text compiled from numerous sources. He worked on it while on vacation in a village near Tver, sending it to Vyatka to be published as a series. As the numerous members of the Petrashevsky Circle were arrested in 1848, Saltykov got summoned to the capital to give evidence on his involvement in the group's activity. There he managed to convince the authorities that 'spreading harm' was not his intention and safely returned to Vyatka. In the summer of 1850 he became a councillor of the local government which implied long voyages through the province on official business, many of them having to do with issues concerning the Old Believers. As an investigator, he traveled throughout the Vyatka, Perm, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Yaroslavl governorates. In 1850 he became the organizer of the Vyatka agricultural exhibition, one of the largest in the country. All this provided Saltykov with priceless material for his future satires. =Provincial Sketches= Saltykov-Shchedrin in 1850s In 1855 Tzar Nikolai I died and the climate in the country instantly changed. In November 1855 Saltykov received the permission to leave Vyatka, the new governor Lanskoy rumoured to be the major assisting force behind this. In January 1856 the writer returned to Saint Petersburg and in February was assigned to the Interior Ministry. By this time many of the stories and essays that would be known as Provincial Sketches have been written, a series of narratives about the fictitious town of Krutogorsk, shown as a symbol of Russian serfdom. Ivan Turgenev who happened to read them first was unimpressed and, following his advice (and bearing in mind still fierce censorship) Nikolai Nekrasov refused to publish the work in Sovremennik. In August 1856 Mikhail Katkov‚Äôs The Russian Messenger started publishing Provincial Sketches, signed N.Shchedrin. The book, charged with anti-serfdom pathos and full of scathing criticism of provincial bureaucracy became instant success and made Saltykov famous. Many critics and colleagues called him the heir to Nikolai Gogol. \\"I‚Äôm in awe... Oh immortal Gogol, you must now be a happy man now to see such a genius emerging as your follower,\\" Taras Shevchenko wrote in his diary.Shevchenko, T.G. The Selected Works in 5 Volumes. Moscow, 1956. Vol.5 P. 120 In 1857 Sovremennik at last reacted: both Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky rather belatedly praised Saltykov, characteristically, imparting to his work what it's never had: \\"aiming at the undermining the Empire's foundations.\\" In 1857 The Russian Messenger published The Death of Pazukhin, a play which was quite in tune with Provincial Sketches. The production of it was banned with characteristic verdict of censors: \\"Characters presented there are set to prove our society lies in the state of total moral devastation.\\" Another of Saltykov‚Äôs plays, Shadows (1862‚Äì1865), about careerism and immorality of bureaucracy, has been discovered in archives and published only in 1914, when it was premiered on stage too. Contrary to left radicals' attempt to draw Saltykov closer to their camp, \\"undermining the Empire foundations\\" were not his aim at all and on his return to Saint Petersburg he was soon promoted to administrative posts of considerable importance. His belief was that \\"all honest men should help the government in defeating serfdom apologist still clinging to their rights.\\" Huge literary success has never made him think of retiring from work in the government. Partly reasons for his return to the state service were practical. In 1856 Saltykov married Elizaveta Boltina, daughter of a Vyatka vice-governor and found, on the one hand, his mother's financial support curtailed, on the other, his own needs risen sharply. Up until 1858 Saltykov continued working in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Then after making a report on the condition of the Russian police, he was appointed deputy governor of Ryazan where later he's got a nickname \\"the vice-Robespierre\\". On April 15, 1858, Saltykov arrived to Ryazan very informally, in an ordinary road carriage, which amazed the local 'society' for whom he'd been known already as Provincial Sketches author. He settled in a small house, often visited people and received guests. Saltykov's primary goal was to teach local minor officials elementary grammar and he spent many late evenings proof-reading and re-writing their incongruous reports. In 1862 Saltykov was transferred to Tver where he often performed governor's functions. Here Saltykov proved to be a zealous promoter of the 1861 reforms. He personally sued several landowners accusing them of cruel treatment of peasants. All the while his literary activities continued. In 1860-1862 he wrote and published (mostly, in Vremya magazine) numerous sketches and short stories, some later included into Innocent Stories (1857‚Äì1863) which demonstrated what Maxim Gorky later called a \\"talent for talking politics through domesticities\\" and Satires In Prose (1859‚Äì1862) where for the first time the author seemed to be quite vexed with the apathy of the oppressed. \\"One is hardly to be expected to engage oneself in self-development when one's only thought revolves around just one wish: not to die of hunger,\\" he later explained. Many of Saltykov's articles on agrarian reforms were also written in those three years, mostly in Moskovskye Vedomosty, where his major opponent was journalist Vladimir Rzhevsky. =Sovremennik= Mikhail Saltykov c. 1870 In 1862 Saltykov retired from the government service and came to Moscow with the view of founding his own magazine there. The Ministry of Education's Special committee under the chairmanship of Prince D.A.Obolensky gave him no such permission. In the early 1863 Saltykov moved to Saint Petersburg to join Nekrasov's Sovremennik, greatly undermined by the death of Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky's arrest. In this magazine he published first sketches of the Pompadours cycle and got involved with Svistok (The Whistle), a satirical supplement, using pseudonyms N.Shchedrin, K.Turin and Mikhail Zmiev-Mladentsev. The series of articles entitled Our Social Life (1863‚Äì1864), examining ‚Äúnew tendencies in Russian nihilism,‚Äù caused a raw with equally radical Russkoye Slovo. First Saltykov ridiculed Dmitry Pisarev's unexpected call for Russian intelligentsia to pay more attention to natural sciences. Then in 1864 Pisarev responded by \\"Flowers of Innocent Humor\\" article published by Russkoye Slovo implying that Saltykov was cultivating \\"laughter for good digestion's sake\\". The latter's reply contained accusations in isolationism and elitism. All this (along with heated discussion of Chernyshevsky's novel What Is to Be Done?) was termed \\"raskol in Russian nihilism\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. On the other front, Saltykov waged a war against the Dostoyevsky brothers‚Äô Grazhdanin magazine. When Fyodor Dostoyevsky came out with the suggestion that with Dobrolyubov's death and Chernyshevsky‚Äôs imprisonment the radical movement in Russia became lifeless and dogmatic, Saltykov labeled him and his fellow pochvenniks 'reactionaries'. Finally, the rift between him and Maxim Antonovich (supported by Grigory Eliseev) made Saltykov-Schedrin quit the journal. Only a small part of stories and sketches that Saltykov wrote at the time has made its way into his later books (Innocent Stories, Sign of the Time, Pompadours). Being dependent on his Sovremenniks meagre salaries, Saltykov was looking for work on the side and quarreled with Nekrasov a lot, promising to quit literature. According to Avdotya Panayeva's memoirs, \\"those were the times when his moods darkened, and I noticed a new habit of his developing - this jerky movement of neck, as if he was trying to free himself from some unseen tie, the habit which stayed with him for the rest of his life.\\" Finally, pecuniary difficulties compelled Saltykov to re-enter the governmental service and in November 1864 he was appointed the head of the treasury department in Penza. Two years later he moved to take the same post in Tula, then Ryazan. Supported by his lyceum friend Mikhail Reitern, now the Minister of Finance, Saltykov adopted rather aggressive finance revision policies, making many enemies in the administrative circles of Tula, Ryazan and Penza. According to Alexander Skabichevsky (who's had conversations with provincial officials working under Saltykov's supervision) \\"he was a rare kind of boss. Even though his frightful barking was making people wince, nobody feared him and everybody loved him - mostly for his caring for his subordinates' needs and also the tendency to overlook people's minor weaknesses and faults when those were not interfering with work.\\" Finally the governor of Ryazan made an informal complaint which was accounted for by Count Shuvalov, the Chief of Staff of the Special Corps of Gendarmes, who issued a note stating that Saltykov, as a senior state official \\"promoted ideas contradicting the needs of maintaining law and order\\" and was \\"always in conflict with people of local governments, criticizing and even sabotaging their orders.\\" On July 14, 1868, Saltykov retired: thus the career of \\"one of the strangest officials in Russian history\\" ended. Years later, speaking to the historian M.Semevsky, Saltykov confessed he was trying to erase from memory years spent as a government official. But when his vis-a- vis argued that \\"only his thorough knowledge of every possible stage of the Russian bureaucratic hierarchy made him what he was,\\" the writer had to agree.–ú.–ï.Saltykov-Shchedrin Remembered by Contemporaries. Vol.1 P. 184 =Otechestvennye Zapiski= Mikhail Saltykov's portrait by Nikolai Ge, 1872. On July 1, 1866, Sovremennik was closed. In the autumn Nekrasov approached the publisher Andrey Krayevsky and 'rented' Otechestvennye Zapiski. In September 1868 Saltykov joined the re-vamped team of the magazine as a head of the journalistic department. As in December 1874 Saltykov's health problems (triggered by severe cold he's caught at his mother's funeral) made him travel abroad for treatment, Nekrasov confessed in his April 1875 letter to Pavel Annenkov: \\"This journalism thing has always been tough for us and now it lies in tatters. Saltykov carried it all manly and bravely and we all tried our best to follow suit.\\" \\"This was the only magazine that had its own face‚Ä¶ Most talented people were coming to Otechestvennye Zapiski as if it were their home. They trusted my taste and my common sense never to begrudge my editorial cuts. In \\"OZ\\" there were published weak things, but stupid things - never,\\" he wrote in a letter to Pavel Annenkov on May 28, 1884. In 1869 Saltykov's Signs of the Times and Letters About the Province came out, their general idea being that the reforms have failed and Russia remained the same country of absolute monarchy where peasant had no rights. \\"The bars have fallen but Russia's heart gave not a single twitch. Serfdom has been abolished, but landlords rejoiced,\\" he wrote. In 1870 The History of a Town came out - a grotesque, politically risky novel relating the tragicomic history of the fictitious Foolsville, a vague caricature upon the Russian Empire, with its sequence of monstrous rulers, tormenting their hapless vassals. The book was a satire on the whole institution of Russian statehood and the way of life itself, plagued by routine mismanagement, needless oppression, pointless tyranny and sufferers‚Äô apathy. The novel ended with the deadly tornado sweeping the whole thing away, \\"making the history stop\\" which was construed by many as a call for radical political change. A series called Messieurs et Mesdames Pompadours (also known as Pompadours and Pompadouresses, 1863‚Äì1874) looked like a satellite to the History of a Town, a set of real life illustrations to the fantastic chronicles. The History of a Town caused much controversy. Alexey Suvorin accused the author of deliberately distorting Russian history and insulting the Russian people. \\"By showing how people live under the yoke of madness I was hoping to invoke in a reader not mirth but most bitter feelings... It is not the history of the state as a whole that I make fun of, but a certain state of things,\\" Saltykov explained. In 1873 came out The Tashkenters Clique (Gospoda Tashkentsy: Tashkent‚Äôers was a generic term invented by Shchedrin for administrators sent to tame riots in the remote regions of the Russian Empire), a snipe at right-wingers who advocated cruel suppression of peasants' riots, and an experiment in the new form of social novel. 1877 saw the publication of In the Spheres of Temperance and Accuracy, a set of satirical sketches, featuring characters from the classical Russian literature (books by Fonvizin, Griboyedov, Gogol and others) in the contemporary political context. Later years Saltykov in 1880 The Well-Meant Speeches (Blagonamerennyie retchi, 1876) featured characters belonging to new Russian bourgeoisie. On January 2, 1881, Saltykov wrote to the lawyer and author Evgeny Utin: \\"I took a look at the family, the state, the property and found out that none of such things exist. And that those very principles for the sake of which freedoms have been granted, were not respected as principles any more, even by those who seemed to hold them.\\" The Well-Meant Speeches initially contained several stories about the Golovlyov family. In 1880 Saltykov-Shchedrin extracted all of them to begin a separate book which evolved into his most famous novel, showing the stagnation of the land-based dvoryanstvo. The Golovlyov Family (Gospoda Golovlyovy, 1880; also translated as House of Greed or A Family of Noblemen), a crushingly gloomy study of the institution of the family as cornerstone of society, traced the moral and physical decline of three generations of a Russian gentry family. Central to it was the figure of Porfiry 'Little Judas' Golovlyov, a character whose nickname (Iudushka, in Russian transcription) became synonymous with mindless hypocrisy and self- destructive egotism, leading to moral degradation and disintegration of personality. In the 1870s Saltykov sold his Moscow estate and bought the one near Oranienbaum, Saint Petersburg, which he came to refer to as 'my Mon Repos'. He proved to be an unsuccessful landowner, though, and finally sold it, having lost a lot of money. Stories vaguely describing this experience later made it into the collections called Mon Repos Haven (1879) and All the Year Round, both books attacking the very roots of Russian capitalism. \\"Fatherland is a pie - that's the idea those narrow, obnoxious minds follow,\\" he wrote. The latter collection remained unfinished due to fierceness of censorship in the wake of the assassination of Alexander II. In 1875-1885 Saltykov was often visiting Germany, Switzerland and France for medical treatment. The result of these recreational trips was the series of sketches called Abroad (Za rubezhom, 1880‚Äì1881), expressing skepticism about the Western veneer of respectability which hid underneath horrors similar to the ones that were open in Russia (the latter portrayed as The Boy Without Pants, as opposed to The Boy in Pants, symbolizing Europe). In 1882 Letters to Auntie, written in the atmosphere of tough censorship came out, a satire on the society in general and its cultural elite in particular (the 'auntie' in question). Portrait by Nikolai Yaroshenko, 1886 In 1883, now critically ill, Saltykov published Modern Idyll, the series of short stories he started in 1877-1878, targeting those of intelligentsia who were eager to prove their loyalty to the authorities. The Poshekhonye Stories (1883), Motley Letters (1884) and Unfinished Talks (1886) followed, but by this time Otechestvennye Zapiski were under increasing pressure from the censors, Shchedrin's prose being the latter's main target. The May 1874 issue with The Well-Meant Stories has been destroyed, several other releases postponed for Saltykov‚Äôs pieces to be excised. In 1874-1879 Otechestvennye Zapiski suffered 18 censorial sanctions, all having to do with Shchedrin's work, most of which (Well-Meant Species, Letters to Auntie, Contemporary Idyll, many fairytales) were banned. \\"It is despicable times that we are living through... and it takes a lot of strength not to give up,\\" Saltykov wrote. The demise of Otechestvennye Zapiski in 1884 dealt Saltykov a heavy blow. \\"The possibility to talk with my readers has been taken away from me and this pain is stronger than any other,\\" he complained. \\"The whole of the Russian press suffered from the Otechestvenny Zapiskis closure‚Ä¶ Where there's been a lively tissue now there is a chasm of emptiness. And Shchedrin's life has been curtailed, probably, for many years, by this 'excision',\\" wrote Korolenko in 1889. Saltykov-Shchedrin's last works were published by Vestnik Evropy and Russkye Vedomosti, among them a collection of satirical fables and tales Small Things in Life (1881‚Äì1887), a set of realistic mini-dramas about common people destroyed by the terror of daily routine. Saltykov's last publication was semi-autobiographical Old Years in Poshekhonye, published in 1887-1889 in Vestnik Evropy. He planned another piece called Forgotten Words (writing to Nikolai Mikhailovsky not long before his death: \\"There were, you know, words in Russian: honour, fatherland, humanity... They are worth of being reminded about\\") but never even started it. Mikhail Evgraphovich Saltykov-Schedrin died of stroke in Saint Petersburg and was interred in the Volkovo Cemetery, next to Turgenev, according to his last wish.  Legacy  Saltykov-Schedrin Memorial House in Tver Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin is regarded to be the most prominent satirist in the history of the Russian literature. According to critic and biographer Maria Goryachkina, he's managed to compile \\"the satirical encyclopedia\\" of contemporary Russian life, targeting first serfdom with its degrading effect upon the society, then, after its abolition, - corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, opportunistic tendencies in intelligentsia, greed and amorality of those at power, but also - apathy, meekness and social immobility of the common people of Russia. His two major works, The History of a Town chronicles and The Golovlyov Family novel, are widely regarded as his masterpieces. Maxim Gorky wrote in 1909: \\"The importance of his satire is immense, first for‚Ä¶ its almost clairvoyant vision of the path the Russian society had to travel - from 1860s to nowadays.\\" \\"The pathos of satirical humanism was his driving force. The mere awareness of people being treated cruelly while causes for their suffer were removable, filled him with rage and with this murderous laughter that makes his satire so distinctive,\\" wrote Alexander Fadeev. Saltykov- Shchedrin has been lavishly praised by Marxist critics as \\"the true revolutionary\\", but his mindset (as far as they were concerned) was not without a fault, for he, according to Goryachkina, \\"failed to recognize the historically progressive role of capitalism and never understood the importance of the emerging proletariat\\". Karl Marx (who knew Russian and held Shchedrin in high esteem) read Haven in Mon Repos (1878‚Äì1879) and was unimpressed. \\"The last section, 'Warnings', is weak and the author in general seems to be not very strong on positivity,\\" he wrote. Some contemporaries (Nikolai Pisarev, Alexei Suvorin) dismissed Saltykov-Shchedrin as the one taken to 'laughing for laughter's sake'. Vladimir Korolenko disagreed; he regarded Shchedrin's laughter to be the essential part of Russian life. \\"Shchedrin, he's still laughing, people were saying, by way of reproach... Thankfully, yes, no matter how hard it was for him to do this, in the most morbid times of our recent history this laughter was heard‚Ä¶ One had to have a great moral power to make others laugh, while suffering deeply (as he did) from all the grieves of those times,\\" he argued. According to D.S.Mirsky, the greater part of Saltykov's work is a rather nondescript kind of satirical journalism, generally with little or no narrative structure, and intermediate in form between the classical \\"character\\" and the contemporary feuilleton. Greatly popular though it was in its own time, it has since lost much of its appeal simply because it satirizes social conditions that have long ceased to exist and much of it has become unintelligible without commentary. Mirsky saw The History of a Town (a sort of parody of Russian history, concentrated in the microcosm of a provincial town, whose successive governors are transparent caricatures of Russian sovereigns and ministers, and whose very name is representative of its qualities) as the work that summed up the achievement of Saltykov's first period. He praised The Golovlyov Family, calling it the gloomiest book in all Russian literature‚Äî\\"all the more gloomy because the effect is attained by the simplest means without any theatrical, melodramatic, or atmospheric effects.\\" \\"The most remarkable character of this novel is Porfiry Golovlyov, nicknamed 'Little Judas', the empty and mechanical hypocrite who cannot stop talking unctuous and meaningless humbug, not for any inner need or outer profit, but because his tongue is in need of constant exercise,\\" Mirsky wrote. Saltykov-Shchedrin on a 1956 U.S.S.R. postage stamp The sole object of my literary work was unfailingly to protest against the greed, hypocrisy, falsehood, theft, treachery, and stupidity of modern Russians. Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin Most works of Saltykov's later period were written in a language that the satirist himself called Aesopian. This way, though, the writer was able to fool censors in the times of political oppression and take most radical ideas to print, which was the matter of his pride. \\"It is one continuous circumlocution because of censorship and requires a constant reading commentary,\\" Mirsky argued. The use of Aesopic language was one reason why Saltykov-Shchedrin has never achieved as much acclaim in the West as had three of his great contemporaries, Turgenev, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, according to Sofia Kovalevskaya. \\"It is unbelievable, how well we've learned to read between the lines in Russia,\\" the great mathematician remarked in her essay written in 1889 in Swedish. Another reason had to do with peculiarities of Saltykov's chosen genre: his credo \\"has always been a satire, spiced with fantasy, not far removed from Rabelais, the kind of literature that's tightly bound to its own national soil... Tears are the same wherever we go, but each nation laughs in its own way,\\" Kovalevskaya argued. Saltykov's style of writing, according to D.S.Mirsky, was based on the bad journalistic style of the period, which originated largely with Osip Senkovsky, and which \\"today invariably produces an impression of painfully elaborate vulgarity.\\"D.S. Mirsky. A History of Russian Literature. Northwestern University Press, 1999. . Page 294. Many other critics (Goryachkina among them) disagreed, praising the author's lively, rich language and the way he mastered both stark realism (The Golovlyov Family, Old Times in Poshekhonye) and satirical grotesque merged with fantasy. Of the writer's stylistic peculiarities biographer Sergey Krivenko (of the Narodnik movement, the one which Saltykov has always been in opposition to) wrote: \\"It is difficult to assess his works using the established criteria. It's a mix of a variety of genres: poetry and documentary report, epics and satire, tragedy and comedy. In the process of reading it is impossible to decide what exactly it is, but the general impression is invariably strong, as of something very lively and harmonic. Ignoring the established formats, Saltykov was driven by two things: current stream of new ideas and those lofty ideals he‚Äôs been aspiring to.\\" Saltykov, according to Krivenko, occasionally repeated himself, but never denied this, explaining it by the need of always being engaged with 'hot' issues ‚Äì \\"things which in the course of decades were in their own right repeating themselves with such damning monotony\\". \\"There are not many writers in Rus whose very name would give that much to one's mind and heart, and who'd leave such a vast literary heritage, rich and diverse both in essence and in form, written in a very special language which even in his lifetime became known as 'saltykovian',\\" wrote Krivenko in 1895. \\"Saltykov's gift was no lesser than that of Gogol, neither in originality nor in itspower,\\" the biographer reckoned. Saltykov-Schedrin was a controversial figure and often found himself a target of sharp criticism, mainly for his alleged 'lack of patriotism' and negativism. He's never seen himself a promoter of the latter and often proclaimed his belief in the strength of a common man, seeing the latter as holder of principles of real democracy. In 1882, as he, feeling depressed by the critical response to his work, made rather a pessimistic assessment of his life in literature, Ivan Turgenev was quick to reassure him. \\"The writer who is most hated, is most loved, too. You'd have known none of this, had you remained M.E.Saltykov, a mere hereditary Russian aristocrat. But you are Saltykov-Schedrin, a writer who happened to draw a distinctive line in our literature: that's why you are either hated or loved, depending [on who reads you]. Such is the true 'outcome' of your life in literature, and you must be pleased with it.\\" For all his insight and taste for detail, Saltykov was never keen on examining individual characters (even if he did create memorable ones). Admittedly, was always more concerned with things general ant typical, gauging social tendencies, collective urges and what he termed 'herd instincts in a modern man', often resorting to schemes and caricatures. In his later years Saltykov-Schedrin found himself to be a strong influence upon the radical youth of the time. In 1885-1886, Vladimir Lenin's brother Alexander and sister Anna were members of one of the numerous student's delegations that came home to visit the ailing Schedrin, latter referring to him as \\"the revolutionary youth's favourite writer\\". Saltykov-Shedrin was a personal favourite of Lenin himself, who often namechecked the writer's characters to prove his point ‚Äì Iudushka, in particular, served well to label many of his adversaries: Russian old landlords and emerging capitalists, Tzarist government members and, notably, his own associate Trotzky.

History During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington ordered construction of the Bayley-Hazen Military Road to provide access into the interior of Vermont. It would prompt the development and settlement of Hardwick and East Hardwick. The town was granted by the Vermont General Assembly on November 7, 1780, then chartered on August 19, 1781, to Danforth Keyes and 66 others, some of whom were from Hardwick, Massachusetts. Permanent settlement began in 1793 when several families named Norris arrived from New Hampshire.

The grant Hopkins received was originally called Hopkinsville; it was later combined with a parcel from the town of Burke, and renamed Kirby. Several ideas have been proposed for how the name Kirby was chosen; the most common is that it is a variant of the English Kirkby, which means a village or settlement around a church. By the time the town was organized in 1807, Hopkins had sold his interest and moved to Hopkinton, New York. Geography Kirby is located on the eastern border of Caledonia County in northeastern Vermont.

It is also the fastest growing town in Vermont with a population over 5,000, growing 9.8% in the decade preceding the 2010 census. History When Rhode Island proprietors secured the original Lyndon township grant, the area was covered in forests and woodlands. The Passumpsic River, flowing through the center of the town, provided power for grist and saw mills. The charter of the town of Lyndon was signed by Governor Thomas Chittenden in 1780. It seems likely that the name Lyndon was chosen to honor Josias Lyndon (1704‚Äì1778), a former governor of Rhode Island and friend of many of the proprietors. Many of these men served with the 2nd Rhode Island Regiment, 1st Division, including Israel Angell. The original proprietors secured the grant as a business venture and had no intention of settling it. Some of the men held high positions of rank, including Jonathan Arnold, William Greene, and James Manning,the President of Rhode Island College, later Brown University. They needed men in search of free land, who would clear each proprietor's grant in return for a portion of it. The town was surveyed in 1781 by Jonathan Arnold, Daniel Cahoon and Daniel Owen. Settlement began in 1789. By the 1790 census, twelve families with 59 residents made their homes in Lyndon. These families installed roads, mills, homes, barns, fields, crops, churches, and schools.Shores, Venila L. Lyndon: Gem in the Green. Lyndonville: Town of Lyndon, 1986. The village of Lyndon Corner was incorporated in 1792; Lyndon Center in 1794. Lyndonville was incorporated in 1866. The village of Lyndon Corner was about south of Lyndonville. The Hotel Lyndon was built there in 1807. It became a tavern and burned in 1897. About 1867, the Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad bypassed Lyndon Corner and Lyndon Center. This resulted in business moving to Lyndonville. The bypassed villages became residential and are no longer distinguished by a separate name. They both gave up their incorporated village status in 1962.

Its lower strata are clayey, and are folded and curved. West of this terrace the level is lower. There is the course of a former river bed which ran towards the east. At the upper village of Lyndon the first terrace is about wide. There is a lot of sand and fine gravel adjoining.

The population was 732 at the 2010 census. History In 1763, Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire gave a charter for the region to a group of proprietors, and the town was given the name Peacham (the etymology of the name is unclear). The original proprietors were speculators who surveyed the town, laid a few rudimentary roads, and divided it into lots, though the territory remained unsettled for some time. In 1775, settlers, primarily from Connecticut and Massachusetts, bought the lots and built homes, developing the land for agriculture. The original settlers survived almost entirely through subsistence farming despite the long winters, hilly terrain, and rocky soil. Nine years later, records show a population of approximately 200 people. The first recorded town meeting took place in 1784, and selectmen were duly elected to govern the affairs of the town. Peacham was early on presented with a choice of having either the county courthouse or the county school, and the residents voted for the school. In 1795 the Caledonia County Grammar School received its charter, and the first school was established in a log structure on the Bayley Hazen Road, halfway between Peacham Corner and South Peacham. In 1799, a library was established, which traveled from store to store.Early History of Peacham A congregational church was founded in 1794 ‚Äì the first pastor, Leonard Worcester, was well known for his fiery sermons. His son Samuel went on to be an important missionary to the Cherokee people, creating the first typeface for the Cherokee alphabet and gaining lasting fame as the plaintiff in the supreme court case Worcester v. Georgia. Early residents, who came to be known as Peachamites, traded butter, eggs, and wheat for goods which they could not make at home, and also relied on the production and sale of items such as whiskey and potash to help augment the relatively poor harvests. Almost from the beginning, various trades and industries‚Äîas many as 30‚Äì35 at a given time‚Äîflourished. Lumbering, coopering, milling, butter making, tin ware, tanneries and leather goods provided goods for local consumption. From 1800 to 1830, sheep farming flourished as a more profitable endeavor than growing crops. In 1840, the town reached its greatest population of 1,443. From that date on, census numbers steadily declined. Farming methods changed, and dairy farming came to replace sheep. The larger, more industrially advanced farms of the late 19th century could not support large families, and youth began to leave home. In the 20th century, the population continued to decline to a low in the mid-600s. Farming also became less common due to competition with larger dairy farms in the West, and many farms either consolidated or went under. Tourism became important during the 20th century as people opened their homes to visitors from the cities of the Atlantic seaboard, often derisively referred to as \\"flatlanders\\". With the advent of the railroad in Barnet and then motor vehicles, Peacham became a popular location for summer residents, some of whom were educators from Boston and New York City. In the second half of the 20th century, Peacham became a popular vacation spot and retirement home for prominent intellectuals and liberal thinkers ‚Äì individuals such as David Dellinger, William Lederer, Roman Jakobson, and the historian Shepard Clough all owned houses in town. Their interests and stimulation enhanced the cultural interests of the town.Peacham Town Plan Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 2.18%, is water.

History South Ryegate in 1909 One of the New Hampshire Grants, it was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on September 8, 1763. Granted to Richard Jenness and 93 others, it was named Ryegate, a variant spelling of Reigate in Surrey, England. The first settlers were Aaron Hosmer and his family. Sold to John Witherspoon and others, the southern half of town was purchased in 1773 by two agents for the Scotch American Company of Farmers from Renfrew and Lanark, Scotland, whose members began settlement in 1774. The town had excellent soil for the cultivation of grains, vegetables and orchards. Streams teemed with salmon and trout. Hills and valleys provided pasturage for grazing sheep and cattle. Connected in 1847 to the Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad, the town by 1859 was noted for producing butter and leather. The Wells River supplied water power for one gristmill and five sawmills. In 1873, the Montpelier & Wells River Railroad was completed. In 1890, a big brickyard opened; then in 1906, the Ryegate Paper Company began operation. But the town's dominant industry was six granite quarries at Blue Mountain. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.80%, is water.

This merger resulted in the closing of five local schools: Groton School, Wells River School, South Ryegate School, Ryegate Corner School, and East Ryegate School. The merger also removed the option for high school choice in the town of Ryegate, in favor of attending the new union high school. Although the merger was approved in 1964, there was a lengthy legal battle regarding the formation of the district, and the new district did not operate a school building until 1970.BMUSD Annual Report 2017-18, pp 16-17 On July 1, 2018 the State Board of Education temporarily reassigned the Blue Mountain Union School District to Orange East Supervisory under the Act 46 school district consolidation law.

The modest elevation of this town gives it a slightly cooler and wetter climate than nearby towns such as St. Johnsbury. Annual snowfall averages well over 100 inches per year at the weather station in the center of town. Climate Sutton has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb), typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers and cold winters. Exceptionally for such a small town, two NWS-certified weather stations have operated in the town for much of recent history. From January 1948 until spring 2017, the original station, located in a frost hollow at an altitude of about 1000 feet, reported data for the town. In January 2000, a new station was built in a hilly area a few miles away and at about 500 feet higher altitude. This station is still reporting today. The two stations show distinct microclimates. At the valley station, a freeze has been recorded for every month of the year as well a temperature of at least .https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?vt8172 The newer station has a much shorter period of record, but NOAA also lists mean monthly maximum and mean monthly minimum temperatures, which are the highest and lowest temperatures one can expect in a typical month each year. From this one can see that the hill station has much less variability of temperature, with much less chance of frost during the warm months.

Smilie Memorial School's benefactor was Ellen Pinneo, born in 1849 in Pinneo Flats in Bolton. She attended the Pinneo Flats School, which was later destroyed by the flood of 1927. Ellen married Melville Smilie and moved to Montpelier where she lived for many years until her death on December 17, 1933. After the flood of 1927 washed away her old schoolhouse, she donated $1000 toward the rebuilding of another school on Pinneo Flats. In her will, she bequeathed a sum of money to the Memorial School. When I-89 was constructed through Bolton and cut off access to the Memorial School, it was demolished and in 1960 part of the present school was erected. In September 1999, a large addition was completed adding five new classrooms and a large gym to the existing building. A final gift was made that made it possible to enlarge the library facility and increase the number of books. The school is exceptional with a strong partnership with Smilie families and Townspeople. On November 4, 2014, the communities of Bolton, Jericho, Richmond, Underhill ID and Underhill Town voted to form the Mount Mansfield Modified Union School District, also known as the MMMUSD.

The population was 30 at the 2010 census, up from 12 in 2000. In Vermont, gores and grants are unincorporated portions of a county which are not part of any town and have limited self-government (if any, as many are uninhabited). Geography Buels Gore is located at the southern tip of Chittenden County, bordered by the town of Huntington to the north, Fayston in Washington County to the east, and Starksboro in Addison County to the west. The crest of the Green Mountains, followed by the Long Trail, runs through the eastern side of the gore, and Vermont Route 17 crosses the gore from east to west, cresting the mountains at Appalachian Gap. According to the United States Census Bureau, Buels Gore has a total area of , of which , or 0.08%, is water. The name in history The gore was chartered by the Vermont General Assembly on November 4, 1780. It is named for Major Elias Buel (in some references \\"Buell\\") who moved to Vermont from Coventry, Connecticut. With a group of would-be proprietors including Ira Allen and several Buel family members, the group petitioned the legislature for a grant. They received a grant for a town, intended to be called \\"Coventry\\" near Shoreham. Due to a surveying error there was almost no land left in the grant. The group returned to the legislature and received a \\"flying grant\\", a sort of license which allowed a grant to be made on uncharted land that could be identified. As much of the state had by now been organized, they finally settled upon three unconnected pieces of land. The largest became the present town of Coventry in Orleans County. A second piece near Coventry was named \\"Coventry Leg\\" for its appendage shape. Coventry Leg was annexed to Newport in 1816. The final small piece, adjacent to Huntington, was called \\"Huntington Gore\\", and renamed \\"Buels Gore\\", despite Major Buel's desire to call it \\"Montzoar\\". All three charters were issued in October 1788, though dated back to 1780, the year of the original petition. Buel was charged retroactive taxes on the grant, a debt that only resolved by sale of all of his lands. He left Vermont to settle in New York. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 12 people, 6 households, and 4 families residing in the gore. The population density was 2.4 people per square mile (0.9/km2).

Bicycle racing Buels Gore and the summit of Appalachian Gap are the site for the finish of the Mad River Road Race which is stage 3 of the Green Mountain Stage Race road bicycle event. This final climb is considered one of the most scenic and challenging finishes for a bicycle race with grades near the summit of 18%. The Mad River Road race started in 1994 and became a stage in the Green Mountain Stage Race in 2000. Annually the event brings between 700-900 racers to the gore to compete.

In 2018 the Huntington district filed its third lawsuit against mergers. On June 6, 2019, the vote to merge Huntington into Mount Mansfield succeeded on a 450-191 basis; the Chittenden East Supervisory Union dissolved as a result. Notable people *Gregory C.

According to the charter, the town was to have an area of , or a tract a little over , but owing to a blunder on the part of the surveyors, it was shorn of a large portion of its possessions. From the beginning, Shelburne's economy was based on farming. With the clearing of land and burning of logs the town experienced a potash boom. A carding and fulling mill, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a blacksmith shop were erected on the La Platte River at Shelburne Falls. In 1811, a few Merino sheep imported from Spain led to an upsurge in sheep raising. Orchards and fruit growing became a major source of income for the farmers, with some 17,740 trees in 1880. Following the War of 1812, commerce on the lake expanded rapidly. The Lake Champlain Transportation Company established its shipyard at Shelburne Harbor and launched its first steamboat, the General Green, in 1825; this was followed by ten others before the Ticonderoga in 1906.

History=The railroad Island Pond became an important railroad center in 1853 when the Grand Trunk Railway established international connections between Montreal, Quebec, and Portland, Maine. The half-way point in the Portland-Montreal railroad line, this town became a booming railroad center with a roundhouse, shops, and all the facilities associated with train operations. In 1923 the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada was bankrupt and taken over by the Canadian government and operated as the Canadian National Railways. With the Canadian government directing the railroad, political considerations soon outweighed the economics of the railroad; commerce was displaced from the port of Portland to the Canadian ports of Halifax and St. John. The importance of the Portland line then began a decline which was never to be reversed. Island Pond's days as a major railroad town were over by the late 1950s due to the elimination of steam locomotives. By 1960 passenger train service to Portland had ended, and three years later the diesel locomotive shop was closed. In 1966 the roundhouse closed, and barely a skeleton staff of people worked in Island Pond. Canadian National continued to operate freight service to Portland until 1988; the following year the line was sold to a short line operator, the St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railroad, which provides service to this day. Today, only the passenger station remains and is used by a bank. The Island Pond Historical Society once housed on the upper floors, is now located at 126 Cross Street.

The group, led by Yoneq Gene Spriggs, sought shelter from the opposition it met elsewhere, although it continually faced opposition which culminated in the Island Pond raid in 1984 where state police and state social workers seized 112 children due to allegations of child abuse. The children were returned the same day upon a determination that the raid was unconstitutional, and no trial was held on the evidence of abuse the state found.

Demographics The population was zero at the 2010 census. Proper name Sources are inconsistent on whether the name is, properly, Warner's Grant or Warners Grant (i.e., with the apostrophe or without), and some sources list it as Warner's Gore. The likely reason is the standard removal of the apostrophe from nearly all US place names by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names on its inception in 1890.U.S. Board on Geographic Names: FAQs The original charter (as reproduced in State Papers of Vermont, Volume Two: Charters Granted by the State of Vermont, VT Secretary of State, 1922, pp 206‚Äì7) merely mentions the boundaries of the tract of land. The land was granted to Hester Warner, the widow of Col. Seth Warner (one of the leaders of the Green Mountain Boys), and Seth Warner's other heirs. While the name's origin, honoring Seth Warner, is clear, the charter does nothing to specify precise usage. State Papers of Vermont, Volume One: Index to the Papers of the Surveyors-General (VT Secretary of State, 1918) lists it as \\"Warner's Grant or Warner's Gore\\" (p. 154). The Vermont Statutes mention the grant in at least three places, each time using the term Warner's Grant (Title 17, Chapter 34, Section 1893; T. 24, Ch. 1, Sec. 6; and T. 24, Ch. 117, Sec. 4341(e)). The Gazetteer of Caledonia and Essex Counties, VT, 1764-1887 (Hamilton Child, 1887) lists the name as Warner's Grant (p. 490).

The town is part of the Missisquoi River watershed, draining to Lake Champlain. The Cold Hollow Mountains occupy the eastern end of the town, with a high point of just north of the Lamoille County line. History=Early years The town history began when Joseph Baker of Westborough, Massachusetts, the namesake for the village, bought 10,000 acres in 1791. Initial settlers were his son-in-law, Stephen Maynard, and his nephew Jonas Brigham, along with their families. Baker built grist and saw mills on Baker's Pond in 1794. Two years later Maynard built a tavern. In 1797, a school was established in a log cabin at the Post Road and Vermont 108. Five acres were deeded for the development of a town common and burying ground in 1804 by Joseph Baker. Maynard built a Federal style house north of the village to serve as the first post office in 1811. There were 12 school geographically-accessible districts in Bakersfield in 1839, due to the growth in the area. The town had grown to 1,258 residents in 1840. Academies The settlement has been called an \\"old academy town\\" for the schools for college-bound students. Public speaking was encouraged for boys. The Bakersfield Academic Association was established in 1839, which built a three- story building to house a Methodist Church and the South Academy. It was the first building for Bakersfield Academy, which opened in 1840. Jacob Spaulding was hired as headmaster and Mary, his wife, was a drawing instructor and preceptress. In 1851, there were 271 students from New England, other parts of the United States, and Quebec. They had a staff of 14 people. The academy suffered a loss of reputation when Spaulding left the school in 1852 to become a principal for Barre and its well-endowed academy. In 1844 by Methodists wanted an academy on the north end of town. Unofficially called North Academy, the principal was Rev. H.J. Moore from northern New York. The academies closed after a loss of students due to westward expansion, the creation of central public high schools, and the American Civil War. In 1870, there were 70 students at Bakersfield Academy. Bakersfield Academy is no longer in existence. Brigham Academy Brigham Academy was built in 1879, with funding provided by Peter Bent Brigham, who left a $30,000 endowment for education, and his sister Sarah Brigham Jacobs who provided land and a $100,000 endowment for the academy. It was staffed by Jacob Spaulding, Rev. Dr. Wright from Bakersfield and of Oberlin College, and President Buckham of the University of Vermont. In 1900, an addition provided additional classroom, laboratories, and a gymnasium. Notable people who attended the academy include Warren Austin, the first U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a U.S. senator and members of the Austin family of Highgate. In 1967, it closed as a high school. It continued to offer elementary and middle school education until 1987.

Movie World, Queensland, Australia An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects. Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens and large picnic areas, which were created for people's recreation. World's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry. Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest, continuously-operating amusement park in North America. The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946, Santa's Workshop in 1949, and Disneyland in 1955. History=Origins The amusement park evolved from three earlier traditions: traveling or periodic fairs, pleasure gardens and exhibitions such as world fairs. The oldest influence was the periodic fair of the Middle Ages - one of the earliest was the Bartholomew Fair in England from 1133. By the 18th and 19th centuries, they had evolved into places of entertainment for the masses, where the public could view freak shows, acrobatics, conjuring and juggling, take part in competitions and walk through menageries. Frederick Savage's 'Sea-On-Land' carousel, where the riders would pitch up and down as if they were on the sea, was the first amusement ride installed in Dreamland Margate in 1880 England. A wave of innovation in the 1860s and 1870s created mechanical rides, such as the steam-powered carousel (built by Thomas Bradshaw, at the Aylsham Fair), and its derivatives, notably from Frederick Savage of King's Lynn, Norfolk whose fairground machinery was exported all over the world; his \\"galloping horses\\" innovation is seen in carousels today.\\"Frederick Savage, Victorian fairground manufacturer of King's Lynn\\". Norfolk.gov.uk. Retrieved 25 February 2018 This inaugurated the era of the modern funfair ride, as the working classes were increasingly able to spend their surplus wages on entertainment. The second influence was the pleasure garden. An example of this is the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken (\\"The Hill\\"), opened in mainland Europe in 1583. It is located north of Copenhagen in Klampenborg, Denmark. Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661 as one of the first pleasure gardens Another early garden was the Vauxhall Gardens, founded in 1661 in London. By the late 18th century, the site had an admission fee for its many attractions. It regularly drew enormous crowds, with its paths often noted for romantic assignations; tightrope walkers, hot air balloon ascents, concerts and fireworks providing amusement. Although the gardens were originally designed for the elites, they soon became places of great social diversity. Public firework displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens, and Cremorne Gardens offered music, dancing and animal acrobatics displays. Prater in Vienna, Austria, began as a royal hunting ground which was opened in 1766 for public enjoyment. There followed coffee-houses and caf√©s, which led to the beginnings of the Wurstelprater as an amusement park. The concept of a fixed park for amusement was further developed with the beginning of the world's fairs. The first World fair began in 1851 with the construction of the landmark Crystal Palace in London, England. The purpose of the exposition was to celebrate the industrial achievement of the nations of the world and it was designed to educate and entertain the visitors. The original Ferris Wheel, World's Columbian Exposition, 1893 American cities and business also saw the world's fair as a way of demonstrating economic and industrial success. The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Illinois was an early precursor to the modern amusement park. The fair was an enclosed site, that merged entertainment, engineering and education to entertain the masses. It set out to bedazzle the visitors, and successfully did so with a blaze of lights from the \\"White City.\\" To make sure that the fair was a financial success, the planners included a dedicated amusement concessions area called the Midway Plaisance. Rides from this fair captured the imagination of the visitors and of amusement parks around the world, such as the first steel Ferris wheel, which was found in many other amusement areas, such as the Prater by 1896. Also, the experience of the enclosed ideal city with wonder, rides, culture and progress (electricity), was based on the creation of an illusory place. The \\"midway\\" introduced at the Columbian Exposition would become a standard part of most amusement parks, fairs, carnivals and circuses. The midway contained not only the rides, but other concessions and entertainments such as shooting galleries, penny arcades, games of chance and shows. Trolley parks and pleasure resorts Many modern amusement parks evolved from earlier pleasure resorts that had become popular with the public for day-trips or weekend holidays, for example, seaside areas such as Blackpool, United Kingdom and Coney Island, United States. In the United States, some amusement parks grew from picnic groves established along rivers and lakes that provided bathing and water sports, such as Lake Compounce in Connecticut, first established as a picturesque picnic park in 1846, and Riverside Park in Massachusetts, founded in the 1870s along the Connecticut River. The trick was getting the public to the seaside or resort location. For Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, on the Atlantic Ocean, a horse-drawn streetcar line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in 1829. In 1875, a million passengers rode the Coney Island Railroad, and in 1876 two million visited Coney Island. Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper classes and the working class at the beach. The first carousel was installed in the 1870s, the first roller coaster, the \\"Switchback Railway\\", in 1884. Blackpool Beach in 1895 In England, Blackpool was a popular beachside location beginning in the 1700s. It rose to prominence as a seaside resort with the completion in 1846 of a branch line to Blackpool from Poulton on the main Preston and Wyre Joint Railway line. A sudden influx of visitors, arriving by rail, provided the motivation for entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Photochrom of the Promenade c. 1898 In 1879, large parts of the promenade at Blackpool were wired. The lighting and its accompanying pageants reinforced Blackpool's status as the North of England's most prominent holiday resort, and its specifically working class character. It was the forerunner of the present-day Blackpool Illuminations. By the 1890s, the town had a population of 35,000, and could accommodate 250,000 holidaymakers. The number of annual visitors, many staying for a week, was estimated at three million. In the final decade of the 19th century, electric trolley lines were developed in many large American cities. Companies that established the trolley lines also developed trolley parks as destinations of these lines. Trolley parks such as Atlanta's Ponce de Leon Park, or Reading's Carsonia Park were initially popular natural leisure spots before local streetcar companies purchased the sites, expanding them from picnic groves to include regular entertainments, mechanical amusements, dance halls, sports fields, boat rides, restaurants and other resort facilities. Steel Pier circa the 1910s Steel Pier circa the 2010s Some of these parks were developed in resort locations, such as bathing resorts at the seaside in New Jersey and New York. A premiere example in New Jersey was Atlantic City, a famous vacation resort. Entrepreneurs erected amusement parks on piers that extended from the boardwalk out over the ocean. The first of several was the Ocean Pier in 1891, followed later by the Steel Pier in 1898, both of which boasted rides and attractions typical of that time, such as Midway-style games and electric trolley rides. The boardwalk also had the first Roundabout installed in 1892 by William Somers, a wooden predecessor to the Ferris Wheel. Somers installed two others in Asbury Park, New Jersey and Coney Island, New York. Another early park was the Eldorado Amusement Park that opened in 1891 on the banks of the Hudson River, overlooking New York City. It consisted of 25 acres. Modern amusement parks Dreamland tower and lagoon in 1907 The first permanent enclosed entertainment area, regulated by a single company, was founded in Coney Island in 1895: Sea Lion Park at Coney Island in Brooklyn. This park was one of the first to charge admission to get into the park in addition to sell tickets for rides within the park. In 1897, Sea Lion Park was joined by Steeplechase Park, the first of three major amusement parks that would open in the Coney Island area. George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and entertainment. The combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney Island the embodiment of the American amusement park. Coney Island also featured Luna Park (1903) and Dreamland (1904). Coney Island was a huge success and by year 1910 attendance on days could reach a million people. Fueled by the efforts of Frederick Ingersoll who borrowed the name, other \\"Luna Parks\\" were quickly erected worldwide and opened to rave reviews. The first amusement park in England was opened in 1896 - the Blackpool Pleasure Beach by W. G. Bean. In 1904, Sir Hiram Maxim's Captive Flying Machine was introduced; he had designed an early aircraft powered by steam engines that had been unsuccessful and instead opened up a pleasure ride of flying carriages that revolved around a central pylon. Other rides included the 'Grotto' (a fantasy ride), 'River Caves' (a scenic railway), water chutes and a toboganning tower. Fire was a constant threat in those days, as much of the construction within the amusement parks of the era was wooden. In 1911, Dreamland was the first Coney Island amusement park to completely burn down; in 1944, Luna Park also burned to the ground. Most of Ingersoll's Luna Parks were similarly destroyed, usually by arson, before his death in 1927. The Golden Age Shoot-the- chute ride at Dreamland, Coney Island During the Gilded Age, many Americans began working fewer hours and had more disposable income. With new-found money and time to spend on leisure activities, Americans sought new venues for entertainment. Amusement parks, set up outside major cities and in rural areas, emerged to meet this new economic opportunity. These parks served as source of fantasy and escape from real life. By the early 1900s, hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada. Trolley parks stood outside many cities. Parks like Atlanta's Ponce de Leon and Idora Park, near Youngstown, OH, took passengers to traditionally popular picnic grounds, which by the late 1890s also often included rides like the Giant Swing, Carousel, and Shoot-the-Chutes. These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or world's fairs: they had names like Coney Island, White City, Luna Park, or Dreamland. The American Gilded Age was, in fact, amusement parks' Golden Age that reigned until the late 1920s. The Golden Age of amusement parks also included the advent of the kiddie park. Founded in 1925, the original Kiddie Park is located in San Antonio, Texas and is still in operation today. The kiddie parks became popular all over America after World War II. This era saw the development of the new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to thrill the riders. By the end of the First World War, people seemed to want an even more exciting entertainment, a need met by roller coasters. Although the development of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance. The 1920s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides. Scenic Railway at Margate, 1930s In England, Dreamland Margate opened in 1880 with Frederick Savage's carousel the first amusement ride installed. In 1920 the Scenic Railway rollercoaster opened to the public with great success, carrying half a million passengers in its first year. The park also installed other rides common to the time including a smaller roller coaster, the Joy Wheel, Miniature Railway, The Whip and the River Caves. A ballroom was constructed on the site of the Skating Rink in 1920 and in 1923 a Variety Cinema was built on the site. Between 1920 and 1935 over ¬£500,000 was invested in the site, constantly adding new rides and facilities and culminating in the construction of the Dreamland Cinema complex in 1934 which stands to this day.The Prince's Regeneration Trust: Dreamland, Margate Conservation Statement Meanwhile, the Blackpool Pleasure Beach was also being developed. Frequent large-scale investments were responsible for the construction of many new rides, including the Virginia Reel, Whip, Noah's Ark, Big Dipper and Dodgems. In the 1920s the \\"Casino Building\\" was built, which remains to this day. In 1923, land was reclaimed from the sea front. It was at this period that the park moved to its 44-acre (180,000 m2) current location above what became Watson Road, which was built under the Pleasure Beach in 1932. During this time Joseph Emberton, an architect famous for his work in the amusement trade was brought in to redesign the architectural style of the Pleasure Beach rides, working on the \\"Grand National\\" roller coaster, \\"Noah's Ark\\" and the Casino building to name a few. Depression and post-World War II decline Main entrance to Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, Allentown, Pennsylvania, 1950 The Great Depression of the 1930s and World War II during the 1940s saw the decline of the amusement park industry. War caused the affluent urban population to move to the suburbs, television became a source of entertainment, and families went to amusement parks less often. By the 1950s, factors such as urban decay, crime, and even desegregation in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time. Many of the older, traditional amusement parks closed or burned to the ground. Many would be taken out by the wrecking ball to make way for suburban housing and development. In 1964, Steeplechase Park, once the king of all amusement parks, closed down for good. The traditional amusement parks which survived, for example, Kennywood, in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, and Cedar Point, in Sandusky, Ohio, did so in spite of the odds. Amusement and theme parks today Stunt Fall at Parque Warner Madrid, Madrid, Spain An aerial view of the S√§rk√§nniemi amusement park in Tampere, Finland Dark Forest entrance at Alton Towers theme park, Alton, England The amusement park industry's offerings range from immersive theme parks such as the Walt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort to thrilling coaster parks such as the Six Flags parks and Cedar Fair parks. Countless smaller ventures exist across the United States and around the world. Simpler theme parks directly aimed at smaller children have also emerged, such as Legoland. Examples of amusement parks in shopping malls exist in West Edmonton Mall, Pier 39 and Mall of America. Family fun parks starting as miniature golf courses have begun to grow to include batting cages, go-karts, bumper cars, bumper boats and water slides. Some of these parks have grown to include even roller coasters, and traditional amusement parks now also have these competition areas in addition to their thrill rides.

Other types of amusement park=Educational theme parks The historical theme park Puy du Fou in France won the 2014 Applause Award from the IAAPA Some parks use rides and attractions for educational purposes. Disney was the first to successfully open a large-scale theme park built around education. Named Epcot, it opened in 1982 as the second park in the Walt Disney World Resort. There are also Holy Land USA and the Holy Land Experience, which are theme parks built to inspire Christian piety. Dinosaur World entertains families with dinosaurs in natural settings, while the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens parks also offer educational experiences, with each of the parks housing several thousand animals, fish and other sea life in dozens of attractions and exhibits focusing on animal education. Created in 1977, the Puy du Fou is a much celebrated theme park in Vend√©e, France. It is centered around European, French and local history. It received several international prizes. Family-owned theme parks Narrow gauge mining train going through Calico Ghost Town Some theme parks did evolve from more traditional amusement park enterprises, such as Knott's Berry Farm. In the 1920s, Walter Knott and his family sold berries from a roadside stand, which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners. Within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico, California ghost town and Prescott, Arizona. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became a theme park. Because of its long history, Knott's Berry Farm currently claims to be \\"America's First Theme Park.\\" Knott's Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States, open since 1846. Santa Claus Town, which opened in Santa Claus, Indiana in 1935 and included Santa's Candy Castle and other Santa Claus-themed attractions, is considered the first themed attraction in the United States: a precursor to the modern day theme park. Santa Claus Land (renamed Holiday World in 1984) opened in 1946 in Santa Claus, Indiana and many people will argue that it was the first true Theme Park despite Knott's history. In the 1950s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction, Marvel Cave near Branson, Missouri. Over the next decade they modernized the cave, which led to large numbers of people waiting to take the tour. The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave. The small village eventually became the theme park, Silver Dollar City. The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood, Celebration City and Wild Adventures. Regional parks The Moomin World theme park in Naantali, Finland Proper The first regional amusement park, as well as the first Six Flags park, Six Flags over Texas was officially opened in 1961 in Arlington, Texas. The first Six Flags amusement park was the vision of Angus Wynne, Jr. and helped create the modern, competitive amusement park industry. In the late 1950s, Wynne visited Disneyland and was inspired to create an affordable, closer, and larger amusement park that would be filled with fantasy. He followed in the steps of Disney and had subdivisions within the park that reflected different lands. The subdivisions included the Old South and other sections that referenced Wynne's background. By 1968, the second Six Flags park, Six Flags Over Georgia, opened, and in 1971, Six Flags Over Mid-America (now Six Flags St. Louis) opened near St. Louis, Missouri. Also in 1971 was the opening of the Walt Disney World resort complex in Florida, with the Magic Kingdom (1971), Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989) and Disney's Animal Kingdom (1998). Admission prices and admission policies Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom's in Allentown, Pennsylvania Oaks Amusement Park in Portland, Oregon Amusement parks collect much of their revenue from admission fees paid by guests attending the park. Other revenue sources include parking fees, food and beverage sales and souvenirs. Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles: Pay-as-you-go In amusement parks using the pay-as-you-go scheme, a guest enters the park at little or no charge. The guest must then purchase rides individually, either at the attraction's entrance or by purchasing ride tickets (or a similar exchange method, like a token). The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity or popularity. For example, a guest might pay one ticket to ride a carousel but four tickets to ride a roller coaster. The park may allow guests to purchase a pass providing unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park for a specified duration of time. A wristband or pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission. Melbourne Luna Park Disneyland opened in 1955 using the pay-as-you-go format. Initially, guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions. Within a short time, the problems of handling such large amounts of coins led to the development of a ticket system that, while now out of use, is still part of the amusement-park lexicon. In this new format, guests purchased ticket books that contained a number of tickets, labeled \\"A,\\" \\"B\\" and \\"C.\\" Rides and attractions using an \\"A-ticket\\" were generally simple, with \\"B-tickets\\" and \\"C-tickets\\" used for the larger, more popular rides. Later, the \\"D-ticket\\" was added, then finally the \\"E-ticket\\", which was used on the biggest and most elaborate rides, like Space Mountain. Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides, so that for example two or three A-tickets would equal a single B-ticket. Disneyland, as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World, abandoned this practice in 1982. Pay-one-price An amusement park using the pay-one-price scheme will charge guests a single admission fee. The guest is then entitled to use most of the attractions (usually including flagship roller coasters) in the park as often as they wish during their visit. A daily admission pass (daypass) is the most basic fare on sale, also sold are season tickets which offer holders admission for the entire operating year (plus special privileges for the newest attractions), and express passes which gives holders priority in bypassing lineup queues for popular attractions. Pay-one-price format parks also have attractions that are not included in the admission charge; these are called \\"up-charge attractions\\" and can include Skycoasters or go-kart tracks, or games of skill where prizes are won. When Angus Wynne, founder of Six Flags Over Texas, first visited Disneyland upon its opening in 1955, he noted that park's pay-as-you-go format as a reason to make his park pay-one-price. He thought that a family would be more likely to visit his park if they knew, up front, how much it would cost to attend. Rides and attractions See List of amusement rides Minimum height requirement sign Mechanized thrill machines are a defining feature of amusement parks. Early rides include the carousel, which originally developed from cavalry training methods first used in the Middle Ages. By the 19th century, carousels were common in parks around the world. Another such ride which shaped the future of the amusement park was the roller coaster. The origins of roller coasters can be traced back to 17th-century Russia, where gravity-driven attractions, which at first only consisted of individual sleds or carts riding freely down chutes on top of specially constructed snow slopes with piles of sand at the bottom for braking, were used as winter leisure activities. These crude and temporarily built curiosities, known as Russian Mountains, were the beginning of the search for even more thrilling amusement park rides. The Columbian Exposition of 1893 was a particularly fertile testing ground for amusement rides and included some that the public had never seen before, such as the world's first Ferris wheel, one of the most recognized products of the fair. In the present day, many rides of various types are set around a specific theme. Parks contains a mixture of attractions which can be divided into several categories. Rameses Revenge at Chessington World of Adventures, Greater London, is a Huss Top Spin ride and was the first of its kind to feature a water element Flat rides Flat rides are usually considered to be those that move their passengers in a plane generally parallel to the ground. There is a core set of flat rides which most amusement parks have, including the enterprise, tilt-a-whirl, gravitron, chairswing, swinging inverter ship, twister, and top spin. However, there is constant innovation, with new variations on ways to spin and throw passengers around appearing in an effort to keep attracting customers. Manufactures such as Huss and Zamperla specialise in creating flat rides among other amusement attractions. Roller coasters Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, have fast and steep drops from high altitudes Amusement parks often feature multiple roller coasters of primarily timber or steel construction. Fundamentally, a roller coaster ride is one in which a specialized railroad system with steep drops and sharp curves, passengers sit and are restrained in cars, usually with two or more cars joined to form a train. Some roller coasters feature one or more inversions (such as vertical loops) which turn the riders upside down. Over the years there have been many roller coaster manufacturers with a variety of types of roller coasters. Manufacturers today include: * Bolliger & Mabillard * Gerstlauer * Great Coasters International * Intamin * Mack Rides * Premier Rides * Rocky Mountain Construction * Vekoma * Zamperla Railways gauge Six Flags & Texas Railroad in operation in 2007 Amusement park railways have had a long and varied history in American amusement parks as well as overseas. Some of the earliest park trains were not really trains; they were trolleys, which brought park patrons to the parks on regular rail lines from the cities to the end of the rail lines where the parks were located. As such, some older parks, such as Kennywood in Pennsylvania, were referred to as trolley parks. The earliest park trains that only operated on lines within the park's boundaries, such as the one on the ridable miniature Zephyr Railroad in Dorney Park, were mostly custom-built. A few parks trains (such as the Disneyland Railroad, Walt Disney World Railroad, and Dollywood Express) operate using locomotives that had working careers on common carrier railways. Amusement park railways tend to be narrow gauge, meaning the space between their rails is smaller than that of railroads. Some specific narrow gauges that are common on amusement park railroads are gauge, gauge, gauge, and gauge. Past and present manufacturers include: *Allan Herschell Company *Brookville Equipment Corporation *Cagney Brothers *Chance Rides *Crown Metal Products *Custom Fabricators *Custom Locomotives *Doppelmayr Garaventa Group *Hurlbut Amusement Co. *Katiland Trains *Miniature Train Co. (MTC) *National Amusement Devices Co. (NAD) *Ottaway *Sandley *Severn Lamb *Tampa Metal Products *Train Rides Unlimited *Western Train Co. Water rides Amusement parks with water resources generally feature a few water rides, such as the log flume, bumper boats, rapids and rowing boats. Such rides are usually gentler and shorter than roller coasters and many are suitable for all ages. Water rides are especially popular on hot days. Ghost Pirate Dark Ride in Milwaukee County Fair Dark rides Overlapping with both train rides and water rides, dark rides are enclosed attractions in which patrons travel in guided vehicles along a predetermined path, through an array of illuminated scenes which may include lighting effects, animation, music and recorded dialogue, and other special effects. Ferris wheels Kamikaze ride in ƒåakovec Porcijunkulovo Fair, Croatia Ferris wheels are the most common type of amusement ride at state fairs and county fairs in the US. Transport rides Transport rides are used to take large numbers of guests from one area to another, as an alternative to walking, especially for parks that are large or separated into distant areas. Transport rides include chairlifts, monorails, aerial trams, and escalators. Ocean Park Hong Kong is well known for its cable car connecting the Lowland and Headland areas of the park, and for having the world's second longest outdoor escalator in the Headland. Both transportation links provide scenic views of the park's hilly surroundings and, while originally intended for practicality rather than thrills or enjoyment, have become significant park attractions in their own right.

Since 2011 it has been part of the Ludwigslust-Parchim district. Ludwigslust is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region. The former royal residential town is known for its rich heritage, especially the famed Ludwigslust Palace, known as Versailles of the North. History Ludwigslust In 1724 Prince Ludwig, the son of Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, decided to build a hunting lodge near a small hamlet called Klenow. Later, after his succession to the Dukedom, this became his favourite residence and he named it accordingly Ludwigslust (\\"Ludwig's pleasure/desire\\"). In 1765 Ludwigslust became the capital of the duchy in place of Schwerin. The town was enlarged by a residential palace (the castle). This situation continued until 1837, when Grand Duke Paul Friedrich returned the capital status to Schwerin. The W√∂bbelin concentration camp--sometimes referred to as Ludwigslust concentration camp--was established by the SS near the city of Ludwigslust in 1945. At the end of World War II, as the Line of contact between Soviet and other Allied forces formed, Ludwigslust was captured by British troops initially, then handed over to American troops. After several months the US troops departed and allowed Soviet troops to enter under the Yalta agreement designating the occupation of Mecklenburg to be administered by the Soviets. Citizens of Ludwigslust, Germany, inspect a nearby concentration camp under orders of the 82nd Airborne Division Sights * Schloss Ludwigslust, a Baroque residential palace built in 1772‚Äì1776, according to plans by Johann Joachim Busch.

The palace is in the middle of the palace garden (Schlosspark), a vast park (120 ha.) in the English style, with canals, fountains and artificial cascades. * The Stadtkirche (Municipal- / City-Church), built in 1765‚Äì1770 in Neoclassical style with Baroque sway.

It is the most remote and the most northern of the Champlain Islands. At 7 mi (11 km) by 2 mi (3 km), it lies close to the place that the lake empties into the Richelieu River. It is incorporated as a New England town in Grand Isle County. Its population was 471 at the 2010 census. The island is named after a French soldier, Pierre La Motte, who built a military outpost on the island in 1666. The island's population swells many times in the summer months. The island is the site of Fort Sainte Anne, Saint Anne's Shrine, the Methodist Episcopal Church of Isle La Motte, the Fisk Quarry and Goodsell Ridge Preserves, the Isle La Motte Elementary School, and the Isle La Motte Lighthouse. History Map of Fort Sainte-Anne and other forts on the Richelieu River, circa 1666 Statue of Champlain and guide on Isle La Motte On 9 July 1609, Samuel de Champlain debarked on the island. In 1665, the French began building a series of forts along the Richelieu River to protect New France from the Iroquois. From north to south these were Fort Richelieu, Fort Chambly, and Fort Sainte Th√©r√®se. Four companies of the Carignan-Sali√®res Regiment were sent from Quebec City to extend these forts further south, under Captain Pierre La Motte. They built a trail connecting Fort Sainte Th√©r√®se and Fort Saint-Louis (Chambly). In 1666, Fort Saint-Jean and the farthest south Fort Sainte Anne on Isle La Motte were added. The fort included Saint Anne's Shrine. Both the fort and chapel were dedicated to Saint Anne. In 1668, the bishop of Quebec, Fran√ßois de Laval, came to Isle La Motte to baptise a number of Iroquois to Christianity. Even after the abandonment of the fort, the shrine continued to give mass to worshipers. The fort was the first European settlement in what is now Vermont. Fort Saint Anne was the one most vulnerable to attack. The fort was garrisoned by about 300 French soldiers over the next four years, and the troops were then pulled back to Qu√©bec after they had destroyed the fort. In the mid-1800s, orchards, vineyards, and dairy farms flourished on the island, which was then connected to the mainland by ferry during the warmer months and by foot or wagon over the ice in winter. In November 1802, Isle La Motte was renamed to \\"Vineyard,\\" but the original name was restored in November 1830. In 1878, the town was incorporated for the sole purpose of building a bridge to Alburgh that was completed in 1882. Fisk Farm was the site at which the Vermont Fish and Game League was addressed in August 1897 by President William McKinley and in September 1901 by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt, who had learned of the shooting of McKinley, who later died. Geology and quarrying The island, along with Valcour Island south of Plattsburgh, was formed 480 million years ago as a reef during the Ordovician Period in a shallow tropical sea, near where Zimbabwe is today. At that time there was no life on dry land except for a few primitive plants such as mosses and algae. Almost all of life was in the oceans. Carbon dioxide levels were 14‚Äì16 times higher than today, with high sea levels covering much of the continents, which were mostly located south of the equator. The stromatoporoid patch reef, one of the oldest known metazoan reefs, originally stretched a thousand miles from what is now Quebec to Tennessee, but only a few remnants remain today. The island's fossil reefs are part of the Chazy Fossil Reef, a National Natural Landmark dedicated in 2009. Reef builders during this period in earth history were principally bryozoa, stromatolites, stromatoporoids, sponges, and algae. Other marine life included cephalopods, gastropods, crinoids, and trilobites. Today fossil gastropods (snails) can be seen at the abandoned quarries. Black limestone from the Chazy Formation was quarried on the island. The oldest quarry behind Fisk Farm started as early as 1832. The limestone is composed of calcite and fossils of marine creatures. It is so dark in appearance that it was marketed in the 18th and 19th century as \\"black marble\\" and was used for the construction of the U.S. Capitol building and the National Gallery of Art. Structures made of the stone still visible on the island are the Isle La Motte Public Library, the Isle La Motte Methodist Church, Isle La Motte Historical Society (formerly the South Stone School House), ruins of the Fisk House at Fisk Farm, and the original Fisk House (once owned by Lieutenant Governor Nelson Fisk).

History In 1780, the American Revolution-era government of Vermont granted the town of Orange to Captain Ebenezer Green, Amos Robinson, and 63 other shareholders. At the time, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York were fighting for control of Vermont, including the right to award town charters‚Äîa fight eventually won by Vermont. During the Revolution, New York unsuccessfully attempted to award a charter for the town of Kempton, which would have encompassed the same territory as Orange. The first settlement in Orange took place in 1793, when Joseph Williams and his family built a house in the southern portion of the town. Orange was officially organized in 1796 in a meeting which took place at Williams's home, and its first government consisted of: Joseph Thayer as town meeting moderator; John Sloane, town clerk; Thomas Storrs Paine, Fairbanks Bush, and Gould Camp as selectmen (Camp was also town treasurer); Ezra Paine, constable; listers Fairbanks Bush, Ezra Goodale, and Humphrey Hunt; and grand juror Joseph Williams. In 1798, Orange was represented in the Vermont House of Representatives for the first time, following the election of Ezra Goodale.

Randolph's prosperity during the Victorian era endowed it with some fine architecture, including the Second Empire Randolph Railroad Depot and Renaissance Revival Kimball Public Library. In 1921, Randolph was the setting for, and provided some of the cast of, a silent movie called The Offenders. In 1922 the same was true for the film Insinuation.

It wasn't until 1867 that, after a succession of fairs in Orange County starting in 1847, the Tunbridge Agricultural Society was organized and staged a fair at the Elisha Lougee Farm in North Tunbridge. At the 1867 fair, Vermont's former Lieutenant Governor Burnham Martin referred to the fair as a \\"little World's Fair\\". Lewis Dickerman adopted the phrase and used it in the 1868 publicity handbills and the Tunbridge fair has since used the name. In 1875, the Union Agricultural Society assumed the sponsorship of the fair and moved its location to the present fairgrounds in the center of Tunbridge. In 1894, the fair joined the National Trotting Association, and for many years has maintained the only remaining grass race track in Vermont. The annual fair continues to this day with demonstrations of farming and agricultural traditions and culture, working antique displays, horse and ox pulling, horse racing, cattle and horse shows, junior exhibits, floral and 4-H exhibits, contra dancing, gymkhana, and many free shows.

The population was 1,047 at the 2000 census. The town is believed to be named after George Washington, although the town may also be named after Washington, Connecticut as there are records of individuals moving from that town in Connecticut to Vermont around 1766.Bartholomew, George Wells. \\"Record of the Bartholomew Family.\\" Salem Press, 1885. p.79. History During the 1760s and 1770s the territory now known as Vermont was in dispute between New York and New Hampshire, the result of conflicting interpretations of each colony's charter. People moving into the territory, then known as New Connecticut or the New Hampshire Grants, generally settled after purchasing land grants from New Hampshire governor Benning Wentworth. When the British government resolved the dispute in New York's favor, the colonial government attempted to assert control over the grants and force residents who had purchased land grants from Wentworth to pay a fee and confirm their titles. Many Vermonters resisted, leading to creation of the Green Mountain Boys. As part of New York's effort to demonstrate control over the grants, in 1770 it chartered the town of Kingsland far from New York in what was then remote Gloucester County. Kingsland had no record of any residents, but was designated as one of two county seats. A log jail and courthouse were constructed at the head of a stream named subsequently named the Jail Branch. In 1781 the government of Vermont, by then an independent republic, re-chartered Kingsland and named it Washington. The town was uninhabited until 1785, when David Morse obtained title to 100 acres. By 1792 the town was completely organized, and records for 1794 indicate that there were 32 freemen on its voter checklist. Centered on the hilltop near the Jail Branch, the town consisted mainly of small sheep farms that produced wool. Between 1820 and 1829 there were two fulling mills and one carding mill in operation, and sheep raising peaked circa 1830. Washington's population peaked at 1400 in 1840, after which there was a steady decline, as wool production decreased due to increasing tariffs and other factors. Most farms and homes around the center of town on the hilltop were abandoned, and the center of town relocated downhill and further north, along the Jail Branch and what is now Vermont Route 110. With the arrival of the railroad in the 1850s, the dairy industry expanded as urban markets became accessible. By 1895, Washington had enough dairy farms to make the operation of a creamery possible. As the granite industry grew in nearby towns, both it and the railroad bypassed Washington, which remained a low-population rural community centered on agriculture. By the twentieth century dairy farms were increasingly competitive, and by the 1950s many small farms had ceased operation. By 1960 Washington's population had declined to 565. Although Washington remains a rural community, most farms are no longer in operation, and the town has become a \\"bedroom community\\" whose residents commute to work in Barre, Montpelier, Burlington and other cities.

History Hale's Tavern in 1915 The area was first called Governor's Right because 500 acres (200 hectares) were granted to Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire. It was purchased by Er Chamberlin, who built a gristmill on the Wells River.Frederic P. Wells, History of Newbury, Vermont; The Caledonian Company, St. Johnsbury, Vermont 1902 Located at the head of navigation for the Connecticut River, Wells River developed as a center for trade. Canal boats guided by long poles floated downriver laden with lumber, clapboards and shingles, returning with goods such as iron, salt, rum and molasses. In the 1830s and 1840s, Jacob Kent Jr. was the proprietor of the Coosuck House, a well-known Wells River hotel. On November 6, 1848, the Connecticut & Passumpsic Rivers Railroad opened to Wells River, rendering obsolete the river's barge traffic. In 1853-1854, the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad reached Woodsville, New Hampshire across the Connecticut River. It built division offices and repair facilities, transforming that village into a booming railway town. The line replaced the 1805 bridge over the narrows to Wells River with a two-level wooden span which combined a toll highway deck at the bottom of the truss, with railroad tracks on the roof. In 1903, a steel bridge of similar configuration replaced it. In 1873, the Montpelier & Wells River Railroad was completed, enhancing the region's position as a railroad junction.

The town remained predominant agricultural until copper was discovered in nearby Vershire in 1813. With the opening of the Ely Copper Mine in 1821 the town rapidly began to grow. The mine became the site of Vermont's largest labor revolt, dubbed the 'Ely War,' in 1883. Unable to remain financially solvent the mine was sold to George Westinghouse. Combined with a fire that destroyed much of the town in 1910 and the mine's closure in 1920, West Fairlee's economy suffered immensely. Today the town is largely a bedroom community.

He called it \\"Navy.\\" Abner Allen, from Barton, Vermont, was the first settler in 1803. In 1825, the town of Navy changed its name to Charleston, presumably after a naval battle that had occurred off Charleston, South Carolina. During the Civil War Charleston furnished 121 enlisted men, thirty-five of whom were killed in action or died from the effects of wounds or disease contracted while in the service.Gazetteer of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, VT.; 1883-1884, Compiled and Published by Hamilton Child; May 1887 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town had a number of mills. The population hit a high of 1700. A round barn (not uncommon for the time and place) was erected in Charleston in 1908. It was possibly the largest such structure in New England. The barn burned to the ground in 1918, though the large stone foundation can still be seen along the Ten Mile Square Road.(unpublished- NorthWoods Stewardship Center)- \\"On the Banks of the Clyde: A Land Use and Cultural History of the NorthWoods Stewardship Center\\" A series of fires destroyed East Charleston May 18, 1921, and West Charleston on the following day.

The surface of the town is somewhat uneven, some portions being very low. The Clyde River is the largest stream in the town. It flows into Charleston, in a northwesterly direction nearly through its center. Falls are found on the river, especially in the western part of town, where it drops more than in , but its current is generally slow. Echo Lake, situated in the easterly part of the town, receives the waters of Lake Seymour in Morgan, and through that the waters of Holland Pond. Echo Lake is one mile (1.6 km) from East Charleston. It is one mile (1.6 km) and a half long and one mile (1.6 km) wide. General Whitelaw gave it the name of Echo Pond because when any sound was produced in its vicinity, it reverberated in various directions, producing a series of echoes. Pensioners Pond is the next in size, and was so named because of the pension of a revolutionary soldier who employed its water power. Toad Pond is above Pensioners Pond, near the great swamp on the Brownington line.

The population was 1,136 at the 2000 census. The town includes the unincorporated villages of Craftsbury, Craftsbury Common, Mill Village, North Craftsbury, and East Craftsbury. History The state granted the town to Ebenezer Crafts, Timothy Newell, and sixty-two associates, on November 6, 1780. They named it Minden. It was changed to Craftsbury, in honor of Ebenezer Crafts, on October 27, 1790. Crafts was the first settler in the county.Gazetteer of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, Vermont; 1883-1884, Compiled and Published by Hamilton Child; May 1887. North Craftsbury, later known as Craftsbury Common, was the first significant settlement in the town, and was for many years the center of culture and commerce, not only for Craftsbury, but for the greater region as well serving many of the neighboring towns. As mills multiplied around the town in the early 1800s additional settlements were made at Mill Village and in Craftsbury Village, while a predominantly Scottish settlement was made in East Craftsbury. In 1840, the town needed 12 school districts to administer its schools, because of poor road infrastructure. There were 1,200 people, predominately engaged in farming. They owned 333 horses, 1,718 cattle, 3,166 sheep, and 658 pigs. They produced of potatoes, oats, of other crops, of hay, and of maple sugar. The town had two gristmills, a hulling mill, two carding machine operations, ten sawmills, two fulling mills, three carriage makers, and one oil mill. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.7 square miles (102.9 km2), of which 39.3 square miles (101.7 km2) is land and 0.4 square mile (1.1 km2) (1.11%) is water. A view across Craftsbury Common showing the United Church of Craftsbury, and bandstand. Craftsbury is on a plateau on the Catamount Trail. There are many hills and valleys. The soil varies from alluvial meadows to clay and gravel. There are more numerous grades and varieties of soil than is usual. There are five ponds or lakes. Lake Elligo (also known as Eligo Pond) is partially in Greensboro. It is about two miles long and half a mile wide. Unusually, it has two outlets: one flows to the north and the other to the south. The northern outlet is one of the head branches of Black River. The southern flows through Little Elligo Pond and on to the Lamoille River in Hardwick. The eastern shore rises to cliffs. The western shore rises gradually. Near the center of the pond are two small islands. The lake was formerly a hunting-ground of the St. Francis Indians, who named it Elligo Scoloon. The others are Great Hosmer Pond, lying partly in Albany, Little Hosmer Pond, and two other small ponds. The Black River is the main river in town. It was called Elligo-sigo by the natives. Its current is slow. The drop from its source to Lake Memphremagog, including the falls at Irasburg and Coventry, is 190 feet. Wild branch, a tributary of the Lamoille, rises in Eden and flows through the western part of the town. The valley of the Black river in Craftsbury is a muck bed averaging a quarter of a mile in width. Geology Geologically, the town varies in its structure to an unusual degree. There is granite in the east part of town. This alternates with gneiss and mica slate. In the central portions of town, the previous rocks are replaced by dark argillaceous slate. This alternates with siliceous limestone. These rocks are from the Devonian Period and are part of the Waits River Formation. The rocks on the west side of the Black River also vary. These are older rocks from the Cambrian Period, Moretown Formation. State Route 14 runs along a seam where these east and west rock formation converge. Strata of mica slate, argellaceous, and chlorite slates, and limestones, alternate. An extensive deposit of gray granite is near Craftsbury village. It is broken on the surface. This rock is filled with nodules of black mica and quartz, in concentric layers. These are about one inch in diameter. In much of the area, the biotite orbicules are so numerous that a hundred may be counted within a circle two feet in diameter. In some parts of the ledge these nodules are flattened, as if subjected to an immense vertical pressure when the mass was in a semi-fluid state. In the nineteenth century these rocks were once believed to be unique from any other found in America or Europe. Today, it is known that they resemble those found in Bethel granite. As the last glacial period ended, part of the town became submerged under the transient Lake Winooski which drained when its ice dam melted 14,000 years ago.

Portus Baxter and David Camp were Underground Railroad agents before the Civil War. On October 31, 1866, the town erected a granite monument at Derby Center in honor of those who died in the Civil War.

This increased the land size of Derby so it became the largest in Orleans County. Like many Orleans County towns, Derby grew in population until 1890, after which the depression (then called \\"panics\\") of 1893 affected the local economy and agricultural prices. Population fluctuated until it hit a bottom in 1940. The town has grown steadily since.Vermont Genealogy Resources - Derby, Orleans County In 1917, the city of Newport was formed from portions of the towns of Newport (the former village of Newport) and Derby (the former village of West Derby).

The population was 673 at the 2010 census. The village is located on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and is contiguous with the district of Rock Island in the town of Stanstead, Quebec. Notable buildings include the Haskell Free Library and Opera House. History The village was incorporated in 1791. It lies on an elevation at the far north of Derby, which was chartered on October 29, 1779 and first settled in 1795. By 1859, the area was noted for the beauty of its farmhouses and luxuriant farmland, set before the distant vista of Lake Memphremagog and the Green Mountains.Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 Because of an erratic survey, the border separating Canada from the United States was drawn incorrectly by the surveyors in the 18th century, above the 45th parallel which was the agreed boundary. Derby Line was founded based on that line, above the 45th parallel. The boundary was confirmed by the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty in 1842. Description Derby Line is known for the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a line house deliberately constructed on the international border and opened in 1904. The donors were a binational couple: Carlos F. Haskell was a local American businessman who owned a number of sawmills, while Martha Stewart Haskell was Canadian. The intent was that people on both sides of the border would have use of the facility, which is now a designated historic site. Patrons of the library from either side of the border may use the facility without going through border security. Besides the library, five inhabited structures are divided by the border. Most residents use the US entrances to avoid problems with the border patrol; crossing the border within buildings does not require official permission. A tool-and-die factory, once operated by the Butterfield division of Litton Industries, is also divided. The factory in Canada closed in 1982 after a lengthy strike by Canadian workers. The factory in Derby Line is open. It was bought in 1988 by Group Tivoly, a cutting tools company based in France, and has 160 employees. There are ramifications to living directly on the border of another country. For example, the US Border Patrol expressed a desire to close off streets which have historically run together with those of Stanstead Town. [In many US locales the term for such a political entity is \\"township\\"]. Border officials were concerned about illegal immigration. In 2007, the village of Derby Line met with the Mayor and Council of Stanstead in joint session in Qu√©bec, to be addressed by the authorities. Ironically, this meant that the Vermont village's trustee meeting was held in a foreign country, following Vermont procedural rules.

As of the 2010 census, the town's population was 1,122. It contains two unincorporated villages, Glover and West Glover. The town is named for Brigadier General John Glover, who served in the American Revolutionary War. He was the prime proprietor of the town. Glover is home to three museums: the Bread & Puppet Museum, the Glover Historical Society museum, and the Museum of Everyday Life. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 38.6 square miles (100.0 km2), of which 37.9 square miles (98.1 km2) is land and 0.7 square mile (1.9 km2) (1.92%) is water. The surface of the town is uneven, with hills and valleys. The highest elevation is Black Hills, at , in the south part of town.Orleans County Vermont Summits The town drains northward via the northern branches of the Barton River, and southward via branches of the Passumpsic, Lamoille, and Black Rivers, which have their sources here. Four ponds of considerable size also are found here, Parker Pond, in the north, Clark's pond, in the central, and Sweeney pond in the west, as well as Shadow Lake.Gazetteer of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, VT.; 1883-1884, Compiled and Published by Hamilton Child; May 1887 Shadow Lake was first called Chambers Pond, then Stone Pond about 1822. In 1922 it was given its current name. The Abenaki had called it Pekdabowk, or Smoke Pond. History In 1802, the town decided to construct one school at the Parker settlement. Operating expenses were limited to $20 for that year. In the most cataclysmic natural catastrophe affecting Orleans County in post-Columbian times, the banks of Glover's Long Pond gave way on June 6, 1810, and flooded the Barton River valley. The hero of the day was laborer Spencer Chamberlain who ran ahead of the flood to warn people at the mill. The wayward pond was forever after known as \\"Runaway Pond\\". By 1851, there were 450 grammar school students. In 2017, the number of students at that level had dropped to about 100. From about the 1820s to the 1930s, there was a settlement, Slab City, near the outlet from Shadow Lake, whose economy was dependent on the logging, and three sawmills in the area. The settlement also contained a lime kiln, butter tub factory, a cider mill, a one-room schoolhouse, a post office, a church, and other allied businesses. In 1836, a suit against the height of the water retained in a dam to power the sawmills was successful. The suit was motivated in large part by the Runaway Pond catastrophe. The end of the dam power marked the beginning of the end for Slab City. The unincorporated village of West Glover had a municipal septic system which failed in 2008. This was replaced in 2012. It connected to the main sewage line in Glover village, which in turns was connected to the wastewater treatment facility in adjacent Barton. This was funded by USDA Rural Development Agency.

History Greensboro was chartered in 1781. The town was named for Timothy Green, one of the original charter recipients and an original landowner under the charter. However, there is no evidence that he ever visited the town, and his land was sold for non-payment of taxes a few decades after he received it.Peter D.

In 1781, the blockhouse's party of four was attacked by Abenaki; two were killed and two were captured.:22-23 A second road was built by Timothy Hinman between 1791 and 1793. This road, which came to be known as the Hinman Settler Road, branched off from the Bayley-Hazen in Greensboro and continued to Derby. These two roads were of major importance to the settlement of northern Vermont.:23 The town sent many soldiers to fight in the Civil War. Of eight prisoners of war from the town, confined to Andersonville Prison, one returned. In the early 20th century, a development near the Highland Lodge contained restrictive covenants in the title forbidding subsequent resale to Jews. These restrictions were found to be illegal by the US Supreme Court in 1948. The Highland Lodge opened in 1954. It had a hotel and restaurant that was open year-round. It had a beach on Caspian Lake with sailboats, kayaks, and canoes; children's play programs and nature programs in the summer and nature hikes and cross-country ski trails in the winter.

Irasburg was established in 1781 when the land was granted to Ira Allen, Roger Enos, Jerusha Enos (wife of Roger Enos), Jerusha Enos, Jr. (wife of Ira Allen), Roger Enos, Jr. and others by the Vermont General Assembly. Ira Allen later obtained the rights of the other proprietors, and he deeded the town to Jerusha Enos, Jr. as a wedding gift.Marjorie A. Orcutt, Edward S. Alexander, A History of Irasburg, Vermont, 1989, page 20 In 2010 the US census reported that there were 1096 citizens living in Irasburg. Irasburg has a total land area of , being land and being water. On average, it snows 9 out of the 12 months of the year. History The land now known as Irasburg, Vermont, was granted on February 23, 1781, to Ira Allen, by the General Assembly of Vermont. At this point in time, the lands of Vermont were claimed by both New Hampshire and New York. The Continental Congress ordered that the land would not be distributed until the inhabitants of New York, New Hampshire, and the land known as \\"Vermont\\" resolved the conflict of who truly owned the land. The General assembly of Vermont ignored this order however and Vermont was granted to 40-70 individuals. Ira Allen, the person known to have been granted the most land, was born in Colchester in 1790 and attended Middlebury College and the University of Vermont. The Allens leased the land which they had received to settlers. Although Ira Allen was the first to be granted land, Irasburg's first settler was Caleb Leach in 1798. No land was conveyed by deed however, until Ira H. Allen, son of Ira Allen, became town resident in 1814 and served as town clerk. Captain James Richardson settled Irasburg in 1803 and is believed to have opened the first tavern in Town. The production of salts and pearl-ashes was the primary industry in Irasburg for the beginning of the 19th century. Although there was an embargo, these goods were transported to Canada. During this time, there was a large amount of smuggling of the salts and pearl-ashes by town residents. Mills emerged in Irasburg as early as 1810. By the 1820s, the town began to prosper as industrial sites began to emerge which included, a woolen mill, tannery, and factory production of stoves and plows. The Old Heerman Mill was located here.

The first courthouse and jail were built in 1815, by Irasburg residents at their own expense. The original courthouse was moved in 1847 however, and a new one was built on the same site. The original jail was built of timber, and was replaced by one which was made of stone in 1838. This was eventually made of one made of granite in 1862. In 1862, Company E of the 9th Vermont Infantry was recruited, in part, from Irasburg. In 1877, the town was still spelled \\"Irasburgh.\\" The original county courthouse burned, with all its records, in 1910 or 1911. A new Irasburg Town Hall was built in 1911 and remodeled in 1990.

Geology Circa 400 million years ago, large and slow moving upheavals formed the serpentine rock and the asbestos fiber which sometimes accompanies serpentine. This serpentine comprises Brown's Ledges at the Lowell-Westfield border. A rare fern species, Adiantum viridimontanum, grows which can tolerate the high nickel content of serpentine. Serpentine also contains iron, so much so that some rocks can be magnetized. This affects where cell towers can be placed in town.

During the first half of the nineteenth century, the population inflow was predominantly from other states of the US. In the second half the new arrivals were more often foreign-born - from Ireland and from French-speaking Canada. By 1870 the population was 944 and it reached its peak in 1890 when it stood at 1,178. Farming and lumber were its main economic base. Dairy products and hardwood were both exported to other states. Silsby and Company lumber mill closed in the 1920s. This loss of jobs resulted in a population drop of 40% between 1920 and 1940. Several tons of asbestos were mined in 1870. By 1910, Lowell produced half the asbestos mined in the United States. Lumber exports stopped by 1930. Farming has experienced a slow but steady decline since 1930 or so. Consistent with all of Vermont‚Äôs Northeast Kingdom, Lowell lost population throughout most of the twentieth century. This trend reversed in the mid-1980s. The asbestos mine in Lowell was of economic importance from the 1940s to the mid-1980s. In the mid-1940s, the Belvidere mines produced more than 90% of all U.S. asbestos. In 1967, the mine produced of asbestos fiber [sic] annually. It closed in 1992. The Shortsleve Mink Farm was located here. In 2008, the town supported the Democratic candidate for president 225 to 151, yet voted for the local Republican challenger for the Vermont Legislature 229 to 79 to 71 (three parties). In 2008, the state warned residents of the town and nearby towns that there was a \\"health risk\\" for people living within a radius of the asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain. Above ground mill tailings were estimated at . In April 2009,the Vermont Department of Health released a revised study which found that all deaths related to the asbestos mine were caused by occupational exposure. The report also concluded that people living near the mines had no increased risk of asbestos-related illness than people living anywhere else in Vermont.http://healthvermont.gov/enviro/asbestos/vagm-healthstudy.aspx However, the site will still need to be cleaned up. In 2009, the expected cost of cleanup was $300 million. In 2012 Kingdom Community Wind, built by Green Mountain Power in cooperation with Vermont Electric Cooperative, began operation. With a nameplate capacity of over 63 MW, the 21 turbines produce enough power to meet the annual needs of over 24,000 average Vermont residences, and is the largest wind farm in the state of Vermont.

With a population of 818 at the 2010 census, it is the largest village in the county.See Historical U.S. Census totals for Orleans County, Vermont#Villages History Roger Enos purchased land in 1820 in the area from Ira Allen. He had been given a land grant as a veteran in lieu of pay after the Revolutionary War; he may also have purchased this parcel from Herman Allen. It was named \\"Barton Landing\\"; this was the first place where craft could be safely loaded for transportation down the Barton River to Lake Memphremagog. It was at the confluence of the Willoughby and Barton rivers, providing sufficient water for flotation. Enos built the first building, a sawmill, at the confluence. Jesse Cook bought this building in 1830 to convert to a textile mill for weaving cloth, part of the northern economy using cotton from the South. In 1839 John Little converted it into a grain mill. Lovinas Chandler bought this building in 1869 to use as a lumber mill. His son, who founded the E. L. Chandler Company, expanded the business here and in Barton Village in the 1890s. About the turn of the 20th century, Parker Young Company bought this complex of buildings. The 1928 flood ruined these buildings, together with causing other damage throughout the region. Parker Young sold these properties back to E.L. Chandler. The owners developed the Sweat-Comings Company, the Vermont American Corporation, and finally, the Baumritter Corporation. The latter's furniture division expanded from a payroll of $120,000 in 1954 to $2,500,000 in 1968. Then it was sold to Ethan Allen Manufacturing. In 1833, the Valley House was built as a restaurant and tavern. In 1875 twenty rooms were added for an inn. The building was destroyed by fire in 1998. The railroad reached the town in 1859‚Äì1860. Railroad accidents were not uncommon. On November 9, 1909, a crew member was killed in a head-on collision between two locomotives, just north of the rail intersection with Main Street. Near the same place, on March 12, 1913, another head-on collision killed one of the crew. The town changed its name to Orleans in 1908 by popular vote, to the name of the county. In the late 1910s, the Ku Klux Klan was first revived in Atlanta. It gradually expanded into northern and midwestern cities, where anxieties about migration, immigration, and social changes had heightened because of rapid industrialization and movement of peoples. The KKK promoted itself as a fraternal organization, among many that had been started since the late 19th century. In this period, it was primarily opposed to Catholic and Jewish immigrants, but kept some of its racist background. A chapter was started in Orleans. A 1918 photograph shows children at the old Opera House, a number of them dressed in KKK hoods, and others in blackface. In the late 1970s, as efforts were made to improve water quality and the environment, the federal and state governments stopped the village from dumping raw sewage into the Barton River. Orleans built a new treatment plant, which cost $2.8 million, 90% of which was paid for by state and federal governments. The village disconnected its old storm sewers from the sanitary sewage system. In 1999, the local Ethan Allen plant employed 600 workers. This dropped substantially in the 21st century, as it moved some manufacturing offshore or to areas with lower labor costs.

These Indians were nearly starving, which probably arose from the moose and deer, which formerly abounded here, being destroyed by the settlers. Their principal employment was making baskets, birch-bark cups and pails, and other Indian trinkets. They left in the spring and never returned. One of the party was a squaw, Molly Orcutt, who became quite noted among the settlers as a healer. She was found dead on Mount white Cap, in East Andover, Maine, in 1817, having died, it is believed, at an age of 140 years.Gazetteer of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, VT.; 1883-1884, Compiled and Published by Hamilton Child; May 1887 Dr. Levi Moore and A.j.

Since Chittenden County had a town named Westford, in 1787 the name was changed to Westmore. The first vacation house was built on the lake in 1860. It is known as the Cheney House, named after an owner in the late 19th century. Westmore never attracted many settlers. The town's peak population was in the census year of 1880 with 485 people. Before he became famous, Robert Frost camped here in the summer of 1909 with his family. Songadeewin Camp for girls was located here in the 1920s-1940s.Not to be confused with a camp of the same name operating on Lake Dunmore in 2007. Electricity became available at the south end of the lake, from West Burke, circa 1934. In 1970, the state of Vermont acquired as part of Willoughby State Forest, which included the Cheney House.

FootnotesExternal links Category:Towns in Vermont Category:Towns in Orleans County, Vermont ","title":"Westmore, Vermont"},{"id":"137385","text":"Benson is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,056 at the 2010 census. The town is rural, with a concentration of several homes and businesses in Benson Village, at the intersection of Stage Road and Lake Road. Benson village is the centerpiece of a complex local economy that includes obstacle courses, a taco truck, the Wheel Inn tavern, a general store, an alpaca farm, a museum, a town transfer station, a do-it-yourself furniture store, a bookshop, three antique stores, a tungsten mine,a sandwich shop, and a quaint Bed and Breakfast throughout the town's main road. Government As is the tradition of many towns in rural New England, the municipal government enjoys a degree of autonomy from the county and employs only a few essential service-providers. The democratically elected Selectboard and Town Clerk decide on an annual budget for road crews, educators, and law enforcers. Town committees set the protocols of town policy with particular focus on the town's annual budget, which is decided annually on Town Meeting Day. The Town Meeting is an assembly of all adult registered voters in the town, and the assembly usually draws a crowd approaching 40 citizens. These forty citizens help to determine the direction of town planning, in particular the areas of road maintenance, public safety, fire protection, public holidays, local taxation, communication, housing and development, agriculture, foreign policy, rural electrification, fence viewing, tourism, tungsten extraction, and the maintenance and safety of the town dump. On the state level, Benson is currently a part of the Addison-Rutland-1 district and represented in the Vermont House of Representatives by Will Stevens (I-Shoreham). As part of Rutland County, it is represented in the State Senate by Senator Peg Flory (R), Senator Brian Collamore (R), and Senator Kevin Mullin (R). Traditionally, Benson's politics have trended to the right, but a growing alt-right or Third Position movement among some members of the town has led them to reconsider the orientation of the town towards the areas of road maintenance, public safety, fire protection, public holidays, local taxation, communication, housing and development, agriculture, foreign policy, rural electrification, fence viewing, tourism, tungsten extraction, and the maintenance and safety of the town dump. Public safety The town employs a town constable, but most law enforcement is handled by the Vermont State Police. The amount of crime in Benson is negligible when compared with the nearby communities of Orwell and Shoreham who respectively ranked second and tenth in recidivism and repeat offenders as of 2012. Even so, Benson has faced the growing drug epidemic in rural New England, and the use of illegal substances is on the rise across all ages and demographics. Ambulance services are provided by Benson First Response and the Fair Haven Rescue Squad. The nearest hospitals are Rutland Regional Medical Center and Middlebury's historic Porter Hospital. Benson also operates a small, entirely volunteer fire department, who respond to more motor vehicle crashes then fires. This volunteer department also sponsors an ice and swift water rescue team. . Assistance in fighting particularly large fires is provided by other neighboring volunteer fire departments, including Fair Haven, Castleton, Hubbardton, West Haven and Orwell, and Poultney. Similarly, Benson's volunteer firefighters occasionally respond to large blazes and calls for water rescue in other local towns when the opportunity presents itself. Politics A majority of Benson's residents voted against Republican George W. Bush in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, according to the Rutland Herald. Simultaneously, Benson voters supported Republican Governor Jim Douglas and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders. As was the trend in the rest of Rutland County, voters were split on the issue of state senators, with Democrat Bill Carris and Republicans Hull P. Maynard, Jr. and Kevin J. Mullin receiving votes in numbers consistent with their county-wide victories. Economy The local economy is driven by a number of small businesses centered in the central village center also known as the central business district centered on the intersection of Center Road and Stage Road. The former C.J. Williamson store, a local greengrocery and gas station began the town's economic development and differentiation from the greater Fair Haven area. The Williamson store opened in 1912, shortly after the proprietor survived a bear attack while hiking in the Green Mountains. The Williamson store was soon joined by a tavern known as the Wheel Inn, which provides American fare and serves as the center of local intrigue. On the same site, there was an American Revolutionary War-era public house that served as a meeting place for American and British soldiers during the tense 1770s. Other restaurants, such as an Arby's Roast Beef sandwich shop came and went, but the Wheel Inn remained in near-constant operation through the 2010s.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 11 Other economic engines of the town include the Benson Tungsten Mine, a convenience store, and an herbal tobacconist. Benson has had a substantial downturn economically since the reduction in number of total employees at the Benson Tungsten Mine. As of January 2016, only 200 of the town's nearly 1,000 residents were employed in Tungsten extraction, processing, or administration. This number has been steadily decreasing, to the point that Benson's elementary school has changed its moniker from the \\"Benson Tungsten Miners\\" to the \\"Benson Golden Eagles\\" in honor of golden eagles, which are sparingly found in the area. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.36%, is water, consisting of lakes, streams, rivers, ponds, swamps, wetlands, creeks, brooks, oceans, seas, waterfalls, cataracts, bayous, canals, harbors and reservoirs. Benson has of town roads, streets, highways, courts, freeways, toll roads, expressways, parkways, greenbelts, carriageways, ways, fords, or bridges. The Benson Sycamore Tree is a local institution, located on Stage Road at the former estate of Lieutenant Colonel John Trutor.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 10 Before Lieutenant Colonel Trutor purchased the property on Stage Road, it was a local inn that served tourists who trekked through the state's roads and railways. Two of the most famous individuals who stayed at the inn were John Blackburn and Karl Suessdorf, who wrote the song \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" while staying at the inn.Sheila Davis (1984) The Craft of Lyric Writing , Writer's Digest Books, Cincinnati Blackburn and Seussdorf memorialized the Sycamore tree, a massive specimen, in the song's lyrics. A small plaque makes reference to this historical moment of musicianship on Stage Road, opposite the home. History While nobody seems to be quite sure as to the precise origin of the town's name, most historians over the years have speculated that it was named for Egbert Benson, a respected lawyer and Revolutionary War officer, who was instrumental in negotiating the land claim which New York had made to Vermont ‚Äî a congressionally mandated prerequisite for Vermont joining the Union as a state of its own, rather than being divided between New York and New Hampshire.John J. Duff et al., The Vermont Encyclopedia, \\"Benson\\" Benson residents have entered into some disputes over the history of the town in the recent publication \\"Remembering Benson\\" over the origin of the town's name.Karen Barber, Tom Bartholemew et. al, \\"Remembering Benson.\\" Benson, Vermont: Town of Benson Vermont, 2012. Lilian Snyder Philips Smith, who moved to Benson in 1948, claimed that her late husband Percy Phillips' great-great grandfather Benson Philips was an early selectman responsible for chartering the town's first primary school in 1813.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 17 This was contradicted by Leonard Lussier, who questioned Mrs. Snyder Philips Smith's account as \\"probably malarkey.\\"\\"Remembering Benson, p. 18 Benson's political history has been checkered with Tory, Republican, Progressive, and Know Nothing sentiments. Local Historian Genevieve Trutor expressed surprise at Benson's progressive streak, noting that the brief tenure of 1920s representative Susannah W. Nifong was surprising to locals as well as anyone who might consider the prevalent political conditions at the time.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 20 Mrs. Trutor was an active feminist agitator during her own time, arguing for women to be engaged in front-line combat during World War II.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 21 The Benson Tungsten Mine opened in 1968, near the junction of Stage Road and Vermont Route 22A, under the directorship of Kenneth Farnswell, a local speculator and entrepreneur.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 53 The tungsten mine proved to be a source of town employment and pride throughout the economically turbulent 1970s, and still plays a role as the largest tungsten mine in the state of Vermont. One of the mine's older shafts was in the process of being converted to a tourist attraction as of 2016. The 1976 United States Bicentennial celebrations became a point of great national and town pride, as the town's rivalry with neighboring Orwell intensified over which town would hold a better celebration. Although there was no formal victor, Benson's parade still maintains an important part in the town's history, while Orwell's Chicken Dinner has been largely forgotten. The opening of the town's Arby's was the height of the festivities, making its grand debut on August 8, 1976, as part of the Benson Day celebration.\\"Remembering Benson, p. 29 Francis Munger remembered the day as \\"one of the greatest moments in my town's history\\", reflecting the general feeling of hope and optimism the fast- food franchise brought to the local economy. The Arby's would not last out the decade, and Benson's economy fell into a slump that it would not recover from until the late 2000s. In 1994, the town became briefly infamous for failing to approve its school budget eighteen times before it finally passed, a national record at the time.

Castleton is about to the west of Rutland, the county's seat and most populous city, and about east of the New York/Vermont state border. The town had a population of 4,717 at the 2010 census. Castleton University is located there, with roots dating to 1787. History Print of Castleton from 1889 by L.R. Burleigh with listing of landmarks Castleton was settled in 1770, and chartered in 1761. The charter for of land was granted by Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire and divided the land into 70 \\"rights\\" or \\"shares\\". Governor Wentworth retained ownership of two shares, and several others were given for churches and a school. Three families had settled in Castleton by 1770. In the spring of 1767, some of the town's first settlers, Amos Bird and Noah Lee, arrived in Castleton from Salisbury, Connecticut. Castleton's favorite landmark, Birdseye Mountain, is named for Colonel Amos Bird. He had acquired 40 shares of land when the town was chartered and built a permanent residence there in the summer of 1769. More settlers followed, and by 1777 the town consisted of 17 families. In May 1775 Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys met in Castleton with Benedict Arnold to plan their next day's attack on Fort Ticonderoga, west, on the New York side of Lake Champlain. Their successful capture of the fort was a holding action that lasted two years until the British launched a powerful sweep southward on Lake Champlain. The battle at nearby Hubbardton, followed by battles at Bennington and Saratoga, marked the turning point of the Revolutionary War in the North. Although German soldiers were stationed in Castleton for a time in 1777, they left as the fortunes of the war changed, and Tory sympathizers were treated with scorn by Castleton settlers. Fort Warren, built in 1777, was also located in Castleton. The first medical school in Vermont was chartered here in 1818. Following the war, Castleton continued to grow as an agricultural community. Farmers raised cattle, and then turned for a while to sheep. Saw mills and gristmills were the first industries established in town. During the 19th century the slate and marble industries thrived in and around Castleton. The railroad came in 1854, and the last half of the century saw the development of tourism around Lake Bomoseen. In the 19th century Castleton flourished, and many residents built elaborate houses to replace their log cabins and primitive frame houses. Several luxury hotels were built around the west end of the lake. A trolley system ran from the center of town to Lake Bomoseen, a destination for tourists vacationing during the summer. The Hydeville area flourished in the mid-19th century as a slate quarrying and milling center. Between 1900 and 1940 several fires occurred in Castleton Village, Castleton Corners and Hydeville, as well as at the lakeside resorts. Despite this destruction of hotels and the original commercial and industrial areas of its villages, the town of Castleton retains an architectural heritage spanning two hundred years of Vermont history. Castleton's mile-long tree-shaded Main Street, with its array of Federal and Greek Revival style houses and public buildings, many by builder Thomas Royal Dake, has been listed almost in its entirety on the National Register of Historic Places. Arts and culture=Museums and other points of interest  The Higley House was built in 1810 by Erastus Higley, and houses antiques and furnishings. Antique carriages are located on the grounds. The house is now maintained by the Castleton Historical Society, and was built and lived in by the Higley family until 1973. The Castleton Federated Church was built in 1833 by master builder Thomas Dake. The church is listed in the Historic American Buildings Survey. Education Castleton is part of the Castleton- Hubbardton Union School District. The town has two schools: Castleton Elementary School, which serves grades K‚Äì6, and the Castleton Village School, which serves grades 7 and 8. Students from Castleton families attend high school at Fair Haven Union High School. Castleton University is located in Castleton and dates back to 1787. It is a public liberal arts college. Infrastructure=Transportation In 2009, Castleton began running a depot station through Amtrak. The station is located behind Main Street near the post office.

The population was 1,741 at the 2010 census. Proctor is home to the Vermont Marble Museum and Wilson Castle. History Loading marble in 1908 In the early 19th century, small high-quality marble deposits were discovered in Rutland, and in the 1830s a large deposit of nearly solid marble of high quality was found in what is now West Rutland. By the 1840s small firms had begun operations, but marble quarries only became profitable when the railroad came to Rutland in 1851. At the same time, the famous quarries of Carrara in Tuscany, Italy, became largely unworkable because of their extreme depth, and Rutland quickly became one of the leading producers of marble in the world. This fueled enough growth and investment that in 1886 the marble companies saw to it that when the present Rutland City was incorporated as a village, most of the town was split off as West Rutland and Proctor, which between them contained the bulk of the marble quarries. Proctor was formed around the nucleus of the old Sutherland Falls from parts of Rutland and Pittsford. Proctor was named for and almost completely owned by Senator Redfield Proctor. The closing of the marble quarries in the town in the 1980s and 1990s cost the area many jobs, and Proctor has struggled much more than its neighbors.

History  Berlin was chartered June 8, 1763.Book of Charters, P. 473-474: \\"‚Ä¶is hereby incorporated into a township by the name of Berlin.\\" The name refers to Berlin, Germany, and was the only German town name in this new English colony.Close-by Montpelier resembles Montpellier in south France; the name Middlesex was copied from a county in England. The grantees who received the 70 original rights to the township were priests, merchants and judges. The charter was issued by the Royal Governor of New Hampshire, Benning Wentworth, and stated that each \\"proprietor, settler or inhabitant\\" should pay one ear of Indian corn for each acre of land, and after ten years, one shilling for each 100 acres. It took 22 years until the first settlers arrived in the area: Ebenezer Sanborn coming from nearby Corinth, founding the \\"Bradford farm\\", and Joseph Thurber from New Hampshire, founding the \\"Shepard farm\\". Both left a year later for New York state. In 1788 a legislature of the state of Vermont stated that \\"the town of Randolph, Braintree, Brookfield, Roxbury, Williamstown, Northfield, Wildersburgh, Berlin and Montpelier [...] hereby are formed into one entire probate district, by the name of the district of Randolph.\\"Legislative Acts, State of Vermont, October 15, 1888. Jacob Fowler, a hunter, was the first settler who stayed and left descendants in town. Other early settlers were Moses Smith, Daniel Morse, John Lathrop, and Hezekiah Silloway. In 1789 thirteen families lived in Berlin, and eight more in 1790. The first child born in Berlin was Abigail Black (1789). The first town meeting was held on March 31, 1791.First town meeting at the dwelling-house of Aaron Strong; James Sawyer, moderator, David Nye, clerk, Zachariah Perrin, Eleazer Hubbard and James Sawyer, selectmen; Micajah Ingham, constable. The first sawmill was built in the same year, the first school (on East Street) in 1794. The first Christian institution was founded in 1798, with James Hobart as its minister. A Congregational meeting house opened at Berlin center in 1803. After it burned down in 1838 the Congregational Church was built at Berlin Corner.

The population was 1,607 at the 2010 census. Calais is homophonous with callous.Such pronunciation is attested by Robert Browning in his De Gustibus \\"When fortune's malice / Lost her---Calais)---\\" Calais contains the unincorporated communities of Adamant, East Calais, North Calais, Kent's Corner, Maple Corner and Pekin. History Old West Church on Christmas Eve Colonel Jacob Davis named Calais after the French port city of the same name, during a time of general enthusiasm for things French as a result of France's aid during the American Revolution. The Wheelocks and Parkers were the first families to settle the town, in the latter part of the 18th century. In the early and mid 19th century, the Vermont wool industry spawned sheep pastures in the town. Photographs of the time show a heavily de-forested Calais. Like many small Vermont towns, Calais was devastated by the Civil War. Volunteers from Calais flocked to the Union cause, most serving in the Army's volunteer regiments. In the post-Civil War era, agriculture turned from sheep to dairy, and new families came to fill farms that were sold by the families and widows of Civil War veterans. Historical landmarks * Kents Corner * Old West Church * Maple Corner * Robinson Saw Mill * Adamant Co-op Village histories Calais once had a village called Sodom. This name was allegedly given because the village had no church, though it did have a few active quarries. In 1905, the residents petitioned the state legislature to change the name to Adamant, chosen to suggest the hardness of granite. Pekin is named after Peking (now Beijing), China, the result of a local farmer who had a friend who was a missionary to China. The missionary sent some Chinese wheat back to Vermont, the farmer planted it, and it flourished. It became the style to give directions using the wheat field as a landmark (\\"up by the Pekin wheat\\", or \\"just past the Pekin wheat\\"). Eventually, the location of the field came to be known simply as Pekin. Another version suggests that the missionary sent back rice, and that the farmer planted the rice in a low-lying plain, which flooded each spring. The river came to be known as Peking Brook, later and presently Pekin Brook.

Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.9 square miles (103.2 km2), of which 39.7 square miles (102.7 km2) is land and 0.2 square mile (0.5 km2), or 0.53%, is water. History The town of Middlesex was granted by royal charter on June 8, 1763, by New Hampshire colonial governor Benning Wentworth. The town takes its boundaries from Waterbury, incorporated the previous day, and Worcester, which received its grant the same day as Middlesex. The source of the town's name is uncertain but it is supposed Wentworth, or a staff member, chose the name for its location between Waterbury and Worcester. Another possibility would be that Wentworth chose Middlesex to seek favor from English nobleman Charles Sackville who held the title Lord Middlesex until 1765, when he became Duke of Dorset. The town remained largely undeveloped through the period of the Vermont Republic and early Vermont statehood, with settlements in the village and Putnamville. The Putnam family were among the first settlers of the town. Seth Putnam was elected first town clerk in 1790; brothers Isaac and Jacob Putnam were elected town surveyors. Middlesex village, situated along the Winooski River, is the town's chief settlement and location of the town hall. Middlesex Village obtained a post office in 1821 (that office closed in 1966). Middlesex Center is, as the name suggests, in the near center of the town situated northwest of the Great Brook and Brook Road. Shady Rill is rolling, mostly lowland where three brooks-Herrick, Martins, and Patterson, each named for a local family, converge with the North Branch which runs south to Wrightsville and Montpelier. A northern affiliation Baptist church was built in Shady Rill in 1849. The village of Putnamville is located along the town's eastern border along the North Branch River. A waterfall there once powered grist and saw mills. A post office was opened in Putnamville, incongruously titled Putnamsville, in 1882 (this post office closed in 1935). Wrightsville, just south of Putnamville, was once a sizable settlement with nearly 30 built structures, and several mills. The Wrightsville Dam, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps 1933-35 in response to the 1927 flood, caused that settlement to be disbanded. The Northbranch Cemetery was moved southwest to Portal Road, and a majority of the mostly Greek Revival houses were moved west up the hill to where the old Hood place presently stands. Off Portal Road and Bolduc Road is Tangletown Road, which takes its name from an area of town nicknamed Tangletown because the woods there are so thick and so alike that settlers reported getting \\"tangled up\\" (lost) in the area. The town had a large bear population well into the late nineteenth century. A recorded story tells of a farmer located between Middlesex Center and Bear Swamp finding one of his sheep killed by a bear. The farmer and his wife immediately walked their property to take stock of their flock. The farmer spotted a bear and killed it, soon afterward his wife called out that she sighted one and he shot that one, the couple returned to the barnyard and spotted a third bear-this one eating another of their sheep, and the farmer shot that bear as well. The area received the nickname Beartown. Through most of the nineteenth century and well into the mid-twentieth century, the primary economic activity was farming. Dairy farming, sheep herding (for wool), logging, orchards and maple sugaring have all been part of the town's economy. Following the end of World War II, the town slowly transitioned to becoming a place to live for people who worked elsewhere, mostly in Montpelier.

Culture Although Plainfield is similar to many other rural New England towns by the numbers (size, population, etc.), it has a distinct flair which sets it apart from most surrounding communities. Goddard College attracts a liberal, educated population that at one time made up a significant portion of the townspeople. Goddard alumni include Mumia Abu-Jamal, members of the band Phish, David Mamet, Piers Anthony, Mary Edwards, onetime State Historian H. Allen Soule Jr., and abstract artists including Robert M. Fisher and James Gahagan. Plainfield was home to noted composer and builder of the first American village style gamelan, Dennis Murphy. The town currently has two restaurants; one located in the village center with New York-style pizza, and the other a cafe on US Route 2. The village also has a community food co- op and community center open to non-members and featuring local products, a used bookshop, and a community maintained flower garden, all within several hundred feet of each other. The town has a unique public library, the Cutler Memorial Library, and is home to an environmentally progressive biodiesel station. Plainfield is also home to the historic Allenwood Farm. Plainfield's atmosphere is distinct from popular tourist destinations in Vermont such as Stowe, and Woodstock in that its commercial activity is generated primarily by local residents. There are a number of active local groups such as the Plainfield Historical Society and the Plainfield Area Community Association, which sponsor community activities, like the annual Old Home Days. Plainfield, like a number of Vermont towns, retains the influence of the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s. A number of people came to stay for good and continue to run organic farms. This older generation has now joined with the newer, younger sustainable agriculture movement and the food renaissance in Vermont. While the college, Goddard, has suffered a decline in recent years, the town nevertheless retains an ethos of activism, community and solidarity (except on Town Meeting day when everyone voices their opinion loudly). Community spirit and solidarity was demonstrated in 2013, when the town raised the most money per capita for Vermont Public Radio and thus earned an Ice Cream Social from Ben and Jerry's. The radio station housed at Goddard College, WGDR, continues to serve as a community voice and link for area residents. The newly renovated Plainfield Town Hall Opera House (circa 1841) boasts a footprint of 55' 9\\" along the eaves, 42' 4\\" across the gables, and is a popular destination for local concerts and performances.  Government  Plainfield is governed by a Board of selectmen. Plainfield's Board of Selectmen is made up of three members.

Bellows Falls is home to the Green Mountain Railroad, a heritage railroad; the annual Roots on the River Festival;\\"Roots on the River\\" Vermont Festivals and the No Film Film Festival.No Film Film Festival Facebook History The falls were once a fishing place for the nomadic Abenaki tribes, who were part of the Algonquian language family. They caught plentiful salmon and shad. Indigenous peoples had fished at the falls and inhabited the area for thousands of years before European arrival. They carved two sets of faces in the rocks just below the falls (see Bellows Falls Petroglyph Site (VT-WD-8)). Rockingham Town Hall, which holds the Opera House, was built in 1926 on The Square, and is part of the Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District, designated in 1982. The community was settled in 1753 by colonists of English descent, who called it Great Falls. Later the settlers renamed the town for Colonel Benjamin Bellows, a landowner.,Geographic Names Information System, Bellows Falls,VT. but they kept the name Great Falls for the waterfall, a translation of their Abenaki name, \\"Kitchee pontegu.\\"Geographic Names Information System, Great Falls, NH and VT. In 1785, Colonel Enoch Hale built at the falls the first bridge over the Connecticut River. It was the only bridge across the river until 1796, when another was built at Springfield, Massachusetts.The First Toll Bridge at Bellows Falls The bridge was later replaced. Two bridges currently link Bellows Falls to New Hampshire: the New Arch Bridge (also called the Church Street Bridge), which replaced the Arch Bridge in 1982, and the Vilas Bridge,Collins, Anne L.; Lisai, Virginia; and Luring Louise (2002) Around Bellows Falls: Rockingham, Westminster, and Saxtons River Arcadia Publishing. which was closed due to safety concerns in 2009. The Bellows Falls Canal, one of the first canals built in the United States, was dug by a British-owned company from 1791-1802. The original canal was 22 feet wide and four feet deep, and had 9 locks, each 75 feet long and 20 feet wide, which allowed shipping to go around the Great Falls in the Connecticut River by being lifted 52 feet (16 m) around the gorge. River traffic declined after railroads were built to the Connecticut Valley in 1849, and by 1858 the canal had become used almost exclusively for water power to run the paper mills which became established there. In 1874 the canal was enlarged to 75 feet wide and 17 feet deep. By 1908 it was delivering 15,000 horsepower to the mills. When the mills replaced water power with electrical power, the canal was widened again in 1927-28 to 100 feet, and the water was used to power turbines to generate electricity. The canal's bottom was lined with concrete, and the sides secured with rip-rap set in concrete. A fish ladder allows salmon to continue upstream at times when the bulk of the river's flow is diverted to the canal. The canal is now part of the Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District.\\"Bellows Falls Downtown Historic District\\"Historic marker on site at Bridge Street, Bellows Falls\\"Bellows Falls Canal\\" In 1802, entrepreneurs built the first paper mill in Windham County. Two railroads converged in 1849 at Bellows Falls, helping it develop into a major mill town.

Its borders include three main villages: Dummerston Center, West Dummerston, and East Dummerston. History East Dummerston in 1913 Dummerston was part of the Equivalent Lands‚Äîseveral large sections of land given to settlers in the early eighteenth century. It lies on a tract given to the Connecticut Colony about 1715 by the Province of Massachusetts Bay as compensation for land mistakenly awarded by the latter to its settlers. In 1716, the town was auctioned to a consortium (which included William Dummer, lieutenant governor of Massachusetts), and named Dummerston. On December 26, 1753, the town was chartered as a New Hampshire grant and renamed Fulham by Governor Benning Wentworth. But when the grant was renegotiated, it reverted to Dummerston. The many brooks and streams flowing into the West River provided the area with water power. Dummerston had five gristmills, five sawmills, one slate manufacturer, and one shop for making rakes. Raising sheep across the many hills was an important occupation.Hayward's New England Gazetteer of 1839 By 1859, the town had a population of 1,645.

History The Phelps Barn in Grafton In the early 19th century, sheep raising became popular and multiple woolen mills sprang up along the branches of the Saxtons River. Soapstone was quarried on nearby Bear Mountain.Stephen Jermanok, A Town for All Seasons, Preservation magazine, January/February 2010. The town became a notable stagecoach hub for traffic across the Green Mountains into Albany, New York. One inn from that era, \\"the Old Tavern,\\" was founded in 1801. It remains one of the oldest continually operating hotels in the United States. Grafton had a population of almost 1,500 just before the American Civil War. The town suffered severe losses during the Civil War. Local cemeteries in the village hold many tombstones of casualties from the Battle of Gettysburg. After the war, the community declined in population. The soapstone quarry was depleted and closed late in the 19th century. Around the time of the Great Depression, the town's population was less than 400. In the 1960s the Windham Foundation was established to help restore the village.Town, R. L., and Hall, Mathew: What's happening in Grafton, Vermont, Yankee Magazine, November 1967, p. 90. It purchased the Old Tavern and many residences in the area. The foundation also established an artisanal cheese business, the Grafton Village Cheese Company, and built a world-class cross-country skiing center at Grafton Ponds that offers a popular mountain biking program for children in the summer months. The restoration efforts attracted new residents from metropolitan New York and Boston.

The population was 1,035 at the 2010 census. Jamaica includes the villages of East Jamaica and Rawsonville. Its ZIP code is 05343. The town is home to Jamaica State Park, noted for scenic camping spots and various swimming holes, including Hamilton Falls. The nearest large town is Brattleboro. History Jamaica Village in c. 1907 In the colonial period, what is now Vermont was disputed territory, with land claims from both New York and New Hampshire. The original grants for this area, issued by the Royal Governor of New York in 1767 and 1772, were for two towns. But in 1777, the Republic of Vermont was established. Ignoring the previous grants, it gave charter on November 7, 1780 for ‚Äúa tract of vacant land within this state which has not heretofore been granted.‚Äù The charter goes on to say ‚Äúthat the same be and is hereby Incorporated into a Township by the name of Jamaica‚Äù‚Äîits name from the Natick word for beaver and not the Caribbean island. The grant encompassed forty-two square miles, at an altitude ranging from above sea level along the West River to on The Pinnacle. On the charter were listed sixty-seven grantees, many of whose surnames can be found among residents today. Earliest settlement of the town was along the West River near the Wardsboro Bridge, now called East Jamaica, where the first school was established in 1791; however, the building of new roads and bridges towards Manchester advanced settlement westward, so that by 1800 the town center was shifting to Jamaica Village. Within the entire forty-two square-mile township developed as many as ten separate hamlets, each surrounded by outlying farms and linked to Jamaica Village by a network of roads. Eventually there were as many as fourteen one-room schools which served the families in the outlying areas. In the first quarter of the nineteenth century, Jamaica Village also assumed increasing importance as a manufacturing center, largely for topographical reasons. Located near the confluence of the West River and Ball Mountain Brook, the area offered a strategic location for bridges, dams and mills. Along Ball Mountain Brook alone there were numerous dams, each providing power for at least one mill. The first store, Noon House, was built in 1803. The popularity of Noon House led to the building in 1814 of Jamaica House, which provided a convenient overnight spot for travelers at the midpoint between Manchester and Brattleboro.Booker (1940). Historical Notes: Jamaica, Vermont. Brattleboro, Vermont: E.L. Hildreth & Co., Inc. Jamaica, Vermont (1895) by Theodore Robinson Like many Vermont communities, the town's economy prospered with the introduction of Merino sheep in the early nineteenth century. The sheep flourished on rocky hillsides, and as their numbers increased, bare land replaced forests, but this prosperity did not last. The depression that followed the Civil War, and the decline in the wool market, took their toll on the economy. Many sons of Jamaica served with the Union Army during the Civil War. Windham County contributed heavily to manning the 4th Vermont Infantry and nearly all of Jamaica's men joined Company I of that regiment. This regiment saw heavy combat throughout the war but the Battle of the Wilderness took the greatest toll on those from the village of Jamaica. One of Jamaica's soldiers, Sergeant Henry W. Downs of Company I, 8th Vermont Infantry, won the Medal of Honor for bravery under fire. In 1869, a great flood carried away ‚Äúa mile of bridges‚Äù and damaged every dam on Ball Mountain Brook. Because of its setting near the river and the region's heavy snows, Jamaica has suffered through many damaging floods in the more than two hundred years since its founding. During this period, Jamaica and other towns in the West River Valley bonded together in a venture that was seen as the salvation of the area‚Äôs economic woes, the West River Railroad. Originally chartered in 1867, the proposed railroad was to run from Brattleboro to Whitehall, New York. In 1877, financing provided by the valley towns moved the languishing project forward with the first segment from Brattleboro to Londonderry. Although it was never extended farther, the railroad provided valuable public transportation for the lower West River Valley until the 1930s, by which time automobile ownership had become almost universal.

The town's first church was organized in 1776, and put up at the top of Town Hill in 1778. In 1820, it was replaced by a newer structure nearby, and timbers and board from the old church were used in 1822 to build the Town House, which was also located in the vicinity. Between 1836 and 1844 both of these buildings - the church and the Town House - were moved down the hill to about their current locations on the Town Common. The church burned down in 1931 was replaced by the current one, which is roughly a reproduction of its predecessor, except slightly smaller. After the move down the hill, Town House was on the east side of South Road, but when it was hit by a new, oversized snow plow in 1966, it was moved across the road to its current location.Interview with Forrest Holzapfel, Town Historian, April 1912 The Whetstone Inn was built around 1775 by Deacon Jonas Whitney, who arrived in Marlboro in 1773.

The population was 2,702 at the 2010 census. The town's historic core makes up the Putney Village Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History On December 26, 1753 Colonel Josiah Willard led a proprietors' petition for a Putney charter to be established in the Equivalent Lands. The charter was issued that day by Governor Benning Wentworth - issuer of the New Hampshire Grants under the authority of King George II of England. Significant settlement of Putney did not begin until after the French and Indian War ended in 1760. The town arose in a large plain on the west side of the Connecticut River, above the mouth of Sacketts Brook. A falls on the brook provided water power for early mills, and it is around that point that the main village was formed. Because the town did not have abundant sources of water power, it was largely bypassed by the Industrial Revolution of the mid-19th century, and remained largely rural in character. The village's character is defined by the Federal and Greek Revival styles popular during its most significant period of growth, the late 18th to mid-19th century.

Looking west at the Saxtons River Historical Society (a former Congregational church). Saxtons River is an incorporated village in the town of Rockingham in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 565 at the 2010 census. For over a hundred years, Saxtons River has been the home of Vermont Academy, an independent secondary school. Most of the village is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as Saxtons River Village Historic District. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 0.5 square mile (1.3 km2), all land. History Saxtons River was first settled in 1783, but growth was extremely slow. A meeting house was built and the village cemetery established in 1810, and the first textile mill was opened at the Middle Falls (now officially named Saxtons River Falls) in 1815. The village bounds were determined by the town in 1820, and it was formally incorporated as a village in 1905, which is overseen by a Board of Trustees elected by registered voters of the Village. From 1900-1924, Rockingham's two incorporated villages were linked by the Bellows Falls & Saxtons River Railroad, an electric train system. The company created Barbers Park, east of the Saxtons River about halfway between the villages, to which summertime crowds took the trolleys to baseball games and amusement rides. Although Saxtons River village had a long history of industry (in particular successful textile operations, as well as saw mills, a grist mill, tannery, and distillery), much of it had failed by the 1920s. Located mostly inside the Village boundaries, and a strong influence on the character and economy of Saxtons River, is Vermont Academy, a private, co-educational high school founded in 1876. Vermont Academy established an annual Winter Carnival early in the 20th century, contributing to the creation of New England's winter recreation culture. Student enrollment is around 230.Saxtons River Village web site http://www.rockbf.org/index.asp?SEC=B4316549-8F7D-4EDF- ABB4-A92ACCD380F4&DE;=206B9057-AEA5-4E58-B35B-C4444D788DB8&Type;=B_BASIC Retrieved 7-29-17 After a period of decline in the mid-20th century, many of the older buildings, such as the Saxtons River Inn, were restored and rehabilitated.

History=Early settlers Captain John Coffeen, the town's first permanent settler, brought his family and possessions into the wilderness of Cavendish in June 1769. They built a dwelling in the northern part of town on what is now E. I. Heald's farm, on the lot still called the \\"Coffeen pasture\\". The Coffeens remained the only family in Cavendish for two years. In the early 1780s, Leonard Proctor and Salmon Dutton came from Massachusetts and gave their names to the two major settlements on the Black River, Proctorsville and Duttonsville. In 1782, the first recorded town meeting occurred and Dutton was elected town clerk. He is credited with having conducted a 1784 survey for the first road from Duttonsville along the Black River to Ludlow (now Vermont routes 103 and 131). In 1786 he became the town's first justice of the peace. He also served as moderator of the town meeting, as selectman, and as town treasurer. The marriage of Redfield Proctor and Emily Dutton in 1858 joined the leading families of the two villages and promised to put an end to the former rivalry.

It had a population of 1,502 at the 2010 census. Sharon was the birthplace of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and as such is an important historical site for Latter Day Saints. The town is also home to The Sharon Academy, an independent middle and high school. History Street scene c. 1906 One of the New Hampshire grants, the township was created on August 17, 1761, by a royal charter which King George III of the United Kingdom issued to Governor Benning Wentworth. It was granted to John Taylor and 61 others, many from Sharon, Connecticut. The town was first settled about 1765 by Robert Havens and family. In 1780 during the Revolution, the village was attacked in the Royalton Raid,A. J. Coolidge & J. B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 when a combined force of British soldiers and Indians burned houses and killed livestock. Although the surface of the town is very broken, the intervales contain fertile soil, and farming became an important industry. On June 26, 1848, the Vermont Central Railroad opened from White River Junction to Bethel, traversing Sharon and accelerating its development. The White River and its tributaries provided water power for mills. By 1859, when the population reached 1,240, Sharon had 12 sawmills, a gristmill, and a bobbin factory. Many of Sharon's most historic homes still line the White River. In the mid-20th century the main form of employment in Sharon was still the lumber industry.Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer, 1952 edition, p. 1745.

The population was 2,825 at the 2010 census. History The town of Weathersfield was named for Wethersfield, Connecticut, the home of some of its earliest settlers. The Connecticut town had taken its name, in turn, from Wethersfield, a village in the English county of Essex, the name of which derived from \\"wether\\", or in Old English wither, meaning a castrated lamb. In England, wethers were trained to lead flocks of ewes to pasture. It was a supreme irony that the name of the Vermont town (with an 'a' inserted) would derive from a connection to sheep, the animal that would come to define Weathersfield's earliest antecedents and first put it on the map. The man responsible for that feat was a native of Boston who had become a European trader. William Jarvis was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson as U.S. Consul General to Portugal, after founding a trading house in Lisbon. In 1811 Jarvis imported from Spain to his farm at Weathersfield Bow the first Merino sheep brought to America.William Jarvis, Weatherfield history, Town of Weathersfield, Vermont Jarvis set aside eight of the 4,000 Merino sheep he imported as gifts to former President Jefferson and to President James Madison.Monticello Report: Sheep for the President, monticello.org \\"I cannot forbear, Sir,\\" Jarvis wrote to Jefferson, \\"making you an offer of a Ram & Ewes, both as a mark of my great esteem & well knowing that the experiment cannot be in better hands.\\"U.S. Consul William Jarvis to Pres. Thomas Jefferson, Lisbon, Jan. 20, 1810, Thomas Jefferson's Farm Book, by Thomas Jefferson, ed. by Edwin Morris Betts, University of North Carolina Press, 2002 Jarvis was a wealthy financier and gentleman farmer who had bought up most of the flood plain of Weathersfield. Jarvis was also one of the most prominent Republicans in the Connecticut River Valley. Thanks to his introduction of Merino sheep, he provided the underpinning for Vermont agriculture for the next century.William Jarvis's Merino Sheep, Vermont Historical SocietyOur Sheep and the Tariff, William Draper Lewis, Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1890Stone Walls and the Joys of Scholarly Connections, January 5, 2007, Dr. Ross, Groton School, groton.org Jarvis married Mary Pepperell Sparhawk of Boston, a fellow descendant of Sir William Pepperrell of Massachusetts.William Jarvis Papers, Vermont Historical Society Library\\"The Life and Times of Hon.
