It is a redundant Anglican parish church in the diocese of Manchester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built between 1863 and 1865 at a cost of about £5,500 (equivalent to £ in ). It was designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. The original plan included a south aisle and a north tower with a spire, but these were never built. The site was given by the 14th Earl of Derby, who also donated £1,000. As built, the church provided seating for 627 people. The church was extended in about 1920. Edward Hordern, the father of the British actor Michael Hordern, was a rector at the church, likely around the turn of the 20th century. On 30 November 2010 the church was declared redundant, and its parish was merged with those of St Peter, Bury, and St Thomas, Bury, forming the new parish of Roch Valley. As of 2011, it was planned to sell it for use as a children's nursery and an early learning centre. Architecture Holy Trinity Church is constructed in coursed rock- faced sandstone with ashlar dressings. It has Welsh slate roofs. The architectural style is Early English. Its plan consists of a nave, a north aisle with a porch, a chancel with a Lady chapel and a vestry to the north. As the arcade runs down the centre of the church, it is described in the Buildings of England series as a \\"double-naved church\\", with \\"the chancel attached to the south nave\\". The windows at the east and west ends contain \\"heavy plate tracery\\". The arcade has five bays and is carried on round piers. Between the aisle and the Lady chapel is a three-bay arcade. In the Lady chapel is a brightly painted reredos, added in 1987 as a First World War memorial.

Hibbard, popularly known as Hibbie (March 21, 1905 in Toronto, Kansas - October 9, 1973 in Ann Arbor, Michigan), was an American paleontologist. Born on a farm in rural southeastern Kansas as the oldest of six children, Hibbard graduated from Fall River High School in 1923. He attended Emporia State Teaching College in Emporia, Kansas, during the summer and the following autumn became principal of a school in Thrall, Kansas. In 1926, he enrolled in the University of Kansas at Lawrence as a pharmacy major. He frequently went on paleontological collecting trips. During one such excursion, he fashioned a primitive sieve to recover small vertebrate fossils. He received a Bachelor of Arts in 1933 and a Master of Arts in 1934, both in zoology. After briefly moving to Kentucky to survey living mammals at what is now the Mammoth Cave National Park, he returned to Kansas, where he became Assistant Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. In the summer of 1936, the University did not fund a paleontological collecting trip; accordingly, Hibbard was commissioned by the Museum of Zoology to survey living mammals in eastern Kansas, and found time to collect fossils between his trapping duties. During his collecting trips in Kansas, which continued from 1936 in 39 mostly consecutive summers, Hibbard perfected the wet-screening technique for recovering small fossils, which caused a revolution in the knowledge of small mammal fossils. He went to the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology in 1936 to work on a dissertation, but returned to Lawrence, Kansas in 1938. Hibbard received his Ph.D. degree in Ann Arbor in 1941 and became Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology and Assistant Professor of Zoology in Kansas. He moved to Ann Arbor definitively in 1946 and became Professor of Geology in 1953, a position he held until his death in 1973. More than 80 scientists attended a symposium in his honor on May 7–8, 1974. Hibbard wrote 158 scientific papers and was renowned for his discipline, dedication, and early rising. At least 18 species were named after him and he served as President of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, Kansas Academy of Science, Michigan Academy of Science, and Michigan Geological Society, and Director of the American Society of Mammalogists, American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, and American Geological Institute. Hibbard married Faye Ganfield in September 1935. They had a daughter, Katherine, and two grandchildren.

Formation Creation of the PIOB in 2005 was triggered by a series of corporate scandals including the collapse of Enron and WorldCom in the United States and of Parmalat in Europe. These undermined public confidence in the conduct and competence of audit practitioners, leading to demand for an overhaul of the IFAC including an independent oversight body to ensure that all standards are in the public interest. The board was established through a collaborative effort by members of the international financial regulatory community, working with IFAC, led by Michel Prada, Chairman of the French Financial Markets Authority and Deputy Chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Technical Committee. The first chairman was Stavros Thomadakis, a Professor of Finance at the University of Athens who was formerly chairman of the Hellenic Capital Market Commission. The new board was welcomed by regulatory bodies such as the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) of the United Kingdom. Activities The PIOB oversees the public interest activities of three independent standard-setting boards supported by IFAC: the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB), the International Accounting Education Standards Board (IAESB) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). The PIOB also oversees the IFAC's Compliance Advisory Panel, which evaluates member body compliance with IFAC Statements of Membership Obligations. The Chair of the PIOB has the right to attend and to speak at IFAC Board meetings. Oversight The PIOB is accountable to the Monitoring Group, which is composed of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the World Bank, the European Commission and the Financial Stability Board.

He asked for a way of expressing real numbers as sequences of natural numbers, such that the sequence is eventually periodic precisely when the original number is a cubic irrational. Motivation A standard way of writing real numbers is by their decimal representation, such as: :x=a_0.a_1a_2a_3\\\\ldots\\\\ where a0 is an integer, the integer part of x, and a1, a2, a3, … are integers between 0 and 9. Given this representation the number x is equal to :x=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{a_n}{10^n}. The real number x is a rational number only if its decimal expansion is eventually periodic, that is if there are natural numbers N and p such that for every n ≥ N it is the case that an+p = an. Another way of expressing numbers is to write them as continued fractions, as in: :x=[a_0;a_1,a_2,a_3,\\\\ldots],\\\\ where a0 is an integer and a1, a2, a3… are natural numbers. From this representation we can recover x since :x=a_0 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_3 + \\\\ddots}}}. If x is a rational number then the sequence (an) terminates after finitely many terms. On the other hand, Euler proved that irrational numbers require an infinite sequence to express them as continued fractions. Moreover, this sequence is eventually periodic (again, so that there are natural numbers N and p such that for every n ≥ N we have an+p = an), if and only if x is a quadratic irrational. Hermite's question Rational numbers are algebraic numbers that satisfy a polynomial of degree 1, while quadratic irrationals are algebraic numbers that satisfy a polynomial of degree 2. For both these sets of numbers we have a way to construct a sequence of natural numbers (an) with the property that each sequence gives a unique real number and such that this real number belongs to the corresponding set if and only if the sequence is eventually periodic. In 1848 Charles Hermite wrote a letter to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi asking if this situation could be generalised, that is can one assign a sequence of natural numbers to each real number x such that the sequence is eventually periodic precisely when x is a cubic irrational, that is an algebraic number of degree 3?Émile Picard, L'œuvre scientifique de Charles Hermite, Ann. Sci. École Norm. Sup. 3 18 (1901), pp.9-34.Extraits de lettres de M. Ch. Hermite à M. Jacobi sur différents objects de la théorie des nombres. (Continuation)., Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 40 (1850), pp.279-315, Or, more generally, for each natural number d is there a way of assigning a sequence of natural numbers to each real number x that can pick out when x is algebraic of degree d? Approaches Sequences that attempt to solve Hermite's problem are often called multidimensional continued fractions. Jacobi himself came up with an early example, finding a sequence corresponding to each pair of real numbers (x, y) that acted as a higher- dimensional analogue of continued fractions.C. G. J. Jacobi, Allgemeine Theorie der kettenbruchänlichen Algorithmen, in welche jede Zahl aus drei vorhergehenden gebildet wird (English: General theory of continued-fraction- like algorithms in which each number is formed from three previous ones), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 69 (1868), pp.29-64. He hoped to show that the sequence attached to (x, y) was eventually periodic if and only if both x and y belonged to a cubic number field, but was unable to do so and whether this is the case remains unsolved. In 2015, for the first time, a periodic representation for any cubic irrational has been provided by means of ternary continued fractions, i.e., the problem of writing cubic irrationals as a periodic sequence of rational or integer numbers has been solved. However, the periodic representation does not derive from an algorithm defined over all real numbers and it is derived only starting from the knowledge of the minimal polynomial of the cubic irrational.Nadir Murru, On the periodic writing of cubic irrationals and a generalization of Rédei functions, Int. J. Number Theory 11 (2015), no. 3, pp. 779-799, doi: 10.1142/S1793042115500438 Rather than generalising continued fractions, another approach to the problem is to generalise Minkowski's question mark function. This function ? : [0, 1] -> [0, 1] also picks out quadratic irrational numbers since ?(x) is rational if and only if x is either rational or a quadratic irrational number, and moreover x is rational if and only if ?(x) is a dyadic rational, thus x is a quadratic irrational precisely when ?(x) is a non-dyadic rational number. Various generalisations of this function to either the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1] or the two-dimensional simplex have been made, though none has yet solved Hermite's problem.L. Kollros, Un Algorithme pour l'approximation simultanée de Deux Granduers, Inaugural-Dissertation, Universität Zürich, 1905.Olga R.

Some of the instruments mentioned in this list are also used in other countries. In India, folk instruments are popularly used in spiritual and devotional songs. These instruments are also used in traditional dance forms, village ceremonies and street theater. A number of ethnic groups as like \\"swardhara the music\\"in India use folk instruments. Loh Tarang and other Indian instruments are not easily available in musical instrument stores. That’s because they are not used commonly in popular forms of music.abhishek jadham design this instrument and teach also Ethnic instruments used in folk tradition are hard to come by. Folk instruments from India have been used by musicians in world music and ethnic fusion.

They are instruments that are banged, shaken, or taped. The old bass drum is an example of an unpitched percussion instrument. The xylophone is an example of a pitched percussion instrument. The first percussion instrument was the stone and stick. Musical stones dates back to 2300 B.C. Notched sticks, rattles, and hollowed log drums were also created during this time. The percussion family includes ancient hourglassed-shaped talking drums, modern metal oil drums, chains jerked in and out of boxes, half coconut shells banged together, washboards, cowbells, wind-bells, thunder sheets, and even brake drums. Just about anything can be turned into a percussion instrument. Today, garbage cans and their lids are being used as percussion instruments. Tuned percussion instruments consists of the Timpani, Xylophone, Marimba, Glockenspiel, and the Cimbalom. Untuned percussion instruments consists of the Drum (various types), Cymbals, Triangle, Tambourine, Castanets, Chinese Wood Block, and the Tam-Tam. Each individual instrument brings in a certain quality and tone to music. It enhances the total sound of the music and they play a crucial part in music composition and arrangement.

It is named after its chief engineer, who died in an accident during the construction of the highway, when a tree fell over his tent. The BR-010 highway is known as the Belém-Brasília Highway or Transbrasiliana Highway, in the stretch between the city of Estreito, in the state of Maranhão, and the city of Belém. Between Brasília and Estreito, the highway has many incomplete and unpaved stretches, especially in the state of Tocantins. Between Brasília and Estreito, the original route of the Belém- Brasília Highway follows the BR-060, the BR-153 and the BR-226 highways, which are completely paved in this stretch. The total length of the highway is 1,950 km, passing through the Federal District and four states: * Federal District: 44.6 km * State of Goiás: 287.9 km * State of Tocantins: 773.2 km * State of Maranhão: 379.1 km * State of Pará: 465,3 km History The Belém-Brasília Highway was the first road built through the central and the middle north region of Brazil, having been built between 1958 and 1960. Its construction was one of the greatest achievements of road engineering, due to the enormous difficulties faced in its design and by the construction crews - more than 5,000 courses of water had to be conquered, and new ways of bulldozing and felling massive trees higher than 50 m and with girths exceeding 4 to 5 m in diameter had to be devised. Initially it was a dirt road, but in the succeeding years it was macadamized and more permanent bridges were built. The BR-010 highway was fundamental to bring modernity to a completely wild region. Many agricultural settlements and entire new cities, with its suite of commerce, industry, etc., sprang along the highway. It was also the first land connection between the states of Pará and Maranhão, and all the rest of the country, so that the economic potential and development of the region could be increased. In its beginning, a trip through the road was a dangerous undertaking, due to the presence of wild animals such as the ferocious spotted jaguars and poisonous snakes, and also of road banditry. There were no hotels, gasoline stations and restaurants along the highway and travellers had to carry their own supplies. Today, it entails a drive of approximately 2 days.

In July 2002 Microsoft product managers stated that home networking was too hard to use, and the company was developing products using the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11b standard (sold under the Wi-Fi name). Products announced in September included the MN-500 wireless base station, MN-510 WiFi Universal Serial Bus (USB) network interface controller and MN-520 PC Card for laptop computers. The MN-500 served as a wireless access point, a router, and included an Ethernet hub with four 10/100 Ethernet ports. A five port Ethernet switch and Ethernet network interface controller cards were announced, along with kits. Reviews noted the reasonable prices and simple interface, although the configuration software would sometimes fail. One reviewer noted the 96-page book included with the base station. It was one of the first products to enable Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) by default, which provided at least some level of privacy. Software included a setup wizard, a broadband network utility (BNU) and an auto-update feature. According to codes in the documentation, the initial MN-510 was developed by Accton Technology Corporation. Features were similar to products of SMC Networks, a subsidiary of Accton. By January 2003 it was estimated the products were in the number two position in US retail sales for Wi-Fi products. However market share declined by February when introduction of faster products based on IEEE 802.11g standards were delayed. Market leader Linksys was purchased by Cisco Systems in March. NetGear and D-Link also gained market share in 2003. The MN-700 model supporting 802.11g was available in September. A new PC card for 802.11g was also available.

The reticle is illuminated by an electronic light source (an incandescent light bulb or, more recently, a light-emitting diode) or by ambient light gathered behind the reticle via an opalescent window or fiber optic light pipe.

There have had more modern incarnations such as the Armson Occluded Eye Gunsight (OEG) and the Normark Corp. Singlepoint. These both used a light gathering rod in a protective clear dome collecting ambient light to illuminate a 'dot' style reticle. Collimator sights have had uses as a small arms sight for low light situations (such as twilight or \\"room clearing\\" operations) since there is no intervening optical window that can block the light, allowing the use of both eyes with a relatively un-obstructed field of view.Maj.

Lean Supply Chain Managements aims are to maintain close to zero inventories and reduce work-in- process; Agile goes for quick responses to customer inquiries and market changes while controlling costs and quality; Resilience is about reacting quickly to disruptions impacting supply chain; and Green refers to sustainability in supply chain through low emissions to the environment and a recycling strategy for products. History The idea of LARG SCM was developed in the research unit of mechanical and industrial engineering (UNIDEMI) in the Faculty of Science and Technology at New University of Lisbon, Portugal. UNIDEMI is the main research center working on LARG SCM. UNINOVA and NECE are contributing partners. Overview A Lean company means nearly zero inventories; a Resilient company must have enough inventory to react to the effects of disruptions that may occur in a supply chain. These concepts seem to be contradictory . However, it would be ideal to have both systems working together in a company. These facts advise for further research in production and supply chain management; Lean and Resilient concepts require to be modeled on a compatibility basis. LARG SCM develops a deep understanding of interrelationships (conflicts and trade-offs) across lean, agile, resilient and green supply chain paradigms. This understanding is believed to be vital to turn these concepts really compatible. This achievement will provide an important contribution for a competitive and sustainable environment; its justification will be based on better “lean, agile, resilient and green production systems” at the company level, with implications at the overall supply chain level and its agents.

Stylistically, it is a typical BAO album, with a variety of musical genres including Swedish folk music, classical and pop influences. The album was recorded in the first half of 2011 in Benny's newly built studio, Rixmixningsverket.Rixmixningsverket. http://www.rmvstudio.com/ The studio is located adjacent to Benny's Mono Music offices and studio, where part of the mixing was done. As usual, the album features some instrumentals mixed with songs performed by Helen Sjöholm, Tommy Körberg and Kalle Moraeus. This time, eight out of the 13 tracks have vocals, while only five songs are instrumentals. Most of the lyrics are once again written by Benny's former ABBA partner Björn Ulvaeus. All music is composed by Benny Andersson, with the exception of \\"Månstrålar klara\\", a traditional tune with lyrics by Arvid Ödmann, performed by Tommy Körberg. =Title= The title of the album (and its title-track) is taken from and inspired by the student song 'O, gamla klang- och jubeltid!, originally a German song : 'O alte Burschenherrlichkeit, composed by Eugen Höfling in 1825. The song was featured in the (German)stage play Alt- Heidelberg by Wilhelm Meyer-Förster, part 5, scene 5, which was translated to Swedish as Gamla Heidelberg by Frans Hedberg in 1903, where the song starts 'O, du studentens glada liv, varthän har du försvunnit? (O, that merry life of the student days, where did you go?). The song was reworked by August Lindh, and published for the first time in Swedish in 'Sångbok för Västmanlands-Dala nation nr 9, 1921'. The Student Song 'O, gamla klang- och jubeltid is still often sung in academical gatherings, and while doing so, the students underline the lyrics by standing onto their chairs. Track listing Songs *The title track, \\"O klang och jubeltid\\" (Oh sound and time of jubilation), with lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus, is a reflection of happy times gone by. Helen Sjöholm, Tommy Körberg and Kalle Moraeus individually sing the verses and rejoin for the chorus, accompanied by Adolf Fredrik's Youth Choir for the last chorus. Together they look back on happy times in the past, calling them a \\"good old friend\\", longing for them and wanting to see them again. *As a preview, the Helen Sjöholm number \\"Kära syster\\" (Dear sister) was released to radio in the middle of May, some five weeks before the album's release. It received its premiere on \\"Nanne i P4\\", the radio show of Nanne Grönwall, Benny's daughter-in-law, on Friday, May 13, 2011.Sveriges Radio P4, Nanne i P4. http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=4080&artikel;=4503490 The song carries a similar theme to Jolene by Dolly Parton, with a woman begging another woman not to steal her man/husband. *\\"Månstrålar klara\\", performed by Tommy Körberg, is a unique exception, as it was not written by Benny Andersson. Taking into account all studio albums that feature Benny as an artist, this is the first since 1973 (when Agnetha Fältskog wrote one song for the ABBA album Ring Ring) that doesn't consist entirely of his own material. \\"Månstrålar klara\\" is a traditional composition, with lyrics by Arvid Ödmann. The song was previously often performed by Swedish tenor Jussi Björling.Aftonbladet, review of \\"O klang och jubeltid\\". http://blogg.aftonbladet.se/jensfilm/2011/06/bra-bao?awesm=fbshare.me_AcCBP *\\"Midsommarpolka\\" is the first instrumental track on the album, a polka, as the title implicates. It is very much in the style of previous Benny Anderssons orkester instrumentals and polkas. *\\"Allt syns när man är naken\\", again with lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus, translates to Everything is visible when you're naked. Helen Sjöholm sings lead and is accompanied by Tommy Körberg and Kalle Moraeus in the choruses. While the verses sound like a soft ballad, the choruses have a completely different style and a stomping drum-beat. The line \\"du är Yin, jag är Yang\\", which means I am Yin, you are Yang, is repeated throughout the song. A video clip of the recording process of this song was uploaded onto the Mono Music homepage and can be found here: Video clip, Mono Music *\\"Alla goda ting\\" is another instrumental in typical BAO style. *\\"En dag i sänder\\", with lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus and vocals by Helen Sjöholm, is the most \\"modern\\" sounding pop track on the album. It has a driving beat, with drums and electric guitar, and a catchy melody. It is the most ABBA-like sounding song on this album. According to Jans Peterson of Aftonbladet, it could and should be a new single. In the end of July, while the band was on tour in Sweden, \\"En dag i sänder\\" was tested for Svensktoppen and immediately entered the hitlist at number 4 on July 31 before eventually topping the chart the week after. *\\"Flickornas rum\\" (The girl's room) is a charming classical tune. The beginning, which exclusively features Benny Andersson on piano, sounds very much like a classical piano sonata. With the inclusion of violins in the second half, the musical format transforms to a violin sonata, which almost always features piano and violin(s) together. *After a minute-lasting instrumental introduction, \\"De ljuva drömmarnas orkester\\" (The sweet dreams orchestra) becomes a march, performed by Helen Sjöholm, Tommy Körberg and Kalle Moraeus as a trio. The lyrics by Björn Ulvaeus are a depiction of the joyous experience of a band, most obviously Benny Anderssons orkester itself, playing in front of an audience. According to Aftonbladet, it could very well a new theme song for the band. *\\"Jag hör...\\" (I hear...) is a classical ballad by Tommy Körberg, sounding as if it could be an outtake from one of Benny Anderssons musicals, such as Chess, in which Körberg also played one of the leading roles.Chess the musical, homepage. http://www.chessthemusical.com/ The lyrics, once again written by Björn Ulvaeus, describe voices calling out of the dark and the black, telling the listener to \\"come\\" and that \\"here is a place for you\\". It is open to interpretation, but could indicate voices from the twilight land, as Aftonbladet's review suggests. *\\"Sorgmarsch\\" is an instrumental, lasting for nearly five minutes. It can be translated as march of sorrow or funeral march. The sound corresponds to the title. *Another song performed by Helen Sjöholm, \\"Vilar glad. I din famn\\", was premiered at the royal wedding of Swedish Crown Princess Victoria in June 2010. For this occasion, it was performed by Gustaf Sjökvists kammarkör, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Orsa Spelmän in Stockholm's Storkyrkan. The choral version was released as a single in summer 2010, with an a cappella version also being included (MMCD-S 136).Mono Music, discography. http://www.monomusic.se/cd---mono-music-produktioner---diskografi.aspx *\\"Brudmarsch\\", the bride's march, is the album's closing number. It starts out with a rather bare instrumentatal, which develops as the song progresses. Finally, Adolf Fredrik's Youth Choir can be heard again, singing the line \\"Vilar glad i din famn\\" from the previous song. As already mentioned, the original version of \\"Vilar glad. I din famn\\" was premiered at the wedding of Swedish Crown Princess Victoria and was therefore originally played for a bride. Because of this, the inclusion of this line in the end of \\"Brudmarsch\\" makes perfect sense. The Swedish instrument nyckelharpa can also be heard on this song, played by Cajsa Ekstav and Cecilia Österholm. Benny Andersson himself got one of these instruments in December 2009 and eventually also learned to play it.Svenska Dagbladet, article. http://www.svd.se/kultur/nyckelharpa-nasta-for-abba-benny_3993533.svd Promotion and reception To promote the album, Benny Anderssons orkester went for a summer tour, playing at eight cities in Sweden at the end of July 2011.Mono Music, press release about \\"O klang och jubeltid\\". http://www.monomusic.se/pressmeddelande-2011-05-06.aspx Additionally, the group also performed on the first date of this year's Allsång på Skansen TV program, which was aired on Tuesday, June 28.Allsång på Skansen, by svt.se. Three songs were performed: \\"Kära syster\\" and \\"O klang och jubeltid\\" during the actual program and \\"Allt syns när man är naken\\" during the extra 30min web broadcast, which followed the TV coverage. Upon its release, the album received positive and some mixed reviews. Although the biggest Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet gave the album a score of four stars,Aftonbladet, review. http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/recensioner/article13150271.ab?teaser=true other reviewers and newspapers, like Dagens Nyheter,Dagens Nyheter, review. http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/skivrecensioner/benny-anderssons-orkester-o- klang-och-jubeltid found the album a be bit too sweet sounding, or just too old-fashioned and nothing new.

The stadium's\` capacity was 40,000 and it was built in 1928 and used until demolished in 1987. It was claimed, incorrectly, to have been the first purpose built speedway track in Britain. Belle Vue Aces in 1963 History Part of the complex of buildings and attractions that formed Belle Vue Zoological Gardens the Hyde Road stadium was originally constructed in 1886 as an athletics ground. It was named after Hyde Road, a road which begins at the east end of Ardwick Green South in Ardwick and runs east towards Hyde. At the boundary between Gorton and Denton it continues as Manchester Road.Geographia Manchester Colour Map. London: Geographia, 1986 In 1928 the owners of the gardens decided to convert the stadium for use as a speedway venue. The opening speedway meeting here was staged on 23 March 1929, when Arthur Franklyn won the Golden Helmet. Following the announcement that Stuart Bamforth had sold the stadium for redevelopment, the last speedway meeting was staged on 1 November 1987, when a double header took place. Firstly, Belle Vue defeated the Coventry Bees in a replay of the League Cup before losing to the Cradley Heath Heathens in the final league match ever raced at Hyde Road. Speedway returned to Belle Vue Greyhound stadium and remained there. Some of the more famous riders who rode at Hyde Road, either for international meetings, as a Belle Vue Ace, or as a visiting team rider include Speedway World Champions Jack Young, Peter Craven, Ronnie Moore, Ove Fundin, Barry Briggs, Ivan Mauger, Ole Olsen, Peter Collins, Anders Michanek, Egon Müller, Michael Lee, Bruce Penhall, Erik Gundersen, and Hans Nielsen. The speedway at Hyde Road was in length. The site of the old Hyde Road stadium is now the site of the British Car Auctions Ltd.

It lives on the edge of the vegetation, often in degraded environments. The seeds of this species are dispersed by numerous species, including fruit bats (Megachiroptera) when present. Taxonomy Ficus septica was described first by the Dutch botanist Nicolaas Laurens Burman in 1768. Two centuries later, E. J. H. Corner listed three varieties for Ficus septica: F. septica var. septica distributed all over the range of the species; F. septica var. cauliflora limited to Queensland, Australia and the Solomon islands; and F. septica var. salicifolia endemic to the Philippines Islands. Then in the latest Flora Malesiana edition, Cornelis Christiaan Berg put all these varieties in synonymy together under the name Ficus septica. Within the genus, Ficus septica belongs to the subgenus Sycomorus section Sycocarpus subsection Sycocarpus. Description Tree or shrub up to 25 meters. The latex of F. septica is characteristically yellow. Leaves and petioles are both glabrous. Leaves are symmetric, elliptic to oblong. Figs grow often in pairs but can be solitary or in groups of up to four. Figs are depressed-globose to ellipsoid, the apex is flat or concave. Seven to twelve ribs towards to ostiole. At maturity, whitish to yellowish dots appear on the fig. The individuals from Philippines have their stems covered by short hairs while those found in Taiwan are glabrous. Habitat Ficus septica trees live up to 1800m in montane forests or secondary growth environments. It can be seen often along rivers. In Taiwan, at the northern limit of its distribution, F. septica lives up to 500m in secondary growths and along roads and coastlines. Ecology Ficus septica is pollinated by fig wasps from the genus Ceratosolen. Usually members of the genus Ficus are pollinated by a single species of pollinating fig wasps specific to each fig species, but recent observations of Ficus septica have shown there to be three pollinating species in the South of Taiwan and two in the Philippines. The figs of Ficus septica have been reported to be eaten by 22 animal species and among them 14 are bats: * Double-eyed fig parrot * Unspecified fruit dove * Black-naped oriole * Northern common cuscus * Stein's cuscus * Common spotted cuscus * Mantled guereza * Black rat * Lesser short-nosed fruit bat * Horsfield's fruit bat * Greater short-nosed fruit bat * Indonesian short-nosed fruit bat * Bare-backed fruit bat * Lesser naked-backed fruit bat * Long-tongued nectar bat * Long- tongued fruit bat * Broad-striped tube-nosed fruit bat * Common tube-nosed fruit bat * Greater musky fruit bat * Geoffroy's rousette * Common blossom bat References septica Category:Flora of Australia Category:Flora of Malesia Category:Flora of Taiwan ","title":"Ficus septica"},{"id":"32010573","text":"BR-040 is a federal highway of Brazil. The road connects Brasilia to Rio de Janeiro. BR-040 Highway, Brazil The starting point of the highway is in Brasília at the junction with the BR-450 (Via EPIA) and BR-251 (Via EPCT). The road ends at Praça Mauá at the Port of Rio de Janeiro. The BR-040 traverses Distrito Federal and the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. It is the main road link between these parts of the country. In September 2009, the stretch of highway between Brasília (DF) and Petrópolis (RJ) was named President Juscelino Kubitschek Highway. The BR-040 serves the following town and cities: * Brasília (DF) * Valparaíso de Goiás (GO) * Luziânia (GO) * Cristalina (GO) * Paracatu (MG) * João Pinheiro (MG) * Três Marias (MG) * Felixlândia (MG) * Paraopeba (MG) * Caetanópolis (MG) * Sete Lagoas (MG) * Ribeirão das Neves (MG) * Contagem (MG) * Belo Horizonte (MG) * Congonhas (MG) * Conselheiro Lafaiete (MG) * Cristiano Otoni (MG) * Carandaí (MG) * Ressaquinha (MG) * Alfredo Vasconcelos (MG) * Barbacena (MG) * Santos Dumont (MG) * Ewbank da Câmara (MG) * Juiz de Fora (MG) * Matias Barbosa (MG) * Simão Pereira (MG) * Comendador Levy Gasparian (RJ) * Três Rios (RJ) * Areal (RJ) * Petrópolis (RJ) * Duque de Caxias (RJ) * Rio de Janeiro (RJ) Today's BR-040 came into being in 1973 by means of the National Transportation Plan. The initial draft saw the highway planned from Brasília to São João da Barra, (RJ). With the revision, the stretch between Belo Horizonte and São João da Barra became part of the BR-356 as part of the Rio stretch of the BR-040. This was originally part of the BR-135. Until 1964, the stretch between Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte was called the BR-3. Two stretches of the BR-040 are important to the history of Brazilian roads. The stretch between Petrópolis and Juiz de Fora included the Estrada União e Indústria, the first Brazilian highway, inaugurated on July 23, 1861 by Dom Pedro II. This stretch was replaced by the actual Rio de Janeiro-Juiz de Fora road in 1980. The stretch of the BR-040 situated between Petrópolis (RJ) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) was named the Washington Luiz highway in honour of the ex-president of the republic who had it built during his 1926-1930 term. In 1931, the asphalt concrete road was the first of its kind in the country. This stretch of the BR-040 between Juiz de Fora and Rio de Janeiro has been managed by the Companhia de Concessão Rodoviária Juiz de Fora-Rio de Janeiro (Concer) since 1996. A significant urban stretch of the BR-040 in Rio de Janeiro is made up of the Avenida Brasil along with the BR-101 and Avenida Rodrigues Alves. After crossing the Rio Meriti and passing by Duque de Caxias, the highway ends at Praça Mauá. =History of the Washington Luiz highway= In the year 1926 President of the Republic Washington Luís declared to the nation that \\"governing means opening roads\\". By 1927, Brazil had 93,682 cars and 38,075 trucks. The Federal District and the State of Rio de Janeiro counted 13,252 cars and 5,452 trucks. One of the priorities was the Rio-Petrópolis highway, especially since the national press had heavily criticised the abandonment of the road to the Imperial City. Nevertheless, torrential rain poured down for two summers, washing away the sand and gravel required to surface the road. Impassable ruts formed on the tarmac. One newspaper commented on the delays, at a time when coupés, cabriolets and cockroaches all boarded the wagons of the Leopoldina. The tools of the day were the pick, shovel, hoe and donkey cart. An outbreak of malaria occurred in the lowlands, while in the mountains of Petrópolis workers were forced to live in makeshift accommodation. President Washington Luís, alongside his ministers and regional authorities, inaugurated the Rio-Petrópolis highway on the 25th of August 1928. The road measured eight metres wide. The next day was a Sunday. No less than 1,783 cars took to the road, causing a reporter to compare the long, slow queues to those of Avenida Central. Just two days later, many road users admitted to being frightened by the sheer height of the trucks. Three years later, the mountain stretch was being surfaced. Three flyovers were built high above the rocky valley floor. The former Rio-Petrópolis was long considered the finest highway in South America. In the 1950s the Petrópolis bypass was built, linking Itaipava to Xerém. This then became used as a route down from the mountains. Currently the old Washington Luiz serves as access road from the BR-040 to the arrival at Petrópolis (Quitandinha). Then, the Rio-Juiz de Fora meets the Rio- Teresópolis highway (BR-493 and BR-116). =The road from Petrópolis - Juiz de Fora= This stretch replaced the old Union and Industry road, the first Brazilian highway, which opened in 1861. Work began in 1975 and lasted 5 years, being completed on 15 June 1980. The finished road crosses mountainous, hilly and flat zones and is dual carriageway ( wide) throughout, although single carriageway was present from Matias Barbosa to the outskirts of Juiz de Fora until upgraded by Concer between 2005 and 2009 as far as km 773. On the long journey from Petrópolis to Juiz de Fora, the BR-040 passes through seven municipalities. Traffic volume is around 7000 vehicles per day on this route with less from Rio-Bahia, according to the DNIT. On the 1st of March 1996, the stretch from Rio de Janeiro to Juiz de Fora was privatised and is under management for a period of 25 years by Concer. There are three tolls on the road, two in Rio de Janeiro at km 104 (Duque de Caxias) and km 45 (Areal) and one in Minas Gerais at km 814 (Simão Pereira) =From Juiz de Fora - Belo Horizonte= This stretch is long and corresponds approximately to the route of the Caminho Novo which opened in the Eighteenth Century. In the 1930s the road was straightened and extended to Belo Horizonte. On the 1st of February 1957 the BR-3 highway was officially opened by then president Juscelino Kubitschek. In 1982, the highway was widened from Belo Horizonte to the junction with the BR-356 for Ouro Preto, as was the stretch from Alfredo Vasconcelos to Serra da Mantiqueira near Santos Dumont. It was widened all the way to Juiz de Fora, except sections on bridges and overpasses. Since the mid-1990s further stretches have been widened. Several danger spots are present on the highway such as the Curva do Ribeirão do Eixo (Km 588), Viaduto do Túnel (Km 756) among others. The most dangerous part of the road is the section between Conselheiro Lafaiete and the state capital. In 1970, Toni Tornado won the Festival Internacional da Canção with soul song BR-3. =The Sete Lagoas stretch: BR-135= Between the capital of Minas Gerais and Sete Lagoas the road is dual carriageway. From there on until Brasília the BR-040 is single carriageway. Over the years the northern part of Minas Gerais has developed and the increasing flow of vehicles, mostly trucks loaded with coal for steel works, has made the journey untenable. Long delays during festive periods were commonplace. Roadworks were planned to widen the BR-040 highway by the Federal Government in January 2007, beginning with the stretch between Sete Lagoas and the junction with the BR-135 at o Trevão de Curvelo. Altogether a 48 km stretch was widened, with two lanes on each side separated by flowerbeds. Only small sections of road remain under construction, with most of them already receiving traffic. Further bridges and viaducts have been scheduled for construction. In the case of Paraopeba, traffic now bypasses the city whereas before it passed through. According to the DNIT, this stretch has a daily flow of around 15,000 vehicles. It is of strategic importance for the region's raw material industries including coal.

Eynon Rees, was a Welsh writer and film actor of the 1950s, mainly known for his radio and television work. During the 1940s he appeared on the BBC radio variety show Welsh Rarebit as the comedic character Tommy Troubles, reaching an audience of 12 million. Career history Evans was born in Nelson in Glamorgan, Wales in 1904. He became a bus driver, but switched jobs to become a full-time script writer. He came to note in the 1940s when he appeared on the wartime variety show Welsh Rarebit, which was broadcast throughout Great Britain and France. His character 'Tommy Troubles', along with his friends Willie, Llew and Jimmy became cult characters endearing themselves to the British public. At its peak the show reached 12 million people. When the radio show switched from radio to television in the early 1950s, Evans transferred with it to the screen, writing further adventures for Tommy Troubles. In 1954 his play, The Happiness of Three Women, was adapted for a film treatment. Evans himself starred, in the Maurice Elvey directed film, as Amos the milkman, while the more notable leads included Donald Houston and Petula Clark. In 1955, Evans' book Room in the House, was adapted for the screen by Alfred Shaughnessy, and again directed by Elvey, though on this occasion Evans did not feature. Evans continued working in film throughout the 1950s, including an uncredited appearance as a ticket collector in Private's Progress (1956), playing Decon in television children' drama The Buccaneers, one episode of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents (1956) and another uncredited role in The Battle of the River Plate (1956). Along with his acting roles, Evans continued to produce feature-comedies for BBC Wales TV. Described as 'uncomplicated, if robust' by film historian David Berry, his works included The Prodigal Tenor (1957), The Bachelor Brother (1960) and Jubille Concert (1961). In 1958 he appeared in the comedy westernThe Sheriff of Fractured Jaw, which was followed by a few one-off appearances in TV shows. In 1959 he took small roles in two notable British films, playing Mr Morgan in J. Lee Thompson's Tiger Bay and Truscott in John Boulting's I'm All Right Jack. After appearances in comedy films Friends and Neighbours (1959) and Two-Way Stretch (1960), he took a lead role in the 1960 television production of How Green Was My Valley. Evans played family patriarch Gwilym Morgan, with Welsh actress Rachel Thomas in the role of his wife. Evans continued to take small TV roles through the early 1960s, and in 1962 he appeared in Only Two Can Play and Go to Blazes. Only Two Can Play was the third time he had appeared in a film starring Peter Sellers, the others being I'm All Right Jack and Two-Way Stretch. 1964 saw Evans write and appear in a BBC television mini-series Ring out an Alibi. Evans played roles in several popular British television dramas in the late 1960s, including Danger Man, Dixon of Dock Green and Softly Softly. Filmography *Undercover (1943) - Lieut.

It was originally thought to be a subspecies of the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus colias. Description The Atlantic chub mackerel is a long, streamlined fish with a deeply forked tail, is all covered with very small fish scale. The first dorsal fin has 9 or 10 spines and is separated from the second dorsal fin by a space at least as long as its base. The origin of the anal fin is directly below or just behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. This fish is silvery in colour, the upper surface has oblique zigzagging lines while the belly is paler and spotted or marked with wavy lines.  Ecology  Atlantic chub mackerel and other members of the genus Auxis are important pelagic forage species. Fisheries Atlantic chub mackerel bought at Rome fish market This fish is particularly abundant in the eastern Mediterranean. Two variants are distinguished: in the late summer and autumn, the fish is fat and roe-filled, whereas in the late winter and spring it is very lean, almost emaciated. The Greek names for the two forms are koliós and tsíros, respectively. They are usually roasted, although the former form is often packed in salt for later consumption. The fish releases its own oil into the salt packing and acquires a very long shelf life. In the islands of the Aegean, it is a particularly popular delicacy, under the name goúna: fresh-caught mackerel is split open at the belly, eviscerated, and left to dry flesh-side up in the sun for one day. The same evening it is very briefly seared over a fire and then served with lemon juice. Along the eastern seaboard of North America Atlantic chub mackerel were not the target of directed commercial fisheries until 2013 when commercial trawlers began targeting them because of a lack of squid. Landings went from almost zero to 5m pounds within the year. Status This fish has a wide range and is abundant over parts of that range. Although it is heavily fished in places, the population seems relatively stable and the IUCN has listed this species as Least Concern.

The keel of Lady of Mann was laid on 26 October 1929, and by early spring the following year she was ready for launching. Lady of Mann was launched on 4 March 1930, by Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, the Lady of Mann, after whom she was named. Lady of Mann Clyde trials recorded 22.79 knots, but her speed was often over 23 knots on regular service. She was driven by two sets of single-reduction geared turbines;Coastal Ships: D Ridley Chesterton 1967 page 45 , and developed a shaft horsepower of 11,500. The ship was oil-fired by cylindrical Scotch boilers. Lady of Mann's general design and machinery followed closely that of the , with the improvements gained by the three years operation of that vessel.

(Daddy) Woods O.B.E., Lady of Mann joined seven of her Steam Packet sisters at Dunkirk and then at the evacuation of the north- western French ports. After this she spent four years on transport work from Lerwick. She then went south and was engaged in the D-Day landings on the Cherbourg Peninsula. Operation Dynamo Requisitioned as a personnel ship at the outbreak of war, she had a good turn of speed, and was able to get in and out of the Dunkirk bombardments and lift 4,262 men back to the relative safety of Dover and Folkestone. She remained for six hours in Dunkirk harbour on 31 May 1940, despite having been damaged by shellfire from shore batteries on her approach and being bombed by enemy aircraft. She emerged from the bombing with little damage and claimed one enemy aircraft shot down. She was back at Dunkirk in the early hours of 1 June and took off 1,500 casualties. The following day, 2 June, she again steamed into Dunkirk but was ordered back for lack of troops, as by this time the evacuation was drawing towards its close. She picked up 18 French soldiers from a small boat on her way back and landed them in England. On the night of 3 June, she made her last trip to the shattered harbour. She berthed alongside the East Pier at a little after midnight on the morning of 4 June, and left for England after embarking another 1,244 troops in little over an hour. Later that afternoon, Operation Dynamo ended. Over the period of the evacuation, Lady of Mann had lifted more troops to safety than any other vessel.Isle of Man Examiner: Monday 30 April 2012. p34 Operation Ariel Following Operation Dynamo Lady of Mann was in action once more. She became part of the force of personnel ships assigned to Operation Ariel, the evacuation from the ports of north-west France. She was at Le Havre, Cherbourg and Brest, embarking troops as the enemy advanced in a vast encircling movement. Along with her Steam Packet sister , Lady of Mann was one of the last three ships to leave Le Havre. It was estimated she had 5,000 troops on board as she departed under air attack. Trooping duties Another operation which the Lady of Mann was assigned to was that of ferrying forces personnel from , which served throughout the war as a troop transport ship. Queen Mary would arrive in Belfast from Canada or the United States, turn around quickly and set off again westwards. Lady of Mann was one of several vessels that undertook this important task, taking troops on the final leg of their sea voyage to Greenock. Following her trooping duties Lady of Mann was then taken over by the Admiralty and converted to a Landing Ship Infantry (Hand Hoisting) vessel with a carrying capacity of six landing craft, 55 officers and 435 men. Operation Overlord On D-Day, 6 June 1944 as part of Operation Overlord, Lady of Man was the headquarters ship of the senior officer of the 512th Assault Flotilla, responsible for the landings in the Juno area near Courselles. Later in the month, while still on the Normandy operations, she was retired for repairs. Personnel duties and then went back to her duties as a personnel carrier. She served as such for the remainder of the war, carrying on for some months afterwards moving troops and bringing out displaced persons. She was mostly Channel plying to Ostende and the Hook from such ports as Dover and Harwich. ;Lady of Mann during her war service Lady of Mann at the Faroe Islands during her war service..JPGLady of Mann at the Faroe Islands on war service Lady of Mann pictured on war service at the Faroe Islands..JPGLady of Mann departing the Faroe Islands Lady of Mann returns from the war..jpgLady of Mann returning to Douglas, 9 March 1946, following her war service. =Post-war service= Lady of Mann returned to her home port, Douglas, on 9 March 1946, where she was given a civic reception. A local paper that week said that during her war service Lady of Mann had carried more than 2,000,000 troops. She was reconditioned by Cammell Laird & Co at Birkenhead and after her proud war service, Lady of Mann returned to her duties with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company on 14 June 1946. Like her sister , Lady of Mann only sailed during the summer season, and this may go some way to explaining their relatively long lives. Her career continued until August 1971. Lady of Mann made her final sailing from Liverpool at 09:00hrs on 14 August. In the afternoon she made passage from Douglas to Ardrossan, returning the following day, Sunday, 15 August. After a final day in her home port, Douglas, she departed bound for Barrow-in-Furness where she was laid up awaiting sale. On 14 December 1971, Lady of Mann was sold to Arnott Young and Co., Glasgow. She was taken under tow by the tugboat Wrestler on 29 December, arriving at Dalmuir on 31 December, for breaking up. Lady of Mann was an exceedingly popular ship. When she came to be broken up, enthusiasts wrote from all parts of Britain hoping to get souvenirs from her. One of the most elegant features of the \\"centenary Lady of Mann\\" was her main staircase which was made of mahogany. It was widely admired, and was another example of the type of furnishing that subsequently had to vanish. Before the ship had finished her service life, the staircase was in contravention of modern fire regulations. Alterations had to be made in the mid-1960s; the stylish opening had to be blocked in with steel walls, and steel doors had to be fitted. The appearance was largely sacrificed; the regulations concerning fire precautions duly satisfied. But when Lady of Mann was due to be broken up in the early 1970s, this much desired staircase was not quite finished. An enthusiast living in Castletown, succeeded in acquiring at least part of the woodwork, and it was reassembled at Lorne House in Castletown, where it remains to this day. Steam Packet officials affectionately described her as having been 'foreman built'. For when she was in the Vickers Armstrong yards at Barrow, the builder was going through the very severe slump which followed the 1929 Wall Street crash. Most of the yard staff had been dismissed and only key men kept on. It was these men who built the ship, and a very fine one she proved. The name Lady of Mann was resurrected by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company in 1976, when the fourth car ferry joined the fleet.

Living with the Ghosts is the fifth studio album by American ambient/post-rock band Hammock. It was released on May 18, 2010 by the band's own label, Hammock Music. In addition to the standard edition, Chasing After Shadows... Living with the Ghosts was released in a limited edition format with a photobook and four-track EP titled North West East South. The album received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the songwriting and production, though some reviewers criticized the album's length. Background After releasing the minimalistic Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow in 2008, Hammock wanted to create an album with \\"a very full atmosphere\\"\\\\\\\\. \\"It wasn't like an intentional reaction to Maybe rather it felt like a natural progression of what we wanted to do at the time\\", the band commented. \\"As an artist, that's the voice you have to follow.\\" Music The band described Chasing After Shadows... Living with the Ghosts as \\"[their] most bombastic record so far\\", and as \\"more organic\\". Byrd and Thompson were inspired by the landscape of the Deep South, where they both grew up, and from \\"an understanding of the impermanence of life. When we look at this aspect of the human experience straight in the face we have a greater appreciation of life but at the same time we also experience a deep sense of melancholy.\\" They cited atmospheric artists such as Brian Eno, William Basinski, Stars of the Lid, Cocteau Twins, the Church and the Cure as influences, in addition to more cinematic acts, including Sigur Rós, Max Richter, Johann Johannsson and Arvo Pärt. =Composition= Chasing After Shadows... Living with the Ghosts was written by the band by introducing \\"almost every idea we have\\" and then \\"[criticizing themselves] to death\\". Release and promotion Chasing After Shadows... Living with the Ghosts was released on May 18, 2010 in the US and June 14, 2010 in the UK. The band made outtakes from the album available online. A limited edition of the album, featuring a photobook and four-track EP titled North West East South, was also released. The album's title described \\"only seeing the shadow of things and not their reality\\". The band stated that the use of ellipsis \\"both continues and separates a thought.\\" Hammock collaborator Thomas Petillo created the album's artwork while traveling through the Deep South with Byrd and Thompson. The figures floating in water were photographed at Hot Springs, Arkansas. however, Petillo intended the cover to represent rebirth. Reception Chasing After Shadows... Living with the Ghosts was met with positive critical reception. BBC critic Mike Diver ranked it as \\"one of the most beautiful albums of this year.\\" James Mason of AllMusic noted that \\"as objective a concept as perfection is, it is hard to think of what Hammock have achieved here as anything else.\\" Ryan Reed of PopMatters described the album as \\"perfect sonic accompaniment for the half-dreams that plague a restless sleep.\\" Critics noted that the album featured \\"a slight move toward more conventional rock structures\\" and more acoustic textures than their previous releases, but that fans of Hammock's previous releases would still enjoy it. When comparing the album with Maybe They Will Sing for Us Tomorrow, Diver criticized the album for feeling \\"uncomfortably boxed in, its textures equally rich but unable to flow in the manner its makers previously permitted.\\" Joe Tangari of Pitchfork described the music as \\"intensely visual... you really get the sense of shapes shifting and forms moving.\\" Mason praised the album's songwriting. \\"The temptation to slip into melodrama with music like Hammock's must be immense, but Byrd and Thompson know when to push over the top and when to pull back, take in the surrounding view, and pour that beauty into their songs,\\" he said. \\"The exhilarating thing about this record is that they walk this line, between being at the top and going over.\\" Ferguson felt the strings were underused on the album, noting that \\"when they do come to the fore, the arrangements are excellent.\\" The album's production was praised by Mason. Reed said his favorite moments were those where \\"the surprising details creep in\\". In contrast, Diver described the production as \\"patchy\\". The album's length was noted by reviewers. Mason praised the album for \\"[working] as an entire piece, not a mere collection of songs.\\" Tangari said the album was \\"easy to luxuriate in for its full run time.\\" Writing for Drowned in Sound, Robert Ferguson praised the opening three tracks, but felt that \\"from here is where Chasing After Shadows... starts to feel a bit samey.\\" \\"Halfway through the album... the euphoria starts to wear off,\\" Reed said, \\"and it becomes difficult not to beg for a fresh chord change or a new instrument.\\" Track listing Personnel * Hammock (Marc Byrd and Andrew Thompson) – guitars, vocals, percussion, producers * Steve Hindalong – drums, percussion * Tim Powles – drums * Love Sponge Strings and Horns – strings, horns * Matt Slocum – cello * Christine Glass Byrd – vocals * Tim Powles – mixing, additional production * Derri Daughterty – mixing * William Bowden – mastering * Thomas Petillo – photography References External links * Chasing After Shadows...

When plants are subjected to less than ideal growing conditions, they are considered to be under stress. Stress factors can affect growth, survival and crop yields. Plant stress research looks at the response of plants to limitations and excesses of the main abiotic factors (light, temperature, water and nutrients), and of other stress factors that are important in particular situations (e.g. pests, pathogens, or pollutants). Plant stress measurement usually focuses on taking measurements from living plants. It can involve visual assessments of plant vitality, however, more recently the focus has moved to the use of instruments and protocols that reveal the response of particular processes within the plant (especially, photosynthesis, plant cell signalling and plant secondary metabolism) *Determining the optimal conditions for plant growth, e.g. optimising water use in an agricultural system *Determining the climatic range of different species or subspecies *Determining which species or subspecies are resistant to a particular stress factor Instruments used to measure plant stress Measurements can be made from living plants using specialised equipment. Among the most commonly used instruments are those that measure parameters related to photosynthesis (chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, gas exchange) or water use (porometer, pressure bomb). In addition to these general purpose instruments, researchers often design or adapt other instruments tailored to the specific stress response they are studying. Photosynthesis systems Photosynthesis systems use infrared gas analyzers (IRGAS) for measuring photosynthesis. CO2 concentration changes in leaf chambers are measured to provide carbon assimilation values for leaves or whole plants. Research has shown that the rate of photosynthesis is directly related to the amount of carbon assimilated by the plant. Measuring CO2 in the air, before it enters the leaf chamber, and comparing it to air measured for CO2 after it leaves the leaf chamber, provides this value using proven equations. These systems also use IRGAs, or solid state humidity sensors, for measuring H2O changes in leaf chambers. This is done to measure leaf transpiration, and to correct CO2 measurements. The light absorption spectrum for CO2 and H2O overlap somewhat, therefore, a correction is necessary for reliable CO2 measuring results. The critical measurement for most plant stress measurements is designated by \\"A\\" or carbon assimilation rate. When a plant is under stress, less carbon is assimilated. CO2 IRGAs are capable of measuring to approximately +/- 1 μmol or 1ppm of CO2. Because these systems are effective in measuring carbon assimilation and transpiration at low rates, as found in stressed plants, they are often used as the standard to compare to other types of instruments. Photosynthesis instruments come in field portable and laboratory versions. They are also designed to measure ambient environmental conditions, and some systems offer variable microclimate control of the measuring chamber. Microclimate control systems allow adjustment of the measuring chamber temperature, CO2 level, light level, and humidity level for more detailed investigation. The combination of these systems with fluorometers, can be especially effective for some types of stress, and can be diagnostic, e.g. in the study of cold stress and drought stress. Chlorophyll fluorometers Chlorophyll fluorescence emitted from plant leaves gives an insight into the health of the photosynthetic systems within the leaf. Chlorophyll fluorometers are designed to measure variable fluorescence of photosystem II. This variable fluorescence can be used to measure the level of plant stress. The most commonly used protocols include those aimed at measuring the photosynthetic efficiency of photosystem II, both in the light (ΔF/Fm') and in a dark-adapted state (Fv/Fm). Chlorophyll fluorometers are, for the most part, less expensive tools than photosynthesis systems, they also have a faster measurement time and tend to be more portable. For these reasons they have become one of the most important tools for field measurements of plant stress. Fv/Fm Fv/Fm tests whether or not plant stress affects photosystem II in a dark adapted state. Fv/Fm is the most used chlorophyll fluorescence measuring parameter in the world. \\"The majority of fluorescence measurements are now made using modulated fluorometers with the leaf poised in a known state.\\" (Neil Baker 2004)Rosyara, U. R., S. Subdedi, R. C. Sharma and E. Duveiller. 2010. Photochemical Efficiency and SPAD Value as Indirect Selection Criteria for Combined Selection of Spot Blotch and Terminal Heat Stress in Wheat. Journal of Phytopathology Volume 158, Issue 11-12, pages 813–821 Light that is absorbed by a leaf follows three competitive pathways. It may be used in photochemistry to produce ATP and NADPH used in photosynthesis, it can be re-emitted as fluorescence, or dissipated as heat. The Fv/Fm test is designed to allow the maximum amount of the light energy to take the fluorescence pathway. It compares the dark-adapted leaf pre- photosynthetic fluorescent state, called minimum fluorescence, or Fo, to maximum fluorescence called Fm. In maximum fluorescence, the maximum number of reaction centers have been reduced or closed by a saturating light source. In general, the greater the plant stress, the fewer open reaction centers available, and the Fv/Fm ratio is lowered. Fv/Fm is a measuring protocol that works for many types of plant stress. In Fv/Fm measurements, after dark adaption, minimum fluorescence is measured, using a modulated light source. This is a measurement of antennae fluorescence using a modulated light intensity that is too low to drive photosynthesis. Next, an intense light flash, or saturation pulse, of a limited duration, is used, to expose the sample, and close all available reaction centers. With all available reaction centers closed, or chemically reduced, maximum fluorescence is measured. The difference between maximum fluorescence and minimum fluorescence is Fv, or variable fluorescence. Fv/Fm is a normalize ratio created by dividing variable fluorescence by maximum fluorescence. It is a measurement ratio that represents the maximum potential quantum efficiency of Photosystem II if all capable reaction centers were open. An Fv/Fm value in the range of 0.79 to 0.84 is the approximate optimal value for many plant species, with lowered values indicating plant stress (Maxwell K., Johnson G. N. 2000), (Kitajima and Butler, 1975). Fv/Fm is a fast test that usually takes a few seconds. It was developed in and around 1975 by Kitajima and Butler. Dark adaptation times vary from about fifteen minutes to overnight. Some researchers will only use pre-dawn values. Y(II) or ΔF/Fm' and ETR Y(II) is a measuring protocol that was developed by Bernard Genty with the first publications in 1989 and 1990. It is a light adapted test that allows one to measure plant stress while the plant is undergoing the photosynthetic process at steady-state photosynthesis lighting conditions. Like FvFm, Y(II) represents a measurement ratio of plant efficiency, but in this case, it is an indication of the amount of energy used in photochemistry by photosystem II under steady-state photosynthetic lighting conditions. For most types of plant stress, Y(II) correlates to plant carbon assimilation in a linear fashion in C4 plants. In C3 plants, most types of plant stress correlate to carbon assimilation in a curve-linear fashion. According to Maxwell and Johnson, it takes between fifteen and twenty minutes for a plant to reach steady-state photosynthesis at a specific light level. In the field, plants in full sunlight, and not under canopy, or partly cloudy conditions, are considered to be at steady state. In this test, light irradiation levels and leaf temperature must be controlled or measured, because while the Y(II) parameter levels vary with most types of plant stress, it also varies with light level and temperature. Y(II) values will be higher at lower light levels than at higher light levels. Y(II) has the advantage that it is more sensitive to a larger number of plant stress types than Fv/Fm. ETR, or electron transport rate, is also a light-adapted parameter that is directly related to Y(II) by the equation, ETR = Y(II) × PAR × 0.84 × 0.5. By multiplying Y(II) by the irradiation light level in the PAR range (400 nm to 700 nm) in μmols, multiplied by the average ratio of light absorbed by the leaf 0.84, and multiplied by the average ratio of PSII reaction centers to PSI reaction centers, 0.50, relative ETR measurement is achieved. Relative ETR values are valuable for stress measurements when comparing one plant to another, as long as the plants to be compared have similar light absorption characteristics. Leaf absorption characteristics can vary by water content, age, and other factors. If absorption differences are a concern, absorption can be measured with the use of an integrating sphere. For more accurate ETR values, the leaf absorption value and the ratio of PSII reaction centers to PSI reaction centers can be included in the equation. If different leaf absorption ratios are an issue, or they are an unwanted variable, then using Y(II) instead of ETR, may be the best choice. Four electrons must be transported for every CO2 molecule assimilated, or O2 molecule evolved, differences from gas exchange measurements, especially in C3 plants, can occur under conditions that promote photorespiration, cyclic electron transport, and nitrate reduction. For more detailed information concerning the relationship between fluorescence and gas exchange measurements again refer to Opti-Sciences application note #0509 on Yield measurements. Quenching measurements Quenching measurements have been traditionally used for light stress, and heat stress measurements. In addition, they have been used to study plant photoprotective mechanisms, state transitions, plant photoinhibition, and the distribution of light energy in plants. While they can be used for many types of plant stress measurement, the time required, and the additional expense required for this capability, limit their use. These tests commonly require overnight dark adaptation, and fifteen to twenty minutes in lighted conditions to reach steady state photosynthesis before measurement. = Puddle model and lake model quenching parameters = \\"Understanding of the organization of plant antennae, or plant light collection structures, and reaction centers, where the photosynthetic light reaction actually takes place, has changed over the years. It is now understood that a single antennae does not link only to a single reaction center, as was previously described in the puddle model. Current evidence indicates that reaction centers are connected with shared antennae in terrestrial plants.\\" As a result, the parameters used to provide reliable measurements have changed to represent the newer understanding of this relationship. The model that represents the newer understanding of the antennae - reaction center relationship is called the lake model. Lake model parameters were provided by Dave Kramer in 2004. Since then, Luke Hendrickson has provided simplified lake model parameters that allow the resurrection of the parameter NPQ, from the puddle model, back into the lake model. This is valuable because there have been so many scientific papers that have used NPQ for plant stress measurement, as compared to papers that have used lake model parameters. For an in-depth overview of quenching, refer to the OSI quenching application note. It discusses all of the parameters used in lake models by Kramer, Hendrickson, and Klughammer. It also reviews puddle model parameters, and quenching relaxation measurements. Further, a deep review of all existing parameters is provided in Lazar (2015, J. Plant Physiol. 175, 131-147) OJIP or OJIDP OJIP or OJIDP is a dark adapted chlorophyll fluorescence technique that is used for plant stress measurement. It has been found that by using a high time resolution scale, the rise to maximum fluorescence from minimum fluorescence has intermediate peaks and dips, designated by the OJID and P nomenclature. Over the years, there have been multiple theories of what the rise, time scale, peaks and dips mean. In addition, there is more than one school as to how this information should be used for plant stress testing (Strasser 2004), (Vredenburg 2004, 2009, 2011). Like Fv/Fm, and the other protocols, the research shows that OJIP works better for some types of plant stress than it does for others. Choosing the best chlorophyll fluorescence protocol and parameter When choosing the correct protocol, and measuring parameter, for a specific type of plant stress, it is important to understand the limitations of the instrument, and the protocol used. For example, it was found that when measuring Oak leaves, a photosynthesis system could detect heat stress at 30 °C and above, Y(II) could detect heat stress at 35 °C and above, NPQ could detect heat stress at 35 °C and above, and Fv/Fm could only detect heat stress at 45 °C and above. (Haldiman P, & Feller U. 2004) OJIP was found to detect heat stress at 44 °C and above on samples tested. (Strasser 2004) The relationship between carbon assimilation measurements made by photosynthesis systems of the dark Calvin cycle, and measurements of variable fluorescence of photosystem II (PSII), made by chlorophyll fluorometers of the light reaction, are not always straightforward. For this reason, choosing the correct chlorophyll fluorescence protocol can also be different for C3 and C4 plants. It has been found, for example, that Y(II) and ETR are good tests for drought stress in C4 plants, but a special assay is required to measure drought stress in most C3 plants at usable levels. In C3 plants, photorespiration, and the Mehler reaction, are thought to be a principal cause. (Flexas 2000) Chlorophyll content meters These are instruments that use light transmission through a leaf, at two wavelengths, to determine the greenness and thickness of leaves. Transmission in the infrared range provides a measurement related to leaf thickness, and a wavelength in the red light range is used to determine greenness. The ratio of the transmission of the two wavelengths provides a chlorophyll content index that is referred to as CCI or alternatively as a SPAD index. CCI is a linear scale, and SPAD is a logarithmic scale. These instruments and scales have been shown to correlate to chlorophyll chemical tests for chlorophyll content except at very high levels. Chlorophyll content meters are commonly used for nutrient plant stress measurement, that includes nitrogen stress, and sulfur stress. Because research has shown, that if used correctly, chlorophyll content meters are reliable for nitrogen management work, these meters are often the instruments of choice for crop fertilizer management because they are relatively inexpensive. Research has demonstrated that by comparing well fertilized plants to test plants, the ratio of the chlorophyll content index of test plants, divided by the chlorophyll content index of well fertilized plants, will provide a ratio that is an indication of when fertilization should occur, and how much should be used. It is common to use a well fertilized stand of crops in a specific field and sometimes in different areas of the same field, as the fertilization reference, due to differences from field to field and within a field. The research done to date uses either ten and thirty measurements on test and well fertilized crops, to provide average values. Studies have been done for corn and wheat. One paper suggests that when the ratio drops below 95%, it is time to fertigate. The amounts of fertilizer are also recommended. Crop consultants also use these tools for fertilizer recommendations. However, because strict scientific protocols are more time consuming and more expensive, consultants sometimes use well-fertilized plants located in low-lying areas as the standard well-fertilized plants. They typically also use fewer measurements. The evidence for this approach involves anecdotal discussions with crop consultants. Chlorophyll content meters are sensitive to both nitrogen and sulfur stress at usable levels. Chlorophyll fluorometers require a special assay, involving a high actinic light level in combination with nitrogen stress, to measure nitrogen stress at usable levels. In addition, chlorophyll fluorometers will only detect sulfur stress at starvation levels. For best results, chlorophyll content measurements should be made when water deficits are not present. Photosynthesis systems will detect both nitrogen and sulfur stress.

Phoenix Online Studios is currently developing The Silver Lining (game). It is an episodic game series based on the King's Quest series. It is an unofficial sequel, taking place where King's Quest 8 left off. Four episodes of the game has been released so far. Smaller developers have released assorted games set in the KQ universe as well. Steve Lingle created a text based remake of King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder. A small team known as Intermezzo Software created a followup set between KQ2 and KQ3, using Sierra's classic AGI system (requires DosBox). Finally, Joel Page created a short adventure/parody called Owl's Quest: Every Owl has it's Day starring Cedric the Owl from King's Quest V, set after KQ8. In some cases a few of Sierra's former employees such as Josh Mandel, Lori Ann Cole and Andy Hoyos became involved with the fan games, lending their voices to characters. In the case of King's Quest III Redux, several professional actors/actresses lent their voices to a couple of characters, including Robert Adamson. Another notable aspect is that AGD Interactive, Phoenix Online Studios, and Infamous Adventures each received fan licenses from Activision (or previous owners of the King's Quest IP) to finish their fan remakes and games, and release them for free.KQIX: The Silver Lining -- A Talk with Phoenix Online Studios. GameSpy article by Allen 'Delsyn' Rausch from December 16, 2005Vivendi Games Agrees To Crown Fan-Created 'King's Quest' SequelMTV article by Stephen Totilo from December 9, 2005 =Mythology= The King's Quest fan series like their predecessors are often inspired by classical fairy tales, fantasy, classic horror, and mythology. Whereas the original series references to other works were often direct, some of the fan developers such as AGD Interactive chose to obscure the references in some way. For example Dracula (who was directly taken from the novel of the same name) was replaced with the Count Caldaur who instead of being evil turns out to be good. Little Red Riding Hood was replaced by the character Possum/Anastasia, and Grandma became Lavidia (curiously Anastasia can be seen reading a copy of Little Red Riding Hood, further showing that she is not the classic fairy tale character). Medusa was replaced with the character Smaude, who turns out to be a cursed maiden and innocent. =Fan games= *King's Quest ZZT (1997) - by Interactive Fantasieshttp://if.digitalmzx.net/gameinfo1.shtml#kqzzthttp://if.digitalmzx.net/games.shtml game download *King's Quest ZZT 2 (2000) - by Interactive Fantasieshttp://if.digitalmzx.net/gameinfo3.shtml#kqzzt2 *King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown (2001)/Enhanced Edition (2009), unofficial modernized VGA remake of King's Quest I SCI by AGD Interactive (formerly \\"Tierra Entertainment\\"). *King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones (2002)/Enhanced Edition (2009), also by AGD Interactive, based on King's Quest II. *Peasant's Quest (2004) by Homestar Runner, a satirical parody of King's Quest and similar adventure games, set in the world of Peasantry. *King's Quest 2 ¼: Breast Intentions (2005) - a game by Intermezzo Software.Game download (requires DOSbox) *King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human (2006), by Infamous Adventures, unofficial modernized VGA remake of King's Quest III. *King's Quest V - The Text Adventure (2007) - created by Steve Lingle, it is an unofficial text adventure remake of King's Quest V. *Owl's Quest: Every Owl Has It's Day (2007) - by Jstudioshttp://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/paw/lppaw/33091-lets- play-live-owls-quest *King's Quest III: To Heir Is Human (a.k.a.

Game descriptions =King's Quest ZZT= Alexander sets out on adventure to stop Ravenlos (the evil cousin of Mordack and Manannan). Following Rosella and Valenice's return to Castle Daventry, a big festival is held. A messenger comes to the castle, explaining to them that Ravenlos, the evil cousin of the sorcerer Manannan has conquered the island of Llewdor, and is planning to conquer Daventry. Graham was furious of the news, and asked his son Prince Alexander to defend the kingdom. Alexander was not willing to go fight against him and his army, until his father collapses sick, which changes Alexander's mind. Alexander visits the old wise gnome for a medicine for his father, and after he is healed, he sets off for the long and dangerous mission. Along the way he meets strange creatures like Centaurs, Elves and Ogres and visits many places, like the mountains of Llewdor, the island of Tamir, and the Aberian Desert.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZqucSN6CXQ Youtube video of gameplayhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8txlm0OMTlY King's Quest ZZT Let's play A nod to the King's Quest ZZT games is made in The Silver Lining (video game)'s \\"The Four Winds\\" meta-fiction newsletter.

Valanice sets out on an adventure to find her kidnapped son, and save him from starvation. The game uses the classic AGI system. Along the way she meets the woodcutter and his wife, pirates, henchmen, Charon, Rumplestiltskin, and others. =King's Quest V: The Text Adventure= A text based re-imagining of the King's Quest V adventure. It contains an almost completely original script, with all new descriptions for the events and areas in the game. =Owl's Quest: Every Owl Has It's Day= Owl's Quest: Every Owl Has Day is an unofficial adventure fangame developed and released in free download format by Jstudios for Microsoft Windows on May 26, 2007.Adventure Game Studio Game PageJstudios webpage It is a short parody of the King's Quest series (specifically King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder! and the fangame The Silver Lining) starring Cedric the Owl from King's Quest V. The game is set a short while after King's Quest VIII: Mask of Eternity.Narrator: \\"After the dealing's in King's Quest VIII TM, the royal family of Daventry is planning a cellebration.\\" Plot Cedric receives an invitation from King Alexander to attend a birthday ceremony in the Land of the Green Isles.Jstudios website Having had a curse put on him by Crispin, Cedric must attempt to make his way to Crispin and have the curse removed so he can fly to the Green Isles. Cedric explores new locations in Serenia, including Cedric's treehouse, the Inverted Tower of Repunzel, and thwarts snakes and scorpions to make his way to Crispin's house, and finally to the Green Isles. The game includes a full voice cast (minus the narrator). Gameplay The gameplay is similar to the interface found in King's Quest VII: The Princeless Bride. It includes a single icon interface, an inventory section, and a feature to look at items. The single cursor can be used to speak to characters or look at objects on the screen. The art style is a crude mix of KQ7 animation style, with close-up photos from KQ5 and KQ6. The background artwork is a mix of crude hand-drawn art, and images taken from KQ5 and KQ6. The game has a total of 8 points, with not much more than ten puzzles to solve.Game Solution There are a total of three ways to die in the game (killed by a scorpion, a snake, or falling into a pit). Development The game was developed by Joel Page using the Adventure Game Studio, created for the monthly AGS competition. It has a full voice cast except the narrator. All parts presumably done by Joel Page (as he is the single person on the credit screen). The game uses a mix of music largely taken from KQ7. The parody aspects of the game poke fun at situations in KQ5 with mixed results. For example Cedric encounters and can be killed by things he warned about in KQ5. He is forced to go into places, he would have told Graham to avoid in KQ5. The game makes fun of Crispin's mispronunciation and use of generic magic words (which case he uses the 'bibbidi bobbidi boo' from Cinderella). It makes fun of Cedric's \\"annoying\\" voice and nature. It even attempts to break the fourth wall at times with Cedric conversing with the narrator. Reception The game was given a special two part \\"Let's Play\\" review on That Guy with the Glasses by Paw Dugan. In the videos he and his co-host kept a running timer of the total number of typographical and grammatical errors in the game's script. They also pointed out the satirical aspects of the game that make fun of Cedric, and certain over-used plot contrivances in KQ5. They poke fun at the game's bugs. The videos also show the replies from the live events audience making fun of the game. Some of the footage will be used in a special on Sierra fan game development scene.That Guy with the Glasses Owl's Quest Let's Play Review =Cedric Shooter= In this funfair-style arcade mini-game adaption of Sierra's KQ5 owl named Cedric, you have to kill Cedric as many times as possible within the 20 seconds time limit!

Aretino was started by Arthur J. O’Neill, who was linked to several Chicago-area record and phonograph operations. O’Neill named this company in honor of Guido Aretino, an 11th-century Italian monk because he was an originator of the musical scale Aretino is an oddity distinguished by its records' spindle hole, the largest ever produced for commercial purposes. It was a premium scheme, similar to many of O’Neill's operations, in that a phonograph machine was offered cheaply;Longwell, Glenn 78 rpm Records Labels - Ap to Az Majestic Records. Retrieved June 7, 2011Aretino phonograph and record ad. Eugene Register-Guard. December 8, 1910. Page 2. however, this phonograph could only play Aretino records because it came with a 3-inch spindle. The design was intended such that an Aretino record could be played on any disc phonograph of the time. As such, O’Neill also offered adapters for Aretino discs that allowed them to be played on phonographs with a standard spindle, or even on a Busy Bee machine (another O’Neill operation) with its extra spindle hole. Aretino did not produce any of its own recordings, but it leased masters from other companies. The first series of Aretino records were a single-sided A-prefixJournal - Association for Recorded Sound Collections, Volumes 11-12. 1979. page 22 sequence that originated from Leeds & Catlin.

O'Neal and Belford Royal of Universal Talking Machine (makers of Zonophone Records) developed a close business association, but the relationship between Universal and O'Neal ended on orders of Eldridge Johnson, who was concerned that any association with a \\"cheap\\" brand such as Aretino, even with a subsidiary such as Zonophone, would tarnish the luxury image of the Victor company. Additionally, Victor had set its sights on Hawthorne and Sheble (who manufactured the Aretino phonograph for O'Neal) in courts of law, and enjoined O'Neal in this lawsuit. O'Neal travelled to Camden in an attempt at an out-of- court agreement, but this overture was rebuffed. Soon afterwards, Columbia became the sole supplier.

O'Neal merged his Busy Bee and Aretino operations in 1910, but only continued to make the Aretino product. Aretino ceased operations in 1914, and by 1916 O'Neal's leftover phonograph assets were folded into the Consolidated Talking Machine Company. The music that appeared on Aretino label was typical of the period. Henry Burr, William F. Denny, Byron G. Harlan, Ada Jones, Billy Murray, Vess Ossman, Steve Porter, Cal Stewart, and Bert Williams among many other early recording pioneers had their recordings leased to Aretino.

Sankaramangalam. Soorya, Babu Namboothiri, Sai Das and Balan play the lead roles. Plot Susan and Jose are students of the post-graduate course in the university. They fall in love and decide to get married. The political scene in the university is turbulent. Once, Susan and Jose happen to witness the death of one of their collegemates in the hands of a group of students. When the police enquiries begin, Jose tries to wash his hands by denying his knowledge about the murder. This creates disturbances in Susan's relation with Jose. Susan's admiration to Mohan, her teacher and the leader of a students union, creates suspicions in Jose's mind also. But eventually, they do get married. Jose gets a job in a factory and the couple move to Trivandrum. Meanwhile, Mohan, who has been fired from the university becomes a union leader in Trivandrum. His works bring him in contact with the workers in the factory where Jose works, and Jose watches his association with the workers with distrust and disdain. Initially, Susan is happy in her new home in Trivandrum. But things start changing when Jose starts a secret relation with his mentor Varkey's daughter Bindu. Whenever she complains, Jose is rude to her. Meanwhile, Mohan makes occasional visits to Jose's house but Jose rudely sends him away. Susan goes to meet Mohan outside her home. One day, while Susan was awaiting Jose to join her for the Christmas Eve dinner, Jose rushes home and beats her up and orders her to get out of the house. Susan, completely shattered, cannot bear the situation. There is no way left for her to extricate herself from the sordid relationship except death. She contemplates suicide. At this moment, Mohan runs into the house, wounded in an encounter with the police. Susan appeals to Bindu to dress up Mohan's wound. The strange confrontation between the two women leads to a change of heart in Bindu. She becomes aware of her own selfishness, and is ashamed of her previous ruthless behavior in continuing her affair with Jose in defiance of Susan and her feelings. With Susan's help, Mohan vanishes into the night, escaping his relentless pursuers. Mohan's dramatic appearance, and Susan's encounter with Bindu, leaves her completely exhausted. Even death seems far away now. The film ends with Susan stepping out of her home and walking towards an unknown destination.

Numerous stretches of BR-116 highway have other official names. The highway is especially busy along the Curitiba—São Paulo—Rio de Janeiro section. The Curitiba–São Paulo section–officially known as the Régis Bittencourt Highway (Rodovia Régis Bittencourt)–is nicknamed the \\"Highway of Death\\" (\\"Rodovia da Morte\\") due to its many weather-related accidents. The São Paulo—Rio de Janeiro section is officially named President Dutra Highway (Rodovia Presidente Dutra) and is the busiest section of BR-116, running into or close to 15 cities with over 200,000 inhabitants.

The locality was originally named Contention after a quarrel between two of its prominent residents. The Contention post office opened in 1886. A daughter of one of the residents involved in the quarrel suggested that the name Twickenham, after the London suburb in England, would be more dignified than Contention. As it happened, the Contention post office closed in 1895, and a Twickenham post office opened in 1896 in the same general vicinity. It closed in 1917, and mail to Twickenham thereafter has been sent via Fossil, about to the north. After formation of Wheeler County in 1899, Twickenham was suggested as a possible county seat. A county-wide election held in 1900 produced 436 votes for Fossil, 267 for Twickenham, and 82 for Spray. At the time, Twickenham had a store, hotel, blacksmith shop, and a ferry across the river.

Rivera, Alex, dir. 1997. DVD. about immigration. The film stars Augusto Rivera, the director’s father, and Alex Rivera himself. It calls attention to ideas of transculturation, national belonging, cultural imperialism, and cultural globalization, as Rivera chronicles his father’s journey from his native Perú to his life in the United States and parallels it with the journey of the potato. Overview The film’s title “Papapapa” is a portmanteau of the Spanish terms \\"potato\\" and \\"father,\\" which connects the relationship between the Peruvian roots of the potato and Augusto Rivera. Rivera sets out to connect the worldwide distribution of potatoes to his father's journey in migrating to the United States. The potato, a vegetable first cultivated by the Incas in Peru, has undergone transformation since the Spanish introduced it to the rest of the world in the 16th century.http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PotatoHistory.htm The director mirrors the migration of the potato to that of his father; he asserts that in the process of migration, his father has also been culturally transformed like the potato. Using home footage and satirical undertones, Rivera acknowledges the challenges his father faces in trying to acquire a better life for himself and his family in the United States. He juxtaposes the story of the potato with that of his father, but also often creates images that intertwine the images of both. In one instance, he uses a handcrafted figure with a picture of his father's face riding a potato from Perú to the United States to capture the essence of both stories he is telling. Rivera crosses the final product of the potato – the potato chip and the French fry, for example – with that of his father, \\"sitting on the American sofa, eating potato chips and watching Spanish-Language television.\\" Within the film, he also adds a pseudo television broadcast named “Inca Television” to discuss the colonial history of the potato. This film highlights the widespread acceptance of the white potato in European and American culture. When the potato traveled from the Americas around the 1622, the brown colored potato was excluded. This idealism is still demonstrated within the potato chip industry. Tri-Sum potato chips say that the consumerism of this snack food is strongly competitive. Therefore, they try to offer the best potato chips possible, done by excluding the brown-colored chips. In modern times, there have been various representations of exclusion to the colored idealism. As Augusto Rivera mentions in his interviews, when he arrived to the United States, there were signs for “Colored” and “White” people, neither of which he identified as. Although he identified as neither, he thought it would be simple to go for the “White” label, as it is the most accepted cultural norm in the United States. Discrimination for colored people are illustrated at a global scale and Augusto Rivera said it was bad in Perú but worsen when he arrived to the United States. Analysis The film captures the essence of Latino immigrants trying to live \\"American\\" lifestyles in an attempt to fulfill a desire for national belonging. Univision,http://www.univision.net/corp/en/index.jsp a television network featured in Spanish, integrates daily news from Latin America. Latin people can maintain an emotional linkage by watching the daily progress of their country of origin while living an American life in the United States. At a certain extent, Alex Rivera embeds transculturation in his film to illustrate the dichotomies of Perú and the United States. Univision, ”Inca Television,” and the potato carry various forms of representation that merge Peruvian identity and American assimilation. Augusto Rivera mentions staying away from the Spanish people to fulfill the “American Dream.” Conscious rising about the life of immigrants is perpetuated within Papapapá. Other ideas presented are the roles of NAFTA North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). January 2008. http://www.univision.net/corp/en/index.jsp and the Border Patrol. Latino are presumed to play roles of housemaids and other while the United States continue prosper in their economy and still seek to leave people south of the border.

Some of Aviointeriors' competitors include BE Aerospace, Recaro, and Zodiac Aerospace. History =Founding= The company was founded as a branch of the “Uno-Pi” a home furniture company part of the CIFA (Confederazione Italiana Fabbriche Arredamento) group owned by Giovanni Pofferi [1908 –1995]. The CIFA Group included the Permaflex brand, that introduced, in 1950, spring-mattress technology in Italy. (Permaflex, during the 1960s and the 1970s, was used in Italian common language as a generic trademark for the spring-mattress). The CIFA group, in an effort to expand the market of the furnishing sector, found an opportunity in commercial aviation with the ATLAS consortium of airlines: comprising Air France, Alitalia, All Nippon Airways, Lufthansa/Condor, Sabena and (from. January 1972) Iberia. This consortium was established to create a European common technical standard for aircraft systems and a centralized purchasing office. Alitalia sponsored within the ATLAS consortium a joint- venture between the newborn Aviointeriors and the French Sicma. The joint- venture was established to share the aircraft cabin equipment market of the members of the ATLAS consortium. Aviointeriors supplied seats and food trolleys for 50% of the European airlines joining ATLAS. A facility was built in Latina in 1974. The joint-venture with Sicma did not last long. Aviointeriors acquired the technical know-how to design, manufacture and sell products on its own. The company moved its headquarters from the CIFA building in Rome to the plant in Latina, where they are today. The furnishing of the Alitalia fleet continued in the following years, but the national market was shared with another company, Alven, that Alitalia also sponsored to avoid an Italian monopoly of the cabin interiors manufacturing. Aviointeriors expanded its market in the 1970s by developing fittings and furniture for V.I.P. Agusta helicopters and private aircraft. =The Alven takeover= At the beginning of the 1980s, the CIFA group suffered a financial crisis and Aviointeriors was put up for sale. After a first offer by Irvin Aerospace, the company was acquired in May 1986 by the Veneruso family owning the Alven which was, at that time, a competitor based near Naples. Advanced seating products in the business class sector, helped Aviointeriors to reach the North and South American market, expanding also in the Far East. =Aviointeriors today= Today the company is focused on the seat market. A full range, from regional economy class seats to first class is produced and sold globally. Aviointerior products are installed on aircraft ranging from the 40 seats regional turboprops to the 400 seats intercontinental jetliners. From its initial production of mechanical economy and business class seats, Aviointeriors now include in its lineup electrically actuated lie-flat seats and full-flat seats with surrounding service furniture. Among developments is a seating concept known as SkyRider, this is a saddle-like airline seat where seat pitch is reduced to 23 inches. Aviointeriors claims that these seats allow up to 40% increase in passenger capacity.CNN, \\"Giddyup: Saddle seat a new squeeze on fliers?\\", Marnie Hunte, 14 September 2010 (accessed 15 September 2010)The Daily Telegraph, \\"SkyRider: new 'saddle' seat allows airlines to 'cram' more passengers\\", Andrew Hough, 14 September 2010 (accessed 15 September 2010)New York Daily News, \\"Saddle up!

He was also a publisher, manufacturer and inventor. Biography Christian L. Poorman was born in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania October 28, 1825, the son of Christian and Elizabeth (Longdorf) Poorman. His father died in 1840 from the effects of a wound received in the War of 1812. He attended the common schools and learned cabinet and chair making trades. He worked at these to afford law school. He entered the Cincinnati Law School in 1853, and graduated in 1855, establishing a large clientage at St. Clairsville, Ohio. Politically, he was a Whig, and became a Republican and strongly supported Abraham Lincoln when he edited the Belmont Chronicle. He continued with the Chronicle until 1870, except when away as a soldier. Poorman raised a company, and was commissioned captain of Company D, 43rd Ohio Infantry, December 21, 1861 - August 12, 1862. For gallantry in the field, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel, and assigned to 98th Ohio Infantry, participated in battles in Kentucky and Tennessee, and resigned September 12, 1863. After selling the Chronicle in 1870, Poorman manufactured machinery in Bellaire, Ohio. He was issued in 1871. The Panic of 1873 wiped out his fortune.

He was influenced by Vitalism a German-Scandinavian movement that incorporated Nietzsche's philosophy.Playing Children. Life Thomé was born on 4 July 1878 in Alajärvi, Grand Duchy of Finland, the son of Johan Thome (a forestry officer) and Agnes Thome (née Wallin). He was one of eight children. His first job was at the Tilgmans Lithographical Company, which commissioned posters from Finnish artists. At the same time he attended the Helsinki University Art School, where he was taught drawing by Fredrik Ahlstedt and Albert Gebhard. In 1898–99, he attended the drawing school at the Finnish League of Artists, under Helene Schjerfbeck, but left because of poor health. He spent 1901 and 1902 in Munich at the Bavarian Royal Academy of Art, studying under the animal-painter H. Zugel and the portraitist Ludwig von Herterich. At this time he painted in a realistic style. Between 1903 and 1910 he spent his summers with Magnus Enckell at Hogland (Suursaari Island) on the southern Finnish coast. He first came to prominence in 1903 when he exhibited in Helsinki at the Exhibition of Finnish Artists, and then in 1904 he visited Paris, Spain and Morocco. On his return to Finland he adopted a darker palette. In 1906, he spent time in Italy and in 1908, in southern France; after which he became interested in representing light and shade through color contrasts (his Borely Park is representative of this period). In 1909, he co- founded the Septem Group of colorists with Alfred William Finch, Magnus Enckell, Yrjö Ollila, Mikko Oinonen, Juho Rissanen, and Ellen Thesleff. Their inspiration came from the 1904 Impressionist and Neo-impressionist Franco- Belgian Exhibition in Helsinki that included works by Paul Signac and Henri- Edmond Cross. Thomé exhibited at all Septem Group exhibitions (1912–1920), and the Exhibition of Finnish Art in Stockholm (1916), St Petersburg (1917), Copenhagen (1919) and Gothenburg (1923). In 1922, he became a member of the Fine Arts Academy of Finland; and in 1941, was awarded an honorary professorship. Between 1920 and 1950, he painted many portraits and watercolor paintings. Thomé died on 1 June 1953 in Helsinki, Finland, aged 74. Vitalism Vitalism had a light palette that replaced the dowdy palette of National Romanticism in the early years of the 20th century. It adopted a positivist view of life, being a development of the tradition of figure painting where the male nude is a symbol of power shown against the sea, the sun and forces of nature.

Biography  Charles was born in Paris on 26 September 1891, the son of François Joseph Eugène Napoléon de Noailles and Madeleine Marie Isabelle Dubois de Courval. He married Marie-Laure Bischoffsheim on 9 February 1923 and the couple moved into 11 Place des États-Unis in Paris. Charles' mother gave them a plot in Hyères, for which first Mies van der Rohe and then Le Corbusier was asked to design a house. Ultimately, they asked Robert Mallet-Stevens, who would design Villa Noailles. Their first daughter, Laure, was born on 8 September 1924. In December 1925, their house in HyèresNot to be confused with the family's house and gardens in Grasse, was finished, and Charles and Marie-Laure would continue to expand Villa Noailles over the years. Natalie, their second daughter, was born 28 December 1925. According to the memoirs of Alexis de Redé (1922–2004), Marie-Laure was asked: 'Charles, he likes men, or does he like women?' She always replied: \\"Charles? He likes flowers.\\" In fact he preferred men, as Marie-Laure discovered early in their married life, when she happened to come to his bedroom one afternoon and found him in bed with his good-looking gym instructor. But the incident was not discussed. They lived lives in part separate, in part together, and in many ways as a devoted couple, telephoning and writing to each other every day when they were apart. And even when in the same house, she would write him a letter and push it under his door, and promptly he would reply. Charles died on 28 April 1981 in Grasse. Patrons of the arts Charles and Marie-Laure de Noailles were patrons of the arts. Their 'hotel' at Place des Etats-Unis was restored in modern style in 1926 by Jean-Michel Franck, and was a focus for a large circle. In 1929, Charles de Noailles bought the manuscript of The 120 Days of Sodom, the first great work of the Marquis de Sade. His wife Marie-Laure was a direct descendant of de Sade.Sciolino, Elaine. (22 January 2013). It's a Sadistic Story, and France Wants It. The New York Times, pg C5. Charles financed Man Ray's film Les Mystères du Château de Dé (1929), which centers around Villa Noailles in Hyères. He also financed Jean Cocteau's film Le Sang d'un Poète (1930) and Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalì's L'Âge d'Or (1930). Charles and his wife appeared in Les Mystères du Château de Dé as well as Le Sang d'un Poète. In 1929 or 1930, Charles made possible the career of Dali by purchasing in advance a large work for 29,000 francs,DominiqueBona, Gala, Flammarion 1995, p.228 thus enabling Dali and Gala to return from Paris to Port Lligat and devote themselves to his art. The de Noailles had an extensive correspondence with Francis Poulenc and commissioned him on two occasions. He received 25000 Francs for Aubade, which he wrote for one of their balls at Place des États-Unis where it premiered on 18 June 1929. Le Bal Masqué, inspired by Max Jacob's Le Laboratoire Central, was written for a private celebration on 20 April 1932 at the municipal theatre in Hyères. Gardener Charles de Noailles was an inveterate gardener. With Roy Lancaster, he published Plantes de jardins méditerranéens, and Camellia sasanqua Vicomte de Noailles was named after him.

(England Furniture Incorporated) is an American manufacturer of upholstered furniture. They are based in New Tazewell, Tennessee, and were founded in 1964 by Charles England and sons Eugene and Dwight “whose goal was to provide an employment alternative for the people in their region of Appalachia.” England Furniture is well known in the industry for pioneering a method of rapid delivery of custom furniture through its proprietary transportation system. In addition to manufacturing, England Furniture sells its furniture through furniture stores (some with galleries called Custom Comfort Centers) across America and Canada. In the same year, England Furniture was acquired by La-Z-Boy. History England Furniture Incorporated was founded in 1964 by Dwight England, in partnership with his Father and Brother, under the name “England UPH MFG Co., Inc.” By 1984, England Furniture was working around the clock.

Clamshells are often made of shaped plastic material, in a way that is similar to a blister pack. The name of the clamshell is taken from the shell of a clam, which it resembles both in form and function. Construction Clamshell containers can be made of a variety of plastics such as polystyrene, polyester, PVC, foam sheets, etc. The material can be made by thermoforming or can be injection molded into the desired shapes. A single piece of material is used for the top and bottom with a \\"living hinge\\" that is integral to the material, rather than added separately. Folding cartons made of paperboard or molded pulp can also be of a clamshell shape. It can also be made of cellulose fiber such as sugarcane-bagasse, wheatstraw, wood pulp, etc. Closing Clamshells can use a variety of means of closing or sealing. Some have self- locking tabs, snaps, or have a friction fit. Others use adhesive, pressure- sensitive tape, labels, staples, or are heat-sealed. When plastic clamshell containers are securely heat sealed, they are tamper resistant and deter package pilferage. These security packages are intentionally difficult to open, sometimes requiring customers to use scissors or a knife to open. Trauma shears have been demonstrated as particularly effective at opening packaging of this type. This can be frustrating to the point of wrap rage.

According to Music Week, the album sold a respectable 25,000 copies in the UK since the release.Music Week - Music Week - Music business magazine - Wonderland beckons Egan Background Sophie Monk of Stereoboard.com also reviewed the EP, \\"Well this is a strange review for me to be writing. I don't usually dedicate my time to listen to new, stereotypical girl bands who I just happened to hear on the radio late one night. But I decided I'd do something a bit different, and I'm actually very much glad that I did. 'Not a love song' is your typical, harmonious, cutesy love song about a complicated relationship, etc, etc. But what's different about this one from most other current girl band releases, such as The Saturdays \\"Higher\\" or Parade 's \\"Louder\\", is that this one actually sounds genuinely well made and... not auto tuned! In this track you will find no annoying, screechy, electronic noises which accompany the so-obviously edited vocals, no embarrassingly awful lyrics, and what's more, the girls actually harmonize, which I would have thought was the whole point of a 'girl band.' But enough with the comparing... these five Irish girls deserve all of the listens and mentions that they can get. I would gladly sit here and listen to their lovely 'Nothing Moves Me' all night. On first listen, yes, it might sound like a dreary, boring, break up song which you'd probably rather not hear on a cold, dark, British 'Spring' night, but you cannot deny that these girls have got amazing voices, and that they know how to make a good, raw, acoustic number. The five Irish stars were introduced back in 2008 by Irish X Factor judge Louis Walsh and Westlife singer Kian Egan, when they held auditions for a new band which they would both co-manage. And from then on, the girls have been touring and promoting the songs from their EP, which was only released on the 4th March. These songs being; their first ever single 'Not a Love Song', 'Not a Love Song (acoustic)', a beautiful acoustic cover of Lady Antebellum's 'Need You Now' and the hauntingly honest 'Nothing Moves Me', which is also a beautiful acoustic track. Although this EP is quite calm, slow, maybe even mellow... I'm expecting some more upbeat, lively tunes from these girls once their self titled debut album 'Wonderland' is released on the 6th June of this year. I'm not a usual fan of these kind of stereotypical, skinny, gorgeous, some-what talented girl bands (because of the reasons I have just mentioned)... but I'm already a huge fan of 'Wonderland', so you know that they must be worth a listen!\\"Wonderland - Wonderland (EP Review) - Stereoboard UK Title and artwork The original title of the EP had been decided to be Not a Love Song, but on February 2011 it was changed to Introduction to Wonderland.

On November 1, the Notre Dame squad stunned Army 35–13 on The Plain at West Point. Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and future legendary head coach Knute Rockne at end, Notre Dame attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has often been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass. Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full-stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.

He was the second son of Zeger II, Lord of Ghent and Petronella of Coutrai. His older brother, Arnold, died before 1190, leaving him the heir to the estate of his parents. He took his title of lord of Ghent, Bornhem, and Saint-Jean Steen around 1199. He married Beatrix of Heusden, and through her became Lord of Heusden, a title which was held by his son and progeny.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 126 Beatrix was the daughter of Hughes of Heusden, son of Anselm III, Lord of Heusden (not to be confused with his cousin, Hughes of Heusden, son of Anselm's brother Eustace, Lord of Choques). Administration of Flanders Philip I of Namur, margrave of Namur and Regent of Flanders with his brother, Baldwin I of Constantinople, fought in the fourth crusade and won the crown of Constantinople. While they were abroad, along with John of Nesle, Zeger was entrusted to the administration of Flanders, being noted in the record in this role in dealings in 1206 and 1210.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 127 Marriage of Ferdinand, prince of Portugal and Jeanne of Constantinople In 1211, Zeger attended the marriage of Ferdinand of Portugal with Joan of Constantinople, daughter of Baldwin I of Constantinople. On returning to Flanders with his army, the couple was accompanied by Philip I of Namur, Zeger, and John of Nesle, châtelain of Bruges. Joan's first cousin, Louis (the future Louis VIII of France) - eldest son of Philip Augustus and Joan's aunt, Isabella of Flanders - held the couple prisoner while he seized the towns of Aire and Saint-Omer. Upon release, Ferdinand began an attempt to regain these towns.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 128 Leaving his wife, who was ill, in Douai, the group went on to the towns of Lille, Coutrai, Ypres, and Bruges. The people of Ghent saw this group's arrival as an attempt to increase the power of France over them, and led by Rasse of Gavre and Arnold of Audenarde, political enemies of Zeger, chased the group away from Ghent. They were saved by cutting a bridge that separated them from their enemies,Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 129 whose army was said to be quite massive.Randall Fegley. The golden spurs of Kortrijk: how the knights of France fell to the foot soldiers of Flanders in 1302 (McFarland, 2002), p. 79 Zeger was part of the negotiations, which resulted in the treaty of the bridge of Wendin, signed February 24, 1211 and granting Louis and his heirs the towns of Aire and Saint-Omer. In exchange, Louis promised to never claim Flanders.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 129 By the next year, 1212, Zeeger III retired to the castle of his wife's family in Heusden, and his wife became a benefactor of Anchin Abbey. In August 9, 1212, whether due to beneficence or the demands of the people, Zeger granted citizens of the city of Ghent (really the bourgeois) the privileged to annually renew their aldermen.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 130 War of Bouvines At the same time, Ferdinand increased his ties with John Lackland, king of England, and sought greater acceptance in Flanders. Ferdinand's affections turned to Zeger's enemies, including Rasse of Gavre and Arnold of Audenarde, and along with John of Nesle, Zeger allied himself with Louis VIII of France, which some in Flanders saw as treachery. It is possible that Zeger secretly supported Philip Augustus, King of France's intention to dismember Flanders, and he aided Philip in the War of Bouvines. During this time, Zeger had taken residence at a new castle, Belle-Maison, in the town of Hesdin.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 131 During the War of Bouvines, Philip Augustus seized Bruges and lay siege to Ghent. The French fleet invaded the port of Damme, but was destroyed upon the advance of the English fleet with Ferdinand. Philip retreated from Ghent and Ferdinand then went to Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres and fortified his army.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 132 In the winter of 1214, Philip retreated to France to rebuild his army and Ferdinand to England to secure support against the French. At this time, Zeger assisted Louis VIII, Philip's son, in his seizure of the towns of Bailleul, Steenvorde, and several other places. In revenge, Ferdinand sacked and plundered Saint-Omer, Guinness, Artois, Sanchu, and Lens, in acts described as particularly vicious, as well as destroying Zeger's new castle at Hesdin. These events led to the decisive Battle of Bouvines, which the French won, and Ferdinand was taken prisoner and brought, for a time, to the tower of the Louvre.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 133 Retirement These events strengthened Zeger, who again retired at Heusden. In 1225 a man appeared who claimed to be Baldwin of Constantinople, who had died in 1205 or 1206. He soon became the focus of a popular revolt, and Ziger played a role in unmasking him. Ziger's efforts to protect Jeanne led Mouske, a historian of the time, to call Ziger the good lord of Ghent.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 137 In the later years of his life, Ziger is believed to have been a charitable lord and good administrator, assisting in the building of bridges over the waters allowing the better connection of Ghent neighborhoods Briel and Over the Reke (the location of Saint Bavo Abby).Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 137 By his death in 1227, he had reconciled with Ferdinand, serving as a witness in court affairs around the Easter holiday of that year.Auguste Havenith, Recherches historiques sur le château et la seigneurie de Heusden, autrement dite vicomté de Gand (De Backer, 1900), p. 139 Family By his wife, Beatrix of Heusden, Ziger had numerous children: *Hugh I of Ghent, lord of Heusden, Bornhem, and Saint-Jean Steene and Chatelain of Ghent, married Odette of Champagne. *Ziger of Ghent, married in 1235 to Ode of Grimberghen *Gerard of Ghent, called the devil, married Elisabeth of Slote *Walter of Ghent, archdeacon at the church of Arras *William of Ghent called the Frisian *Ferdinand of Ghent *Bernard of Ghent, called of Meren, married Margueritte of Wervy References Category:1227 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Zeger III of Ghent"},{"id":"32011864","text":"Mission The primary mission of the Tower Center is to promote the study of politics and international affairs and to stimulate an interest in ethical public service among undergraduates.

The certification has been established to show the attainment of strategic and higher operational level competencies in security. The Register of Chartered Security Professionals is managed by the Security Institute and overseen by the Chartered Security Professionals Registration Authority (CSPRA). Criteria The core criteria for becoming a Chartered Security Professional is to have a high level of competency within five fields: * Knowledge (30% of total): Use a combination of specialist and generalist security knowledge and understanding to optimise the employment of existing and emerging methods and technologies. * Practice Skills (35% of total): Apply appropriate techniques, methodologies and processes to resolve security and risk related issues. * Leadership (10% of total): Provide technical and commercial leadership. * Communications (15% of total): Demonstrate effective interpersonal skills. * Professional Commitment (10% of total): Demonstrate a personal commitment to professional standards, recognising obligations to society, the profession and the environment. These five fields of competency are specified in 16 sub- competencies. =Standard route= The standard route to the certification involves three steps to demonstrate that the candidate has competency at the specified level: * A university degree in a security-related discipline (or an equivalent qualification recognised by the Chartered Security Professionals Registration Authority) or degree in any subject plus a security-related vocational qualification. * Five years' operational security experience with at least two years at the Chartered competence level. * Interview and presentation. =Individual route= The individual route to certification places the emphasis more on experience than formal qualifications. In this route the candidate needs to: * Complete and present a portfolio that outlines how the candidate has met the defined competence requirements. * Have ten years operational security experience with at least five years at the Chartered competence level. * Interview and presentation. =Standards= After admission to the Register of Chartered Security Professionals the registrants need to conduct documented continuing professional development (CPD), follow a specified code of conduct and take out professional indemnity insurance. Management Chartered Security Professionals are admitted into the Register of Chartered Security Professionals. The Worshipful Company of Security Professionals has engaged the Security Institute to manage the register. =Chartered Security Professionals Registration Authority= The Chartered Security Professionals Registration Authority (CPSRA) is the management board of the Register of Chartered Security Professionals, and responsible for maintaining standards and practices in the Chartered Security Professionals scheme. CPSRA's current Chairman is Baroness Henig CBE CSyI. =Licensees= It is foreseen that several organisations will be licensed to admit CSyPs into the Register of Chartered Security Professionals, and that this will work in a similar way to the Engineering Council licensing a number of engineering institutions to admit Chartered Engineers, Incorporated Engineers and Engineering Technicians. Initially, the Security Institute was the sole licensee who could admit Chartered Security Professionals to the Register. The second licensee is ASIS UK Chapter 208 www.asisonline.org www.asis.org.uk. ASIS own the Certified Protection Professional (CPP), Physical Security Professional (PSP) and Professional Certified Investigator (PCI) Certifications and ASIS UK will be mentoring and introducing individuals to the Register. Recognition The Register of Chartered Security Professionals won the 2012 \\"Contribution to Standards in the Security Sector\\" at the annual Security Excellence Awards in 2012. History At the first annual general meeting of the Security Institute on 1 February 2001 the then Registrar and Secretary, Stewart Kidd set out the Institute's short, medium and long term objectives. The latter included the aspiration 'to become the sole professional organisation representing the security' manager and 'to achieve Chartered status'. Peter French, the director of one of the UK's largest security recruiters and at the time Senior Regional Vice President for ASIS International in Europe stated the need for a \\"Chartered Security Professionals\\" scheme in a 2007 interview. This need was repeated later the same year by Bill Wyllie, at the time the Chairman of the Security Institute. Stuart Lowden, Managing Director of the manned guarding company Wilson James, simultaneously stated that much work had to be done before a chartered scheme for security professionals could become reality. The Worshipful Company of Security Professionals was awarded the exclusive right to establish a Register of Chartered Security Professionals when they were given a Royal charter by the Privy Council in March 2010. Realising that they did not have the administrative capacity to run such a register they established a joint working group with the Security Institute in June 2010 with the intention of setting up a Register of Chartered Security Professionals. The Worshipful Company also specified that the Security Institute should manage the Register because they had the administrative procedures and experience to make it work in practice. The group that planned the establishment of the scheme was led by the Worshipful Company's Master, Don Randall MBE, who was also the head of security at the Bank of England. The working group also consisted of Mike Bluestone, Peter French MBE, Di Thomas, David Gill and Roy Penrose OBE QPM. =Establishing the certification= The criteria for joining the Register of Chartered Security Professionals were based on research done by a working party that consisted of Dr Alison Wakefield (University of Portsmouth), Angus Darroch-Warren (Linx International), Garry Evanson (De La Rue), Anders Groenli (Ove Arup & Partners) and Chris Roberts (Association of Security Consultants). The working party based their recommendations to a large part on the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC), but also sought advice from the Foundation for Science and Technology and the Engineering Council. The final version of criteria for becoming a Chartered Security Professional are therefore to a large degree based on the criteria for Chartered Engineers. The proposal of Dr Wakefield's working party also included suggestions that the Register of Chartered Security Professionals in time could be expanded with separate categories for those working on operational and tactical levels. The first ten Chartered Security Professionals were admitted in a ceremony at Drapers' Hall in the City of London on 7 June 2011.

The term first came into being at the start of World War II and was unique only to the local level of the Nazi Party, known as the Ortsgruppen. Duties Translated as Shop Steward, or literally \\"Workers' Representative\\", the duties of the Betreibsobmann were generally the same as a labor union foreman and focused primary on the local level of war production as well as representing the interests of factory workers. Later, as the war progressed, the Betriebsobmann were in charge of production quotas and often would report workers who were not meeting standards. War defeatism and anti-Nazi sympathies were also immediately reported. Seniority Betriebsobmann was divided into four levels of seniority, denoted by a letter placed after the title ranging from (A), (B), (C), and (D). In addition to the primary rank of Betreibsobmann, a junior rank of Betriebsblockobmann existed as an assistant to the local Blockleiter. There was also a \\"Cell Operations Foreman\\" position, known as Betriebszellenobmann as well as a senior foreman position known as Hauptbetriebsobmann. In all, the following were the various levels of seniority: * Betriebsblockobmann * Betriebsobmann (A) * Betriebszellenobmann * Hauptbetriebszellenobmann * Betriebsobmann (B) * Betriebsobmann (C) * Betriebsobmann (D) * Hauptbetriebsobmann The position of Betriebsobmann was not an actual political rank, but rather a title. Those Nazi Party members holding the position of Betreibsobmann also would hold one of several Nazi Party paramilitary ranks. The position of Betriebsobmann would be denoted by a political armband.

Udzinarta mze) is a 1992 Georgian drama film directed by Temur Babluani. It was entered into the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution. The film had been directed since 1985 until 1992. The film was translated into several languages through dubbing as well as subtitling. Catchphrases and a soundtrack (more precisely melody which is a leitmotif of this film) of the film are very widespread among Georgian people. Occasionally vulgar words occur in the film. The director has dedicated the work to his father, who is also a doctor.  Plot  The film is about a doctor named Gela Bendeliani (Elgudzha Burduli) and his wealthless family in Tbilisi in Soviet Georgia. In the film Gela Bendeliani has an unlimited capacity for generosity and forgiveness. He has been working in a government institution, privately experimenting on white mice for 23 years to find a cure for cancer. The authorities disapprove of his work and he has already been thrown out of his job many times. Dato, his son, has been in constant trouble with the law. He apparently loves his father but it is clear that neither father nor son understand each other. Dato is involved in vaguely criminal dealings although he and his criminal friends spend their hours together in an automobile workshop. The rest of the film is about Dato's doings with and without his father, Dato's success at crime and Gela Bendeliani's tragic failure in science.

In those regions, Habsburg authorities have established various forms of provisional military administration, including the newly organized Serbian Militia. By the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, some of those regions remained under the permanent Habsburg rule, while others were returned to the Ottoman Empire. History Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden (1655-1707) In 1683, the Great Vienna War broke out between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy. After the victory in the Siege of Buda (1686), Habsburg forces continued their advance towards south, forcing Ottomans to retreat from the Kingdom of Hungary and neighboring regions. In the same time, local Serbs, who were Christians, formed the Serbian Militia and joined with Habsburg forces against Ottomans, driving them out (fully or partially) from regions of Bačka, Banat and Syrmia (corresponding to modern Vojvodina, in Serbia). In 1688, the Habsburg forces organized a further offensive towards south, crossing rivers Sava and Danube. In the same time, the Serbian Militia operated throughout regions of Šumadija and Raška in central Serbia. After the victory in the Siege of Belgrade (1688), Habsburg forces continued their advance towards south, taking Niš and reaching Prizren and Skopje (1689). In the same time, Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojević also sided with Habsburgs. By the beginning of 1690, Habsburg-controlled area included much of the territory of present-day Serbia. Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Crnojević (d. 1706) In 1690, a full-scale Ottoman counter-offensive was launched, forcing Habsburg commanders and the Serbian Militia to retreat to the north. Ottoman atrocities provoked the Great Migration of the Serbs, led by Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III, who left the Patriarchal Monastery of Peć, and presided an Assembly of Serbian leaders, who met in Belgrade in 1690 and elected Emperor Leopold I as King of Serbia. Ottomans undertook the Siege of Belgrade (1690) and recaptured the city, but were stopped at the Battle of Slankamen (1691) in Syrmia. In 1693, Habsburg forces decided to recapture Belgrade. Imperial army, led by duke Charles Eugène de Croÿ, attacked the city and laid the siege, but Ottoman garrison organized a successful resistance and managed to repel the attack. During next few years, Ottomans made several attempts to recapture regions of Syrmia and Bačka, but were finally defeated at the Battle of Senta (1697) (modern Senta, in northern Serbia). The Habsburg withdrawal from the southern territories of present-day Serbia ran in parallel with the Great Serbian Migrations into the northern regions, remaining within the Habsburg Monarchy. The war ended with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 (signed in Sremski Karlovci in present-day northern Serbia), under which the territory of present-day Serbia was divided between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy. According to the Treaty, most of the territory of present-day Serbia remained within the Ottoman Empire, while the region of Bačka and part of the region of Syrmia were assigned to the Habsburg Monarchy. Habsburg commanders The main Habsburg commanders in charge of operations on the territory of present-day Serbia were: * Ludwig Wilhelm von Baden (1655-1707) * Giovanni Norberto Piccolomini (1640–1689) * Charles Eugène de Croÿ (1651-1702) See also * Holy League (1684) * Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39) * Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788–92) * Serbian Vojvodina  References  Sources    Category:Great Turkish War Category:17th century in Serbia Category:Serbia under Habsburg rule Category:History of Bačka Category:History of Syrmia Category:Habsburg Serbs Category:Occupation of Serbia ","title":"Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686–91)"},{"id":"32011983","text":"Sonderbeauftragter (Special Representative) was a Nazi Party political position which existed between the years of 1939 and 1945.

It is dedicated to presenting lost or forgotten musicals by famous American writers, and has been responsible for the first revivals of the lesser-known works of writers such as Stephen Sondheim, Cole Porter, Alan Jay Lerner, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, Harold Arlen and Jerome Kern.https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/jun/28/theatre.musicals Approach and philosophy Ian Marshall Fisher researches, reconstructs and directs each show based upon exactly what the writers had written, with no changes, amendments and no edits to their original work. In an interview with The Stage in 2005, Fisher commented \\"My original idea was to celebrate the writers in accurately presenting what they had written – and I don't just mean the songwriters but the bookwriters too. That's where my series stands alone. Although other series have sprung up in the last ten years, they don't honour and have a love for the books that I do.\\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2005/05/revival-of-the-fittest-lost- musicals-ian-marshall-fisher/ In another interview, Fisher criticised what he reviewed as the recent trivialisation of musicals, saying \\"Those people who were involved in the Broadway musical wanted to speak to the public. The campery and kitschness is something that's been ladled on to it subsequently.\\" History Lost Musicals began in 1989, and its productions have been presented at London's Barbican Centre, the Royal Opera House, Her Majesty's Theatre and the Victoria & Albert Museum. The project's current home is the Sadler's Wells Theatre. Some of the seventy shows presented have included musicals by George S.

For instance, in November and December 1991 the company gave a performance of Weill's Love Life at the Victoria & Albert Museum with a cast including David Firth and Louise Gold.http://www.ovrtur.com/production/2897706http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/Love_Life.htm This was followed by a major production of the same show by Opera North in 1996. In May 1992, Lost Musicals moved to the Barbican Center's Cinema 1, where By Jupiter was performed by a cast including Myra Sands, Issy Van Randwyck and Louise Gold.http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/By_Jupiter.htm Sands and Gold went on to appear in \\"One Touch of Venus\\" in August of the same year.http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/One_Touch_of_Venus_1992.htm The project's final season at the Barbican took place in 1998, when five productions were offered. Irving Berlin and Moss Hart's revue As Thousands Cheer opened the season with a cast featuring Danielle Carson and Paula Wilcox. This was followed by Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane's first Broadway musical, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, with Jessica Martin and David Firth. Later in the year, George S. Kaufman's Hollywood Pinafore (based on Gilbert and Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore) was presented with actors including Ian Lavender, Frank Lazarus and Matt Zimmerman. This was followed by a rare stage performance of Stephen Sondheim's The Frogs, starring James Vaughan. Finally, to mark the Gershwin centenary the company presented Strike Up the Band in the Barbican Concert Hall, with the BBC Concert Orchestra. The cast included Barry Cryer and Sam Kelly.http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Reviews/Lost_Musicals_1998_Review.htm =The West End and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden= After this period at the Barbican, in 1999 the project moved to the West End. The first three productions that year took place at the Fortune Theatre.http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E1705434363/Lost+Musicals+Kicks+Off+Sunday,+9+May.html First, in May the company performed Kaufman, Hart, Rodgers and Hart's I'd Rather Be Right, with a cast that included Kenneth Haigh. Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones's 110 in the Shade was presented in July, with four performances of Burton Lane, Fred Saidy and E. Y. Harburg's Finian's Rainbow in September. On 21 and 28 November, the project moved to Her Majesty's Theatre for Cole Porter and Moss Hart's Jubilee, which featured the BBC Concert Orchestra and was later broadcast on BBC Radio 3. This was followed in 2000 by a move to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The Kurt Weill centenary was marked in December of that year by a semi-staging of One Touch of Venus, which included a reconstruction of Agnes de Mille's original choreography, which was performed by the Central School of Ballet. The cast included Jessica Martin and Louise Gold, with the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra.https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/dec/13/artsfeatures4http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E0194408679/Lost+Musicals+Celebrates+Weill+with+Venus.html In 2001, Fisher presented a fund-raising gala at the Royal Opera House called A Lost Musicals Occasion, which featured appearances by Gold, Kitty Carlisle Hart, Liza Pulman and Jessica Martin.http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&story;=E882992883195 This was followed later that year by two performances of Porter's Du Barry Was a Lady at Her Majesty's Theatre, with accompaniment by the BBC Concert Orchestra. The cast included Gold, Lauren Ward, James Vaughan and Desmond Barrit. The production was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 27 December 2001.http://www.qsulis.demon.co.uk/Website_Louise_Gold/Dubarry_Was_A_Lady_2001.htm The 2001 season also included three fund-raising performances of Cole Porter's Let's Face It in New York at the New York Historical Society in September,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/theater/theater-review-roundelay- of-infidelity-in-a-cole-porter- revival.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fT%2fTheater while the short 2002 season consisted of two performances of Porter's Fifty Million Frenchmen at the Royal Opera House, with a cast including Laura Michelle Kelly, Dilys Laye and Alan Cox.http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821025686187/Lost+Musicals+Premieres+Cole+Porter's+Frenchmen.html =Later years= Some of the revivals have been UK premieres or first revivals of the shows. For instance, in 2005 the company gave the stage premiere of Evening Primrose, a little-known 1967 television musical by Stephen Sondheim, with a cast including Betsy Blair and Gary Raymond.http://www.ovrtur.com/show/125511 The same year saw the company's second production of Fanny, starring Liza Pulman and James Smilie, and Porter's Silk Stockings.http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821108559962/Lost+Musicals+Premieres+Porter+%26+Sondheim+Works.html In 2010 Lost Musicals presented the first complete revival of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's second Broadway musical, The Day Before Spring, following on from the rediscovery of the full vocal score. It was the first time all the music had been heard since 1946.http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/28590/the-day-before- springhttp://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_concert_review.php?id=8308 Overview Many of the shows have been broadcast by BBC Radio 3. Casting of the shows has often involved veteran performers with experience appearing in classic Broadway shows. For instance, the 2008 Lost Musicals production of Sail Away starred Penny Fuller, whose Broadway credits include Richard Rodgers's Rex, Applause opposite Lauren Bacall and a replacement Sally Bowles in the original Broadway Cabaret. Some of the two thousand actors who have taken part in the performances have included, in addition to those named above, James Corden, Daniel Massey, Sara Kestelman, Anne Reid, Joanna Riding, Andrew Lincoln, John Savident, Henry Goodman, David de Keyser, Anna Francolini, Christopher Benjamin, David Pittu and members of London's Royal National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company. In 1999 Lost Musicals was recognised by the British Charity Commissioners as an educational charitable trust, titled The Lost Musicals Charitable Trust.

Design and development The Loire 30 was designed to meet a French Air Force requirement for a three-seat night reconnaissance aircraft. It was a cantilever high-wing monoplane and powered by three Salmson 9Ab radial engines strut-mounted above the wing. The pilot had an enclosed cockpit with an open cockpit at the nose and amidships, both fitted with pivot-mounted 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine-guns. Only one Loire 30 was produced in 1932, but it failed to gain an order and was relegated to experimental use. =Loire 301= After rejection in its original role, the sole Loire 30 / Loire 300 was modified with a very large windowless drum-shaped turret fitted in the nose and re- designated Loire 301. The purpose of the turret is uncertain; the favored theory of some references is an armored turret housing a large caliber gun; another theory is an airborne blind flying training simulator. To compensate the additional weight of the turret the central engine was moved backwards and inverted to drive a pusher propeller. This led to the unusual propulsion with two tractor and one pusher engines above the wings. Due to the turret resembling a type of copper laundry kettle commonly used at the time, the airplane was nicknamed la lessiveuse.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Tunstall, the archdeaconry of Lancaster, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The earliest record of a church or chapel on the site is before 1230. The tower dates probably from the 16th century. The rest of the church was rebuilt in 1865–67 to a design by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley. Its estimated cost was £4,000 (equivalent to £ in ). Paley worshipped in the church, as he had a country house nearby, and when his son Harry died (who succeeded his father in the architectural practice), he was buried in the churchyard. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone rubble, with a slate roof. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a north transept containing the organ chamber, a chancel at a lower level, and a west tower. The tower is Perpendicular in style, and has three stages, diagonal buttresses, and an embattled parapet. On the west side is a doorway, over which is a three-light window with Perpendicular tracery. The bell openings also have three lights. On the south side of the church is the porch, with four bays to the east. The bays are separated by buttresses and each contains a three-light window with Perpendicular tracery. To the left of the easternmost window is a priest's door. Along the clerestory are four windows. The east window has three lights with Perpendicular tracery. In the west wall of the north aisle is a blocked Norman doorway containing a tympanum carved with human figures. It is filled in with coffin lids and medieval cross slabs. =Interior= The four-bay arcades are carried on octagonal piers. The reredos is a copy of an Annunciation by Filippo Lippi, carved by a local artist. Its gilded frame was made by Shrigley and Hunt. Some of the stained glass is also by Shrigley and Hunt, with other windows by Abbott and Company. Some of the memorials have been moved from the earlier church. The earliest of these date from 1775 and 1795, the others dating from the early and mid-19th century. The organ was built by Conacher.

Biography She was born on October 4, 1951 in Celje. She visited both primary and grammar schools in Celje. After the grammar school she studied comparative literature and literary theory at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana. As a graduate she employed herself in the field of education and taught for five years. She occupied herself with music and theatre as well. She was the leader of the infant improvisational theatre at Experimental Theatre Celje for 13 years, where she was director, stage manager and the author of texts. She is a member of the editorial board of the magazine Poetikon. Nowadays she is considered a classic of Slovene juvenile literature. She lives and works in Celje. Work She writes poems, prose and theatre plays, mostly for young readers. She started publishing poetry for adults in the grammar school's gazette named Brstiči, later on in Dialogi, Mentor and Obrazi as well. She has written three poetical collections of sonnets, namely Pesek v pesmi, Poševno sonce and Opoldnevi. Among the poetical collections, Čaroznanke (1990) is the largest one; their motivation has the origin in everyday life as well as reality and experiences of imagination. In the collection Nebeške kočije (1994) the author is focusing on the themes of universe, in which everything is connected, the themes of human being and nature; with her collection Klepetosnedke (1996) she returns to a child and his/her playful relation to the surroundings. Among the prose work we can find animal stories (Slike in zgodbe iz tisoč in enega pasjega dne, 1985) and various short fairy tales and nonsense texts (Popravljalnica sanj, 1992, Muc Mehkošapek, 1998). A characteristic of her juvenile poetry is a rich poetical language. The poet invents new words, her poems are rhythmic. Moreover, imaginary words are typical of her juvenile prose. She also writes plays and puppet show works for children and chansons for adults.

Life  Conrad was born in Ulm in 1476. He entered the Dominican Order in 1492, and professed the following year. During his formative years he reports that he studied Capreolus. He entered the University of Heidelberg in 1500, and in 1507 became a master of theology, and commenced lectures on Thomas Aquinas. It was here that he wrote his line-by-line commentary on the Prima Secundae of Thomas's Summa Theologica. On July 1, 1511, he took the position of master of theology at Cologne. In 1512, at the request of the factulies of both Heidelberg and Cologne, and with the permission of Thomas Cajetan—then Master General of the Order--, this commentary was published at Cologne under the title of Expositio Comentaria . . . in Primam Secundae etc.. He was also part of the Catholic response to the Lutherans, publishing two long works against Lutheranism, and participating as part of the Imperial party at Augsburg, where he was selected to help refute the Augsburg Confession. Of note, he also served as inquisitor in Mainz, Trier, and Cologne from 1528 until his death; he died in Cologne.  Influence  Cajetan himself acknowledge that he valued Koellin's work, while he was heavily cited by later Thomists, including Bellarmine, Banez, Suarez, Alvarez, Sylvius, John of St. Thomas, and the Salmanticenses. The reformers also called him a \\"distinguished Thomist.\\" Hennessey says that he was, \\"probably the most important Catholic theologian in Germany at the time of the Reformation,\\" while Janz more moderately says that he was, \\"the most important Thomas-commentator in Germany before Cajetan,\\" and adds that under him, \\"the influence of Capreolus' Defensiones reached its high point in the Thomist school.\\"  References  * Denis Janz.

The group formed after lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter Sal Baglio and drummer Mark Cuccinello were joined by Stephen Gilligan on bass, and Dave Friedman on keyboards. On November 7, 1977, the band played their first show in Beverly, Massachusetts. History The Stompers played in Boston-area bars such as The Rathskeller and Jonathan Swift's. After toiling in a sweaty apartment, the group released its first vinyl single in 1978,Coast to Coast/I'm in Trouble on Double Eagle Records, owned by their manager, Peter Lembo. The song was later used in the John Sayles movie Return of the Secaucus 7. On January 3, 1979, the band became one of the first unsigned acts to perform at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston. The group performed to rave reviews and was even asked to appear at a return engagement. Boston-based radio station WCOZ featured The Stompers on a compilation called Best of Boston Beat Volume 1 with the group's song \\"This is Rock n Roll.\\" By the end of 1979, the band was the first unsigned act to appear on the cover of industry trade magazine Performance. In 1980, The Stompers toured with both The Beach Boys and The J. Geils Band. The following year, the song Shutdown was featured on a second WCOZ compilation, Best of Boston Beat Volume 2, and via a fan ballot, earned them the right to compete in the \\"Rock to Riches\\" competition. After winning that competition, the band signed an album deal with Boardwalk Records. Unfortunately, Boardwalk founder Neil Bogart died and the label filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which resulted in the group's self-titled album being delayed until 1983. The single, the Baglio- penned \\"Never Tell an Angel (When Your Heart's on Fire),\\" spent four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 88 in July 1983.https://www.billboard.com/music/the-stompers In July 1983, Cuccinello left the group, was replaced by drummer Lenny Shea and pianist Jeremy Brown also joined the band. Polygram Records later acquired The Stompers through bankruptcy court and re-released the album under the title One Heart for Sale, including a single by the same title. Despite issues with Polygram, the Stompers released the single East Side Girl in 1985 without major label promotion. The song's video was in heavy rotation for two months.

The designer was the Polish architect Józef Plośko who had also built several other historic buildings in Baku in the early 20th century. Mukhtarov often took his wife Lisa Tuganova, who was of Ossetian origin and the daughter of the Russian General Tuganov, on expensive trips to Europe. During one of their trips to France, they came across a beautiful French Gothic building.Azerbaijan International. Legacy of the Oil Barons Part III: Baku's Wedding Palace by Fuad Akhundov Lisa, astonished by its architecture said: \\"How happy the tenants of this building must be.\\" Mukhtarov did not reply but on his return to Baku, he ordered his people off to France to purchase blue prints of the building and bring them back to Baku. An exact copy of the building was raised in central Baku within nine months. On its completion in 1912, Mukhtarov surprised his wife by driving her there in a carriage and telling her that it was her new residence. The couple still lived in the palace until 28 April 1920, when the Bolsheviks occupied Azerbaijan. Upon entering the building, three Russian officers were shot by Mukhtarov himself, after which he committed suicide. In 1922, Soviet authorities allowed the building to be used by the newly founded women's organization, the Ali Bayramov Club, which offered a variety of vocational skills and training to women, in additional to cultural and leisure activities.Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94. Afterward, it functioned as Shirvanshahs Museum. During the existence of Azerbaijan SSR, the palace functioned as the Palace of Marriage Registrations. On 2 August 2001, by a resolution issued by the Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan, the building was listed as real estate of historic and state importance and was to be protected as a monument of Azerbaijani culture. The street lying on the right side of the building carries the name of Murtuza Mukhtarov.

It is located about upstream from the confluence of the Páez River with the Magdalena River. Its works were officially opened on February 25, 2011 in the presence of President Juan Manuel Santos. It is one of the largest infrastructure projects in the country. The project was completed 4 years later, in the end of 2015. The powerhouse near the base of the dam has an installed capacity of 400 MW, which is expected to achieve an average energy generation of /year, with a dam that will have a live storage of and an inundated area . The objective is to enhance the energy security and stability of the Colombian electricity supply, meeting about 8% of energy demand in Colombia with energy prospects of to 2034. Environmental license to implement the project was granted by Colombia's Environment Ministry, which was announced by Alvaro Uribe, the then President of Colombia, in May 2009. It is the first private sector hydro project to be built in Colombia under a new government policy. Apart from implementing the project, environmental issues that are to be addressed by the Emgesa, the project developer, are compensatory afforestation, compensation to project-affected people (no indigenous people are affected) and the protection of water supplies. Emgesa will receive, under a 20-year power contract authorized by Colombia's Comision de Regulacion de Energia y Gas (CREG), a price of US$14 per megawatt-hour for the power sold to the department. It is also intended to sell the electricity to neighbouring countries, thus boosting the national economy. The project is estimated to cost around $837 million, invested by Spanish utility Endesa, through its Colombian subsidiary Emgesa. Geography Magdalena River with Honda city on its bank The dam is located in Colombia, in the Magdalena River basin formed by the central and eastern mountain ranges, to the south of department of Huila. The administrative jurisdiction of the project covers the municipalities of Garzón, Gigante, El Agrado, Paicol, Tesalia and Altamira. However, the dam and the project's powerhouse are located within the municipality of Gigante. The existing Betania Dam is about downstream. Bogotá, the capital of Colombia is to the north. It is to the south of Neiva, from Gigante and from Garzón. The project area lies in the narrow gorge section of the Magdalena River. The rock formation is of friable sandstones of tertiary age. It is upstream from the confluence of the Magdalena and Páez Rivers. The contractor will provide about 48,000 million pesos to build the perimeter road that will boost tourism and commercial development southwest of the Huila Department. Project description The proposed hydroelectric project, a run- of-river reservoir scheme, consists of a high concrete-faced rock fill dam (CFRD) on the Magdalena River. The length of the dam is . There is also an auxiliary dam (an auxiliary dike) of height and crest length. The full reservoir level in the dam is above sea level (asl) and foundation level is asl. The reservoir created by the dam has an area of and stretches over a length of , with an average width of . Other features of the project include a diversion tunnel to facilitate construction of the dam (to divert river flows away from the working area of the dam) which is long, a spillway structure to route the design flood discharge, two intake structures (spaced at ) to divert water through two penstock lines ( length) to the powerhouse located on the downstream. Emgesa has committed to buying of land for 17,000 million pesos to connect two forest reserves in the area of influence (Reserva Forestal de la Amazonía y la Reserva Forestal Central). There are also plans to build a viaduct over the reservoir that will connect the municipalities of Garzón and El Agrado. The decision to build this major dam as a concrete faced rockfill dam was decided after studying several types of dams for the prevailing site conditions. The site conditions, which dictated the choice of the dam, are the narrow gorge of the river and the geological formation of highly friable sandstones at the dam site. The project area is subject to earthquakes and seismic factors have been accounted for in the design of the dam and appurtenant works. Nine earthquakes were experienced in Colombia between 1762 and 1994 with the earthquake event of 2 February 1736 with magnitude of 6.3 on Richter scale to last one on 6 June 1994 of magnitude 6.6 with epicentre of 73 km distance of the project site, which caused severe damage and fatalities. Twenty-three active unstable slope areas, with two potentially unstable land slides (mud slides) are also noted in the project area.\\"UNFCC\\", p.16–17 Construction materials involved in building the project complex include: concrete-; surface excavation–; underground excavation–; rockfill embankment–; and steel reinforcement–15,000 tonnes. ;Power generation The powerhouse located at the toe of the dam has two vertical axis Francis turbines each of 200MW capacity. Each is designed for a discharge of . The generators are of the synchronous type with a generation capacity of 225 MVA. The generation voltage is 13.8 kV. Single-phase transformers of 75 MVA capacity with a voltage relation of 13.8–230 kV are proposed. A switch yard is located adjoining the powerhouse. Power is evacuated through 230 kV transmission line of length from the switch yard to Betania-San Bernardino transmission system. Impacts =Ecological impacts= The ecological and social impacts have been examined in great details and remedial actions have been planned for all the identified impacts. The major impacts are submergence of land (both agricultural and forest areas), displacement of people coming under submergence, submergence of a bridge over the Yaguilga River, submergence of the church of San José de Belén, the submergence of cocoa orchards of Río Loro, 78 archaeological sites between two archaeological regions, effect on fisheries, terrestrial fauna due to submergence and submergence of infrastructure works.\\"UNFCC\\", p.44–47 =Mitigation measures= The project will require evicting 467 families and flooding of prime land in this region. The developer has to ensure that the project affected people have the same or better quality of life in the new areas where they would be resettled with \\"all public services, health coverage and education, restoration of economic activity and level income equal or greater than the current conditions\\". Irrigation facilities shall be provided to the resettled families for 5200 ha with facilities for organic production as a measure for the conversion of soil and natural animal management; reforestation in a new land area acquired by the developer shall cover 11079.6 ha to compensate for the loss of 3034ha due to submergence, which shall also ensure the restoration of tropical dry forest for 5 years; shift the church of San José de Belén and rebuild at the new location; removal all vegetation in the submergence area before reservoir filling to prevent decomposition of vegetation and growth of aquatic macrophytes; create an information base on the archaeological sites coming under submergence with due research; repopulate migratory species of fish in the upstream areas of the river and also establish two limnigraph stations; create suitable dumping areas to dispose excavated material which are not used on the project; establish alternate roads, bridges, water supply works and other infrastructure facilities that would be submerged; and rehabilitate of fauna coming under submergence areas by measures such as chasing, capturing and relocation of the fauna (small, medium and large mammals, serpents and birds) and also establish two veterinary units to treat wounded animals. A ferry and six landings are planned to tap the tourism potential of the new dam; 25,000 million pesos have been set aside for this. The reservoir will also benefit the development of fish farming. =Eviction= On February 21, 2012, Revista Semana published a report that makes reference to a video produced by Bladimir Sánchez, a Communicator from the Huila Department. The video documents events that took place between February 14 and 15, 2012 during the eviction of protesters such as local fishermen and miners by the Colombian Police Force. Several were injured by the excessive use of force demonstrated by the Police during these events.

The stadium hosts the annual NCAA Division III Football Championship game even though Roanoke does not compete in the sport. =Rivalries= Roanoke and Washington and Lee University have been rivals for more than a century. The rivalry, strongest in men's lacrosse, is fueled by a long history of athletic contests; the schools have competed since the 1870s. The rivalry is also influenced by conference affiliation and geography; the schools are charter members of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and are located within an hour drive of each other on Interstate 81. Both schools traditionally have nationally ranked men's lacrosse teams and are usually ranked in the top twenty when meeting late in the season. In addition to Washington and Lee, contests with the University of Lynchburg, Hampden-Sydney College, Randolph-Macon College, and Bridgewater College draw the most attention; all of which are members of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. Roanoke and Virginia Tech were rivals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Virginia Tech was a small college. In 1877, the schools competed in Virginia Tech's first intercollegiate baseball game (Virginia Tech won 53–13), and in 1896, Virginia Tech first wore its current athletic colors – maroon and burnt orange – in a football game against Roanoke. In 1895, Roanoke and Virginia Tech were charter members of the now defunct Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Association along with Randolph-Macon College, the University of Richmond, and the College of William and Mary, and in 1926, Roanoke and Virginia Tech played the inaugural football game at Virginia Tech's Miles Stadium. =School colors= Roanoke has two sets of school colors, blue and gold for academic use and maroon and gray for athletic use. This dates to 1907 when the baseball team needed new uniforms, but could not obtain any in blue and gold. Maroon and gray uniforms were purchased as a substitute. Within a few years, maroon and gray were adopted as Roanoke's official athletic colors. The college athletic nickname became Maroons as well. In recent years, black has been added as an accent color so Roanoke athletic uniforms are often maroon, gray, black, and white on some occasions. =Nickname and mascot= Roanoke's athletic nickname is the Maroons and the mascot is Rooney, a maroon-tailed hawk. The mascot was revealed on April 17, 2009 during the annual alumni weekend festivities.Roanoke College's new mascot lands on campus – Roanoke.com Roanoke has competed as the Maroons for over 100 years, but it was only a color without a mascot to represent the college. Facilities After beginning their history in the tiny, on-campus Alumni Gymnasium, the men's and women's basketball teams played their home games in the 6,820-seat Salem Civic Center arena beginning in 1968. While the team had a great deal of success there and won the program's only national title while calling the Civic Center home, its large size and off-campus location hindered it. In the mid-1980s, the school opened the 2,000 on-campus Bast Center, where the team played until 2016, when the state-of-the-art Cregger Center opened on-campus. The new arena seats 2,500 spectators and sits on a hill with magnificent views of the Blue Ridge Mountains The baseball team formerly played at Kiwanis Field near downtown Salem, but now plays at Haley Toyota Field, home stadium of the Salem Red Sox, Carolina League affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.

Frank House is a historic mansion located in Kearney, Nebraska, United States. The house was built in 1889 by George W. Frank. Since 1971 the property has been owned by Kearney State College, now the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The university now operates the home as The G.W. Frank Museum of History and Culture. In 1973, the house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The Frank House is located in Kearney at 2010 University Drive, on the west end of the University of Nebraska Kearney campus. The house was completed in 1889 at a cost of about $40,000. It was one of the first houses west of the Missouri River to be wired for electricity during the construction of the house. The house is of Richardsonian Romanesque design, with Colorado red sandstone from Wyoming. The exterior stone walls are thick, while the interior supporting walls are thick and made of brick. The house has of living space, with three floors and a basement. The Frank House originally had ten fireplaces, seven of which remain. The largest of the fireplaces is located in the drawing room. The extensive interior woodwork is English Golden Oak, done by a local carpenter named John Peter Lindbeck, a certified master carver. Many of his woodcarving designs are repeated elsewhere throughout the interior and exterior of the home as these were the architects only stipulations on what he was to carve. The grand staircase has six newel posts, each of which has its own design. On the second floor landing is the home's Stained Glass Window, measuring wide and tall, the creator of the window is still unknown and a current research project of the Museum. On the second floor, there were four bedrooms and a bathroom for guests. To fend off cold Nebraska winters, the house was heated by steam heaters located in several rooms throughout the house. In the dining room, the windows are curved to complement the veranda on the east side of the house. Frank family Dr. Augustus Frank was born January 12, 1792, to Andrew and Elizabeth Frank. Frank was born in Germany but immigrated to the United States when he was seven. He trained to be a doctor at a medical college in Dorset, Vermont, and volunteered in the War of 1812. In 1814, Frank began to practice medicine in Victor, New York. He was an abolitionist and a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Frank belonged to the Anti-Slavery Society of New York and the American Anti-Slavery Society. On September 12, 1816, Frank married Jerusha Baldwin. The couple had three children: two sons who died in infancy, and a daughter, Henriette. On March 15, 1825, Jerusha died. In August of that same year, Frank remarried to Jane Patterson (born August 30, 1795, Londonderry, NH). They had seven children, two of whom were Augustus Frank and George Washington Frank. George Washington Frank George Washington Frank George Washington Frank was born on November 29, 1830. In 1854, George Frank married Phoebe McNair. They had four children: Sarah (died in infancy), Augustus II, Jeanie, and George William. Phoebe died in February 1900, and George Washington Frank died on March 20, 1906. Frank built three houses for himself and his family. The first house, completed in June 1869, was built in Warsaw, New York. George Frank built his second house in Corning, Iowa; this second house was called Edgewood. George Frank operated a banking and real estate investment firm in Corning. In the 1990s, after being used as a clubhouse for a local golf course, Edgewood caught fire and was completely destroyed. His Warsaw, NY home still exists today as a private residence. In 1871, he purchased of land from the Union Pacific Railroad in Kearney, Nebraska. He helped establish the Phil Kearney Ranch, where he invested in thoroughbred horses. In 1885, he opened the George W. Frank Improvement Company, and in 1886, began construction on a home in Kearney. On August 1, 1885, Frank bought the controlling interest in the Kearney Canal and the Water Supply Company. Frank continued the construction of the Kearney Canal and started planning for a power plant in 1885. In July 1890, George Frank owned a company that started using electric trolleys which were run by Kearney Street Railway. As a result of over-extension in business affairs and the economic turn down caused by the Panic of 1893, Frank lost many of his businesses and was forced into foreclosure. By this point he had signed the house over to his wife for one dollar, as to elude the mortgage broker and keep the home. But by 1900, Phoebe had died of a sudden heart failure and Frank was forced to leave the house to the bank and his possessions up for auction. Frank moved in with his daughter, Jeanie Frank Elmendorf, who was at that time living in Lincoln, Nebraska, with her husband Charles. Frank died in his sleep at his daughter's home in 1906. He was 76 years old. History of the house = 1886-1900 = The house's design was first conceived in 1885 by the architecture firm of Frank Bailey and Farmer. George William Frank, youngest son of George Washington Frank, was in charge of the firm. He designed the house as a gift to his parents. Construction on the house began in 1886 and was completed in 1889. George Washington Frank and his wife Phoebe moved into the home in 1890, possibly waiting for the large stained glass window on the second floor landing to be installed. The main floor of the home includes a Library, Grand Reception Hall, Front Vestibule, Drawing Room, Kitchen, Range Room, Butler's Pantry, Dining Room, two bathrooms, and George and Phoebe's private quarters. Each of these rooms, except the Kitchen, Range Room, and Butler's Pantry, were complete with their own hand carved fireplaces with imported tile from both the Netherlands and New Jersey. The house was the first west of the Missouri River to be wired for electricity during construction. Frank would entertain numerous investors at the house, hoping to draw attention to his businesses and success in Kearney. To draw attention to his success in the generation of hydroelectric power, and his installation of electric streetcars in Kearney, all the light fixtures in the home were based around the incandescent electric light bulb. The light fixtures featured little intricate detail, and even the original dining room fixture was four light bulbs at the end of a wire. While entertaining, the Franks would hire a famous opera singer to sing as the guests were arriving at the house. A harpist would play in the dining room during all of their meals, and an electric buzzer was located under the dining room table to summon servants when the next course for meals needed to be brought to the table. The Library of the house was rarely, if ever, used as a library. George Frank would bring many investors and guests to the room to show them out the window. The large window in the library looked east across the grounds of the house, and one could see Frank's power plant and the skyline of Kearney before the subsequent planting of trees and establishment of the Kearney State Normal School to the east of the house in 1905. Frank used the Drawing Room as his private office and kept a large oak desk in the center of the room, which was eventually taken down to the local pharmacy to pay for medication for Phoebe. The Drawing Room also housed the largest fireplace mantle out of the ten fireplaces located in the home. George and Phoebe's private quarters were also located on the main floor. Private chambers on the main floor of a home were often considered a scandal in the late 1800s, but George and Phoebe were in their late 60's when they moved in and did not want to bother with the stairs. The second floor included numerous guest rooms and a bedroom for the Franks' head cook and chief of staff, Eliza Galloway. Eliza was a freed African American slave from Maryland and had met George Washington Frank's brother Augustus in New York. When Frank lost the house in 1900 he gave his silver and china collections to her to start her own catering company. The third floor was used as servants' quarters, and at its peak would have held an estimated 47 staff members. The basement of the home was originally furnished and was home to a wine cellar, billiards room, and the bedroom of the Franks' coachman, John Dallas Sauders. By 1900, grieving the loss of his wife, and facing financial difficulty brought on by over- extension and the Panic of 1893, Frank was forced to leave the home to the bank. = 1900-1907 = By 1900, all of the Franks' furnishings were publicly auctioned, including light fixtures. The house changed ownership numerous times according to the Buffalo County Register of Deeds. In 1901 the Camp family purchased the home and lived there until 1906. They often complained that the house had fallen into disrepair, and their daughter continually mentioned in her private diary that the ceilings were leaking and the balconies were too structurally unsound to use. By 1906 the Camps had left and the house again cycled through owners until 1907. = 1907-1911 = In 1907 the home was purchased for $16,000 by Ole and Georgina Grothan. They began the hefty process of renovating the home to fit the needs of a private medical clinic and sanitarium, known as The Kearney New Sanitarium, that was located on the second floor of the home. The tile roof was replaced, along with gas lines that ran throughout the house. The Drawing Room was converted to be used as a waiting room for patients, and a large leaded glass window on the south wall of the room was replaced with glass french doors which still exist in the room today. The Grand Reception Hall was split in half by a wall to provide more privacy to the Grothans' living quarters. Ole was not only a doctor, but a state senator. Ole and Georgina were unable to have children but did eventually end up adopting a daughter. In July 1911, after marital disputes, the Grothans were divorced and Georgina sold the house to the state of Nebraska for $24,000. Ole attempted to sue for repossession of the home but lost. = 1911-1972 = In 1911, the Nebraska State Hospital for Tuberculosis was founded and officially opened in 1912. The Frank House's grounds were purchased from the state of Nebraska for $40,000 which included the necessary renovations for the house itself. A -story pavilion was built to the north of the house in 1912 and served as the first hospital building and staff pavilion. In 1914, a much larger brick building was built to accommodate more patients. Today this building is known as the Communications Building on the University of Nebraska at Kearney's West Campus. The Frank House was turned into a staff residence hall, where the medical superintendent was housed on the main floor, the matron, or head nurse, housed on the second floor along with a staff commons area, and various nurses housed on the third floor. Numerous alterations and renovations took place at the house in this period. The house's porte cochere was converted into a two car garage. The back porch of the home was removed and all windows were screened. All five of the chimneys were removed along with the tile roof being replaced with asphalt shingle. The front veranda was filled in with storm windows and turned into living space. Inside, all the walls and much of the original woodwork were painted white to make the house look sterile. The Kitchen and Library were turned into bedrooms and the Franks' private dressing room was converted to be used as a kitchen. On second floor, all woodwork and walls were painted white, followed by the ceilings getting replaced with 1950s acoustic tile. One bedchamber on second floor was converted into two rooms and a hallway and used as apartments. By 1925 a new hospital building known as the East Sun building had been built to the southeast of the Frank House. It went through subsequent additions in the 1930s and 1940s and is today known as West Center, and houses the University of Nebraska at Kearney's Business and Technology Department. George Washington Frank's son Augustus II's home was also purchased and used as a nurse's pavilion. It was torn down in the 1950s to make way for Greer Cottage, present day Welch Hall.http://frankhouse.unk.edu With better treatments emerging for Tuberculosis, the hospital's populous began to dwindle to just sixteen patients in 1971. At this point the hospital was ordered to close and officially closed its doors in 1972. The grounds of the hospital were turned over to Kearney State College, now the University of Nebraska at Kearney. = 1972-present = From 1972 to 1973 the house sat abandoned with nothing but wicker furniture stacked in the Master Bedchamber. In the fall of 1973 Marian Johnson, an elementary music teacher in Gibbon, Nebraska, and her husband Halvin were invited to a luncheon with Kearney State College President MacDonald. The college, he informed them, hoped to save the house. Various groups on campus suggested using the Frank House as a faculty club while others believed it could be adapted as a college dorm. Another proposal called for demolishing the historic building. President MacDonald asked if Marian and Halvin would move in and direct the restoration. He was well aware of a renewed interest in local history, evidenced by Kearney's recent celebration of its 100th birthday in 1973, when the Frank House was utilized as a historic site for the centennial. In this same year, the house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. On February 1, 1974, the Johnsons hired a mover to relocate them to the second floor of the historic home and begin to run the main floor as a museum. Immediate attention called for the Stained Glass Window to be restored and it was the first restoration project completed at the home. By 1976, the house was officially opened as a museum. The Johnsons left the home in 1990 after living in it and restoring it for sixteen years. Virginia Lund was next to curate the historic house and oversaw the restoration of the Victorian gardens outside the home. In 2006 Virginia retired and curatorship was passed to KrisAnn Sullivan. Sullivan oversaw the completion of the restoration of the master bedchamber and of the northeast bedchamber on second floor. Sullivan also discontinued having the curators live on second floor and opened up the third floor to the public as well. In 2012, Sullivan retired and the house is currently under the management of the Museum of Nebraska Art (MONA), a local art museum that is administratively affiliated with the University of Nebraska at Kearney. As of April 2018 the second, and third floor of the home as well as the basement were opened to the public to see for the first time. G. W. Frank Museum of History and Culture In 1973 the Frank House was utilized as a historic center for Kearney, Nebraska's Centennial Celebration. This was the first instance where the house was utilized as a museum. An estimated 2,000 people toured the house during this event. 1973 was the same year that the house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976 the Frank House officially opened as a museum after the various areas of the house were partially restored and furniture was collected to fill the empty rooms. Tours were originally only held on the main floor, and visitors would get to travel to the top of the staircase to view the large Stained Glass Window as the curators lived on the second floor of the home. Today, the house not only functions as a museum, but also as a university and community events center. Various events are held at the house, one of the largest being the Chancellor of the university's Holiday Reception. The Frank House also hosts various exhibits presented by community members or exhibits presented by the Frank House. References  External links  * Frank House - University of Nebraska Kearney *G. W.

In 2003, the comet was estimated to have a mean absolute V magnitude (H) of 13.05 ± 0.10, with an albedo of 0.03, giving an effective radius of 8.9 ± 0.7 km. Using data from Fernandez (2004–2005) JPL lists the comet with an albedo of 0.05 and a diameter of 13.6 ± 1.0 km. This comet probably represents the transition between typical Halley-family/long- period comets and extinct comets. Damocloids have been studied as possible extinct cometary candidates due to the similarity of their orbital parameters with those of Halley-family comets.

The HCMC is a Member of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and \\"operates within its framework and under its auspices\\". According to Thomson Reuters HCMC is the competent authority for supervising securities laws in Greece, including tender offers. Mandate The commission is responsible for monitoring compliance with the provisions of capital market law, and is funded by fees paid by the supervised entities. These include Investment Firms, Mutual Fund Management Firms, Portfolio Investment Companies, Real Estate Investment Companies and Financial Intermediation Firms. The HCMC also oversees companies listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, ensuring compliance with capital market legislation. Because of problems caused by the financial crisis that blew up in mid 2010, the commission banned short selling of shares listed in the Athens Exchange effective 28 April 2010, to remain in force until 28 June 2010. Legal framework Until 2000, there were no laws covering corporate governance in Greece. The HCMC set up the Committee on Corporate Governance in April 1999, which issued the Mertzanis Report in October 1999, entitled Principles on Corporate Governance in Greece: Recommendations for its Competitive Transformation. This functioned as a voluntary code. In November 2000 the HCMC issued the mandatory Code of Conduct for Companies Listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, which requires listed entities to establish an internal audit unit to monitor the company's audit process, reporting to the board of directors. Law No. 3016 of 2002 regulating corporate governance went into force on 20 June 2003, and allows the HCMC to impose sanctions for non-compliance, but the law has been criticized for lacking detail. The chairman of the commission from 1996 to 2004 was Stavros Thomadakis, who went on to become first chairman of the Public Interest Oversight Board in March 2005. As of June 2011 the chairman was Anastassios Gabrielides.

She uses the name 'Matt' and male pronouns when referring to the time before her transition. Career =Military= Kroc served in the United States Marine Corps from 1991 to 1995 and was selected for presidential security duty serving under President Bill Clinton. The tour of duty included time in Washington D.C., providing security for military officers at the Pentagon and for some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1992 to 1994. Assigned to security duty for Warren Christopher (then Secretary of State) during the United Nations conferences in 1993, Kroc was later assigned to the security force at the presidential retreat at Camp David from 1994 to 1995. =Powerlifting= Kroc began entering powerlifting contests after joining the Marines in 1991. In 2002, he graduated from college and bought a home prior to the 2002 USAPL Nationals. Later he went to London, Ohio, to train at a compound with Dave Tate and Jim Wendler. Kroc also trained with Mountain Dog John Meadows, Branch Warren, and Johnnie O. Jackson. Kroc developed what he called \\"kroc rows\\", or dumbbell rows performed with extremely heavy weight and many repetitions. He made a video showing 25 repetitions with 225 pounds, and has been known to perform kroc rows with 300-pound dumbbells. Private video, access only if authorised by owner He also described lifting 300 pounds for 13 repetitions using straps; and both 205 pounds for 30 repetitions, and 175 pounds for 40 repetitions, neither with straps. The 300x13 claim was verified at the 2010 Arnold Sports Festival. In 2017, after 18 months on estrogen, Kroc's performance was reduced to 210 pounds for 10 repetitions and deadlifting 605 pounds. Kroc is a world champion, a world record holding powerlifter, and a National Physique Committee bodybuilder. =Seminar speaking= In 2012, Kroc spoke at Learn To Train Seminar 4. Kroc then shared this online from December 2012 to March 2013.Part 1 December 12, 2012 Part 2 December 17, 2012 Part 3 December 18, 2012 Part 4 March 1, 2013 =Other= Kroc graduated from Ferris State University in 2002 and is a registered pharmacist working in the specialty pharmacy division of Walgreens. Kroc had careers as a sponsored athlete under contract with both EliteFTS and MuscleTech, and as an author and model, having appeared in and published articles in many magazines including Men's Fitness, Powerlifting USA, MuscleMag, and Muscle & Fitness. Kroc is also a featured author for T-Nation. He joined YouTube in 2006. Personal life In interviews, Kroc has described growing up in a trailer in a rural conservative area. Kroc started working out with cement-filled Sears weights at 6 years old, including doing 100 reps on a 10-pound dumbbell, and at 8 years old constructed a weight bench out of a 2x4 or 2x12 on cement blocks and made a barbell out of milk jugs filled with sand hung on a stick. Kroc weighed 118 pounds as a high school freshman, and, after graduating from high school at Standish-Sterling Central. In 2004, Kroc was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Kroc had three children with a woman named Patty; they split up in 2006. Kroc also married a woman named Lauren. Kroc says she was the \\"Manliest of the Manly Men\\", known as an \\"Ultimate Alpha Male\\" before transitioning. Kroc came out as transgender to friends and relatives (including three sons) around 2005. (50 seconds in .. 16 minutes in) In April 2015, Kroc legally changed forenames from Matthew Raymond to Janae Marie, a name chosen by Kroc's mother. In July of that year, Kroc came out as both transgender and genderfluid. She is living as both genders, saying she often feels like two completely different people trying to share a body, fighting for control. Kroc goes by female pronouns, \\"she uses female pronouns\\" but uses male pronouns when referring to her life as Matt. In December 2015, Kroc's was the first featured among the top 63 most powerful comings-out of 2015. People described an Instagram post where Kroc described undergoing facial feminization surgery more than one year before she publicly came out. Earlier articles state similarly. After an August interview by Dave Palumbo, in September Kroc announced the start of a full gender transition, starting both surgical and hormone treatments, and stopping career lifting. In an interview from October 2015, Janae mentioned being four weeks into estrogen therapy and taking a testosterone blocker. 24 minutes in: \\"I've been on a full dose estrogen therapy the last four weeks, and a testosterone blocker.\\" That same month, Kroc was mentioned on the cover of Muscle and Fitness which featured an interview and a photo shoot. Kroc was formerly on the advisory board for the magazine. This was the longest (highest word-count) story published to date in Muscle & Fitness, and the first to feature a transgender athlete. A 2017 facial feminization surgery was delayed due to an infection from a cat bite. Kroc is the subject of the 2017 documentary film Transformer.Peter Knegt, \\"What's queer at Hot Docs?

It lies near Asenovgrad in the Rhodope Mountains of Plovdiv Province, south central Bulgaria. Constructed most likely in the 12th century, it features two stories, of which the upper story is the church proper and the lower story is of unclear function. The rectangular tower over the church's narthex is regarded as the earliest preserved of its kind in the Balkans. Fragments of frescoes are visible on the walls of the church's upper story. Location and history The Church of the Holy Mother of God lies on an elevation near the road from Plovdiv to Smolyan, south of the town of Asenovgrad (medieval Stenimachos). It forms part of a now mostly ruined castle known as Asen's Fortress, of which the church is the best preserved building. The church is dated by most scholars to the 12th century; however, some researchers place its construction in the 11th century and a few others in the 13th century. Though the church is commonly known as the Church of the Holy Mother of God, this may well not have been its actual name. The dedication is alleged based on a partial Medieval Greek inscription in the church, which may have been a donor's inscription. In the early 20th century, the part of the inscription that was still visible was deciphered as \\"ή παναγία τῆς Πετριζηώτης\\", equivalent to \\"or the Mother of God of Petrich\\". However, this was the name of the main church (katholikon) of the nearby Bachkovo Monastery, which makes it more likely that the inscription references the monastery and its relation to the church in Asen's Fortress in some way, rather than providing the name of the church. At the turn of the 20th century, the Church of the Holy Mother of God was the terminus of two rival religious processions organised by the ethnic Greek and Bulgarian communities of Asenovgrad. A Greek procession took place in 1899 and a comparable Bulgarian one was carried out several years later. These processions began after a man claimed to have seen lights and heard chants while passing near the then-abandoned church. Both processions ended with a Divine Liturgy observed at night by the church. After suffering damage during an earthquake in 1904, the church was reconstructed by a team directed by architect Aleksandar Rashenov in 1936. As of 2008, it continues to function as a place of worship. Architecture The Church of the Holy Mother of God measures approximately in length, in width and in height (over according to other data). The walls of the church were constructed out of interchanging bands of stones and three rows of brickwork tied together with mortar. An exception is the north wall, which was built almost exclusively of stones, with only a single band of bricks. The walls vary from in thickness. The church features two stories: while the upper story was certainly the church proper and the place of liturgy, the role of the lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may have served as a tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs. The church has a single elongated nave. It is surmounted by a dome and finishes with a single apse in its eastern part. The dome is supported by arches to the north and south and vaults to the west and east. The apse is five-sided on the outside and round on the inside. To the west of it is the sanctuary which features three vaults which hosted the bema, the prothesis and the diaconicon. The sanctuary was separated from the rest of the nave via two pillars. Three buttresses support the south wall and the apse. The entrance to the church is on the south wall. The church has a total of 16 windows: three on the apse, one on the south wall, four on the north wall and one on the narthex. To the west of the nave is a small narthex, which is topped by an unusual rectangular tower. The tower was used either as a bell tower or watchtower, or possibly both. It was accessible via wooden ladders on the inside and the outside. It features four wide vaulted windows in its upper part and a rectangular dome covered with roof tiles. According to art historian Robert G. Ousterhout, the tower of the Church of the Holy Mother of God is the earliest example of a belfry integrated into a church building and arranged above the narthex in Balkan architecture. This design would later establish itself as standard in the Balkans. The construction of an integrated tower has been attributed to either Western European or oriental (Syriac or Armenian) influences. Decoration alt=A partially preserved fresco of a biblical scene with portraits of Christian figures in circles below, all painted above a portal The church's exterior appearance has been described as \\"harmonic\\", \\"graceful\\" and \\"proportionate\\". The Church of the Holy Mother of God is richly decorated on the outside. Blind arches, a design element very typical for medieval Bulgarian architecture, feature prominently on the south facade and the dome. A large arch on the south wall ties together the lower and upper story. The apse is particularly richly decorated. Besides rows of elongated bricks, it also includes triangular shapes and lattice patterns above, both made of red bricks. The church's upper story features fragments of frescoes, mostly on the interior, though there are traces of mural painting on one of the blind arches as well. The interior includes images of the Baptism of Christ, Pilate's Court, the Dormition of the Mother of God and the Crucifixion of Jesus. Among the portraits of saints that can be recognised are John the Baptist, the apostles Peter and Paul, Constantine and Helena and the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. Military saints were depicted on the south wall, while the north wall mostly features monks. All of the preserved frescoes were done in the 14th century and are an example of Palaiologan art. All captions to the frescoes are in Medieval Greek.

Biography Niceforo was born in Castiglione di Sicilia, Catania, Italy, and died March 2, 1960, in Rome. He was an Italian sociologist, criminologist, and statistician who posited the theory that every person has a “deep ego” of antisocial, subconscious impulses that represent a throwback to precivilized existence. Accompanying this ego, and attempting to keep its latent delinquency in check, according to his concept, is a “superior ego” formed by man's social interaction. This theory, which he published in 1902, bears some resemblance to the discoveries of psychoanalysis that were being made about the same time. Niceforo taught criminology in Lausanne (Switzerland), Brussels (Belgium), and elsewhere and statistics at the universities of Naples and Rome (from 1931). Initially he was influenced by the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso (1835–1909), who had theorized the existence of a criminal type, identifiable by certain physical features. Niceforo came to believe, however, that crime could be understood only through a thorough investigation—biological, psychological, and sociological—of the normal human being. Lombroso had included southern Italians among the races who were more inclined to commit crimes citing southern brigandage as a proof to corroborate his theories. This scientific racism manifested in Niceforo with Crime in Sardinia was published in 1897; here Niceforo related the crime in the Island to the existence of a Mediterranean Race and used the analysis of local music, songs, traditions and folklore as a proof of the Sardinians' racial inferiority and tendency to crime. One of the first empirical social scientists in Italy, he applied statistics to the problem of finding regularities in social behaviour. Out of these studies came his theory that persons in all societies exhibit certain constant features, which he called residues, one of which was diversity among individuals. He also discerned in every society the stratification of people into social hierarchies and their collection into a mass, observable especially in religious and national ideological systems. In elaborating his theory of man's dual ego, he maintained that the deep ego often successfully evades the attempts of the superior ego to control it. This view is detailed in his L’ “io” profondo e le sue maschere (1949; “The Deep Ego and Its Masks”).

The area of the district is . Its administrative center is the town of Shenkursk. Population: The population of Shenkursk accounts for 37.5% of the district's total population. Geography The district is located in the valley of the Vaga River, a major left tributary of the Northern Dvina. A major tributary of the Vaga is the Led River (left). Some areas in the east, northeast, north, and west of the district lie in the basin of various left tributaries of the Northern Dvina. There are many glacial lakes in the district, the biggest of which is Lake Lum. Most of the district is covered by coniferous forests (taiga). There are meadows in the floodplains of the river valleys, most notably the Vaga's, and swamps. History Coat of arms of Shenkursk from 1780 The area was originally populated by the Finno-Ugric peoples and then colonized by the Novgorod Republic. After the fall of Novgorod, the area became a part of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Historically, it was a part of Vazhsky Uyezd, a vast area including almost all of the basin of the Vaga River. Chronicles mention Shenkursk in 1229 as Sheng-Kurye. In 1426, Varlaam Vazhsky, who was later beautified as a saint, founded the Vazhsky Monastery. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Archangelgorod Governorate, In 1780, the governorate was abolished and transformed into Vologda Viceroyalty. Vazhsky Uyezd was split, and the area of the current Shenkursky District became a part of the newly established Shenkursky Uyezd. In 1796, Shenkursky Uyezd was transferred to Arkhangelsk Governorate. Shenkursk played a prominent role in the Russian Civil War. In the autumn of 1918, about six thousand British and American troops advanced south of Shenkursk. On January 19-25, the Bolshevik troops staged a counteroffensive, known as the Battle of Shenkursk. Three thousand troops, split into three armies, advancing from three sides, cut Shenkursk off, and moved the front area north of Shenkursk. Shenkursky Uyezd remained in Arkhangelsk Governorate until 1929, when several governorates were merged into Northern Krai. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, and Shenkursky Uyezd was split into Shenkursky, Bereznikovsky, and Rovdinsky Districts. Shenkursky District became a part of Nyandoma Okrug of Northern Krai. Rovdinsky District, with the administration located in Rovdino, existed until 1959 (with a brief break between 1931 and 1935). On September 11, 1959, the district was abolished and split between Shenkursky and Velsky Districts; the district's administrative center Rovdino became a part of Shenkursky District. In the following years, the first-level administrative division of Russia kept changing. In 1930, the okrug was abolished, and the district was subordinated to the central administration of Northern Krai. In 1936, the krai itself was transformed into Northern Oblast. In 1937, Northern Oblast was split into Arkhangelsk Oblast and Vologda Oblast. Shenkursky District remained in Arkhangelsk Oblast ever since. Divisions =Administrative divisions= As an administrative division, the district is divided into twelve selsoviets and one urban-type settlement with jurisdictional territory (Shenkursk).

His only victory came on August 31, 1979, when he pitched 2 innings of scoreless relief in a 4 hour, 15 inning marathon against the San Diego Padres at San Diego Stadium. Post-Cardinals career After the 1979 season, the Seattle Mariners purchased O'Brien's contract. However, he was released shortly before the 1980 season. He found work with the Richmond Braves, the AAA affiliate of the Atlanta Braves in 1980 and the beginning of the 1981 season. He finished the 1981 season with the Columbus Astros, the Houston Astros' AA affiliate in the Southern League. Coaching career O'Brien was a pitching coach at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in 1983 and at Michigan State University from 1988 to 1991. In 1991, he skippered the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was an assistant coach at the University of Michigan from 1991 to 1995.

Biography  Birze was born into the family of a municipal employee in Rūjiena. He completed primary school in 1933. After the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940, Birze joined the Young Communist League. He was arrested in July 1941, after the Occupation of Latvia by Nazi Germany. He was first held in prison in Valmiera, then transferred to the Salaspils concentration camp. After this he was assigned to do forced labor in the construction of a hangar at the Spilve Airport in Riga. In July 1944 he was among 1,200 people transported to Germany and interned in the Buchenwald concentration camp. In April 1945, during the evacuation of the camp, Birze managed to escape. He tried to return home through Poland, where he was arrested and held from May until September in an NKVD filtration camp in Hrodna. The time he spent in these camps and prisons is reflected in his literary works, especially in his novel Yet Icebound Rivers Flow. He graduated from the University of Latvia Faculty of Medicine in 1949. After graduation he worked as a doctor in Cēsis. He died there in 2000.

Later in his life he served in World War I and worked as a contractor. Early life Alfred Joseph Schneider, commonly known as \\"Chubby Snyder\\", was born on August 20, 1890 in Buffalo, New York to Frank and Margret Schneider both of New York. Frank Schneider was of Danish and German ancestry, while Margret Schneider was full German. Frank Schneider worked as a contractor. Chubby Snyder had two siblings, a sister, Willis Maischoss (née) Schneider and a brother, Frank L. Schneider. Baseball career Before 1914, Snyder played semi-professional baseball in his home-town of Buffalo, New York. In 1914, Snyder joined the Major League Baseball (MLB) Buffalo Buffeds of the short-lived Federal League. Until 2010, Jack Snyder who played with the Brooklyn Robins in 1917 was credited as playing for the Buffeds in 1914. Members of the Society for American Baseball Research discovered that it was in fact Chubby Snyder. He played just one game with Buffalo that season. In that game, Snyder made one plate appearance in which he drew a walk. Defensively, he played catcher. Snyder emerged in 1916 as a member a semi-pro baseball team called Pine Ridge. Later life After his baseball career was over, Snyder served in World War I. He later became a member of the Niagara Falls Rotary Club.

Ohio Elections Commission, 514 U.S. 334 (1995), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an Ohio statute prohibiting anonymous campaign literature is unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the freedom of speech. In a 7–2 decision authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court found that the First Amendment protects the decision of an author to remain anonymous. On April 27, 1988, Margaret McIntyre stood outside of a middle school in Westerville, Ohio, and passed out anonymous leaflets that opposed a proposed school district tax levy. The Ohio Elections Commission fined McIntyre $100 for violating a state law that prohibited the distribution of any kind of political or campaign literature that does not have the name and address of the person responsible for its contents. With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, McIntyre appealed the fine in court. The county court reversed the fine, holding that because McIntyre did not attempt to mislead the public, the Ohio statute was unconstitutional as it applied to her actions. However, the state court of appeals reinstated the fine, referring to a 1922 decision by the Ohio Supreme Court as precedent, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Ohio Supreme Court on April 19, 1995. As precedent, the Court referred to its decision in Talley v. California (1960), in which the Court found a similar law prohibiting anonymous leafletting unconstitutional, as well as the role of anonymous political literature throughout history, one example being The Federalist Papers. The Court's majority opinion emphasized the importance of anonymous speech, describing it as \\"not a pernicious, fraudulent practice, but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 357. The effect of the Court's opinion on anonymous speech has been analyzed in the contexts of television and radio advertisements, campaign finance, and the Internet.  Background  = Ohio statute and prior case law = The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prevents the federal government from abridging the freedom of speech, and the Fourteenth Amendment extends this prohibition to state governments under the incorporation doctrine.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 336, n.1. Section 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Revised Code forbade the creation and distribution of any kind of publication \\"... designed to promote the adoption or defeat of any issue, or to influence the voters in any election ...\\" unless the publication contains the name and address of the person responsible for the content of the publication.\\"McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 338, n.3. Previously, in a case called State v. Babst (1922), the Supreme Court of Ohio, the state's highest court, upheld the constitutionality of the \\"statutory predecessor\\" of section 3599.09(A).McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 339.State v. Babst, 104 Ohio St. 167, 135 N.E. 525 (1922). However, in Talley v. California (1960), the Supreme Court of the United States held that a similar Los Angeles city ordinance prohibiting all anonymous leafletting was unconstitutional because it violated the First Amendment.Talley v. California, 362 U.S. 60 (1960). The U.S. Supreme Court has also discussed whether disclosure of an anonymous individual's identity is permissible in certain situations. In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Court upheld, among other things, a part of the Federal Election Campaign Act that required the public disclosure of political campaign contributions above a certain dollar amount. Applying a standard of exacting scrutiny, the Court determined that the government's interest in providing the electorate with information about campaign contributions outweighed the First Amendment concerns in the case of Buckley. In First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978), the Court invalidated a Massachusetts law that made it a crime to use corporate funds to influence the voters of an election. As part of its analysis, the Court commented that \\"identification of the source of advertising may be required as a means of disclosure, so that the people will be able to evaluate the arguments to which they are being subjected\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 354, n.18 (quoting Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 at 792, n.32). = Facts of the case = One of the anonymous leaflets passed out by Margaret McIntyre which became the subject of McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission On the evening of April 27, 1988, the superintendent of Westerville City School District held a public meeting at Blendon Middle School in Westerville, Ohio, to discuss a new school district tax levy. On the same day, an Ohioan named Margaret McIntyre stood outside the school and distributed leaflets to meeting attendants, asking them to vote no on the tax levy issue. Some of the leaflets did not identify her as the author, instead identifying the message as coming from \\"concerned parents and tax payers\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 337. While she was distributing the leaflets, a school official who supported the tax proposal warned McIntyre that her anonymous leaflets were unlawful. Despite the warning, McIntyre continued to distribute the leaflets at a meeting the next day.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 338. The tax levy issue failed to pass on its first try. In November 1988, in the third election on which the issue was presented, the tax levy was finally approved. Five months after the levy passed, the same school official who warned McIntyre about her anonymous leaflets filed a complaint with the Ohio Elections Commission, accusing McIntyre of violating section 3599.09(A) of the Ohio Revised Code. The commission found her guilty and fined her $100. = Lower court proceedings = McIntyre appealed the fine to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, which reversed the fine, holding that because McIntyre \\"did not 'mislead the public nor act in a surreptitious manner'\\", section 3599.09(A) was unconstitutional as it applied to her actions. McIntyre was represented by David Goldberger, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. The Ohio Court of Appeals reversed that court, putting back the fine. In a divided vote, the majority of the judges felt bound by the precedent set in State v. Babst (1922) by the Supreme Court of Ohio, which upheld the \\"statutory predecessor\\" of section 3599.09(A). The judge who dissented from the opinion argued that the U.S. Supreme Court's intervening decision in Talley v. California (1960) \\"compelled the Ohio court to adopt a narrowing construction of the statute to save its constitutionality\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 339. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals, also by a divided vote. The majority of the state supreme court justices felt that the Ohio statute was different from the city ordinance in Talley, finding that section 3599.09(A) \\"has as its purpose the identification of persons who distribute materials containing false statements\\". In a dissenting opinion, Justice J. Craig Wright wrote that section 3599.09(A) \\"'is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest and is, therefore, unconstitutional as applied to McIntyre.'\\"McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 340.  Supreme Court  Justice John Paul Stevens, the author of the majority opinion in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission Margaret McIntyre died while the case was still being litigated in the state courts. On behalf of Joseph McIntyre, the executor of McIntyre's estate, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, which the Court granted on February 22, 1994.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 340–41.McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission, 67 Ohio St.3d 391, 618 N.E. 2d 152, cert. granted, 510 U.S. 1108 (U.S. February 22, 1994). Justice Stevens later wrote, \\"Even though the amount in controversy is only $100\\", the Court's grant of certiorari \\"reflects our agreement with [the executor's] appraisal of the importance of the question presented\\". = Opinion of the Court = Justice John Paul Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court on April 19, 1995, reversing the Ohio Supreme Court in a 7–2 decision.McIntyre, 514, U.S. 334 at 335. Stevens emphasized that the First Amendment protects a right to anonymity, referring to Talley as precedent,McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 342. and stated that Ohio's interests in preventing fraud and informing the electorate were insufficient to justify the sweeping scope of its statute.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 348–53. Stevens also rejected the argument that the Court's prior decisions in Bellotti and Buckley compel the Court to uphold the Ohio statute.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 353–56.  Freedom to publish anonymously  Stevens began his First Amendment analysis by quoting Talley v. California, where the Court wrote: \\"Anonymous pamphlets, leaflets, brochures and even books have played an important role in the progress of mankind.\\"McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 341 (quoting Talley v. California, 362 U.S. at 64). Stevens noted various well- known authors throughout literary history who had opted to publish either anonymously or under a pseudonym, including Mark Twain, O. Henry, Benjamin Franklin, and Voltaire.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 341, n.4. He then stated that the \\"freedom to publish anonymously extends beyond the literary realm\\", referring to the decision in Talley, as well as The Federalist Papers, a collection of anonymous essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to promote the ratification of what is now the U.S. Constitution.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 342. In justifying a First Amendment right to anonymity, Stevens wrote that while curiosity might cause a reader to inquire about an author's identity, an author's \\"decision in favor of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 341–42. Stevens added that anonymity \\"provides a way for a writer who may be personally unpopular to ensure that readers will not prejudge her message simply because they do not like its proponent\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 342. Stevens concluded that Talley's reasoning \\"embraced a respected tradition of anonymity in the advocacy of political causes\\", stating that \\"this tradition is perhaps best exemplified by the secret ballot, the hard-won right to vote one's conscience without fear of retaliation\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 343.  Exacting scrutiny standard  Because Ohio's law was \\"a regulation of pure speech\\" as opposed to a regulation of merely \\"the mechanics of the electoral process\\", Stevens applied a standard of \\"exacting scrutiny\\", a more rigorous standard of scrutiny than the Ohio Supreme Court had applied.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 345. Under this standard, the Court may uphold Ohio's law \\"only if it is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding state interest\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 347. Specifically, Ohio must demonstrate that its stated interests \\"in preventing fraudulent and libelous statements\\" and \\"in providing the electorate with relevant information\\" are sufficient to justify its law against anonymous campaign literature.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 348. Stevens stated that the interest of \\"informing the electorate\\" is \\"plainly insufficient to support the constitutionality of its disclosure requirement\\", writing that \\"the identity of the speaker is no different from other components of the document's content that the author is free to include or exclude\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 348–49. On the other hand, Stevens acknowledged that the fraud and libel prevention interest \\"carries special weight during election campaigns when false statements, if credited, may have serious adverse consequences for the public at large\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 349. However, Stevens also commented that Ohio's election laws include \\"detailed and specific prohibitions against making or disseminating false statements during political campaigns\\" and that \\"Ohio's prohibition of anonymous leaflets plainly is not its principal weapon against fraud\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 349–50. Stevens concluded that while Ohio's prohibition may \\"serve as an aid to enforcement of the specific prohibitions and as a deterrent to the making of false statements by unscrupulous prevaricators\\", these \\"ancillary benefits\\" do not justify the Ohio statute's \\"extremely broad prohibition\\", particularly because it \\"encompasses documents that are not even arguably false or misleading\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 350–51.  Bellotti and Buckley  Stevens concluded that neither of the Court's prior decisions in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti and Buckley v. Valeo is \\"controlling\\" in McIntyre. With respect to Bellotti, Stevens clarified that \\"although we commented in dicta on the prophylactic effect of requiring identification of the source of corporate advertising, that footnote did not necessarily apply to independent communications by an individual like Mrs. McIntyre\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 353–54. Additionally, while Buckley \\"concerned contributions to [a political] candidate or expenditures by the candidate or his responsible agent\\", Stevens wrote that the case \\"had no reference to the kind of independent activity pursued by Mrs. McIntyre\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 354. = Dissent and concurrence = Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in the judgment only. Thomas agreed with the majority opinion that the Ohio law prohibiting anonymous campaign literature was unconstitutional because it violated the First Amendment, but would have applied \\"a different methodology to this case\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 358–59 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Rather than analyze the \\"tradition\\" and \\"value\\" of anonymous speech in American history, Thomas stated that the Court should instead \\"determine whether the phrase 'freedom of speech, or of the press,' as originally understood, protected anonymous political leafletting\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 359 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). After analyzing historical evidence, Thomas concluded that the original intent of the First Amendment included a protection of anonymous speech and criticized the majority for adopting \\"an analysis that is largely unconnected to the Constitution's text and history\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 371 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). Justice Antonin Scalia filed a dissenting opinion, in which Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined. Scalia rejected the Court's opinion that the First Amendment protects a \\"right-to-be-unknown while engaging in politics\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 371 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Responding to the majority and to Justice Thomas, Scalia stated that \\"to prove that anonymous electioneering was used frequently is not to establish that it is a constitutional right\\", concluding that there was a scarcity of historical evidence that \\"anonymous electioneering\\" was regarded as such by the Framers of the Constitution.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 373 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In the absence of such evidence, Scalia looked towards \\"the widespread and longstanding traditions of our people\\", commenting that laws similar to Ohio's exist in every U.S. state except California and that the history of these laws extends to the nineteenth century.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 375–77 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Scalia also concluded that prior case law would also justify upholding Ohio's statute.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 378 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Specifically, previous cases support that \\"protection of the election process justifies limitations upon speech that cannot constitutionally be imposed generally\\" and reject that \\"a 'right to anonymity' is such a prominent value in our constitutional system that even protection of the electoral process cannot be purchased at its expense\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 378–79 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Scalia further stated that \\"the prohibition of anonymous campaigning is effective in protecting and enhancing democratic elections\\".McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 381 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion, in which she responded to Scalia's dissent, emphasizing the narrow scope of the majority's decision: \\"We do not thereby hold that the State may not in other, larger circumstances, require the speaker to disclose its interest by disclosing its identity.\\"McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 358 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  Analysis and impact  McIntyre has been referred to in analyses of the relationship between anonymous speech and the First Amendment. In an article published in the North Carolina Law Review, Richard K. Norton wrote that the majority opinion in McIntyre \\"left the jurisprudential door slightly cracked, suggesting the possibility that some kind of acceptable proscription on anonymous speech exists, but gave no indication what such a proscription might look like\\". Norton argued that McIntyre's \\"legal analysis does not provide a satisfying exposition of the concerns truly driving the debate, nor does it offer a satisfactory guide for predicting how the Court will rule on future anonymous political speech questions\\". Responding to Norton's claim, Amy Constantine wrote in a Connecticut Law Review article that \\"McIntyre nonetheless is an important decision that recognizes a de minimis exception to campaign literature disclosure statutes\\". Constantine added that \\"in a broader context, the decision affirms this country's historical commitment to protecting core political speech and protection of the marketplace of ideas metaphor\\" and \\"has tremendous ramifications for the forty-eight states, including Connecticut, that have similar disclosure statutes for political campaign literature\\". = Political campaign advertisements = At the beginning of 1995, the year the Supreme Court decided McIntyre, all U.S. states (plus the District of Columbia) except California had laws similar to the Ohio law prohibiting anonymous campaign literature.McIntyre, 514 U.S. 334 at 376, n.2 (Scalia, J., dissenting). In an analysis published in the Catholic University Law Review, Rachel J. Grabow concluded that \\"because some of the Court's language in McIntyre is unclear, and the decision leaves unanswered questions, McIntyre's future is difficult to predict\\". Grabow cited Scalia's dissenting opinion, stating that Scalia had \\"posited that it was impossible to know whether McIntyre invalidated other existing identification statutes\\" and that \\"it would take decades to flesh out the scope of the right to distribute anonymous campaign literature\\". Grabow criticized the Court's decision, arguing that \\"the majority opinion fails to fully consider Ohio's strong interests in preventing fraudulent campaign-related statements and providing information to its electorate\\". Grabow disagreed with the Court's use of the exacting scrutiny standard in striking down Ohio's law, arguing that other state regulations on the electoral process are reviewed at a lower standard and that \\"subjecting all election regulations to exacting scrutiny would substantially hinder the states' ability to ensure fair elections\\". Grabow also argued that even under the exacting scrutiny standard, \\"the Court underestimated the strength of Ohio's interest in an informed electorate\\".  Television and radio advertisements  At the time the Supreme Court decided McIntyre, thirty-one states had laws that required sponsors of political television and radio advertisements to identify themselves in the advertisement. In an analysis published in 1996 by the University of Chicago Law Review, Thomas Dupree Jr. wrote that because of the McIntyre decision \\"the constitutionality of these statutes has been cast into doubt\\". However, Dupree qualified that statement by saying that the \\"precise scope of McIntyre is far from clear\\" and that \\"the Court offered little guidance as to the decision's applicability to statutes that regulate a narrower class of speakers—such as candidates for political office—or a communications medium other than print\\". Dupree stated that he \\"advocates a narrow interpretation of McIntyre\\", arguing that \\"state disclosure laws, narrowly tailored to include only candidates or their agents communicating via broadcast media, remain constitutional after McIntyre\\". According to Dupree, \\"Historically, the Court has applied lighter First Amendment scrutiny to restrictions on broadcast communication than to restrictions on print communication\\". Additionally, Dupree argued that while the Ohio law in question in McIntyre was \\"overly broad\\" because it regulated political speech \\"by all citizens\\", a narrower statute limited only to political candidates would leave \\"untouched anonymous speech by private individuals like Mrs. McIntyre, without clearing the way for candidates to engage in anonymous warfare over the airwaves\\". = Campaign finance = In an article published in the William & Mary Bill of Rights Journal, Richard Briffault, a professor at Columbia Law School, commented that even though McIntyre invalidated a disclosure law on constitutional grounds, the decision did not undermine \\"the Court's general support for the public dissemination of campaign finance information\\". Briffault commented that in McConnell v. FEC (2003), \\"the Court easily upheld the extension of disclosure requirements to electioneering communications\\". According to Briffault, \\"Justice Thomas's contention in his McConnell dissent that McIntyre changed the constitutional analysis of disclosure and required that disclosure requirements be subject to strict judicial scrutiny was given short shrift by the rest of the Court\\". The Court would further distinguish disclosure laws from the Ohio law in McIntyre in subsequent cases such as Citizens United v. FEC (2010) and Doe v. Reed (2010). According to Briffault, \\"Citizens United also dealt with—and strongly upheld—some of the disclosure provisions of federal campaign finance law, thus, confirming once again that even campaign spending that cannot be limited may be subject to disclosure\\". In Doe, the Court held that requiring disclosure of signatures on a referendum does not violate the First Amendment. = Internet anonymity = McIntyre has been cited in cases involving defamation by anonymous Internet users (sometimes described as \\"cybersmears\\"). In an analysis published in the Washington and Lee Law Review, Caroline Strickland wrote that although the Court's decision in McIntyre \\"emphasized a general respect for the anonymous advocacy of political causes, it did not contemplate anonymous unlawful speech such as the Internet postings challenged in cybersmear lawsuits\\". Strickland stated that \\"public interest groups, court documents, and legal practitioners often cite McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission as an authority for the protection of anonymous Internet speech\\", but also wrote that \\"many citations to McIntyre presuppose that its rationale applies in the cybersmear context and fail to address the distinctions between Mrs. McIntyre's speech and alleged cybersmear\\". Specifically, Strickland stated that the \\"most blatant misapplications of McIntyre fail to address the fact that McIntyre did not directly contemplate fraudulent, libelous, or otherwise unlawful, anonymous speech\\". Strickland ultimately concluded that because of these and other distinctions, \\"neither the First Amendment nor McIntyre protects the intentionally false speech challenged in some cybersmear lawsuits\\". Strickland compared McIntyre to two subsequent cases, both concerning requests for a process called \\"expedited discovery\\", by which a court can attempt to \\"facilitate efforts to identify and to serve an unknown defendant\\". The first was a 2000 case in which a Virginia Circuit Court \\"used McIntyre in its First Amendment analysis to extend the protection of anonymous speech to the Internet context\\", but \\"maintained, however, that the right was not absolute and did not extend to unlawful Internet statements\\". The second was Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3 (2001), a case in which a New Jersey court denied expedited discovery of the identities of two anonymous individuals. According to Strickland, \\"The court noted the factual distinctions of McIntyre, yet stated that its general principle – that the First Amendment protects anonymous speech – nevertheless applied\\". Jasmine McNealy, an assistant professor at the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, responded to Strickland's article in a paper published in the First Amendment Law Review, stating that Strickland's conclusion \\"does not recognize, however, that plaintiffs are asking for the discovery of the defendant's identity before there is an actual adjudication of whether the comments at issue are truly defamatory\\". McNealy stated that \\"McIntyre can be viewed as supporting anonymous online speech\\". However, in an analysis of various anonymous online speech cases that cite McIntyre, McNealy found that \\"most of the courts citing McIntyre used it as a reference citation, and not as a decision that must be followed or explained\\". McNealy concluded, \\"In sum, the influence of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in McIntyre has not been as significant as thought possible with respect to online anonymous speech.\\"  See also  * National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v.

Biography A native of Teelin, County Donegal, Ó hEochaidh worked as a fisherman in his youth. Despite a basic education, from an early age he made a written record of the oral folklore of his area. In 1935, James Delargy of the Irish Folklore Commission appointed Ó hEochaidh to be full-time folklore collector for the Gaeltacht area of Donegal. Besides keeping written records, Ó hEochaidh recorded stories and songs on wax cylinders. In some cases, all his powers of persuasion were needed, as some viewed his 56 lb Ediphone as the work of the Devil. Up to a dozen cylinders could be recorded in the course of a single day, all of which he painstakingly transcribed in meticulous handwriting by night. He once estimated that he spoke to at least one thousand five hundred people. His detailed obituary in The Guardian concurred, noting that \\"His is the largest collection of Irish folklore ever compiled by one individual.\\" During the 1960s, he briefly guest lectured at Queen's University, Belfast, in the Celtic Department. With the dissolution of the Irish Folklore Commission in 1971, he joined the Department of Irish Folklore at University College, Dublin. In 1988, he received an honorary doctorate in Celtic literature from University College, Galway. The following year, he was made President of the Oireachtas, the Gaelic cultural festival held yearly in Glencolmcille, Donegal. In 1995, he was named Donegal Person of the Year. Publications Ó hEochaidh's published work included an edition of the autobiography of his father-in-law, Micí Mac Gabhann (1865–1948), published in 1959 as Rotha Mór an tSaoil. It won an Irish book award. It was in 1973 translated by Valentin Iremonger as The Hard Road to Klondike (1973). With Máire Mac Néill and Séamas Ó Catháin, he produced Síscéalta ó Thír Chonaill (\\"Fairy Legends From Donegal\\") in 1978. Personal life His wife, Anna Ní Gabhann, died in 1996. He was survived by his brother Tomás and sister Cáit.

The spectrum of archaeological remains relate the site to the Arabian Neolithic. The earliest samples of Ubaid style pottery in Saudi Arabia were found at Dosariyah. Ubaid- style pottery and stone tool  Location  The site is located about 12 km south of Jubail and 800 m inland from the present coastline of the Persian Gulf. Today it represents an approximately north-south orientated flat hill elevating about 2 m above the regular ground without a direct line of sight on the Persian Gulf. Southwards lies the Sabkha as-Summ. The surrounding area is dominated by dunes and spare vegetation. Discovery Grace Burkholder first discovered Dosariyah in 1968. Scattered all over the area she found great amounts of painted and unpainted pieces of pottery, stonetools made from Silex and Obsidian, Seashells, bones of mammals and fish as well as plaster. In the same year, Geoffrey Bibby dated the pottery to the Ubaid period and suggested further investigation on the site. In 1972 Abdullah H. Masry proofed at least 7 layers containing settlement debris to a depth of 2.50 m, separated by layers with only few finds. After these first excavations a massive fence was built around the site to protect it. Since 2010 a joint Saudi-German team from the Dammam Regional Museum and the University of Tübingen is re-excavating Dosariyah.  Dating  The range of findings as well as the stratigraphy date the main time of Dosariyah’s habitation to the Arabian Neolithic and the Ubaid period. Radiocarbon dates from shells verify this assumption, dating to the late 6th and the early 5th millennium BC. Except a single potsherd from the Islamic Period and modern debris found on the surface there are no indicators for later settlements at this site. The good preservation of organic material makes Dosariyah an excellent example for the investigation of the Neolithic on the Arabian Peninsula.  Pottery and Function of the Settlement  The findings of Dosariyah contain elements of the local Arabic Neolithic as well as influences from southern Mesopotamia. Especially the large amount of imported Ubaid style pottery from southern Mesopotamia suggests intense cultural contacts. About 25% of Dosariyah’s pottery is tempered with straw and minerals. This, therefore called “Coarseware”, is seen as a local pottery tradition. Ubaid style pottery is found at various sites along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf. Even though many of these sites contain only few Ubaid style sherds the great deal of imported pottery and obsidian at Dosariyah suggests its relevance within an extensive social and economic network. Several, up to 50 cm thick layers containing mostly shells of pearl oyster Pinctada radiata could be seen as evidence for pearling. If Dosariyah was a permanently inhabited settlement or a periodically used encampment established by herding nomads for trading, fishery etc. is object of the current investigations. Obsidian trade In Dosariyah, nine samples of Ubaid-associated obsidian were analyzed. They came from eastern and northeastern Anatolia, such as from Pasinler, Erzurum, as well as from Armenia. The obsidian was in the form of finished blade fragments.Lamya Khalidi, Bernard Gratuze, Gil Stein, Augusta Mcmahon, Salam Al-Quntar, et al..

Plot The story revolves around Simran who is a Canadian NRI working as a manager at a local cafeteria in Chandigarh. JB, Goldy, and Pinka Bhoond, are three of the four main characters who chase Simran all through the movie. All three of them are more interested in Canada than in Simran. Smeep on the other hand actually loves Simran from the deepness of his heart. He fell for her beauty since the time he saw her for the first time three years ago during Simran's hotel management course. Since then, he has lost track of her whereabouts, but he still keeps a greeting card that he had bought for her three years ago. Smeep and Goldy are roommates and live in Chandigarh as well. Goldy finds an ad in classified section of a Punjabi newspaper about a NRI Canadian girl looking for a suitable match. He immediately gets excited and leaves for her address which happens to be a restaurant. Goldy doesn't want to make it obvious for Simran about his intentions of marrying her for Canada. So he tries to be friends with her before proposing her. He is successful in becoming friends with her. On other hand, Smeep also finds the whereabouts of Simran with the help of 'Bhabhi' detective. He also reaches the same restaurant and is very happy to meet Simran after so long. Simran also seems very happy to see him. This leads to rivalry between Smeep and Goldy. A series of crazy events add to the humor of the movie. While they're busy trying to impress Simran, JB enters the scene. He is a middle-aged man and is very quickly successful in impressing Simran. He quickly becomes her friend. Goldy and Smeep try to bring his true colors in front of Simran, but are unsuccessful in front of JB's intelligence. They accept the fact that there are three players in the game. Pinka Bhoond enters the story right when Smeep and Goldy are discussing tactics to deal with JB. Pinka Bhoond in the disguise of a very rich businessman Rattan Singh Tata arrives in a chauffeur driven Mercedes. Simran happens to be his friend as well and they both get very insecure because of his money and power. Later, Smeep and Goldy are successful in bringing him to his real worth in front of Simran, but this doesn't help their cause of removing him from the race for Simran. Later, Smeep discovers from a stammering servant of Simran that she is marrying in Bathinda, disappointing all four of the men. Smeep leaves for his home in Bathinda to help deal with the pain. The other three guys meet in Bathinda as well in order to break the wedding. When the plan to call the wedding is in execution, they all discover that its Simran's aunt Harsimran who is marrying Jaspal Bhatti and not Simran. When Simran learns about this, she thinks that all four of them were involved in this plan. She is angered and breaks her friendship with all of them. Finally JB, Goldy and Pink accept their mistake and tell the facts to Simran. They tell her about true feelings of Smeep. Simran finds it very sweet and then tells Smeep that she also loves him. Harsimran and Jaspal Bhatti give their garlands to Smeep and Simran to make their love official. In the background, a lady from Vancouver is heard saying she'd like a son-in-law like Smeep.

Paratheria is an obsolete term for a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought to be related to them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to be related to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.  History  The term \\"Paratheria\\" was coined by British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in 1887 in a review of tooth development in mammals. He found that the \\"Edentata\\" were especially distinctive. In this group, he included the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, which are still placed together as Xenarthra, as well as the pangolins and the aardvark. According to Thomas, edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution. Consequently, he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals, for which terms had been introduced by Thomas Huxley: Eutheria (placentals) and Metatheria (marsupials). For this new grouping, he suggested the name Paratheria \\"to indicate their position by the side of, but separate from, the other Mammals\\" (the Greek παρά para means \\"beside\\"). Thomas had included one other mammal among the edentates, the aardvark; however, he was unable to provide a satisfactory scenario for the origin of its wholly unique dentition, which he could only compare with that of some fish. Thomas's arrangement was foreshadowed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville's 1839 classification; he placed edentates (except the sloth Bradypus, which he considered to be a primate) as a major division, the Maldentés (\\"poorly toothed\\"). This group was considered to be distinct from the other monodelphes (placentals), the Bien dentés (\\"well-toothed\\"). Similarly, Paul Gervais proposed in 1855 that edentates should be placed in a separate subclass of mammals. Thomas's hypothesis received little support, or even attention, in subsequent years. In 1893, Henry Fairfield Osborn remarked that new studies of edentate teeth indicated that they were not as distinct as Thomas thought. William Berryman Scott did, however, place Paratheria as a separate subclass in 1904, although he apparently did not follow Thomas's theories about the origins of edentate teeth. In 1910, William King Gregory reviewed the interrelationships of mammals and placed edentates among other placentals, though he gave \\"Paratheria\\" as an alternative name for his superorder Edentata, which included Xenarthra and tentatively Pholidota (pangolins), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), and the fossil Taeniodonta. In 1976, Eli Minkoff also used \\"Paratheria\\" for a placental superorder that included Edentata (for the sloths, armadillos, and anteaters) and Pholidota. The Paratheria hypothesis enjoyed a brief renaissance when unusual, high-crowned teeth began turning up in the Cretaceous and Paleocene fossil record of Argentina. In 1984, Sudamerica ameghinoi, from the Paleocene of Argentina, was assigned to Xenarthra within Paratheria, ranked as a cohort (a taxonomic rank between infraclass and superorder). Two years later, José Bonaparte named Gondwanatherium patagonicum from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina, which he thought to be related to Sudamerica, and tentatively assigned it to Paratheria, now ranked as an infraclass. Bonaparte described an additional related animal, Vucetichia gracilis, from the Argentinean Late Cretaceous in 1990; by then he classified it in the order Gondwanatheria, which was tentatively assigned to the infraclass Paratheria. Bonaparte argued against George Gaylord Simpson's 1931 view that xenarthrans derive from the Tertiary Palaeanodonta of North America, and instead suggested that xenarthrans, and perhaps pangolins, split from eutherians (placentals and their extinct relatives) as early as the Early Cretaceous and derived from some early \\"pantothere\\" (a now-abandoned grouping of early mammals, including dryolestoids among others). However, Bonaparte himself had abandoned the proposed relationship between xenarthrans and gondwanatherians by 1993. Instead, gondwanatherians were shown to be related to another Late Cretaceous Argentinean animal, Ferugliotherium (which turned out to be undistinguishable from Vucetichia), and through it to multituberculates. The relation between multituberculates and gondwanatheres later became controversial, but they are no longer thought to be related to xenarthrans. By 1996, \\"few if any systematists would ... doubt the eutherian affinities of xenarthrans\\" and molecular data have also supported the placement of Xenarthra within placentals as one of four major clades. The name \\"Paratheria\\" is no longer in use.

The identity was presented as a Syrian-American blogger, identifying herself as a lesbian on her weblog A Gay Girl in Damascus and blogging in support of increased civil and political freedom for Syrians. During the 2011 Syrian uprising, a posting on the blog purportedly by \\"Amina's\\" cousin claimed that Amina was abducted on June 6, 2011. This sparked a strong outcry from the LGBT community and was covered widely in mainstream media. In the wake of the reports, questions arose regarding the possibility that Arraf al Omari was an elaborate hoax. On June 7, 2011, author/blogger Liz Henry, Andy Carvin (a journalist with National Public Radio in Washington, D.C.) and others raised doubts about the identity of the blogger. The photos purported to be of her were proven to be a Croatian woman residing in Britain with no relation to Syria, the blog, or the ongoing protests in the country. On June 12, Ali Abunimah and Benjamin Doherty of the website The Electronic Intifada conducted an investigation that pointed to a strong possibility that the identity of Amina was MacMaster, an American living in Edinburgh. Hours later, Tom MacMaster posted on \\"Amina's\\" blog and took responsibility for the blog and the false reports of her capture. Creation and spread MacMaster created the character Amina Abdallah as a fictional persona or alias; MacMaster said in an interview with National Public Radio that he could not recall when he created the character. NPR stated that it found posts from Amina at the Yahoo! group \\"alternate-history\\" dating to February 2006. MacMaster said that he created the Amina character so he could more easily participate in discussions about the Middle East. MacMaster believed that if he used his real name, people would have presumed that he was too closely tied to the United States, but as Amina he would have more credibility. As Amina, MacMaster posted on various listservs and websites. MacMaster fleshed out the character's background, and he said that he began writing a novel based on the character. Eventually, he created various profiles for Amina at various social networking sites. Originally he used the character to discuss politics of the Middle East and science fiction. In the northern hemisphere fall of 2010, MacMaster moved Amina to Syria. MacMaster said that he was going to stop using the persona by then.

She had gained popularity after her blogging about the Syrian opposition movement in the face of the government's crackdown on protests. The media in Western countries first paid attention to the blog around May 2011. Her family was well-connected with relatives in the government and the Muslim Brotherhood, and being politically active was a \\"natural thing\\". However, she stated \\"Unfortunately, for most of my life being aware of Syrian politics means simply observing and only commenting privately.\\" Amina had been increasingly critical of the government in the months of the Syrian uprising. In April, Arraf told how her father confronted two security agents who came to arrest her, threatened to rape her, and accused her of being involved in a salafist plot. When unrest broke out, her character described the protests as if she were there. =Fictitious account of threats and hiding= One of Amina's close online friends, a real person named Sandra Bagaria (who later admitted that she never met Amina in person or virtually) explained on June 7 that Arraf had been hiding in \\"four or five different apartments in four or five different cities\\" across Syria since two young men appeared at her home in Damascus several weeks before. \\"Amina woke up in the middle of the night and saw her father outside talking to two young guys in their early 20s. I think they were there just following orders, they didn't know what they were doing\\" Bagaria said. The two men eventually left without arresting Arraf al Omari, but \\"Since that day, we agreed they might come back for her. It was only a matter of time.\\" In April, before fictionally going into hiding she wrote,\\"The Syria I always hoped was there, but was sleeping, has woken up ... I have to believe that, sooner or later, we will prevail.\\" In May 2011, Arraf wrote that she had gone into hiding after her father reported that men had come looking for her. Two weeks later, she blogged that she had been sent a fake message by someone posing as her partner, inviting her to a meeting at a hotel. She also suspected her email accounts had been hacked. In the weeks before her reported abduction, Amina had described traveling around Syria, sometimes in disguise and once riding inside a box on a truck, Bagaria said. At one point, Amina wore an Islamic head scarf and posed as her father's wife so that they could slip more easily through government checkpoints. \\"When she was traveling with her father, she was grabbed by a soldier who said 'What is a lovely young girl like you doing with an old man like him?'\\" Bagaria recalled being told. Although purportedly in hiding and under threats of arrest, the character of Amina continued to write her blog. Arraf's character wrote that she would not flee Syria, and that activists had to fight for a more open and free country. She also explained her approach to nonviolence.Mackey, Robert; Stack, Liam (June 7, 2011). \\"After Report of Disappearance, Questions About Syrian- American Blogger\\", The New York Times.

She was described as walking in the area of the Abbasid bus station near Fares al Khouri Street, on her way to meet a person involved with the Local Coordinating Committee, a real opposition planning group. On the blog, MacMaster posted as \\"Rania Ismail\\", Amina's fictional cousin, reporting the event: \\"Amina was seized by three men in their early 20s. According to the witness (who does not want her identity known), the men were armed ... Amina hit one of them and told the friend to go find her father. One of the men then put his hand over Amina's mouth and they hustled her into a red Dacia Logan with a window sticker of Basel Assad.\\" Basel is the brother of president Bashar al-Assad. Response to abduction The online response in the LGBT community, mainstream media, and social networking websites was rapid and extensive. Facebook pages were set up on June 6 calling for Arraf's release. The Free Amina Arraf Facebook page had already gathered over 10,000 members by the night of June 7;Free Amina Arraf support page at Facebook activists tweeted using the hashtag #FreeAmina. On Arraf's blog, MacMaster, writing as Amina's cousin \\"Ismail\\", wrote they did not know whether Arraf was in a jail or held elsewhere. Now Lebanon wrote that Arraf was one of the \\"ordinary, inspiring heroes of the Syrian revolution\\", known for \\"her fearless, blunt accounts of political turmoil in the country, and for her candidness about being gay\\". Journalist Andrew Belonsky wrote an article for Death and Taxes magazine, stating the \\"U.S. government should ... use its power and influence to call for Arraf's release ... Such a statement would of course prove that the U.S. remains committed to freeing citizens held overseas, just as we have in North Korea and Iran, but an official declaration would also send two indispensable messages: international governments must protect free speech, and democratic societies must respect LGBT equality.\\" The U.S. State Department stated on June 7, 2011 that it was looking into the issue. Hoax revealed In the wake of the kidnapping reports, questions were raised about the possibility that not only the kidnapping but Arraf al Omari were an elaborate ongoing hoax.

Lečić, who worked as an administrator at the Royal College of Physicians in London, was made aware of the issue by a friend. She appeared on the BBC's Newsnight to clarify that she had never known of the Syrian woman and that the usage of Lečić's personal images had been going on for some period of time. She stated that having her photograph circulated and associated with someone else — whether that person was real or not — was upsetting for her. =Admission= On June 12, The Electronic Intifada published evidence for its claims that Amina was the product of Tom MacMaster of Edinburgh, formerly of Atlanta, Georgia.\\"New evidence about Amina, the 'Gay Girl in Damascus' hoax\\", The Electronic Intifada.

Because of the political developments in Syria, people on the internet began to notice the blog. Attention increased after the blog character described her experience with the Syrian state internal police.

Post-revelation reception Monica Hesse of The Washington Post wrote that upon discovery of the hoax, bloggers, women, gays and lesbians, and Syrians were unhappy, since a blog that claimed to be one of them was written by an American heterosexual male. Hesse explained \\"If [MacMaster] had not been so emotionally resonant, so detailed, so seemingly 'real,' nobody would have cared so much when Amina disappeared, and nobody would have worked so hard to figure out what might have happened to her, and nobody would have learned that she was a pale man from Georgia.

He was the son of Sultan Badlishah and the brother of the late ruler, Sultan Abdul Halim. Tunku Abdul Malik served as Regent of Kedah from 1970 to 1975. Biography Tunku Abdul Malik was born on 24 September 1929 at Istana Anak Bukit, Anak Bukit, as the second son of Tunku Badlishah and Tunku Sofiah Tunku Mahmud to survive infancy. Tunku Badlishah was the seventh son of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim (also the father of Tunku Abdul Rahman, first Prime Minister of Malaysia). His father was appointed Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Kedah in 1935 and became sultan in 1943. He was educated at Titi Gajah Malay School and Sultan Abdul Hamid College, and attended Wadham College, Oxford. His elder brother, Tunku Abdul Halim succeeded to the throne in 1958 upon the death of their father. Tunku Abdul Malik became Regent of Kedah from 1970 to 1975 during Sultan Abdul Halim's first reign as Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Because Sultan Abdul Halim has no sons, Tunku Abdul Malik was designated as heir in 1981, and was invested as Raja Muda. Marriage Tunku Abdul Malik married Tengku Raudzah binti Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin (b. 1 September 1929 - d. 21 September 2015), the daughter of Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah of Selangor, on 16 July 1957 at Istana Bukit Kota, Alor Setar. After his appointment as Raja Muda in 1981, Tengku Raudzah became the Raja Puan Muda. They had been married for 58 years until Tengku Raudzah's death in September 2015. He outlived both his wife and his eldest sister, Tunku Hamidah (b. 1924, who died the same year at the age of 91) by two months. Death Tunku Abdul Malik died at 1:00 am, 29 November 2015, age of 86 at Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital, Alor Star due to old age. His body was laid to rest at Kedah Royal Mausoleum in Langgar.

Identified as a blues standard, it was inspired by earlier blues songs. \\"Early in the Morning\\" has been recorded by numerous musicians, including Junior Wells, who made it part of his repertoire. Origins Charlie Spand recorded \\"Soon This Morning\\" on June 6, 1929.Paramount Records 12760 The song features Spand's vocal and piano and opens: Spand subsequently recorded several versions of \\"Soon This Morning\\". Several other bluesmen also recorded renditions of the song, often varying the lyrics. Some early versions include Big Bill Broonzy as \\"At the Break of Day\\" (1934),Bluebird Records 5571 Walter Roland as \\"Early This Morning\\" (1934),Banner Records 33343 Jimmie Gordon as \\"Soon in the Morning\\" (1935),Decca Records 7099 Bill Gaither as \\"Bout the Break of Day\\" (1936),Decca 7404 as \\"Leroy's Buddy\\" Speckled Red as \\"Early in the Morning\\" (1938),Bluebird 8069 and Washboard Sam as \\"So Early in the Morning\\" (1939).Bluebird 8358 Leroy Carr recorded \\"Truthful Blues\\" on August 14, 1928,Vocalion 1232 10 months prior to Spand's recording. Although he performs the song at a slower tempo and uses different lyrics, it has elements similar to \\"Soon This Morning\\". Also singing in a piano blues style, Carr's recording opens: Both lyrical variations have been used frequently in subsequent recordings, but it is unknown if Carr's recording influenced Spand's. Sonny Boy Williamson I version John Lee \\"Sonny Boy\\" Williamson recorded \\"Early in the Morning\\" in 1937. The song is a medium-tempo twelve-bar blues that features Williamson's vocal and harmonica accompanied by Robert Lee McCoy (later known as Robert Nighthawk) and Henry Townsend on guitars. He incorporated his signature \\"call- and-response style of alternating vocal passages with pungent harmonica blasts\\" that became a fundamental of blues harmonica. Williamson's chorus uses lyrics similar to the earlier songs: Williamson's \\"Early in the Morning\\" (and the other early versions of the song) was released before blues songs were tracked by record industry trade magazines such as Billboard. When he re- recorded the song in 1945, it did not appear in the R&B; chart. Junior Wells versions Chicago blues harmonica player Junior Wells recorded several versions of \\"Early in the Morning\\" during his career. He first recorded it in 1954 for States Records (S-139), while he claimed he was AWOL from the U.S. Army. Titled \\"'Bout the Break of Day\\", Wells added several verses which have been used in subsequent versions of the song by other artists. Backing Wells on vocal and harmonica are Muddy Waters and Louis Myers on guitars, Otis Spann on piano, Willie Dixon on bass, and Fred Below on drums. In 1965, he recorded two versions of the song with Buddy Guy – a live recording at Pepper's Lounge in Chicago from It's My Life, Baby! (Vanguard) and a studio recording for the influential Hoodoo Man Blues album. Recordings by other artists Many artists have recorded their interpretations of \\"Early in the Morning\\", including Tampa Red (1951); Muddy Waters (1963) later released on One More Mile (1994); Charlie Musselwhite from Stand Back! Here Comes Charley Musselwhite's Southside Band (1967); and B.B. King with Van Morrison from B.B. King & Friends: 80 (2005). Eric Clapton recorded three versions of \\"Early in the Morning\\": a studio version from Backless (1978) and live versions from Crossroads 2: Live in the Seventies (1978, released 1996) and Just One Night (1980).

On February 23, 2017, a press conference was held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) formally announcing that a tip had been received that led to the arrest of Ryan Alexander Duke for Grinstead's murder and concealment.Tara Grinstead missing: Ex-student used hands to kill teacher in home, warrant says. CBS News / AP, February 24, 2017 On March 3, 2017, an additional arrest was made public in connection with Grinstead's disappearance when Duke's former classmate Bo Dukes (no familial relation) was charged with attempting to conceal a death, hindering apprehension and tampering with evidence.  Early life  A native of Hawkinsville, Georgia, Grinstead won the title of Miss Tifton in 1999 and competed in the Miss Georgia beauty pageant. Her winnings from this pageant and many others that she had entered helped her pay for college. Grinstead graduated from Middle Georgia College in Georgia and in 2003 earned a master's degree in education at Valdosta State University. In 1998, she began teaching history at Irwin County High School in Ocilla.  Disappearance  On October 21, 2005, the night before her disappearance, Grinstead visited a beauty pageant, for which she was a coach to young contestants, and attended a barbecue. On October 24, a Monday morning, she did not show up for work. Co- workers called police, who went to the home where she lived alone. They found Grinstead's cell phone inside the house and her car outside. Her purse and keys were gone. Local police immediately called in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), feeling that \\"something was wrong\\" and the case was beyond the resources of the small town police department. The GBI found no signs of forced entry and no sign of a struggle. Irwin County High School principal Bobby Conner was quoted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying, \\"We're a small community and this has really touched home because it is something you read about happening elsewhere. This is someone with a tremendous, magnetic personality, and the kids just love her.\\" Investigation In 2008, the Grinstead case received renewed attention with a report on the CBS News show 48 Hours Mystery, which noted the similarity of Grinstead's disappearance to that of another young woman, Jennifer Kesse, in Orlando, Florida, three months later. In connection with that 48 Hours story, police revealed that they had found DNA on a latex glove that was found in Grinstead's yard, \\"just a stone's throw from her front stoop\\", according to an interview with Gary Rothwell of the GBI: > Rothwell did not identify as a suspect the person whose DNA was found in the > glove, but he said that person could help lead to a break in the case. \\"We > believe it is a critical element to solving the case,\\" Rothwell said. > Rothwell said the DNA has been analyzed and agents know it's a man's DNA. > But they haven't identified the man. Over the course of the investigation, > he said, agents have compared the DNA to dozens of men who knew Grinstead or > who were associated with her. \\"None of them matched,\\" Rothwell said. The DNA > also has been entered into Georgia and national databases, but still no > matches.\\" In February 2009, videos surfaced on the Internet featuring a self-proclaimed serial killer. Dubbing himself the \\"Catch Me Killer\\", the man in the videos detailed what he claimed to be his sixteen female victims, and one of these women was determined by authorities to be Grinstead. Although the man's face and voice were digitally obscured, police eventually determined the videos' creator to be 27-year-old Andrew Haley. A police investigation revealed the videos to be part of a bizarre, elaborate hoax, and Haley was ultimately eliminated as a substantial lead in Grinstead's disappearance. In 2011, the chief GBI investigator said that \\"this case has never gone cold\\", adding that leads still come in on a weekly basis.Search reopens in disappearance of Tara Grinstead 41 NBC Retrieved June 19, 2015 Running from 2016-2017, the Up and Vanished podcast was credited by officials and media for helping shed new light on the evidence and reigniting public interest in the case. On February 23, 2017, the GBI announced that they had received a tip that led to the arrest of Ryan Alexander Duke for Grinstead's murder. About three years before Grinstead's disappearance, Duke had attended Irwin County High School, where Grinstead was employed as a teacher. According to warrants read in court, Duke burgled Grinstead's home, and when she caught him in the act, he strangled her and removed her body from the house. Another arrest, on March 3, 2017, was made public in connection with Grinstead's disappearance. Bo Dukes, a former classmate of Duke with no familial relation, was charged with attempting to conceal a death, hindering apprehension and tampering with evidence. Grinstead's sister, Anita Gattis, said that she has known Bo Dukes' family for years but never connected him with any part of her sister's disappearance. In August 2017, a grand jury filed four new charges against Dukes: two counts of making false statements, one count of hindering apprehension of a criminal and one count of concealing the death of another. These additional charges are based on a Wilcox County indictment stating that Dukes had lied to a GBI official who had questioned him in 2016 concerning the disappearance of Grinstead. After Ryan Duke and Bo Dukes were arrested, Irwin County judge Melanie Cross issued a gag order prohibiting anyone involved with the case from talking about it in order to protect Duke's right to a fair trial. Georgia television stations WMAZ and WXIA challenged the order in court, and Judge Cross relaxed the order but still \\"restricted public comment by anyone working with the prosecution or defense, court staff, and current and former police officers on the case.\\" WMAZ and WXIA again took this order to court and the case went to the Supreme Court of Georgia in October 2017. In March 2018, the gag order was tossed out in a unanimous opinion. The trial of Bo Dukes began on March 19, 2019. He was found guilty for his role in helping cover up the murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison on March 22, 2019. Ryan Duke's murder trial was set for April 1, 2019, but the Georgia Supreme Court delayed the murder trial on March 28, 2019 after Duke's lawyers contended that they were unconstitutionally denied funds for experts to testify on Duke's behalf.

The School offers graduate courses in literature, creative writing, the teaching of writing, and theater. Classes are held for six weeks each summer. The School awards two degrees. Each year, approximately 90 students earn a Master of Arts (M.A.) and 5 or fewer students earn a Master of Letters (M.Litt), for which an M.A. is a prerequisite. Each degree can be completed in four to five intensive summers spread over different campuses. The School was established in 1920 at the College's mountain campus in Ripton, Vermont near Bread Loaf Mountain and has since expanded to campuses at Lincoln College at the University of Oxford, St. John's College in New Mexico, and the University of North Carolina at Asheville. Around 80% of students are middle school and high school teachers. The student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1. Founding and history In 1915, the first of the Middlebury Language Schools was founded. As the German School and, subsequently, other Language Schools were founded, Middlebury decided to begin a similar school for the teaching of English literature. The Bread Loaf School of English was established in 1920. Poet Robert Frost was involved in the first half-century of the Bread Loaf School. He purchased a 150-acre farm in the immediate vicinity (now owned by Middlebury College and known as the Robert Frost Farm) and subsequently spent more than 40 summers lecturing at the School. Faculty and staff In addition to Robert Frost, prominent faculty and staff have included Carlos Baker, Harold Bloom, Catherine Drinker Bowen, Cleanth Brooks, John Ciardi, Donald Davidson, Bernard DeVoto, Elizabeth Drew, Charles Edward Eaton, Richard Ellmann, A.

Campuses =Bread Loaf Mountain campus= The School of English's central location is Middlebury College's mountain campus in Ripton, Vermont, east of Middlebury on a plateau within sight of Bread Loaf Mountain. Between 1860 and 1910, Joseph Battell acquired vast tracts of land and left to Middlebury College upon his death in 1915. The College sold nearly all property to form the core of the Green Mountain National Forest in the 1930s and 1950s, but retained the mountain campus and the rustic summer resort Battell developed. In addition to hosting the School of English and the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference, the mountain campus is home to Middlebury College's Rikert Ski Touring Center during the winter months. The campus consists of two-dozen clapboard buildings serving as dormitories, classrooms, and social space. An additional seven cottages are located within one mile of the main campus. The Bread Loaf Inn, which now acts as a dormitory and dining hall, was built in 1861 and subsequently expanded in the Second Empire style. The campus is known for its distinctive mustard-colored buildings dating from Battell's era; structures built since 1915 are painted white and generally of the Colonial revival- style. The campus hosts around 250 students every summer. =Other campuses= The Lincoln College, Oxford location was first used in 1978 and enrolls about 90 students each year; Bread Loaf School of English uses Lincoln College's facilities during the University of Oxford's long summer vacation. The New Mexico campus at St. John's College, Santa Fe, has enrolled 80 students every summer since 1991.

While at Camp Mangum the regimental officers were elected with Stephen Dodson Ramseur as colonel.Day p. 9 - p. 11 Campaign Actions After training, the unit was transferred to Richmond, Virginia, where they were placed in Major General Robert Ransom, Jr.'s brigade. While here they participated in the Seven Days Battles, with Col. Ramseur being wounded in the arm at the Battle of Malvern Hill. After his recovery he would be promoted to brigadier general and assigned elsewhere. LeRoy McAfee assumed command of the 49th NCT, being promoted to full colonel on 1, November 1862, and held that post until the army's surrender at Appomattox.Histories p. 127 The 49th fought under General Robert E. Lee as part of the Army of Northern Virginia throughout the Peninsula Campaign. They participated in the capture of Harper's Ferry, Virginia, and then were force marched to Sharpsburg, Maryland, for the Battle of Antietam. After their arrival in Sharpsburg the 49th was posted in reserve near Burnside's Bridge. After some time resting they were ordered to support the attack at the west woods. There they pushed the Union troops out of the woods until they were halted at the edge of the cornfield. They remained in this position, under almost constant artillery shelling, for the rest of the day and into the night.Histories p. 128 - p.129Ransom's Report Afterward the army fell back and took up position near Fredericksburg, Virginia. The 49th participated in the battle there being posted on Marye's Heights. Shortly after the battle General Ransom's Brigade was recalled to eastern North Carolina. The 49th served in the New Bern area and near the Chowan River in North Carolina with the purpose of protecting the Petersburg / Weldon / Wilmington railroad. During this time they fought frequent skirmishes with Union cavalry forces attempting to raid the railroad.Histories p. 129 - p. 130 Returning to Virginia, the unit participated in several battles as part of the Bermuda Hundred Campaign, eventually taking their place in the Petersburg line on the Confederate left just south of the James River. On 30 July 1864, the Union army exploded thousands of pounds of gunpowder they had placed into a mine dug under the Confederate position. Ransom's brigade was at this time being commanded by Colonel McAfee. The 49th was posted close by and was rushed to the crater to help hold off the assault by the Union troops. They took up a position on the left of the crater with their lines at an angle fronting the Confederate breastworks and the crater. They played a conspicuous part in repelling the assault and ensuring that the Army of Northern Virginia was not cut in half.Histories p. 141 - p. 143Day p. 81 - p. 85 It was during the fighting here that the unit's flag was captured by Union troops. This flag is now in the archives of the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, awaiting funding for restoration. After the Battle of the Crater it was determined by General Lee to attempt to break out of the siege. The 49 NCT was part of this attack and hit the Union line at Fort Stedman. The 49th was one of the units that made it into and occupied the fort until they were compelled to retreat to their own lines by the Union counterattack. On 9 April 1865, General Robert E. Lee ordered a retreat. During the retreat the 49th was surrounded, and many were captured or scattered at the Battle of Five Forks.

Carroll. The book was initially released on January 7, 2010 by Dutton. Background In the book, Carroll explores the nature of the arrow of time, that goes forward from the past to the future, and posits that the arrow owes its existence to conditions before the Big Bang. However, reasoning about what was there before the Big Bang has traditionally been dismissed as meaningless, for space and time are considered to be created exactly at the Big Bang. Carroll argues that \\"understanding the arrow of time is a matter of understanding the origin of the universe\\" and in his explanations relies on the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all systems in the Universe tend to become more and more disorganized (increase in entropy). The arrow of time is based on ideas that go back to Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist of the 1870s. Reception Manjit Kumar in his review for the Daily Telegraph called the book \\"a rewarding read\\" that was \\"not for the faint hearted\\". Writing for The A.V. Club, Donna Bowman commented, \\"Its appeal lies in Carroll's gift for leading readers through the train of thought that connects black holes, light cones, event horizons, Laplace's demon (or Maxwell’s), dark energy, and entropy with the question of time... Like all great teachers, he makes his subject irresistible, and makes his students feel smarter.\\" A reviewer of Kirkus Reviews added, \\"Not for the scientifically disinclined, but determined readers will come away with a rewarding grasp of a complex subject.\\" Andreas Albrecht, writing for Physics Today, gave the book a generally positive review, while noting that Carroll's attempts to provide material for both lay and expert readers might at times leave both dissatisfied. In his review for New Scientist, philosopher Craig Callender wrote that \\"Carroll seems slightly embarrassed by the many leaps of faith he asks of his reader\\" in explaining his hypothesis for the origin of the arrow of time. Eric Winsberg's evaluation of Carroll's proposal concluded by saying that its conceptual costs \\"seem high, and the benefits few.\\" References External links * Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:Popular physics books Category:Cosmology books Category:English-language books Category:Philosophy of time ","title":"From Eternity to Here"},{"id":"32013481","text":"Ácratas (meaning \\"Anarchists\\") is a 2000 Uruguayan documentary film. It was written and directed by Virginia Martínez, and premiered in Argentina in 2004. The film is about anarchism in Uruguay, and gives controversial insight into the minority and indigenous movement within the libertarian movement of the 1930s. It has received critical acclaim for its comprehensive documentation, and for the way its construction captivates the attention of the viewer, reinforcing the impact of the film. The film, long esteemed by cinephiles in Buenos Aires, also received recognition, winning First Prize for Documentary at the Festival del Cinema Latinoamericano di Trieste, and the second prize at the Festival \\"Contra el silencio todas las voces\\" of Mexico (both in 2000). Production This self-financed independent documentary is based on photography, period films, archival materials and testimonies of survivors, families, and historians; the narrative follows the \\"anarchists expropriators\\" in the Rio de la Plata, specifically in the first third of the twentieth century. It incorporates extensive research conducted in Ushuaia, Buenos Aires, Montevideo and Barcelona. The sources of such documentation, including the archive material and Sodre Caruso, are credited at the film's end. This was in part brought about by Osvaldo Bayer, anarchist historian, who has written about anarchists expropriators, Abel Paz, historian of the Spanish revolution, and incorporates recordings of Italian-Uruguayan intellectual Luce Fabbri. Plot The documentary covers two cities, Montevideo and Buenos Aires, primarily in the 1920s and 1930s, and the men of action who migrated in from Spain, Germany, Russia and elsewhere during this time. These romantic gunmen committed their acts, not for personal gain but to fight against a regime they perceived as oppressive and repressive. It focuses, in particular, on Miguel Arcángel Roscigna who was considered the most intelligent and reflective member of the \\"expropriating anarchist\\" movement, as he always had a detailed plan of action before attacking. Correctly or not, the film shows him participating in famous events, such as the assault on Messina Change in Montevideo or escaping the prison of Punta Carretas in 1931 where, 40 years later, the Tupamaro gas attack took place (today, it is a mall.) The film demonstrates how the media of the time printed or broadcast sensational stories about the group's activities, and dogged them. The documentary also shows how internal differences of opinion divided the group, and indeed many of his colleagues did not approve of Roscigna's peaceful activities.

It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a bottom-dwelling fish feeding on crustaceans, other invertebrates and fish. The females give birth to live young. Its lifestyle makes it vulnerable to trawling and other fishing methods, populations seem to be declining and it has disappeared from parts of its range. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"endangered\\". Description The common guitarfish can grow to a length of about , but a more normal length is about . The dorsal surface is khaki-brown and the underparts are white. It is very similar in appearance to the blackchin guitarfish (Rhinobatos cemiculus), which shares its distribution, but is generally smaller, has larger eyes, more widely separated rostral ridges, a longer front nasal lobe and a wider back nasal flap. Distribution The common guitarfish is found in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from the southern end of the Bay of Biscay to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea. It cruises slowly around just above the seabed, sometimes resting on the sand or mud and semi-covering itself with sediment. Ecology The common guitarfish is a benthic fish, cruising along just above the sandy or muddy seabed and foraging for crustaceans, other invertebrates and fish. It is an ovoviviparous fish with one or two litters of live young being born each year, each litter being four to ten fish. The gestation period is about four months, and the young develop inside the female, obtaining nourishment from their yolk sacs at first, and later from uterine secretions of their mother. Status The common guitarfish lives close to the coast and breeds in shallow water. This makes it vulnerable, and it is fished, primarily as bycatch, over much of its range. In the northern Mediterranean, catches used to be landed, along with the blackchin guitarfish (Rhinobatos cemiculus), at fishing ports such as Palermo, but both fish are now no longer seen there and have probably been extirpated from the area. It is no longer to be seen in the Balearic Islands either. Off the coasts of West Africa, it is caught as bycatch by international shrimp trawling vessels, and by cephalopod fisheries trawling the seabed, as well as being caught by local artisanal gill net fishermen. Its meat may be salted and exported and its fins sold to Asia. It may be safest in the southern Mediterranean where the fishing is less intensive and it is still sometimes landed, but even there, most of the fish landed are immature. For the fish to have a long-term future and the fisheries to be sustainable, the adult fish need to be allowed to mature and breed. There is no special conservation plan for this fish and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \\"endangered\\".

It was covertly installed in Encinitas, California by Patterson and his friend Bob Nichols, who posed as construction worker during the installation.Surfing Madonna mosaic draws mass following. Associated Press. BakersfieldNow.com. 07-06-2011.Surfing Madonna mosaic in Southern California draws mass following. Julie Watson. Associated Press. Oakland Tribune. 07-06-2011. The city declared that the artwork was to be considered graffiti because of the illegality of its installation. Patterson came forward to accept responsibility for it, and was fined $500 and ordered to pay approximately $6,000 for the art's removal. It was removed in 90 minutes, and Patterson was allowed to keep the art. The response to the installation was divided: while some members of the Catholic and Latino communities took issue with it, others felt that it symbolized their Mexican heritage. The art is now in place across the street from where it was originally installed. It inspired a 501c3 non profit founded by Mark Patterson and Bob Nichols called \\"Surfing Madonna Oceans Project\\". Since the inception of the non-profit in 2013 the Surfing Madonna Oceans Project has donated well over $100,000 to local ocean/beach/park and humanitarian programs. Installation and legality The piece was installed on a 10 foot- square concrete wall on a rail bridge in the city of Encinitas. Dressed as construction workers, Mark Patterson and longtime friend Bob Nichols installed the mosaic clandestinely in about two hours on the afternoon of April 22, 2011. It was covertly installed in Encinitas, California (on Earth Day/Good Friday). The mosaic features the Virgin of Guadalupe on a white surfboard, hands in an attitude of prayer, with her green cloak waving in the wind. The words \\"Save the Ocean\\" are displayed vertically to her left. As the piece was installed without prior permission, it was considered to be graffiti. $2,000 was spent by officials for an art consultant to review how best to remove it without destroying it. During that process, they discovered — underneath the glass — part of Mark Patterson's name. He soon came forward and admitted to being the mosaic's creator. Patterson was fined $500 by the city, and at the city's demand, paid approximately $6,000 to a local contractor to remove the mosaic from the train bridge wall. The mosaic came down in about 90 minutes, with minimal damage. The city allowed Patterson to reclaim the mosaic. Response While some members of the Catholic and Latino communities found it offensive, others identify with it as symbol of their Mexican heritage.Local Latinos, Catholics split on 'Surfing Madonna'. Ernesto Lopez. North County Times. The local Catholic priest was fond of the artwork, and even asked that a local church be able to display it. The state believed that the mosaic could violate the separation in the constitution between state and church. As a result, the state denied the request to put the Surfing Madonna at the entrance of Moonlight Beach State Park.Whitlock,Jared,\\"Surfing Madonna finds new home on Encinitas Boulevard\\", \\"The Coast News\\",October 16, 2013 Reinstallation For a period of time the mosaic was on display on an exterior wall at Cafe Ipe, next door to Surfy Surfy, in the neighborhood of Leucadia, north of its original location. The mosaic is now out of storage and back in public view. It has been reinstalled in Encinitas directly across the street from its original location now called Surfing Madonna Park at Leucadia Pizzeria, on the corner of Highway 101 and Encinitas Boulevard.

The ride is similar to the parks Shockwave ride in terms of how the riders are spun. At the base of the ride there are a number of fountains that (only during hot days) shoot up towards the riders as they are spinning and soak them. When the weather is cool, the fountains shoot up but go back down before the water hit the riders. Over the past couple of years, the ride cycle has been cut down and riders don't get as wet as they did in the past. Unlike the 'Topspins' made by Huss which feature one gondola (or row), Riptide features two gondolas. History When the ride first opened in August 2000, its name was Cliffhanger. It also had longer cycles meaning that riders got hit with the water more often than riders do today. In 2007, when Cedar Fair announced that they had purchased all the Paramount Parks in North America, the ride name was changed to what it is called today, Riptide. For reasons unknown, Cedar Fair cut down the ride cycle slightly, when they took over the park, meaning less passes through the water and less wetness for riders. Structure Water ejected from fountains at the bottom of the ride structure. Riptide is mainly made up of 4 parts. The first parts are the two supports that hold the entire ride up. The second parts are the two arms that hold and move the gondolas up and down in a circular rotation. The third parts are the tow gondolas. This is where the riders are seated for the ride. Each gondola holds a maximum of 20 riders meaning that the ride can operate with a maximum of 40 riders per cycle. The gondolas also spin freely on a circular rotation just like the arms that hold the gondolas. The fourth parts are the fountains. The fountains at the bottom of the ride can shoot as high as the ride itself and are a part of the ride to soak riders while riding (only during hot days). Ride experience Riptide in operation in August 2011 The following is what a rider can expect during the operation of the ride. There is no 'official' cycle for the ride, as operators can change the cycle and control the fountains as they please. *Riders may go through the fountain (and get wet) two or three times. *Riders will be spun around on the gondolas and (at some points of the ride) be rotated upside down (possibly into the fountains). *Riders should expect the operator to tease riders by raising the fountain just below the front gondola but as the gondolas get closer, the fountain may go back down. (This may or may not happen.) Some operators may perform a different cycle than the experience listed above. The experience listed above may not correspond to the operation of SOME cycles and the experience listed is what is most commonly used with the cycle of the ride.

Life  Ambrož is first mentioned in 1419 as pastor of the Holy Spirit Cathedral in the East Bohemian town of Hradec Králové (). Queen Sofia and her burgrave had him driven out of town, because he supported the Hussite cause. In the spring of 1420, Ambrož and Diviš Bořek of Miletínka mobilized a crowd on mount Oreb and lead the crowd to Prague, which was threatened by King Sigismund, scorching and burning the area they travelled through, and destroying the monastery of Münchengrätz, ostensibly in support of the rebels. In June the Orebites, as they called themselves, conquered Hradec Králové and Ambrož was reinstated in his parish. Under his leadership, the city turned into a center of the Hussite movement. Even Jan Zizka, the leader of the Hussites, came to Ambrož for advice about his conflicts with the Tábor. After Žižka's death, his remains were transferred to Hradec Králové and buried in the parish church. In 1433 Ambrož was appointed Archdeacon and Captain of Hradec Králové. As ambassador, he participated in the negotiations and participated in the negotiations in Basel that lead to the Compact of Prague. After Sigismund had been elected King of Bohemia, Ambrož continued to oppose him. In 1436, Sigismund deposed Ambrož as captain and attempted to replace him with someone more loyal, sending a new captain with forces to drive the insurgents out of Hradec Králové. However, Ambrož refused to relinquish his position, and he suffered heavy losses. He refused an offer to negotiate a surrender, and continued to fight the losing battle. In 1437, with his forces depleted, Ambrož was forced to flee. He was wounded and captured, but was released after only a brief captivity. He then travelled to Kolín, where he died two years later in 1439. Ambrož was a representative of the more moderate Hussites, who called themselves Orphans. He tolerated University Professors and he granted asylum after 1427, and protected the so-called Picards, whom he rescued from the stake. Adherence to the Catholic faith, however, he held to be a crime that should be punished by beheading.

Originally known as the Pius XII Provincial Seminary, it was founded in 1941 on top of Beehive Hill in the Brisbane suburb of Banyo, in a large Romanesque style building designed by Hennessy & Hennessy. The number of students peaked at 134 in 1967, but later gradually declined. In 2002, the seminary relocated to St Paschal's parish in Wavell Heights, and the building became the Brisbane campus of the Australian Catholic University. By 2007 vocations were increasing, and Holy Spirit Seminary was re-founded by the Queensland bishops. In 2008 the Seminary returned to the grounds of the former seminary at Banyo, and is co-located with the Australian Catholic University's McAuley campus. The seminary serves the Catholic province of Queensland, covering the Cairns, Rockhampton, Townsville and Toowoomba dioceses as well as the Brisbane archdiocese. Cardinal William Levada opened the new seminary campus following the completion of construction in May 2008 at a cost of $4.5 million. Preaching at the dedication of the chapel, Cardinal Levada said \\"convestitum Spiritu Sancto\\" (clothed with the Holy Spirit) was more than a motto for the seminary.Levada opens new Holy Spirit Seminary (2008) There were eight resident students including five Africans and a further three students in pastoral placements. The seminary Rector, Father Michael McCarthy and the Vice-rector Fr Ken Howell were present. In 2006 there were seven students for the whole of Queensland studying in the Seminary, including one man in his 60s. Fr. McCarthy said a \\"desperate shortage\\" of priests across Queensland had prompted the church to look further afield.Church turns to Africa for priests At that time the dioceses of Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and Toowoomba had no seminary students. \\"The church cannot operate without priests and the seminaries in Nigeria are extraordinarily dynamic, packed with 600 and 700 students,\\" Father McCarthy said. Originally designed for 16 seminarians, it was extended in 2010 to accommodate the 31 men in training at that time. In February 2012, six students entered the Seminary and in June 2012, eight more commenced: four for Brisbane, two for Townsville and two for Umuahia, Nigeria. In 2015 twenty students were studying there.

The parameters of the \\"challenge\\" by Nicholson to the NHS collectively add up to a demand by Nicholson for the NHS to find £20 billion in \\"efficiency savings\\" by 2015. The claim is that better ways of working rather than more spending must be found, amidst a warning that if the challenge were not met, either more money would be needed or fewer desirable results would be achieved. The Health and Social Care Bill 2011's provisions, which greatly alter the fundamentals of NHS functioning (not just financing), is technically not a part of this \\"challenge\\" at all, but is happening separately. The Nicholson challenge keeps NHS law and regulations as they have been prior to the Health And Social Care Bill's passage, but asks staff and administrators to find these \\"savings\\" within those present parameters nevertheless. Problems Doctors and nurses across the NHS already complained early in 2011 that front-line NHS services of many different types were having to be cut immediately, and very heavily, in order to achieve these \\"savings\\", despite Nicholson alleging that they would not have to be. NHS workers still insist, up to the present day, that it is impossible to find these types of 'savings' in this amount of time without having to make drastic cutbacks to existing services. Even a late-March 2012 news article dealing with the risk register of the Health and Social Care Bill 2011 found fit to mention a few lines about the Nicholson Challenge's £20bn target, mentioning that in the 2010-dated risk register, \\"Civil servants ... rate highly the danger that the £20bn savings may not materialise as managers lose focus and ... quality of patient care suffers\\", even though \\"Ministers [today in 2012 say] that a report to be published on Tuesday shows that the NHS is on course to meet the so called \\"Nicholson challenge\\" to save £20bn over the course of this parliament.\\" On 18 October 2011, the allegations by doctors and nurses of a direct and immediate decline in care as a result of the Nicholson Challenge was backed up by research when The Guardian published an exposé revealing how the Nicholson Challenge is \\"really affecting the young, old and infirm\\". The BBC released a 3 February 2012 article stating that twelve London hospital trusts were already \\"not financially viable\\" to withstand the pressures of current cost-saving measures plus the ultimate goals cited by the Nicholson Challenge. The article reports that those with knowledge of these trusts' financial performance allege that to remain viable the local total collection of 18 area hospital trusts alone would have to make a total of £1.2bn in efficiency savings by 2015 including £421m in nursing cuts. On 10 February 2012, The Independent reported that the NHS spent £195 million on redundancy payments in 2010/11 and expected to spend £616.6 million on these payments in 2011/12. It is estimated that between 9,100 and 16,800 staff will be made redundant; apparently, these costs are accounted for in the £20 billion savings target of the Nicholson Challenge. On 4 July 2012, The Guardian reported that the Institute for Fiscal Studies has been saying that the NHS will need to find \\"an extra £20bn a year by 2020\\" — a figure the IFS itself essentially admits is ironic given that the Nicholson Challenge's £20bn in 'savings' is meant to be completed by 5 years prior to that point, in 2015. The article states that the IFS reports that \\"England's NHS budget squeeze [from the Nicholson Challenge] is already the \\"tightest four-year period for the last 50 years\\". NHS spending will be essentially flat in real terms - at about £110bn a year - until 2015.\\" Because of these shifts and the long-term financial hardship the IFS is saying these circumstances will cause, the IFS suggests in its report that from 2015 through 2020 a solution the NHS might have to consider could include \\"...a mixture of charging, tax rises and perhaps even greater borrowing\\". If what the IFS alleges becomes actual government policy, then it will be thereafter be unclear how either the government or the NHS would be able to reconcile the instituting of monetary charges from patients with the first fundamental NHS pillar, in place since its founding in 1948, which insists unequivocally that the NHS must be, and must remain, \\"free at the point of use\\". Defending the challenge Defenders of the \\"challenge\\", such as James Ball of The Daily Telegraph, point out that health service finance directors had already been fully aware, since the summer of 2009, of the kind of constraints that would have to be dealt with because of the UK deficit crisis. Nicholson first signalled his challenge in June 2009 while the UK government was under the previous administration, that of Gordon Brown and the policy received the full support of the then Secretary of State Andy Burnham. In September 2012 the Guardian revealed a commercial sector report which, with significant irony, estimated that private companies can expect to benefit from £20 billion worth of income from the privatisation of health services resulting from the Health and Social Care Act 2012 See also *NHS Sustainability and transformation plans in England  References  Category:National Health Service (England) ","title":"Nicholson challenge"},{"id":"32013844","text":"The 1989 Japan Series was the Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) championship series for the 1989 season.

Schnitt was born in New York City and raised in Nanuet, New York and Virginia Beach, Virginia. He is a graduate of Frank W. Cox High School in Virginia Beach. He has worked in radio since he was 16 and used the stage name MJ Kelli in hosting shows at the Hampton Roads, New York City, and Tampa markets from 1986 to 2012. From 1994 to 2012, Schnitt was morning drive time host of The MJ Morning Show (known before 2001 as The MJ and BJ Morning Show) at Tampa top 40 station WFLZ and select other Clear Channel Communications stations. In 2001, Schnitt launched an afternoon talk program The Schnitt Show on Miami radio station WIOD. The Schnitt Show later expanded to other markets, including Tampa station WFLA in 2002. The show now airs live on WHNZ-AM from 3-6 p.m. Eastern and is rebroadcast on 970 WFLA (AM) from 6-9 p.m. Eastern. Early life and broadcast career beginnings Schnitt was born in Manhattan and grew up in Nanuet, New York.https://twitter.com/toddschnitt/statuses/210589068814327808 Schnitt has credited New York City station MusicRadio 77 WABC with his interest in radio broadcasting. As a young boy growing up in Nanuet, New York in the early 1970s, Schnitt became fascinated by WABC and listened as much as possible. In late 1976, Schnitt's family moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia. In 1982, at the age of 16, Schnitt landed his first part-time job at WCPK-AM 1600 in Chesapeake, Virginia. During his high school years he worked at numerous Hampton Roads, Virginia area stations including WVAB, WNIS and WNVZ (Z-104). Schnitt attended Ithaca College in New York and worked at the Cornell student- run station, WVBR. In 1986, he returned to the Hampton Roads area and scored his first full-time radio job at WRSR-FM (97Star), which soon reverted to the call letters WGH-FM. The name MJ Kelli was first used at WGH-FM. The name MJ was created because the 97Star program director was adamant that Todd Schnitt was not a good radio name. In 1988, Schnitt was recruited to leave WGH-FM (97 Star) and cross the street to Top 40 rival radio station WNVZ-FM (Z104) because Schnit's 6-10 p.m. Eastern nighttime show on WGH was the only show beating WNVZ in the nighttime ratings In 1989, after just a little over a year at WNVZ, Schnitt was hired by Scott Shannon at Pirate Radio, KQLZ in Los Angeles as creative director, assistant program director and morning show cast member. Schnitt later rejoined Shannon at the revamping of WPLJ, New York which had originally signed on as Mojo Radio in April, 1991. Schnitt left New York City in October 1992 to start The MJ Kelli Morning Show, his first morning-drive program (6-10 a.m.) on WOVV (Star 95.5), West Palm Beach, Florida. In February 1994, he was brought to Tampa, Florida to anchor the new morning show on WFLZ (The Power Pig). Schnitt was teamed up with BJ Harris, the Power Pig's program director to form the MJ and BJ Morning Show. Harris left the show on February 7, 2001. The show was renamed The MJ Morning Show. The MJ Morning Show Schnitt hosted The MJ Morning Show under his \\"MJ\\" personality. The show was broadcast Monday through Friday 6-10 am on flagship WFLZ/Tampa, FL and syndicated to KSLZ/St. Louis (Z107.7), WKSL/Jacksonville, FL and WFKS/Melbourne, FL (95.1 KISS-FM). The show focused on current events, lifestyle news, pop-culture and personal experiences. The program had been mostly a talk format but played about two songs per hour. Schnitt's Tampa-area rival was Bubba the Love Sponge Clem, morning host at rock stations WXTB and later WHPT. In March 2008, Schnitt sued Clem for defamation of him and his wife. A Jury found Clem \\"not guilty\\" on all counts. It was announced on January 19, 2012 that Todd Schnitt would be doing the last \\"MJ morning show\\" broadcast on February 17, 2012. He continued hosting his political talk show The Schnitt Show, which broadcasts afternoons. In October 2019, Schnitt teamed up with two former members of the show, Fester and Froggy, to launch an \\"MJ Morning Show Reunion Podcast.\\" He also started a podcast with Fark.com founder Drew Curtis called \\"Fark and Schnitt\\" in September 2019. The Schnitt Show The Schnitt Show is a conservative radio talk show that airs Monday through Friday from 3-6 p.m. Eastern. It is based from Tampa's 970 WFLA and 1250 WHNZ. Schnitt describes himself as a \\"fiercely independent conservative with libertarian influence.\\" The show consists of news, political commentary, lifestyle and pop-culture with sound bites and parody material. The Schnitt Show is syndicated by Compass Media Networks and is heard on nearly 60 stations across America. The program first launched on October 1, 2001 on WIOD in Miami. After Glenn Beck left WFLA, Schnitt took over the 3-6 p.m. slot on 970 WFLA in Tampa starting January 3, 2002. In 2013, The Schnitt Show was moved to sister station 1250 WHNZ as a side-effect of Sean Hannity's new deal with iHeartMedia requiring all his iHeartMedia owned-and-operated affiliates carry him live. WHNZ became the live flagship station of the program from 3-6 p.m. Eastern with a rebroadcast on 970 WFLA from 6-9 p.m. In 2017, Newsmax TV began airing the first hour of the program live from 3-4 p.m. Eastern. Viewers can tune in to watch Schnitt on AT&T; U-verse Ch. 1220, DirecTV Ch. 349, Verizon Fios Ch. 615, and Dish Network Ch. 216. Newsmax TV also streams its programming online.

Major Ormsby was killed leading a vigilante force against Paiute Indians in what was called the Pyramid Lake War. Early life William Ormsby was born in Greenville, Pennsylvania in 1814. His title of \\"Major\\" may reflect service in the state militia.Nevada Appeal With thousands of other men, Ormsby moved to California in 1849 during the California Gold Rush. His efforts at gold mining and horse sales in the West were mostly unsuccessful. He joined William Walker's filibustering expedition to Nicaragua and returned to California afterward. Nevada Undeterred by his earlier struggles, Ormsby moved to Genoa, Utah Territory (later Nevada) in 1857 as an agent for the Pioneer Stage Line. Ormsby and other supporters of the stage line favored western Utah Territory as the focal point of their overland stage route. Ormsby presided over a meeting in Genoa which selected Judge James Crane to go to Washington, D.C. in an effort to create a new territory, which they thought should be named \\"Sierra Nevada\\". Abraham Curry also shared the vision of a new territory and foresaw that Carson City in Eagle Valley would become the new territory's capital. Curry left a large tract of land in the center of the valley open for the possibility of a capitol building. Major Ormsby moved to Carson City and bought land to the southwest of Curry's proposed capitol site, where he constructed a hotel called the Ormsby House.Nevada Appeal part 2 His group did not succeed in 1859 in getting the federal government to designate a new territory. But, the discovery of the Comstock lode near Virginia City brought them new hope. Ormsby opened his hotel in 1860, in the wake of the Comstock Lode, as more settlers and prospectors rushed to the area. He also bought McMacklin's store and was appointed as a judge in a murder trial, indicating his stature in the town. Pyramid Lake War In 1860 Ormsby and his wife arranged for companions for their daughter Lizzie. He had become familiar with Tru-ki-zo or Truckee, a Paiute elder. Truckee brought his 13-year-old granddaughter, Sarah and her younger sister Elma Winnemucca to live at the Ormsby household. Sarah already knew some English and Spanish, and Elma some English. Sarah was learning to read and write English, and the three girls learned from one another. That year, two proprietors of Williams Station, an overland stage stop near present-day Silver Springs, kidnapped two Paiute girls and abused them. An angered group of Paiute warriors rode to Williams Station to rescue the girls, killing five white settlers and burning the station in the process. Word of the attack reached other miners and settlers, who wanted to retaliate.Pyramid Lake War, Online Nevada More than 100 vigilantes from Carson City, Virginia City, Genoa and Silver City assembled and chose Major Ormsby as their leader. Ormsby led this poorly trained and poorly armed force north from Williams Station along the Truckee River toward Pyramid Lake. The Piaute chief Numaga ambushed Ormsby on May 12, 1860 and defeated the vigilantes, killing 76 men and wounding another 29 at what came to be known as the first Battle of Pyramid Lake.Michno, p.74 Among the dead was Major Ormsby. He and other dead were first buried at the site. Ormsby's family later arranged transfer of his body and reinterment in Carson City's Pioneer Cemetery. In a third action, his remains were exhumed and his family arranged for his removal when they left the state.Major William Ormsby In June, Colonel John C.

It is bounded by the Grand Calumet River on the north, by Grant Street on the east, by Chase Street on the west, and by the Norfolk Southern railroad on the south. Adjacent areas include an industrial district to the north, Downtown West to the east, Tolleston to the south, and Brunswick to the west. As of 2000, Ambridge Mann had a population of 6,236, which was 96.3% African-American. Located just south of Interstate 90, the neighborhood can be seen while passing Buchanan Street. The neighborhood is home to Gary's only hospital, Methodist Northlake. Schools in Ambridge Mann include Vohr Elementary and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Academy, an alternative high school. A 7-acre city park, Ambridge Park, provides public access to the Grand Calumet waterfront. In May 2011, the Gary Board of Public Works and Safety announced it was moving forward with plans to construct a bicycle trail that would run along the Grand Calumet from Gary's western border to Ambridge Park. This is part of a larger Gary Green Link project, which will develop bicycle trails throughout the city. Ambridge Mann was formerly considered to comprise two distinct neighborhoods, Ambridge and Horace Mann, lying north and south of 5th Avenue respectively. Ambridge took its name from the American Bridge Works, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel located on the north bank of the Grand Calumet River; Horace Mann was named after a school in the neighborhood. The area was whites-only until the early 1970s, when the heavily Jewish community was replaced by middle-class African- Americans. Many former inhabitants of Ambridge Mann migrated to Miller Beach during this period. The neighborhood had a population of 8,920 in 1970. Ambridge Mann is traversed by the South Shore Line, and bisected by U.S. highways 12 and 20, which run along 4th and 5th Avenues. The Indiana Toll Road runs just north of the neighborhood, on the north bank of the Grand Calumet River, with an interchange at Grant Street in the neighborhood's northeastern corner. Buses of the Gary Public Transportation Corporation serve the neighborhood. The South Shore Line formerly stopped at Ambridge station, but service there ended in 1994. The housing stock is dominated by single-family homes, with a cluster of historic apartments along 5th Avenue; as of 2000, it had a 92% occupancy rate and 49% owner-occupancy rate. The neighborhood is chiefly residential, with a small pocket of commercial activity at the intersection of 5th and Bridge. The housing in Ambridge Mann was chiefly built in the first half of the twentieth century to house managers at the Gary Works. The neighborhood is home to a great number of prairie style and art deco homes. The Gary Masonic Temple is located in the neighborhood along with the Ambassador Apartment building. As of 2007, the neighborhood's home values were among Gary's highest, with a median of $70,145, second only to the lakefront neighborhood of Miller Beach. Famous people from Ambridge Mann include Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who grew up in a brick bungalow near the river on Arthur Street.

At the age of 17, Koback signed with the Pirates as a bonus baby out of Hartford Public High School. He made his MLB debut without ever playing in the minor leagues. At the time, he was the youngest Pittsburgh Pirates player ever. During his first career start, Koback caught a complete game shutout by Pirates pitcher Murry Dickson. Most of Koback's time with Pittsburgh was spent as a bullpen catcher. Over his three-year MLB career, Koback compiled a .121 batting average with one run scored, four hits, one triple and one base on balls in 16 games played. The majority of his playing career was spent in the minor leagues with the Lincoln Chiefs (1955, 1958), Williamsport Grays (1956), Hollywood Stars (1956–57), New Orleans Pelicans (1956–57), Columbus/Gastonia Pirates (1958) and Charleston Senators (1960). He batted and threw right-handed. During his career, he weighed and stood at . After retiring from baseball, Koback played pro–am golf in Connecticut. Early life Nicholas Nicholie \\"Nick\\" Koback was born on July 19, 1935 in Hartford, Connecticut to Nickolai Koback, who was a naturalized citizen of the United States originally from Russia. He worked at the Hartford Machine Screw Company. Nick Koback attended Hartford Public High School where he played baseball. During his sophomore season, his school's team won the Triangular League championship. In May 1952, Koback missed playing time for his high school team due to a broken finger. He also played guard on the school's basketball team. Koback graduated from Hartford Public High School in June 1953. Baseball career =Pittsburgh Pirates (1953–55)= On August 30, 1953, during a pinch hit at-bat, Koback hit his first career MLB triple, which would later prove to be his only career MLB extra-base hit, off Milwaukee Braves pitcher Johnny Antonelli (pictured). On July 9, 1953, after being scouted by Ed McCarrick, Koback was signed by the Major League Baseball (MLB) Pittsburgh Pirates out of high school. Koback received contract offers from the Boston Red Sox, Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago Cubs and New York Giants who wanted to start him out in the minor leagues, but he declined after Pittsburgh offered the most money. Koback later said in an interview with The Pittsburgh Press that \\"Money looks awful big to an 18-year-old\\". Koback was signed under the Bonus Rule which at the time stated that he had to be on the Pirates roster for two years. To fit Koback on the roster, Pirates general manager Branch Rickey released pitcher Bob Schultz. The official sum of his contract was not initially disclosed. However, his contract was later valued at US$20,000. Upon joining the Pittsburgh club, Koback went through a three- day training program with Pirates coaches. He made his MLB debut on July 29, without ever playing in the minor leagues, as a pinch hitter for catcher Mike Sandlock against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. In both of his at- bats he had over the night, Koback went hitless against St. Louis pitcher Harvey Haddix. Koback was the youngest Pittsburgh player ever at 18 years and 10 days old when he made his MLB debut. He got the first start of his career on July 31, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. During that game, Koback caught the entire game, which was a complete game shutout by Pirates pitcher Murry Dickson. Koback got his first MLB hit that game against Cubs pitcher Paul Minner. In his next game on August 1, against the Cubs, Koback got his first career sacrifice hit. In mid-August, Pirates manager Fred Haney stated that Koback \\"is a good receiver but he's only a kid\\". During the first game of a doubleheader against the Milwaukee Braves on August 30, Koback served as a pinch hitter for pitcher Roger Bowman when he got his first career MLB triple off pitcher Johnny Antonelli. Koback's final game of the season came on September 26, against the New York Giants at Forbes Field. In that game, he started as the catcher going hitless in three at-bats. Under the Bonus Rule, Koback was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates MLB roster for his first two seasons. After the 1953 season, Koback played amateur baseball on pitcher Spec Shea's traveling team. After returning to his home-town from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Kocack was asked if he felt any homesickness during the season, to which he replied, \\"Homesick? I was too busy and too excited to be homesick\\". While in Hartford for the off-season, Koback was the guest of honor at a Hartford Public High School sports rally. He gave a speech to local fire fighters, which was received positively according to The Hartford Courant. In mid-January 1954, the Pittsburgh Pirates held a workout for incoming rookies and younger players, in which Koback took part. The 1954 season would be the last year he would be protected by the Bonus Rule. Before the start of the season, United Press International stated that Koback and his teammate Vic Janowicz were a problem for the Pirates because \\"neither [were] ready for full-time duty\\". Koback made his season debut on July 11, as a pinch hitter for catcher Toby Atwell in a game against the New York Giants. Koback's second game of the season came on July 17, as a pinch hitter for catcher Jack Shepard in a game against the Chicago Cubs. On July 25, the Sunday Herald's sports editor Sam Cohen wrote a scathing critique of the Bonus Rule, which he stated \\"[the rule] we feel hampers rather than aids the costly prospects' development, because in practically every case, they see so little action\\". Cohen went on to use Koback as an example of how the rule is \\"detrimental\\" to the development of young players. During his third game on September 22, against the Philadelphia Phillies, Koback started as the catcher going hitless in three at-bats. On September 26, Koback made his final appearance of the season against the Brooklyn Dodgers, where in three at-bats he went hitless. In four games that season, he went hitless in 10 at-bats. Defensively, Koback played all of his four games as catcher. Of those four games, two were starts. He made 14 putouts. Koback got his first hit of the 1955 season off of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Joe Nuxhall (pictured). Koback re-signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates on January 15, 1955. He made his season debut on May 17, against the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. During his appearance, which was as a pinch hitter for pitcher Nellie King, Koback got one hit, a single, in one at-bat against Reds pitcher Joe Nuxhall. Koback recalled a conversation he had with then-rookie Roberto Clemente during the 1955 season, saying, \\"Sometimes [Clemente] would come out on the field and bullshit with me. He'd say, 'Hey you—strong guy!'\\" On June 5, Koback played both games of a doubleheader against Cincinnati. In the first game, he appeared as a defensive replacement as the catcher. In his only at-bat that game, which was against Reds pitcher Johnny Klippstein, Koback flied out. Koback started the second game of the doubleheader. During his second at-bat of the game, Koback hit a single off Reds pitcher Jackie Collum, which would later prove to be the last hit of Koback's MLB career. Koback's fourth appearance of the season came on June 19, against the Cincinnati Reds. During that game, he served as a pinch- hitter for pitcher Dick Littlefield in the seventh inning. Koback's final MLB appearance came on July 4, against the New York Giants. In that game, he served as a pinch hitter for pitcher Lino Donoso and struck-out in one at-bat. Over his career with the Pirates, Koback primarily served as a bullpen catcher. In his five games that season, he batted .286 with two hits in seven at-bats. Behind the plate, Koback made no errors, one assist and four putouts. =Later career (1955–1960)= On July 12, 1955, the Pittsburgh Pirates sold Koback to the minor league Lincoln Chiefs of the Class-A Western League. The Chiefs, who represented Lincoln, Nebraska, were managed by former St. Louis Browns and Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Bill Burwell. His teammates featured past and future MLB players Bill Bell, Joe Christopher, Bennie Daniels, Dick Hall, Cholly Naranjo, Earl Smith, Jim Waugh and George Witt. With the Lincoln club that season, Koback batted .223 with 23 hits, five doubles and two triples in 38 games played. In November 1955, Koback was assigned to the minor league Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, which was to be under an open classification in 1956. His manager with the Stars was long-time minor league player and manager Clay Hopper. Most of Koback's teammates on the Stars had major league experience one time or another over their careers. He played with Hollywood during their season opener on April 10, 1956. With the Starts that season, Koback batted .176 with three hits and three runs batted in (RBIs) in 10 games played. Defensively, Koback had a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage in 42 total chances. In early-May, Koback was farmed out to the minor league New Orleans Pelicans of the Double-A Southern Association. In five games played with the Pelicans under the management of Andy Cohen, Koback accumulated one hit. Later in May, he was again sent to another team, this time it was the Williamsport Grays of the Class-A Eastern League. The manager of Williamsport was Jack Fitzpatrick, a long-time minor league player and manager. With the Grays that season, Koback batted .313 with 62 hits, 16 doubles and two home runs in 68 games played. Del Wilber (pictured) served as Koback's manager during his final professional baseball season in 1960. In October 1956, Koback joined the Venados de Mazatlán of the Mexican Pacific League. On March 1, 1957, Koback played a charity game as a member of the Hartford, Connecticut Young Democrats against the Hartford Young Republicans. Koback began the 1957 season with the Hollywood Stars. Koback batted .167 with five hits, one of which was a double, in 11 games played. In the field, he had a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage in 52 total chances. In May, Koback was farmed out to the Mobile Bears of the Double-A Southern Association. He later joined the New Orleans Pelicans, also of the Southern Association. Koback batted .230 with 28 hits, six of which were doubles, in 41 games played. Before the start of the 1958 season, Koback joined the minor league Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League. However, before the start of the regular season, Koback broke his finger. By May, Koback was played for the minor league Lincoln Chiefs of the Class-A Western League. Monty Basgall, a former MLB player, was Koback's manager that season. On the season, he batted .240 with 54 hits, four doubles, four triples and three home runs in 68 games played. After the 1958 season, Koback enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard and took up primary residence in that state. He spent the entire 1959 season with the minor league Pirates who represented Columbus, Georgia and Gastonia, North Carolina. The Pirates, who were members of the Class-A South Atlantic League, were managed by former MLB pitcher Ray Hathaway. On the season, Koback batted .226 with 18 runs scored, 30 hits, six doubles, two triples, three home runs and 30 RBIs in 50 games played. Defensively, he made four errors, had 21 assists and 188 putouts. In April, Koback was traded by the Salt Lake City Bees, who still owned his contract, to the minor league Charleston Senators in exchange for outfielder Chick King. The Senators, who were members of the Triple-A American Association, were managed by Del Wilber, a former MLB player. Koback played five games with the Senators that season. In those games, he went hitless in four at-bats. That season would later prove to be his final in professional baseball. Later life After his baseball career was over, Koback took up golf. In 1965, he began to work as a golf instructor at Goodwin Park in Hartford, Connecticut. Koback participated in the Keney Park Invitation in May 1966. He served as the assistant to Harry Nettelblatt at the Golf Club of Avon. Koback won a pro–am tournament at Cliffside Country Club in Hartford, Connecticut in June 1969. In 1970, Koback was named the assistant to Bud Cordone at the Pequot Golf Club.

Gameplay Cars 2 features most of the characters from its film counterpart, with additional characters from both movies available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 via downloadable content. In Cars 2, a third-person racing game, players have a choice of 25 different characters and train to become world-class spies. As part of training, players participate in missions using high-tech gadgets, for example, to avoid enemies or slow them down. The game has three types of trophies: bronze, silver and gold. Points are awarded at different values depending on what type of vehicle class players use. The game characters are divided into three weight-classes: heavy, medium and light. Players can unlock new cars, tracks and missions by collecting emblems. Drop-in/drop-out multiplayer modes support up to four players simultaneously. Synopsis Based on Pixar's computer animated film, Cars 2: The Video Game follows the exploits of car characters Lightning McQueen and Mater as they train in a secret facility known as CHROME, short for Command Headquarters for Recon Operations and Motorized Espionage. They are joined by British Intelligence agents Finn McMissile and Holley Shiftwell as they attempt to become the car-equivalent of spies. Several characters from the Cars 2 film appear, with additional characters from the first film and Cars Toons animated shorts available as downloadable content. Development Cars 2 was unveiled during E3 2011. A playable demo was presented in a Cars- styled booth. The game was first shown to the public at E3 2011. It was also unveiled at the American International Toy Fair in New York City.IGN Staff. According to a video interview on Game Line, John Day, the producer of the game, said they wanted to create a good family racing game and add a few things that perhaps no one has seen before. Avalanche Software was working in close collaboration with Pixar artists to bring the humor and personality of the feature film to life. Reception Cars 2 received mixed reviews from critics, with a score of 72 and 74 on Metacritic for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions respectively. IGN gave the game an 8 out of 10 rating, stating that \\"Cars 2 is a great multiplayer game that rivals Mario Kart.\\" The Official Xbox Magazine gave it a 7.5 out of 10 rating, praising fun and polished racing but criticizing the fact that online play was missing from the title. Game Informer gave the title a 7.75 out of 10 rating, calling it a satisfying racing experience. GameSpot Justin Calvert gave it a 7.5 out of 10 rating, praising its career mode and track designs. He was, however, upset that there was no online mode as expected and also no free roam unlike its predecessors.

Griffiths, is a correlation inequality for ferromagnetic spin systems. Informally, it says that in ferromagnetic spin systems, if the 'a-priori distribution' of the spin is invariant under spin flipping, the correlation of any monomial of the spins is non-negative; and the two point correlation of two monomial of the spins is non-negative. The inequality was proved by Griffiths for Ising ferromagnets with two-body interactions, then generalised by Kelly and Sherman to interactions involving an arbitrary number of spins, and then by Griffiths to systems with arbitrary spins. A more general formulation was given by Ginibre, and is now called the Ginibre inequality. Definitions Let \\\\textstyle \\\\sigma=\\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma_j\\\\\\\\}_{j \\\\in \\\\Lambda} be a configuration of (continuous or discrete) spins on a lattice Λ. If A ⊂ Λ is a list of lattice sites, possibly with duplicates, let \\\\textstyle \\\\sigma_A = \\\\prod_{j \\\\in A} \\\\sigma_j be the product of the spins in A. Assign an a-priori measure dμ(σ) on the spins; let H be an energy functional of the form :H(\\\\sigma)=-\\\\sum_{A} J_A \\\\sigma_A ~, where the sum is over lists of sites A, and let : Z=\\\\int d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma) e^{-H(\\\\sigma)} be the partition function. As usual, : \\\\langle \\\\cdot \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{Z} \\\\sum_\\\\sigma \\\\cdot(\\\\sigma) e^{-H(\\\\sigma)} stands for the ensemble average. The system is called ferromagnetic if, for any list of sites A, JA ≥ 0. The system is called invariant under spin flipping if, for any j in Λ, the measure μ is preserved under the sign flipping map σ → τ, where : \\\\tau_k = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\sigma_k, &k; eq j, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\- \\\\sigma_k, &k; = j. \\\\end{cases} Statement of inequalities =First Griffiths inequality= In a ferromagnetic spin system which is invariant under spin flipping, : \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\rangle \\\\geq 0 for any list of spins A. =Second Griffiths inequality= In a ferromagnetic spin system which is invariant under spin flipping, : \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\sigma_B\\\\rangle \\\\geq \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\sigma_B\\\\rangle for any lists of spins A and B. The first inequality is a special case of the second one, corresponding to B = ∅. Proof Observe that the partition function is non-negative by definition. Proof of first inequality: Expand : e^{-H(\\\\sigma)} = \\\\prod_{B} \\\\sum_{k \\\\geq 0} \\\\frac{J_B^k \\\\sigma_B^k}{k!} = \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{k_C\\\\\\\\}_C} \\\\prod_B \\\\frac{J_B^{k_B} \\\\sigma_B^{k_B}}{k_B!}~, then :\\\\begin{align}Z \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A \\\\rangle &= \\\\int d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma) \\\\sigma_A e^{-H(\\\\sigma)} = \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{k_C\\\\\\\\}_C} \\\\prod_B \\\\frac{J_B^{k_B}}{k_B!} \\\\int d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma) \\\\sigma_A \\\\sigma_B^{k_B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{k_C\\\\\\\\}_C} \\\\prod_B \\\\frac{J_B^{k_B}}{k_B!} \\\\int d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma) \\\\prod_{j \\\\in \\\\Lambda} \\\\sigma_j^{n_A(j) + n_B(j)}~,\\\\end{align} where nA(j) stands for the number of times that j appears in A. Now, by invariance under spin flipping, :\\\\int d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma) \\\\prod_j \\\\sigma_j^{n(j)} = 0 if at least one n(j) is odd, and the same expression is obviously non-negative for even values of n. Therefore, Z<σA>≥0, hence also <σA>≥0. Proof of second inequality. For the second Griffiths inequality, double the random variable, i.e. consider a second copy of the spin, \\\\sigma', with the same distribution of \\\\sigma. Then : \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\sigma_B\\\\rangle- \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\sigma_B\\\\rangle= \\\\langle\\\\langle\\\\sigma_A(\\\\sigma_B-\\\\sigma'_B)\\\\rangle\\\\rangle~. Introduce the new variables : \\\\sigma_j=\\\\tau_j+\\\\tau_j'~, \\\\qquad \\\\sigma'_j=\\\\tau_j-\\\\tau_j'~. The doubled system \\\\langle\\\\langle\\\\;\\\\cdot\\\\;\\\\rangle\\\\rangle is ferromagnetic in \\\\tau, \\\\tau' because -H(\\\\sigma)-H(\\\\sigma') is a polynomial in \\\\tau, \\\\tau' with positive coefficients :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_A J_A (\\\\sigma_A+\\\\sigma'_A) &= \\\\sum_A J_A\\\\sum_{X\\\\subset A} \\\\left[1+(-1)^{X}\\\\right] \\\\tau_{A \\\\setminus X} \\\\tau'_X \\\\end{align} Besides the measure on \\\\tau,\\\\tau' is invariant under spin flipping because d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma)d\\\\mu(\\\\sigma') is. Finally the monomials \\\\sigma_A, \\\\sigma_B-\\\\sigma'_B are polynomials in \\\\tau,\\\\tau' with positive coefficients :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_A &= \\\\sum_{X \\\\subset A} \\\\tau_{A \\\\setminus X} \\\\tau'_{X}~, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_B-\\\\sigma'_B &= \\\\sum_{X\\\\subset B} \\\\left[1-(-1)^{X}\\\\right] \\\\tau_{B \\\\setminus X} \\\\tau'_X~. \\\\end{align} The first Griffiths inequality applied to \\\\langle\\\\langle\\\\sigma_A(\\\\sigma_B-\\\\sigma'_B)\\\\rangle\\\\rangle gives the result. More details are in and . Extension: Ginibre inequality The Ginibre inequality is an extension, found by Jean Ginibre, of the Griffiths inequality. =Formulation= Let (Γ, μ) be a probability space. For functions f, h on Γ, denote : \\\\langle f \\\\rangle_h = \\\\int f(x) e^{-h(x)} \\\\, d\\\\mu(x) \\\\Big/ \\\\int e^{-h(x)} \\\\, d\\\\mu(x). Let A be a set of real functions on Γ such that. for every f1,f2,...,fn in A, and for any choice of signs ±, : \\\\iint d\\\\mu(x) \\\\, d\\\\mu(y) \\\\prod_{j=1}^n (f_j(x) \\\\pm f_j(y)) \\\\geq 0. Then, for any f,g,−h in the convex cone generated by A, : \\\\langle fg\\\\rangle_h - \\\\langle f \\\\rangle_h \\\\langle g \\\\rangle_h \\\\geq 0. =Proof= Let : Z_h = \\\\int e^{-h(x)} \\\\, d\\\\mu(x). Then : \\\\begin{align} &Z;_h^2 \\\\left( \\\\langle fg\\\\rangle_h - \\\\langle f \\\\rangle_h \\\\langle g \\\\rangle_h \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad= \\\\iint d\\\\mu(x) \\\\, d\\\\mu(y) f(x) (g(x) - g(y)) e^{-h(x)-h(y)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\iint d\\\\mu(x) \\\\, d\\\\mu(y) f(x) (g(x) - g(y)) \\\\frac{(-h(x)-h(y))^k}{k!}. \\\\end{align} Now the inequality follows from the assumption and from the identity : f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} (f(x)+f(y)) + \\\\frac{1}{2} (f(x)-f(y)). =Examples= * To recover the (second) Griffiths inequality, take Γ = {−1, +1}Λ, where Λ is a lattice, and let μ be a measure on Γ that is invariant under sign flipping. The cone A of polynomials with positive coefficients satisfies the assumptions of the Ginibre inequality. * (Γ, μ) is a commutative compact group with the Haar measure, A is the cone of real positive definite functions on Γ. * Γ is a totally ordered set, A is the cone of real positive non-decreasing functions on Γ. This yields Chebyshev's sum inequality. For extension to partially ordered sets, see FKG inequality. Applications * The thermodynamic limit of the correlations of the ferromagnetic Ising model (with non-negative external field h and free boundary conditions) exists. :This is because increasing the volume is the same as switching on new couplings JB for a certain subset B. By the second Griffiths inequality ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial J_B}\\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\rangle= \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\sigma_B\\\\rangle- \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\sigma_B\\\\rangle\\\\geq 0 :Hence \\\\langle \\\\sigma_A\\\\rangle is monotonically increasing with the volume; then it converges since it is bounded by 1. * The one-dimensional, ferromagnetic Ising model with interactions J_{x,y}\\\\sim x-y^{-\\\\alpha} displays a phase transition if 1<\\\\alpha <2 . :This property can be shown in a hierarchical approximation, that differs from the full model by the absence of some interactions: arguing as above with the second Griffiths inequality, the results carries over the full model. *The Ginibre inequality provides the existence of the thermodynamic limit for the free energy and spin correlations for the two-dimensional classical XY model. Besides, through Ginibre inequality, Kunz and Pfister proved the presence of a phase transition for the ferromagnetic XY model with interaction J_{x,y}\\\\sim x-y^{-\\\\alpha} if 2<\\\\alpha < 4 . * Aizenman and Simon used the Ginibre inequality to prove that the two point spin correlation of the ferromagnetic classical XY model in dimension D, coupling J>0 and inverse temperature \\\\beta is dominated by (i.e. has upper bound given by) the two point correlation of the ferromagnetic Ising model in dimension D, coupling J>0, and inverse temperature \\\\beta/2 ::\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{s}_i\\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{s}_j\\\\rangle_{J,2\\\\beta} \\\\le \\\\langle \\\\sigma_i\\\\sigma_j\\\\rangle_{J,\\\\beta} :Hence the critical \\\\beta of the XY model cannot be smaller than the double of the critical temperature of the Ising model :: \\\\beta_c^{XY}\\\\ge 2\\\\beta_c^{\\\\rm Is}~; :in dimension D = 2 and coupling J = 1, this gives :: \\\\beta_c^{XY} \\\\ge \\\\ln(1 + \\\\sqrt{2}) \\\\approx 0.88~. * There exists a version of the Ginibre inequality for the Coulomb gas that implies the existence of thermodynamic limit of correlations. * Other applications (phase transitions in spin systems, XY model, XYZ quantum chain) are reviewed in.

Lebanon had initially requested a twelve-month extension until January 31, 2007, but Council members later agreed a six-month extension. Resolution =Observations= The Security Council recalled the Secretary-General Kofi Annan's conclusion that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon as of June 16, 2000, in accordance with Resolution 425. It emphasised the temporary nature of the UNIFIL operation and urged respect for the Blue Line which was valid for confirming Israel's withdrawal. There was concern at tensions along the Blue Line, including hostilities initiated by Hezbollah and the firing of rockets into Israel from Lebanon, as well as violations of Lebanese airspace by Israel. =Acts= The Lebanese government was called upon to do more to reassert its authority in southern Lebanon through the deployment of Lebanese forces and co-operation with UNIFIL and the Secretary-General. The parties were urged to ensure UNIFIL's full freedom of movement and to ensure its safety. Both Israel and Lebanon were called upon to fulfill commitments to respect the withdrawal line identified by the United Nations and all air, sea and land violations of the line were condemned, making reference to acts carried out from the Lebanese side. The resolution supported efforts by UNIFIL to monitor violations of the withdrawal line and efforts in demining, encouraging the need for additional maps to be provided of the location of land mines. The Secretary-General was requested to continue consultations with the Lebanese government and troop- contributing countries concerning the implementation of the current resolution. It further directed him to report on the activities of UNIFIL and on tasks conducted by the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO). The mandate and structure of UNIFIL was to be kept under constant review. Finally, the resolution concluded by stressing the importance of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East based on relevant Security Council resolutions including 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).

It closed in 2010 after operating for 45 years, but reopened for ski operations in March 2018. History The first trails at the mountain were cut in 1959, and until 1964 operated only T-bar lifts. In 1964, the area constructed a new Stadeli double chair, which made Tenney Mountain the largest ski area in the region. This lift was dubbed the \\"Hornet Double,\\" and began operation on January 10, 1965, along with five new trails that it serviced. In 1970, a second double chair was constructed, built by Heron-Poma. This lift was replaced in 1987 by a Borvig triple chair, called the \\"Eclipse.\\" This was planned to be followed by a second triple, extending from mid- mountain to a higher summit than the Hornet Double served. Due to a weak real estate market during this time, however, the lift was never constructed, although trails were cut. Tenney was purchased shortly after by Bill Krikorian, who renamed the area \\"Lookout\\". It was later closed for part of the 1990s, and subsequently reopened under the name of Tenney Mountain. In 2002, the ski area was purchased once again; the new owners announced a $1 million investment in a new snowmaking system, called SnowMagic. The system was designed to enable snowmaking operations, and in consequence the ski area, to continue year-round, but revenue didn't cover the cost and in 2004 year-round snowmaking operations were shut down. The area did not open for the 2010/2011 ski season due to financial issues including $200,000 in unpaid taxes. On December 15, 2010, Tenney was sold to Iroquois Capital, an investment firm from New York City. The purchasing price was $500,000, and Iroquois also bought of land near the ski area. According to Mitch Kulick, Iroquois' general counsel, up to six entities were interested in buying the area and potentially reopening it for the 2011/2012 ski season. = Tenney Mountain Development Group = On October 17, 2014, a company named Tenney Mountain Development Group (TMDG), headed by Michael L. Bouchard, was registered in Windham, New Hampshire. Two months later, TMDG purchased the area for 1.25 million dollars. In February 2015 it was reported that the construction company working with TMDG had \\"presented plans\\" to the town of Plymouth, and that both of the chairlifts had been run recently. In March, TMDG launched a Facebook page, with hints on what was planned for the resort. Later posts on their Facebook page showed that the reopening of Tenney Mountain was moving forward, including chairlift inspections and snow surveys. = Attempted 2015-2016 season reopening = In early 2015, TMDG started clearing five years of brush growth on the mountain's trails. The lodge was renovated, including a new roof, kitchen and bathrooms. Daily posts outlined the progress at the resort, such as the retrofitting of chairlifts and snowmaking system repairs. Three grooming machines were purchased from Piston Bully, as well as HKD snowmaking equipment. Amenities for the first season were expected to be limited, with no rentals or season passes and minimal trail lighting. They originally planned to open on December 15, 2015, but were unable due to poor winter conditions. Faced with the same problems as many other New England ski resorts, Tenney was unable to open during the season. When the resort shut down in 2009, the owners simply walked away, leaving the infrastructure to decay. They left the snowmaking system full of water, causing the pipes to shatter and split during the following winters. Food was left to rot in the kitchen, and roads on the mountain were not maintained, allowing for erosion to wash away access roads. Also, most of the copper piping in the pump house was ripped out and stolen at some point during the five-year closure period. On the evening of January 5, 2016, Tenney Mountain started making snow for the first time in six years, using four SMI fan guns borrowed from a ski area in New York. Installation of the HKD snowmaking equipment purchased in the summer of 2015 was postponed until after the 2015-16 season. = 2016-2017 = During the numerous warm spells during the late winter, and into the early summer, Tenney Mountain worked on repairing and upgrading the Hornet double chairlift, hoping to have it inspected in June. On June 13, 2016, the Hornet was inspected and tested by the state and passed. Throughout the summer and into the fall, the resort worked to locate and repair bursts and breaks in the snowmaking loops caused by freezing water.

Brittany, an independent Celtic duchy, had a traditional rivalry with neighboring Normandy. Neighboring Rivals From a historical perspective, the Bretons had steadily lost lands to the Norman's ancestors, the Seine River Vikings. The 1064–1065 animosity between Brittany and Normandy was sparked after William the Conqueror, as Duke of Normandy, supported a Breton, Rivallon I of Dol's rebellion against the hereditary Duke of Brittany, Conan II.\\"Brittany Genealogy\\" In 1065, the year before his invasion of Anglo-Saxon England, William of Normandy sent word to the surrounding countries (including Brittany), warning them against attacking his lands, while he was away on the grounds that his mission bore the papal banner. However, Duke Conan promptly informed the Norman Duke that he would take the opportunity to invade the latter's Duchy. =Loss of Breton lands= Duke William's army therefore set out to appease the Breton threat. While outside the monastery of Mont Saint-Michel, two Norman soldiers became mired in quicksand, and Harold Godwinson, future King of England, saved them. Scene from Bayeux Tapestry (c.1066) showing Breton defenders within the castle of Dinan throwing down spears onto the Norman attackers, whilst some of the latter hold burning torches with which to burn down the wooden fortifications ET CUNAN CLAVES PORREXIT (\\"and Conan passed out the keys\\"), scene from Bayeux Tapestry (c.1066) showing Conan II, Duke of Brittany (d.1066) surrendering the keys (hanging from the tip of a lance) to the castle of Dinan, to the forces of William, Duke of Normandy, following the siege and Battle of Dinan =Battle of Dinan= The Battle of Dinan occurred in 1065. Harold fought on the side of Duke William, whose army had chased Duke Conan from Dol-de- Bretagne to Rennes. Duke Conan finally surrendered at Château de Dinan, Brittany. The battle is recalled in the Bayeux Tapestry (see illustration).Note: In the Bayeux Tapestry, Duke Conan is pictured surrendering by giving Duke William the keys to Dinan via a lance. Death of the Breton Lord During Duke Conan's 1066 campaign against Anjou, he took Pouancé and Segré, and arrived in Château-Gontier. There he was found dead on 11 December after donning poisoned riding gloves. Duke William was widely suspected. Political Results Duke Conan II was succeeded by his sister, Hawise, whose marriage to Hoel of Cornwall may have been a political move to consolidate and stabilize the east and west regions of the duchy. =Bretons as Norman allies= Bretons would eventually invade England with the Normans in 1066 mainly as cavalry, which they specialized in.

A leading member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), he was notorious for the use of torture in his killings. He was leader of the UDA East Belfast Brigade for several years at a time when the brigade was at its most active. He later fell out of favour with other high-ranking UDA figures and was killed by unidentified members of the organisation. McCreery came from a well-known east Belfast family that produced a number of leading loyalists as well as footballers, including his cousin David McCreery.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA – Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror, Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 226 Rise to prominence McCreery was a founder-member of the UDA in 1971. Holding the rank of colonel in the UDA, McCreery sat on the group's Inner Council in the early 1970s.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 42 According to Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack, McCreery was responsible for the murders of at least six Catholic civilians in 1972 and also launched a grenade attack on a busload of Catholic workers. His gang became notorious, along with the groups led by John White and Davy Payne, for pioneering the use of torture in their murders, something that was new to Northern Ireland at the time. In this role McCreery co-operated closely with Albert \\"Ginger\\" Baker, a Belfast-born British soldier and UDA volunteer.David McKittrick et al, Lost Lives, Mainstream Publishing, 2008, p. 1287 McCreery's name was also mentioned in connection with the killing of Tommy Herron in 1973. According to one theory the two had a long- running dispute over money that ended when McCreery used a woman to lure Herron into a deadly ambush. The theory remains unproven and is one of a number of competing ideas, as Herron's death remains unsolved.Ian S. Wood, Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA, p. 24 Following the introduction of internment in 1973, McCreery was one of the first UDA members to be taken into custody. Imprisonment and trial In 1973, Albert Baker decided to leave the organisation after becoming disillusioned with killing. Baker turned himself into the Royal Ulster Constabulary and agreed to testify against a number of UDA leaders, including McCreery.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, pp. 41–42 Baker's evidence saw McCreery and six others brought to trial for the torture and murder of James McCartan on 3 October 1972. However, Baker's evidence proved incoherent and was tailored in an attempt to minimise his own involvement, resulting in the judge dismissing the case and McCreery going free. McCartan had been kidnapped from the lobby of the Park Avenue Hotel, Holywood Road and tortured at two separate Newtownards Road UDA clubs (on Finmore Street and Clermont Lane) before being shot dead. According to the evidence presented, McCreery had directed the torture but had left the shooting to Baker, preferring to remain behind and drink at the Clermont Lane club.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 56 Whilst being held, McCreery was part of a Camp Council that met from time to time in the Maze and in which issues affecting prisoners in the compound were discussed. The Council was established by Ulster Volunteer Force leader Gusty Spence and Provisional IRA members Proinsias MacAirt and Billy McKee, to which UDA representatives McCreery and James Craig as well as Official IRA and Irish National Liberation Army representatives were added.Roy Garland, Gusty Spence, The Blackstaff Press, 2001, pp. 167–168 McCreery was released on 17 February 1974, prompting celebrations in his native East Belfast that quickly escalated into a riot. A gun battle between the UDA and the British Army followed and UDA member Kirk Watters and local non-combatant Gary Reid, a cousin of footballer George Best, were both shot and killed by soldiers. Eventually Sammy McCormick, recently appointed East Belfast brigadier, called a halt to the mayhem and over the coming weeks instilled a discipline within the ranks of his brigade that had previously been lacking in the area.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 70 McCreery was then interned without trial along with two other men involved in the Baker trial. Later years and killing McCreery remained an active figure in loyalist paramilitarism and according to author Ian S. Wood, was probably one of those who killed a Protestant, Margaret Caulfield, in Ballysillan on 7 May 1986 when seeking her Catholic husband.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 90 During the 1980s he began to take more of a role in the racketeering side of the movement. Towards the end of the decade he began to garner a reputation within the movement for corruption and greed, a trait shared by his old ally Craig. By this time his base was the Avenue One bar on Templemore Avenue, which he owned.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 162 He had risen to the rank of Brigadier of the East Belfast UDA, following the resignation of Billy Elliot. This made him effectively one of the six leaders of the movement.The death of Doris Day However, by the early 1990s, McCreery's position within the UDA became less secure. In 1991 his cousin had been shot and wounded by UDA colleagues, an attack that left McCreery embittered, and shortly before his death McCreery had a fight with another UDA member, beating him roundly. An internal UDA inquiry in the early 1990s determined that McCreery was also a police agent and claimed that he had even passed on information about fellow UDA members to Irish republicans.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 226–27 McCreery's close links to Craig, who had been killed in 1988 following similar claims, as well as the persona non grata Tommy Lyttle sealed his fate, and a death sentence was passed on McCreery by the new UDA leadership in early 1992. He was shot and killed outside his home on Grahamsbridge Road, Dundonald on 15 April 1992. He was 46 years old.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 227 The killing was claimed by the UDA's Special Assignment Section, which had first appeared in 1988 when it claimed Craig's murder. Aftermath Following his death, an \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" (UFF) statement described McCreery as an \\"enemy of Ulster\\" and accused him of being a leading figure within the illegal drugs trade.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 163 No convictions were ever made for McCreery's killing although his relatives and supporters within the East Belfast UDA blamed Geordie Legge, another leading figure in the east of the city and a major internal rival of McCreery. In 1997 Leonard McCreery, Ned's brother, attacked Legge with a knife, inflicting grievous wounds on Legge. Despite clinically dying twice on his way to the hospital, Legge survived the attack and Leonard McCreery was sentenced to eleven years in prison for attempted murder.Simon Cressy, \\"Leon McCreery\\", Searchlight, No, 424, October 2010, p. 13 Legge, who is described by Ian S. Wood as having served as brigadier of East Belfast, eventually fell foul of McCreery's ultimate successor Jim Gray and was violently killed in Gray's \\"Bunch of Grapes\\" pub in January 2001.Wood, Crimes of Loyalty, p. 264 Gray was also believed to have issued the order to kill McCreery. Leonard McCreery's son Leon also became active in the UDA but in 1999 fled Belfast after being attacked by rivals from the group. In the course of the knife attack he sustained wounds that required 63 stitches and 17 staples. Leon McCreery settled in Stockport where he would later come to prominence as the head steward for the far-right English Defence League.

Chase goes on the hunt for criminals, with various moves at his disposal, such as swinging across poles and performing wall jumps. He can also gain disguises that give him additional abilities, such as a robber disguise that lets him break locks. Chase can also pilot vehicles, such as cars and helicopters, and use loose bricks to build various objects. Other characters can be playable once unlocked, but they'll still talk with Chase's voice (except in cut-scenes where Chase can still be seen). Custom characters are also playable. The Wii U GamePad can be used as a device including a communicator and as a scanner to locate criminals. Lego City Undercover's gameplay borrows heavily from the Grand Theft Auto series. However the game is role-reversed with the player taking on the role of a police officer enforcing the law, rather than a criminal committing crime, although the player is required to commit criminal acts on some occasions in order to infiltrate criminal gangs.  Plot  In 2013, Police officer Chase McCain (Joseph May) comes back to Lego City, after being sent away two years ago in the aftermath of an important case, at the request of Mayor Gleeson. Upon his return, Gleeson reveals the city is in the grips of a crime wave, which she suspects to be the work of Rex Fury - a notorious criminal that Chase helped to arrest, who had recently escaped from prison - and asks Chase to find him and stop him once again. To assist him in his work, Chase is joined by dim-witted rookie Frank Honey, and assisted by police technician Ellie Phillips, though his return is not welcome news for Natalia Kowalski (Jules de Jongh), Chase's ex-girlfriend, who was forced into the witness protection program after he inadvertently revealed her as the witness in Fury's trial, nor Marion Dunby (Kerry Shale), the city's new Chief of Police, who had Chase sent away because of his mistake as well as always having a giant dislike to him. After helping to deal with a number of minor cases, Chase manages to gain a few clues that lead him to encountering Rex at Bluebell Mine. Despite finding him, he is defeated before he can arrest him, and upon regaining consciousness, he learns that Natalia's father has gone missing. Despite offering to help her find him, Chase finds his help refused by Natalia. After, Chase goes to barry's dojo and gets basic kung fu training. Not too long after Chase gets basic training, he is sent to save frank and the state-of-the-art police truck (the M.O.V.) from Chan Chuang's gang. Frank drives the police truck from the department store to the police station, which are right beside each other. Frank eventually crashes the truck but it is not damaged because it crashed into a stage that was poorly set up. After being pressured by Gleeson to involve Chase in Rex's case, upon Frank informing her that he is being purposely kept out of it, Dunby sends Chase undercover within a limousine company owned by Chan Chuang, head of a crime gang. During his time in the company, he works as a driver for millionaire Forrest Blackwell, gains acceptance with Chan's boss, Vinnie Pappalardo, and steals a moon buggy for Chan. When Natalia is captured by Chan, while investigating his connection to her father's disappearance, Chase goes to rescue her, causing her to accept his help in finding her father, but angering Dunby when Chan goes into hiding. Dunby temporarily removes him from the case, and has Chase and Frank transferred to Bluebell National Park to work with Sheriff Duke Huckleberry. Sometime later, Dunby reinstates him to the case, whereupon Chase is tasked by Vinnie to taking on work for him, including the job of stealing a robotic T-Rex from the Lego City museum. After helping to rescue Natalia from a group of mysterious men, whereupon they partially reconcile, Chase tails Vinnie to his private buyer and finds it to be Rex himself. When Vinnie learns he won't be paid for his work and is ordered to steal more items for his buyer, he instructs Chase to steal from Blackwell. After breaking into his mansion, Chase returns to Vinne's ice cream parlor, only to find it overrun by Rex's thugs and Vinnie locked in a freezer in retaliation for going against Rex's orders. Chase manages to save Vinnie from Rex's thugs, and after interrogating the thug's leader, takes their place to learn what Rex is planning. Managing to infiltrate Rex's hideout, Chase overhears Natalia's father, Henrik Kowalski, being interrogated by Rex and discovers that Blackwell himself organized the crime wave, and had managed to kidnap Natalia to coerce her father to work on his plans. Rescuing Kowalski, Chase calls Ellie with what he learnt, whereupon she informs him that Blackwell recently was in the news with promises he had plans that would change Lego City forever. Proceeding to Blackwell's mansion, he searches it for evidence of Blackwell's crimes and to locate Natalia. Chase soon discovers that Blackwell intends to build a colony on the moon, after his plans to build a shopping mall in Bluebell were thwarted by environmental issues. To facilitate his plans, Blackwell converted his high-rise, Blackwell Tower, into a rocket, which Chase discovers will destroy the city when it's launched. Chase quickly has Henrik and several members in the police department build a force field to prevent the rocket's engines from burning the city down. Learning that Blackwell took Natalia with him, Chase pursues him via a space shuttle. Upon the moon, Chase finds himself using a construction mech to battle against Rex within the modified T-Rex he helped to steal. Blackwell leaves both men behind, destroying the shuttle. Chase manages to defeat Rex in a final battle, whereupon Blackwell sends both into free fall towards Earth. Vowing for revenge, Blackwell finds himself sent flying away by a cow out of nowhere. Skydiving towards Natalia's prison within the rocket's command module, Chase rescues her by triggering the module's parachute. Once back in the city, Gleeson congratulates him for saving Lego City, while Dunby offers Chase the honor of overseeing Rex's arrest. However, Chase turns it down, claiming Natalia is more important to him now, and they rekindle their relationship and leave to start a new life together. =Bonus Missions= At the end of the game, when the player is in free roam, there are two bonus missions located at the police station that depict a police chase from two points of view. One mission allows the player to steal a car from the station and drive it to a criminal hideout. The other is the same scenario, only the player controls the cop who pursues the criminal and eventually arrests him.  Development  The development team at TT Fusion had been wanting to create a video game based on the Lego City theme for some time, but the available technology and the fact that most staff were working on existing IPs limited their ability to create such a game. Prototyping for what would become Lego City Undercover began in 2010, and lasted roughly twelve months. As they did not have a solid idea of what the game would be, the team began with creating a small environment with drivable vehicles and Lego buildings. In 2011, Nintendo approached the company and showed them the Wii U hardware, asking whether they would like to develop a game for it. Having already had good experiences with Nintendo with successful ports of their previous titles and liking the platform's specs, the team agreed to work with Nintendo. Developing a game not tied to a movie license gave the team a degree of freedom previously unavailable, while also presenting difficulties with multiple aspects including the story, gameplay and general mechanics of the game. Due to the high compatibility between the team's concept and its prospective hardware, ports to other consoles were not seriously considered, until a few years after the game was released. They were also able to integrate the GamePad functions into the game, making part of Undercovers world. Nintendo generally left the team to develop the game as they pleased, though they received regular updates on the project and would notify them if they saw anything as a problem. One of the early gameplay challenges was the combat, which needed to fit into the story context of the lead character being a policeman. Instead of a simple brawling style, the team designed the battle system to allow for defensive gameplay and not involve an equivalent to lethal take-downs. While designing the setting, the team used elements from multiple locations, including New York City, San Francisco and London. As the game was being developed for a Nintendo console, the team included multiple Nintendo- themed Easter eggs for players to find. The team had to create a new game engine as previous ones were not able to cope with the scale of the environments. They also wanted the main character, Chase McCain, to have depth as they knew both children and adults would play the game. Undercover features full voice acting, which at the time development started was a first for the series, although due to development time, others featuring voice acting were developed and released ahead of it. For the voice casting, the team used voice casting and recording company Side UK. A large voice casting session was held, and several established comedians were specifically asked to come in as the team wanted good delivery for the funny sections of the script. By the time the script writer, former stand-up comedian Graham Goring, was brought on board, a rough outline of the story had been created. His main role was to fill in the gaps and put in as much humor as possible. Goring was given a lot of freedom when it came to the parodies, although the team were regularly consulted on the suitability of the material and a script editor was assigned to check his work. Drawing on his former profession, Goring included a large amount of one-liners and humor intended for both children and adults. Following the template of The Simpsons, the game contains a high number of family-friendly parodies, referencing movies such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Matrix, and TV series such as Starsky & Hutch. The game's story took a while to write, as the team wanted to give it depth. Lego City Undercover was announced during Nintendo's press conference at E3 2011 on 7 June 2011 under the tentative title Lego City Stories. At Nintendo's press conference at E3 2012 on 5 June 2012, the game was revealed to have had a name change to Lego City Undercover. The game's debut trailer was shown during that event, revealing game footage for the first time. During Nintendo's 13 September events, some new trailers detailing the story were shown, along with the announcement that a Chase McCain minifigure would come with the game as a pre- order bonus on North America and Australia while stocks last, and be included in the first copies of the game on Europe. A police high speed chase toy was also released and includes a code for additional in-game content. Nintendo also published the game in Japan on 25 July 2013. On 22 November 2016, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that a remaster would be released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in April 2017, which introduced split-screen cooperative support.  Reception  With a Metacritic score of 80 on the Wii U version, reviews were largely positive, praising the humour and design, but generally criticizing lengthy loading times and a lack of co-operative multiplayer, the latter of which is a staple in most Lego titles. Official Nintendo Magazine awarded the game 90%, making it the magazine's third highest rated Wii U game at the time. IGN gave the game 8 out 10, praising its huge open world while criticising its generic gameplay. Eurogamer gave the game a score of 9 out of 10, saying the game features \\"a mixture of great writing, twinkling level design and laudable values that keep you coming back\\". GamesRadar gave the game 4 out of 5 stars, praising the inventive use of occupations and rewarding puzzles but criticising the lack of co-operative multiplayer. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 8.4, calling it \\"the best game in the series so far.\\" Nintendo Insider awarded the game a score of 85%, writing that it \\"signals a bold new direction for TT Fusion’s creativity.\\" = Sales = According to NPD figures, the game sold more than 100,000 units in the United States in its debut month, debuting outside the top 10 and tying with Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. In the UK, the game debuted at number 12 in the all-formats chart, however, it debuted at number 8 in the individual-format chart and at number 1 in the Wii U chart. In Japan, the game sold more than 18,000 copies during its first week, entering all the charts at number 9.

Although it was one of the first Minnesota state trails to be established, it remains incomplete as three discontinuous sections. The trail is managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. It traverses the rolling morainal landscape of the Coteau des Prairies, passing cropland interspersed with wooded ravines, remnant tallgrass prairie, and wetlands. The trail is named after railroad engineer Casey Jones, who famously sacrificed his life to lessen the severity of a 1900 train crash in Mississippi. Jones had no connections to Minnesota; the trail was named for him as it was the first abandoned railroad grade acquired by the state. The railroad was key to bringing settlers to the area in the late 19th century and for shipping their agricultural products to market. Description The Casey Jones State Trail is currently limited to three separate sections. The first section runs from the city of Pipestone due east for to the Pipestone/Murray county line. After a gap the trail resumes for a section leading into the town of Lake Wilson. These two sections have a natural surface. The third portion is a paved loop between End-O-Line Railroad Park & Museum in Currie and Lake Shetek State Park. The full plan for the trail is a route from Split Rock Creek State Park to Pipestone to Lake Wilson to Slayton to Lake Shetek State Park to Walnut Grove. A spur would provide access to Pipestone National Monument. The plan calls for parallel tracks, one paved and one natural- surfaced, to accommodate horseback riding and snowmobiling as well as biking, in-line skating, and cross-country skiing. History The Casey Jones State Trail was authorized in the late 1960s shortly after legislation was passed allowing for state trails in Minnesota. The original route was to follow the abandoned railroad grade and then sweep northeast through Slayton to Lake Shetek State Park. No further property was acquired, however, and only the section from Pipestone was developed, opening in the mid-1970s. In 1993 Murray County secured federal funds through the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act to build the paved loop from Currie to the state park, which was completed in 1996. The following year a local group secured a key segment leading into Lake Wilson, and that section was soon opened for hiking. The popularity of the paved loop helped renew public interest in the trail. The 2002 Minnesota Legislature officialized the loop as part of the state trail and authorized a extension to the main route. However a second bill to provide funding did not pass and a small appropriation was vetoed by the governor.

Muhammad then sent 50 fighters against them and captured their men, women and children. The prisoners were later released, after a delegation of the tribe came to Muhammad asking for forgiveness. Expedition =Muhammad's tax collectors forced out= The Banu Tamim were a tribe who fought alongside Muhammad and helped in the Battle of Hunayn and Conquest of Mecca. However, when Muhammad sent a delegation led by Uyainah bin Hisn to collect tax (or zakat, which he made obligatory), the Banu al-Anbar, a sub-tribe of the Banu Tamim, refused to pay it. Instead they attacked him and forced him out of the territory, even before he could ask for the tax.The Sealed Nectar, Text Version, Witness-Pioneer.com =50 fighters capture men, women and children= Uyainah bin Hisn came back and told the news to Muhammad, who then sent 50 Muslim fighters to enforce his orders and make an example of the offenders. Uyainah bin Hisn launched a surprise attack against them, captured more than 50 men, women and children and brought them back to Muhammad in Medina. Muhammad kept these men, women and children in confinement. 11 men, 22 women and 30 boys were captured.The Sealed Nectar, Text Version, Witness-Pioneer.com =Poetry contest= Then a delegation of the Banu Tamim rushed to Medina to ask for his forgiveness. Muhammad refused to talk to them, as he felt they were disturbing him. According to Tabari and Ibn Sa'd, when the delegation came, the women and children saw them and began to cry, which explained their urgency to reach Muhammad.The last years of the Prophet , by Tabari, Pg 68. See 4646, notes section When they had the chance to talk, they reminded him of their comradeship in arms (in the Battle of Hunayn) and offered to recite some poems to Muhammad and contest against Muhammad's own poets. The first person to stand up and contest in poetry (which was an Arab tradition at the time) was from the Banu Tamim. Then Muhammad ordered Thabit ibn Qays to reply with his poetry. Thabit recited that Muhammad was a messenger from heaven, devoted to the Muhajir (refugees) and the faithful. He finished the poem by threatening destruction against all those who should refuse Islam. =New Quran verse= After reciting the poems, the Banu Tamim delegation admitted that Muhammad's poets exceeded them in eloquence. Muhammad released the prisoners thereafter but told them not to be so rude to him in the future. A new Quran verse was revealed: The famous Muslim jurist, Ibn Kathir, mentions in his Tafsir that Thabit ibn Qays believed he was among the dwellers of fire because he raised his voice against Muhammad. Muhammad comforted him by claiming he was among the dwellers of paradise. Qays was later killed in the Battle of Yamama. According to the Muslim Scholar Hussain Haykal, all tribes that refused Muhammad's authority faced his overwhelming power. They were confronted with the choices of either (1) converting to Islam and paying the zakat, or if they refused to convert, (2) submitting to the Muslim political power and paying the kharaj. Kharaj is usually synonymous with jizyah, a tax levied on non-Muslims for protection.

The game was first revealed at E3 in 2011. It was later released that year on the Xbox 360 and it uses the Kinect-supported system. The game is the first Kinect shooter on the market. It was published by 505 Games. Gameplay The game is set in a fictional town in North Africa, where players lead a team of operatives. Players are tasked with protecting aid workers and other dignitaries in a volatile nation overrun by a warlord named General Limbano. The gameplay is described as on-rails, similar to the style of arcade games Virtua Cop or Time Crisis. The player moves along a set path and highlights targets with their hand, hovering over them for a few moments to take the shot. To take cover from enemy fire, the player must duck and lean side-to- side. Describing the characters in the game, Richard Dormer of Zombie Studios said, “They're not commandos ... They’re not in there saving the world against the next nuclear bomb. They’re there working with the UN and trying to protect people. No one wants to be a hero. Everybody wants to survive the next day. If there’s one thing that’s important to Blackwater it’s their 100% success rate for protecting people.” Throughout the game, the player will switch between squad members Devin, Baird, Smash, and Eddie. While playing as Devin and Baird, the gamer will be firing an assault rifle. As Smash, the gamer will use a shotgun and as Eddie, a sniper rifle. Blackwater gives players the ability to completely control the gameplay experience using a traditional controller or Kinect's controller-free abilities which introduces a level of immersion to the FPS genre. Throughout each stage in the game, there are sequences where the player will have to perform actions such as jumping across gaps or busting down doors. Players can also kick away oncoming melee attackers. Ian Howe, president of 505 Games said, \\"being able to get the controller out of player’s hands with Kinect and have them on the ground and immersed in the experience will give them a glimpse of what it takes to be a member of an elite fighting force.\\" Development Erik Prince approached 505 Games to create and publish the game. Prince said \\"this game and its immersive Kinect-based approach will give players the chance to experience what it is like to be on a Blackwater team on a mission without being dropped into a real combat situation.\\" During development, 505 Games and Prince worked hand-in-hand with Zombie Studios and former Blackwater operatives to mimic the intensity of real-world missions. Describing the game, Prince said, \\"This is not a training device. This is not a simulator. We're not doing this to teach folks how to conduct military operations in an urban terrain. That's not it at all. This is more along the lines of kids running around their neighborhood playing cops and robbers or cowboys and Indians.\\" Prince sees the game as a potential franchise. Reception Blackwater has received generally negative reviews. It had an average score of 38.45% at GameRankings, based on 11 reviews and an average score of 37/100 at Metacritic, based on 12 reviews. The Official Xbox Magazine gave Blackwater a mixed but mostly positive review with a rating of 7/10. While it noted some flaws such as obvious enemy paths and restarting from the beginning of levels, the review also noted that \\"where this game shines is its Kinect-based mechanics\\", saying that they \\"had a blast shooting, kicking, climbing, jumping, and repelling to complete objectives.\\" Dan Chiappini, writer for GameSpot, describes the game as \\"deceptively physical even for a Kinect title, and while it's not designed primarily as a fitness game, it could be a good way to shed a few extra kilos and get your shooter fix at the same time.\\" In the first review of the game, GamesRadar gave Blackwater 1/10, calling it \\"an insult to gamers and a step backward for the Kinect\\", stating that they were \\"not judging the Kinect’s functionality, but instead, Blackwater’s complete failure to implement it in any sort of enjoyable fashion.\\" James Newton of KINECTaku said, \\"Blackwater is to be commended for maintaining a fairly lively and varied pace.\\" However, he gave it a score of 5/10, concluding that it felt like \\"a gun game missing a gun\\". Giant Bomb also gave this game its \\"worst game of the year award\\" for 2011.

Career Born in Berlin in 1922, she was the daughter of popular stage and film actors Heinrich Schroth and Käthe Haack. Her older half-brother was actor and film director Carl-Heinz Schroth (1902–1989), who was the product of Schroth's father's earlier marriage to Else Ruttersheim. Schroth began her career as a child actress, and made her film debut at the age of nine in 1931's Max Ophüls' comedy Dann schon lieber Lebertran opposite her mother. Until age sixteen she attended drama school in Lausanne, Switzerland. Her early film successes include Spiel im Sommerwind (1938), Weisser Flieder (1939) and Kitty and the World Conference (1939) - the latter of which was her first leading role.Cyranos.com During World War II, Hannelore Schroth continued performing in films. Unlike her father, Heinrich Schroth, who was by then appearing in Nazi propaganda films such as the notorious 1940 anti-Semitic Jud Süß, she avoided overtly political films, such as her appearance in 1945's romantic drama Under the Bridges. After the war, she continued her work extensively in film and returned to the theatre, with engagements in Vienna, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Berlin and Munich. In addition to theatre and appearing in German films as an actress, in the 1950s Schroth began a career as a voice actress, dubbing many English language films into German. Some of which include Jane Wyman's character of Carolina Hill in Just for You (1952), Shirley MacLaine in Irma La Douce (1963), Elizabeth Taylor's role as Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) and Ingrid Bergman's role as Golda Meir in A Woman Called Golda (1982).Deutsche Synchronkartei In her later years, Schroth began appearing on West German television, as well as appearing on stage and in film.

Personal life Schroth was first married to German stage and film actor Carl Raddatz; however, the union ended in divorce. Her second marriage was to the Austrian deep sea diver Hans Hass, which produced a son, Hans Hass Jr. (1946–2009) who became an actor and pop singer.

The following is a list of events that have been held at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia. Fright Nights In 2006, Warner Bros. Movie World decided to run a single Halloween Family Fun Night on 31 October with a Scooby-Doo theme. Due to the event being sold out, the park extended the event to become a 3 night event. This format remained until 2009 when Movie World decided to re-theme and rename the event to Halloween Fright Nights in an attempt to target an older audience. In 2010, Warner Bros. Movie World worked with Sudden Impact Entertainment and Lynton V. Harris to produce mazes based upon the Nightmare on Elm Street and Saw franchises. Just after the conclusion of the 2010 event, it was announced that the event would return in 2011. White Christmas Over one million Christmas lights light up Main Street at the White Christmas event. Following the success of their first Halloween Family Fun Night in 2006, Warner Bros. Movie World ran a one-off Looney Tunes Christmas event on 23 December 2006. The event featured a Christmas parade and Looney Tunes shows. In 2007, an extended Halloween Family Fun line-up returned but the Christmas event was discontinued. On 30 December 2009, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported that Movie World had plans to create a White Christmas event with one million Christmas lights and artificial snow. Through their website and several television commercials they announced the event will be a separate ticketed event on eight nights in December and will feature one million Christmas lights, Polar Express 4-D Experience, Looney Tunes on Ice, Ice Skating for guests, Christmas carollers, snow and a Christmas Parade. The first White Christmas event was held as a charity event on 3 December 2010 for 3,000 disadvantaged children and their families. The following two weeks the event was held on Thursday through to Sunday for VIP pass holders and event ticket holders. Due to the unexpected success of the event, an additional night was added to the line up on Monday 20 December. Sci-Fi Fantasy Night On 14 April 2007, Warner Bros. Movie World hosted a one-off Sci-Fi Fantasy Night. The night was organised as part of the 2007 Supanova Pop Culture Expo, however, tickets were still available for the general public. Several rides and shows operated for the event as well as additional Sci-Fi entertainment, a best dressed competition, games and a Q&A; session. International sci-fi stars were also present including Billy Dee Williams and Clayton Watson. DC Comics 75th Anniversary Heroes vs. Villains Parade Both the Green Lantern and The Flash were featured in the DC Comics 75th Anniversary Heroes vs. Villains Parade. In late May 2010, Warner Bros. Movie World announced that they would help celebrate DC Comics' 75th Anniversary by holding a special Heroes vs. Villains Parade. From early June 2010, DC Comics decorations were displayed and merchandise started to be sold throughout the park. The parade was run nightly from 26 June through to 31 July 2010, replacing the traditional All-Star Parade that would normally be held earlier in the day. The Heroes vs. Villains parade introduced six new costumed characters to the park as well as an array of additional floats. The parade also featured existing in-park characters that would normally be featured in the All-Star Parade. From 26 December 2010, the parade replaced the All-Star Parade in its traditional day timeslot. Other events Warner Bros. Movie World has also played host to a variety of other events.

It was written by songwriter Diane Warren and composer James Newton Howard to promote Walt Disney Pictures' 41st animated feature film Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001). Produced by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair, the song was released as the only promotional single from the film's soundtrack on June 5, 2001. Directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale agreed that Atlantis: The Lost Empire, their third animated Disney project, would not be a musical. However, the studio's marketing department insisted that at least one song be featured during the film's end credits in order to adhere to tradition. Disney hired Mýa to record a pop song for the Atlantis soundtrack because of the studio and singer's shared business relationship with A&M;/Interscope Records. A downtempo pop and R&B; ballad, \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" is an inspirational song about following one's heart and self-discovery, which alludes to the film's central plot about a young adventurer's search for the lost city of Atlantis. Both Warren and Howard collaborated on the song's melody, which borrows from Howard's own orchestral score, while Warren wrote the lyrics. \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" is the only song from Atlantis: The Lost Empire that features both music and lyrics. Upon its release 10 days ahead of the film, the ballad was criticized for sounding generic and uninspired. Some critics also questioned Disney's decision to have Mýa to record the song, believing the single would have benefited from a more experienced vocalist. However, the song was nominated for Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film at the World Soundtrack Awards.  Background and writing  Songwriter Diane Warren co-wrote \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" with composer James Newton Howard. Unlike most of Disney's animated releases, Atlantis: The Lost Empire lacks both songs and musical numbers to assist with its storytelling. After having successfully directed two Disney musicals consecutively, Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale agreed that Atlantis: The Lost Empire, their third animated project for Disney, would not be a musical, nor would it feature any power ballads. However, by the time the film was released in 2001, it had become standard practice for Disney to hire young artists to record pop songs for their films' official soundtrack albums, thus Disney's marketing department insisted that Atlantis: The Lost Empire feature at least one song during its closing credits as a compromise in order to maintain tradition. Earlier that year, the releases of The Mummy Returns and Pearl Harbor had also been accompanied by pop songs to attract a wider audience, a trend Disney would follow with Atlantis. Chuck Taylor of Billboard believes that Disney recruited R&B; singer Mýa because of the studio's professional relationship with the artist's then-record company A&M;/Interscope Records. At that time, Mýa had recently collaborated with singers Pink, Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera on \\"Lady Marmalade\\" for the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack earlier that year, the lattermost of whom made her musical debut recording \\"Reflection\\", the theme song from Disney's Mulan (1998). Rob Burch of The Hollywood News believes that \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" was initially intended to benefit Mýa's career similar to the way in which \\"Reflection\\" had bolstered Aguilera's. \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" was written by songwriter Diane Warren and film composer James Newton Howard. While Howard, who scored the entire film, composed the song's melody, Warren contributed to the song's music while writing its lyrics on her own. On the co-writing process, Howard explained that Warren wrote lyrics to accompany \\"a musical theme\\" he had composed, in addition to making some musical contributions of her own. Therefore, while both Warren and Howard are credited as composers, only Warren retains a lyric writing credit. By then already well known for writing several commercially successful songs for various artists, Warren had already established herself as a prolific songwriter by the time she wrote \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\", which lyrically adheres to a similar songwriting style for which she has become known. Meanwhile, the song's melody is loosely based on a sample of the film's orchestral score. Played during the film's end titles, \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" is the only song from the film that features both music and lyrics, although it is not performed by any character within the context of the film itself because Atlantis: The Lost Empire is not a musical.  Release  Distinguished from most film soundtracks, Atlantis: The Lost Empire features \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" as its first track instead of its last. A&M;/Interscope Records, Mýa's record company at the time, and Walt Disney Records released \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" as the only promotional single from the Atlantis: The Lost Empire soundtrack. It was sent to Top 40 and adult contemporary radio stations on June 5, 2001 to support the film ten days ahead of its June 15 theatrical release date. The single was accompanied by a music video starring Mýa, in which she performs the song interpolated with scenes from the film. \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" appears as the first track on the soundtrack before it is succeeded by Howard's orchestral score, which accounts for the remainder of the album. Puerto Rican singer Chayanne covered the song in Spanish, entitled \\"Donde Va Tu Sueño\\", to promote the film's Latin American release. Recorded in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Chayanne co-wrote his rendition's Spanish lyrics with Renato Lopez, Walterio Pesqueira and Manny Benito. The two-disc Taiwanese release of the soundtrack includes three additional versions of \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" performed in three different languages by three different artists: Jolin Tsai in Mandarin, Joey Yong in Cantonese, and Kangta in Korean.  Composition  \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" is a \\"tender\\" pop power ballad with contemporary R&B;, soul and lite rock influences, performed in an urban contemporary style. According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are \\"about following your heart to find your true self\\", which begin \\"They'll try to hold you back, they will say you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on.\\" A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single \\"correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer\\", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, \\"There's something in your soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe and you know you must go\\", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both \\"earnest\\" and \\"mellow\\"; Mýa performs it using a \\"sweet vocal\\", which spans two octaves from G3 to D♭5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" encompasses \\"soft, contemporary beats\\" combined with the singer's \\"dulcet tones\\" that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as \\"polished\\", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair. Critical reception Ultimately, \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" was both a commercial and critical disappointment despite Disney's efforts; the song has been met with generally negative reviews from music critics, who dismissed it as standard and uninspired. Jerry McCulley of Amazon.com described \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" as \\"a serviceable slice of modern R&B; boilerplate\\". Although AllMusic's Jonathan Widran believed the song could potentially become a \\"pop hit\\", he ultimately dismissed it as \\"fairly generic Diane Warren- written fare.\\" In Billboard, radio personality Charles Karel Bouley agreed that the song is \\"average pop fare\\" while acknowledging its Top 40 potential. Film Score Monthly's Lukas Kendall strongly disliked the ballad, writing, \\"The less said about ...'Where the Dream Takes You,' the better.\\" James Barry of Soundtrack.Net wrote, \\"If I had to pick something to dislike, it'd be the song 'Where the Dream Takes You'\\" because \\"it suffers from sounding like so much other disposable end-credits music.\\" Telenet's Thomas Glorieux opined that the track \\"fails to even stir up the attention because I find it a very ordinary song.\\" Critics were also unimpressed with Mýa's performance. Calling the singer \\"a curious choice\\" for \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\", Chuck Taylor of Billboard criticized Mýa's vocals for failing \\"to lift the ballad beyond the mundane, while making it more than obvious that her talents are best-suited for uptempo, beat-heavy fare\\", and believes the single could have potentially benefited from a more powerful, seasoned vocalist. Ranking \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" among Disney's worst songs, Consequence of Sound's Dominick Suzanne-Mayer panned the ballad as \\"an addendum every bit as forgettable ... as the film in which it appears.\\" \\"Where the Dream Takes You\\" was nominated for Best Original Song Written Directly for a Film at the World Soundtrack Awards in 2001. Live performances To promote \\"Where the Dream Takes You,\\" Mýa performed the song at several media outlets. On the film's release day, June 15, 2001, Mýa performed the song at Live with Regis & Kelly. Next, Mýa performed the song at the event gala, An American Celebration at Ford's Theatre.

UVF leadership Following the imprisonment of UVF leader Gusty Spence for murder in October 1966, Spence remained de jure leader of the group but needed a stand-in leader on the outside. He chose McClelland for this role, and appointed him Chief of Staff or Brigadier-General of the Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) largely because he respected him for his Korean War military service, Spence also being a former British Army soldier.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, p. 21 McClelland had lied about his age in order to enlist in the Royal Ulster Rifles.Ed Moloney, Voice from the Grave, Faber & Faber, 2010, p. 334 Like Spence, McClelland was also a native of the Shankill Road and had a reputation as a disciplinarian. He sought to continue Spence's work by keeping together the few UVF members left and slowly adding to their number. In keeping with Spence's ideals, he sought to lead the UVF as if it were a regular army, and based their internal structure loosely on that of the British Army in which both men had served.Moloney, Voice from the Grave, p. 375 He shared with Spence a belief that the UVF should keep a small, tightly organised membership and as such did not compete with the burgeoning Ulster Defence Association (UDA) for either membership or public profile.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 147 Nonetheless, the late 1960s were characterised by UVF inertia, in part because as Officer Commander McClelland had little personal power and had to enact policies that he received from Spence when he visited him in prison.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 87 Tara In an effort to access any weapons it might have possessed, and to seek possible political guidance, McClelland and the UVF infiltrated the loyalist movement Tara, and under his leadership the two groups associated on the Shankill.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 94-96 McClelland was even \\"commissioned\\" as an officer of Tara, although many in the UVF were uncomfortable with the group's insistence on emphasising a Gaelic cultural mission alongside loyalism.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 96 The relationship deteriorated in early 1971 when a number of people, including an unnamed unionist politician, contacted McClelland to inform him of Tara leader William McGrath's homosexuality and to claim that McGrath had only started the movement in order to \\"pick up\\" young men. Roy Garland stated that McClelland confronted McGrath about the allegations and at a stormy meeting burnt the Tara ledger containing the names of his UVF members and left their headquarters.Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 95 By this time it had also become clear that Tara had little weaponry to speak of and few independent members and as such the link had become largely pointless anyway. Later years McClelland was interned in late 1973 along with a number of other leading figures in the UVF.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand: Protestant paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 117 By this point, however, de facto leadership of the UVF lay with Jim Hanna rather than McClelland\\"Dublin and Monaghan bombings: Cover-up and incompetence\\". page 1.

The choir performs a wide range of works from all time periods and languages, although over the years a special emphasis has been placed on contemporary music of the Americas. Recordings Since 1980, ORS has commissioned and/or debuted 20 new works by American artists. In October 1988, ORS completed a four compact disc contract with Koch International Classics to record new American music. These recordings include * Berliner Messe by Arvo Pärt and Mass to St. Anthony by Lou Harrison * Missa Gaia by Libby Larsen and Echoes Between the Silent Peaks by Stephen Paulus * A collection of holiday music called The Glory of Christmas * Fern Hill by John Corigliano Other ORS recordings include a compact disc of Rachmaninoff's Vespers with members of the Moscow State Chamber Choir under Vladimir Minin. In 1995 ORS was included, along with Chanticleer and The King's Singers, in a compact disc Christmas Around the Country, which was distributed nationally by National Public Radio. An excerpt from the 1995 Glory of Christmas concert broadcast on NPR's Performance Today was so well-received that two hour-long specials on ORS followed. In 2018 ORS released \\"Shadows on the Stars\\" with Gothic Records, an album featuring the music of Pacific Northwest composers, including among others Morten Lauridsen. The album earned the group the America Prize in Choral Performance for the community chorus division. Directors In April 2011, it was announced that following the retirement of thirty-five year veteran artistic director Gil Seeley, the ensemble is headed by Ethan Sperry, Director of Choral Activities at Portland State University.

The ski area reopened in 2003 after having been closed for 13 years. Crotched Mountain is east of Keene, west of Manchester, and northwest of Boston. As of late 2019, it is owned by Colorado-based Vail Resorts. History The original Crotched Mountain Ski Area opened in 1964 on a different face of the mountain - the northeast side, entirely in Francestown. In 1970, a second area opened on the north side with the name Onset, later changed to Bobcat. Bobcat and the original Crotched Mountain merged in 1980 and operated jointly as Crotched Mountain. More than 100 adjacent condominium units were constructed in the late 1980s, creating a burden of debt that contributed to the demise of the resort in 1989. The resort was bought in 2002 by St. Louis-based Peak Resorts, a company that ran a few North American ski areas, including Attitash Mountain Resort and Wildcat Mountain Ski Area in New Hampshire. The company spent an estimated $9 million to build a new lodge, install new, state of the art snowmaking equipment and chairlifts, and to recut trails, and in 2003 reopened what had been the Onset/Bobcat side as Crotched Mountain Ski Area.New England Ski History: Peak Resorts In 2012, the resort installed a high-speed quad, bought from Ascutney Mountain Resort in Vermont. The portion of the mountain with the original Crotched Mountain ski area is now largely owned by the town of Francestown.

The IESBA’s mission is to serve the public interest by setting ethics standards, including auditor independence requirements, which seek to raise the bar for ethical conduct and practice for all professional accountants. The IESBA sets its standards in the public interest with advice from the IESBA Consultative Advisory Group (CAG) and under the oversight of the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). The IESBA is dedicated to operating as transparent as possible. IESBA meetings are open to the public. The agendas, agenda papers, meeting highlights and audio recordings for each meeting are posted on the IESBA's website. In addition, the IESBA's website includes information about the IESBA's Strategy and Work Plan and its various projects and initiatives. The IESBA's website also includes resources, including Staff Q&As; and the IESBA eCode to help support the adoption and implementation of the IESBA Code. Activities In 2018, the IESBA issued a revised and restructured Code which came into effect in June 2019. The revised and restructured Code includes many substantive revisions, including in relation to non-compliance with laws and regulations (NOCLAR). The 2018 version of the Code makes it clear that professional accountants, in whatever capacity they are engaged, cannot turn a blind eye to NOCLAR. The provisions in the Code, including NOCLAR guide ethical behavior and help professional accountants uphold their responsibility to act in the public interest. The IESBA Code also includes a principles-based definition of what constitutes a network. The definition covers the way a group of companies operate and present themselves, and is consistent with the Statutory Audit Directive. The IESBA periodically issues revisions to the IESBA Code.

Ludwika was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1807, the daughter of Nicolas Chopin and his wife Justyna. From a young age, she showed talent for music and literature. Like her brother Frédéric (b. 1810), she studied music with Wojciech Żywny. In 1825 Frédéric wrote to his friend and schoolmate Jan Białobłocki \\"Ludwika has composed a perfect mazurek, of a kind that Warsaw has not yet danced to.\\" When her brother emigrated to Paris in 1830, they wrote one another extensively, and she visited him on one occasion. Later, when Frédéric's health had begun to deteriorate rapidly, he requested that Ludwika come and stay with him. She arrived in Paris on 8 August 1849 with her daughter and husband, lawyer Józef Jędrzejewicz, but her husband soon left. Ludwika was with Frédéric when he died on 17 October 1849. After Ludwika's second trip to Paris, her marriage with Jędrzejewicz began to deteriorate. Her husband accused her of putting her family before everything else, and for many years Jędrzejewicz treated Ludwika badly. This continued until Jędrzejewicz's death in 1853. Ludwika died in her home in Warsaw during an 1855 epidemic of the plague. Her story is mentioned in Flights, a novel by Olga Tokarczuk.

In an October 2013 video feature for the Berrics website, Capaldi revealed his transition with the 360 flip, a very difficult skateboard trick, whereby he only performs the trick in \\"switch\\" stance; that is, opposite to his natural stance. Early life Originating from Simi Valley, California, United States (US) and attended Royal High School. Capaldi explained in early 2013 that the \\"Mo\\" in his name is a nickname that was given to him by his father while he was a young boy. After breaking his wrist skating a handrail, Capaldi proceeded to avoid handrail skateboarding and explained in a 2013 interview that \\"I don't like rails.\\" Professional skateboarding Capaldi stated in a 2013 interview that the best thing about his membership with the team is: \\"Because Girl to me, that's my childhood dream sponsor, so the fact that I'm on my dream sponsor is probably the coolest thing you can have; and Girl is tight as fuck, so.\\" Capaldi also revealed later in the interview that he does not engage in any preparation or rituals prior to skateboarding, but that he has observed other skateboarders, that he considers some of the best, undertake routines prior to the act of skateboarding. Capaldi was sponsored by Matix for several years and released signature clothing products with the brand; the brand also produced custom-made singlets for Capaldi's basketball team \\"The Simi Valley Bierdos\\". Capaldi's first pro model shoe was with Lakai. Capaldi resigned from Lakai after the shoe brand emerged victorious from the 2011 \\"King of the Road\\" competition run by Thrasher magazine. In 2011, Capaldi was recruited to the Spitfire skateboard wheels team after a lengthy period of time with a company entitled Fillmore that is no longer in existence as of March 2013. As part of his introduction to the team, Capaldi created and published a spoof \\"sponsor-me\\" video that is typically reserved for unsponsored skateboarders. Following his time with Lakai, Capaldi joined the DC team, alongside other new team riders such as Nyjah Huston and Mikey Taylor. At the 2012 Agenda trade show, Capaldi's first signature shoe for DC was previewed in three different \\"colorways\\". On January 14, 2013, the first MikeMo Capaldi signature DC shoe model was released to the public, accompanied by two online video segments—promotion for the shoe is accompanied by the tagline: \\"Designed from the Inside Out\\". On November 1, 2016, it was announced that DC Shoes chose not to renew Mike's contract on October 31. Mike eventually parted ways with the company. =Sponsors= As of November 2016, Capaldi is sponsored by Girl Skateboards, Royal Trucks, Spitfire wheels, MOB griptape, Bones Swiss bearings, and Diamond. Capaldi was a former team member of the Lakai footwear and Matix clothing teams. Mike Mo also co-owns a sunglasses company called Glassy. Glassy Capaldi and his brother, Vince, are co-owners and founders of Glassy Sunglasses; however, the trademark for the name \\"Glassy Sunglasses\\" is registered under the name \\"Capaldi, Vince\\". The Glassy sunglasses brand launched its internet store in September 2012, including signature products from Stefan Janoski, Sean Malto, and Mike Mo himself. A signature model for team rider Daewon Song, entitled the \\"Daeviator\\", was launched in late 2012. In May 2013, following a bet between Capaldi and professional skateboarder Chris Cole, the latter became a team rider for the Glassy brand—Capaldi and Cole, who are teammates on the DC Shoes team, agreed that Cole would join the Glassy team if he lost to Capaldi in any contest. The pair competed in the Battle at the Berrics 6 contest on May 18, 2013 and Cole was defeated by Capaldi. Recognition The SkateLab indoor skatepark (located in Capaldi's home area of Simi Valley) partnered with the DC company for the \\"1st Annual Mike Mo Day\\", held on February 9, 2013. Participants at the event were provided with an opportunity to meet and skate with Capaldi, and free Capaldi DC product was also distributed. Contest results Capaldi won the first Battle at the Berrics after beating Benny Fairfax in a flatground game of \\"S.K.A.T.E.\\" (a game in which two contestants engage in a \\"battle\\", whereby the tricks performed by the lead skater must be repeated by the other skater—letters from the word \\"skate\\" are assigned each time a trick is not successfully repeated and the losing contestant is the first skater to complete all of the letters). Capaldi was selected as a competitor for the Street League competition, founded by professional skateboarder, Rob Dyrdek. Capaldi competed alongside professional skateboarders such as Sean Malto, Paul Rodriguez, Chris Cole, and Luan Oliviera for three seasons prior to the cessation of his involvement. ESPN Game Of Skate - 2014 X-Games Gold medalist for \\"Real Street\\" - 2015 Media appearances Capaldi has been featured on Fuel TV's \\"New Pollution\\" segment and also appeared on the NBC television network talking about the \\"Battle at the Berrics\\" competition. Personal life Capaldi resides in Simi Valley, California, United States (US) . However, in 2013, Capaldi revealed that even though Simi Valley is his home town, it is \\"time to move\\". Capaldi's brother, Vince, was diagnosed with \\"bone cancer\\", and was scheduled for an operation in 2009 in which a titanium bone substitute would be inserted into his body. Capaldi explained in a 2013 interview that if he wasn't a professional skateboarder, he would most likely be working in a skate shop, or a Foot Locker store after failing at basketball.

It was written in Early Modern Irish, and is based on a Latin translation of an Arabic work De Scientia Motus Orbis by Masha'allah ibn Atharī (c.740–815 AD). Of its 40 chapters, 27 correspond to chapters in Masha'allah and the rest to various classical authors. The name of its scribe and place of composition is unknown, but it is dated by its reference to the use of spectacles.

Early life and education  Furman is the son of psychologist Gail (née Gorman) and real estate developer Jay Furman. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard College in 1994 and then was a Henry Fellow at Oxford University from 1994 until 1995. He received a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1998. From 1998 until 1999, Furman served as a law clerk for then United States District Judge and future United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey. He then served as a law clerk for United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit Judge José A. Cabranes from 1999 until 2000. Furman also served as a clerk to Associate Justice David Souter of the Supreme Court of the United States from 2002 until 2003.  Professional career  Furman worked as a lawyer at the law firm Wiggin & Dana from 2000 until 2002 and again from 2003 until 2004. In 2004, he became a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he served as an Assistant United States Attorney. From 2007 until 2009, he worked in the office of the United States Attorney General as Counselor to the Attorney General. A 2005 article in the New York Observer identified Furman as a potential future Supreme Court nominee.  Federal judicial service  On June 7, 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Furman to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that had been vacated by Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who had taken senior status in January 2011. On September 15, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate floor by voice vote. On February 15, 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed cloture on Furman's nomination. On February 16, 2012, the Senate, by unanimous consent, vitiated the cloture vote on the nomination and agreed to a final vote on the nomination. On February 17, 2012, the United States Senate confirmed Furman in a 62–34 vote. He received his commission the same day. =Notable cases= On March 24, 2018, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced his decision to add a question about citizenship status to the 2020 Census questionnaire, asserting that it was necessary to help the Justice Department enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Two groups of plaintiffs filed lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to block the question. The cases were assigned to Judge Furman, who rejected the plaintiffs' claim that adding the question violated the Enumeration Clause of the United States Constitution, but held that Secretary Ross's decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act and that the Voting-Rights-Act- enforcement rationale was a pretext designed to conceal the true reasons for adding the question. Judge Furman entered an order blocking implementation of Secretary Ross's decision. On June 27, 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed Judge Furman's order, agreeing that the Voting-Rights-Act-enforcement rationale was pretextual. The Supreme Court's decision left open the possibility that Secretary Ross could try again to add the citizenship question to the 2020 Census, but the Trump Administration ultimately decided not to make a second attempt.

The proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers encountered opposition from local residents and was withdrawn in 1967. Potomac River Basin system Brocks Gap Dam was first proposed in the 1920s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, at a cost in 1921 dollars of $1,889,895. The proposal was revived and updated after World War II and advanced in the late 1950s. The dam was to be part of a series of dams proposed by the Corps' Potomac River Basin Report, which envisioned an ambitious series of water storage and flood control dams throughout the Potomac River basin, responding to a perception of need for additional water and a threat of flooding. Brocks Gap is a water gap in Little North Mountain in Rockingham County, Virginia, just upstream from Cootes Store. Description In 1921 a high rock-fill dam was proposed by the Corps of Engineers. The proposal was slightly revised during the 1940s and 1950s. The dam as finally proposed in 1963 was to be of earthfill construction, high and long, impounding a reservoir of , with a surface area of . Most of the long reservoir was planned to be within the boundaries of George Washington National Forest, but not necessarily on Forest Service property. Construction was planned to start in 1969 and be complete by 1973, at a projected cost of $16,437,000. The reservoir was intended to provide water to the towns of Broadway and Timberville, to lower the temperature of the North Fork and to provide reserve water storage capacity for the Potomac River basin, as well as recreation. The reservoir was expected to inundate 17 commercial buildings, 68 farms, 47 houses, a school and two churches, primarily in the small community of Fulks Run. The damsite is flanked by the sandstone abutments of Little North Mountain, which rises more than to the north and to the south. Normal flow would be regulated by an outlet tunnel in the north abutment, with an unregulated spillway at the south abutment for floods. Opposition The dam proposal encountered intense local opposition from residents of the area to be flooded. As early as 1945 the project was condemned by Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd, who objected to property condemnations and public expenditure. By the 1960s community groups had organized a campaign against the dam. Although the project was supported by the National Park Service, the plan was withdrawn in 1967, in favor of small dams on headwater streams, funded by the Soil Conservation Service.

The dress sold out within 24-hours of her appearance in it, and sparked a trend in \\"little blue dresses.\\" Background Brazilian-born London designer Daniella Issa Helayel, known for her eponymous Issa London label, has designed her versatile, form-fitting dresses under that name since 2001. A favourite of Middleton's for years prior to her engagement, she has been seen in Issa dresses through the years and has been called an \\"unofficial brand ambassador.\\" Issa's designs have been seen on celebrities such as Naomi Campbell, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, and Scarlett Johansson, as well as William's cousins, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York. Middleton's sister Pippa has also been seen in Issa's clothing, including Kate's engagement dress design in a red colour, which she wore to an event in 2007. The last time Middleton wore an Issa dress was July 2011. Many suspect she dropped the label from her usual rotation of designers because that same month, Camilla Al-Fayed (sister of Dodi Al-Fayed, who had a romantic relationship with Diana, Princess of Wales and died in the same 1997 car crash) purchased a controlling stake in Issa. Though they have not publicly commented on the matter, the British royals are known to spurn associations with the Al-Fayed family, as Camilla and Dodi's father Mohamed has accused them of orchestrating Diana and Dodi's deaths. Design and Middleton's debut The dress has been described in colour as \\"sapphire,\\" \\"navy,\\" and \\"royal blue\\". The deep blue colour complemented Diana, Princess of Wales' sapphire engagement ring, which her son William presented to Middleton upon their engagement. The long-sleeved, low- cut wrap dress has been described as one of Issa's \\"classic silk jersey dresses\\", and along with the engagement ring, was paired with \\"simple black pumps\\" by Middleton. Designer Issa told People that she was elated that Middleton had decided to wear her dress for the engagement announcement, stating: Reception The dress became an instant hit and sold out almost immediately in both the US and the UK after its debut. Within 24-hours the dress (retailing at £385) completely sold out at London's Harvey Nichols store. Averyl Oates, the boutique's buying director, told Vogue: \\"The dress worn by Kate sold out almost immediately. Issa is one of our best selling brands and the versatility of the pieces mean that they can be dressed down for the day and dressed up for special occasions.\\" In New York City, where the dress retails for about $615, Monique Erickson, buyer for Issa retailer Beyond 7, was quoted as saying: \\"People are going crazy for this dress... We have a wait list growing by the day.\\" The dress's popularity helped boost sales by 45% for the Issa London label. For those with a lower budget, a short-sleeved cotton replica of the dress by designer Florence + Fred was released in British supermarket chain Tesco for £16. The dress sold out within one hour of being placed on the Tesco website, and with limited stock available, the store expected to sell-out completely by the end of that week. Tesco's buying director Jan Marchant said: \\"Kate Middleton looked extremely elegant in her choice of outfit and many women wanted to find a high street replica of this now iconic dress. The rate at which the dress sold out online is testament to how influential Kate's style choices are.\\" A poll by celebrity style website MyCelebrityFashion.co.uk ranked the dress as the second most iconic outfit of 2010, beat out only by Lady Gaga's 2010 MTV Video Music Awards meat dress. =\\"Little Blue Dress\\" trend= Middleton's blue dress sparked a trend in \\"little blue dresses,\\" as a more colourful alternative to the famous little black dress. According to Glamour contributing style editor Tracey Lomrantz, \\"Women saw (Middleton’s iridescent Issa dress) and thought, 'I want to look like her.'\\" The colour, with hues ranging \\"from iris to cerulean, navy to indigo and everything between,\\" was spotted across the runways and retailers after the engagement announcement.

Note that the north is at the bottom, and so the map appears \\"upside down\\" compared to modern cartographic conventions. Al-Idrisi is also the author of the historical-biographical Book of Roger. The Kingdom of Africa was an extension of the frontier zone of the Siculo-Norman state in the former Roman province of Africa (Ifrīqiya in Arabic), corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today. The main primary sources for the kingdom are Arabic (Muslim); the Latin (Christian) sources are scanter. The Sicilian conquest of Africa began under Roger II in 1146–1148. Sicilian rule consisted of military garrisons in the major towns, exactions on the local Muslim population, protection of Christians, and the minting of coin. The local aristocracy was largely left in place, and Muslim princes controlled the civil government under Sicilian oversight. Economic connections between Sicily and Africa, which were strong before the conquest, were strengthened, while ties between Africa and northern Italy were expanded. Early in the reign of William I, the Kingdom of Africa fell to the Almohad Caliphate (1158–1160). Its most enduring legacy was the realignment of Mediterranean powers brought about by its demise and the Siculo-Almohad peace finalised in 1180. Background Regarding the motive for the Normans' military involvement in Africa, historian David Abulafia raises three possibilities: religious (\\"the extension of crusading activity into a relatively neglected arena\\"), economic (such as \\"the protection of key trade routes\\"), or imperialistic (\\"an attempt to build a vast Mediterranean empire\\"). =Economic motives= Sicily and Africa had close and growing economic ties during the period 1050–1150. The Sicilians imported gold, shipped by caravan across the Sahara to Kairouan (Qayrawan) and Mahdia (al-Mahdiyya), and cloth manufactured of Egyptian and local flax or cotton imported from India and Sicily. Besides this cotton, the Sicilians exported large quantities of wheat, cheese and processed meats. The Greek Orthodox monastery of San Salvatore in Messina was permitted to export its surplus wheat to north Africa in return for wax for its candles. During this time, Africa (i.e., the old Roman province) underwent rapid urbanisation as famines depopulated the countryside and industry shifted from agriculture to manufactures. The depredations of the Banū Hilal and the Banū Sulaym also destroyed many fields and orchards, and forced the population to seek refuge in the towns. Count Roger I of Sicily (1071–1101) is known to have maintained men in Mahdia to collect export duties, while Roger II (count from 1105, king 1130–1154) twice sent forces against African towns when their rulers defaulted on payments for grain imports. In 1117, when Rafi, governor of Gabès, challenged the trading monopoly of his overlord, Ali ibn Yahyā, emir of Mahdia, he asked Roger for assistance. Rafi was trying to send out a merchant ship from his own port, and Roger responded by sending a small flotilla, which fled when confronted by Mahdian forces. Ali then arrested the Sicilian agents in his town and requested help from his allies, the Almoravids, and Roger pleaded with him to return relations to normal. A low-level naval war of raids and counter-raids ensued between the Normans and the Almoravids into the 1120s. The most serious raid took place against Nicotera in 1122, when women and children were taken captive. In 1135 Roger II made his first permanent conquest (if Pantelleria in 1123 is not counted African). The isle of Djerba, which, according to Arabic sources, \\"acknowledged no sultan\\" and was a den of pirates, was captured by Roger, who carried off many of its inhabitants. Sicilian Muslims participated in the conquest of Djerba, but it is unknown what happened to the ancient Jewish community on the island, which was still there (or re-established) in the early thirteenth century. Djerba gave Roger a base from which to exert more influence over Mahdia, which, unable to pay for its grain, was forced to become a protectorate of Sicily by 1142. Its foreign affairs fell to Roger, who forbade alliances with other Muslim states inimical to Sicily, and probably received its customs revenues in lieu of payment for the grain needed to feed it. Roger also had a right to seize any city rebelling against the lordship of the emir of Mahdia. The emir himself, Al- Hasan ibn Ali, whom Ali ibn al-Athīr calls the \\"prince of Africa\\", was personally indebted to the Sicilian fisc, quite possibly as a result of his luxurious tastes. One Arabic chronicler noted how \\"the accursed one [the king of Sicily] imposed the toughest conditions, and he [the emir] had to accept them, and he offered him obedience so that to all intents he became a mere ‘āmil [governor] for Roger\\". =Religiosity= Two Latin chronicles, Robert of Torigny's Chronica and the anonymous continuation of Sigebert of Gembloux's Chronica, are the only sources to assign religious motives to Roger's conquest of Africa, coming as it did at the same time as the Second Crusade and the Wendish Crusade. Roger is not known to have received any papal approval for his African venture. The Arabic sources do, however, refer to his army as being recruited from all around Christendom, an assertion which may be more hyperbole than fact. Ibn Idhari says that Roger \\"called to arms the people of every Latin country\\". One non-Italian knight, Richard de Lingèvres, did participate in the capture of Tripoli and was rewarded with land in Apulia. He is perhaps the same person as Count Richard of Andria. =Ambition= There is evidence that at least some of Roger's contemporaries, mostly his enemies, saw his conquests in Africa as usurpations. Gervase of Tilbury, in a suspect passage of his Otia imperialia, implies that the Emperor Frederick I, who regarded Roger as a usurper in southern Italy, was upset by his extending his power into the old Roman province of Africa. And according to the Erfurt chronicles, at the Diet of Merseburg in 1135, a delegation from the Republic of Venice complained to the Emperor Lothair III that Roger had seized Africa, \\"one third of the world\\", from the king of Gretia (Greece). This garbled report completely detaches Roger's actions from the interreligious context by making the victim of his predations a Christian ruler. The Venetians' primary concern was Roger's ambition. Even the chroniclers of Roger's own kingdom believed his ambition played a primary role in his involvement in Africa. Archbishop Romuald of Salerno in his Chronicon wrote that \\"because he had a proud heart and a great will to rule, because he was not simply content with Sicily and Apulia, he prepared a vast fleet, which he sent to Africa with very many troops, and [Roger] took and held Africa.\\" The pseudonymous court historian \\"Hugo Falcandus\\", in his Liber de regno sicilie e epistola ad Petrum panormitane ecclesie thesaurarium, also emphasised Roger's desire to expand his kingdom: > [H]e took care no less by force than by prudence to defeat his enemies and > to extend his kingdom to its furthest limits. For he conquered Tripoli in > Barbary, Mahdiyya, Sfax, Gabès and many other barbarian cities after > undergoing many labours and dangers. The incorporation of northern Africa into the Sicilian kingdom would have posed no problems for Roger. The cultural connections between Sicily and northern Africa were stronger than those between Sicily and his own peninsular Italian domains. Rise and fall of Norman rule in Africa The \\"Kingdom of Africa\\" (Regno d'Africa) pinpointed in red In 1087, when the organisers of the Mahdia campaign asked him for his assistance, Roger I, who since 1076 had an economic treaty with the Tamīm ibn Muʿizz, emir of Tunis, refused, saying, \\"As far as we are concerned, Africa is always there. When we are strong we will take it.\\" =Conquest of Tripoli and Mahdia= In 1142/3, Roger II attacked Tripoli, further south down the coast from Mahdia. In 1146 he besieged it and took it. The city had already been depleted by a series of famines and was practically in a state of civil war when Roger's troops assaulted it. It was still an important port on the sea route from the Maghreb to Egypt. Several of the minor emirs in the vicinity of Tripoli sought Sicilian overlordship after this. Yūsuf, the ruler of Gabès, wrote to Roger requesting \\"the robes and letter of appointment making me wāli of Gabès, and I shall be your deputy there, as are the Banū Matrūh who hold Tripoli from you.\\" Roger complied and Yūsuf, in his new robes, read out the letter of appointment to an assemblage of notables. Gabès had long been an irritant to Mahdia, and al-Hasan of Mahdia attacked it and brought back Yūsuf to Mahdia, and stoned him to death. It is possible that Roger's attack on Mahdia in 1148 was a response to this insubordination on the part of its emir, but Ibn al-Athīr suggested that Roger was merely taking advantage of a famine in Africa, despite the fact that he had a treaty with al-Hasan until 1150. In June 1148 Roger sent his admiral George of Antioch, a former Mahdian officer, against al-Hasan. Off the island of Pantelleria the Sicilian fleet encountered a Mahdia ship bearing some carrier pigeons. George had the birds sent home with false messages that the fleet was headed for Byzantium. When the Sicilians reached Mahdia on 22 June, the emir and his court fled the unprepared city leaving their treasure behind. This was seized as booty, but the Sicilians were given only two hours to plunder the city while its Muslim inhabitants took refuge in Christian homes and churches. Roger quickly issued a royal protection, or amān, to all the city's inhabitants. According to Ibn Abī Dīnār, George \\"restored both cities of Zawīla and Mahdiyya; lent money to the merchants; gave alms to the poor; placed the administration of justice in the hands of qadi acceptable to the population; and arranged well the government of these two cities.\\" Food was released to encourage refugees to return. On 1 July the city of Sousse (Susa), ruled by al-Hasan's son ‘Ali, surrendered without a fight, and ʿAli fled to his father in Almohad Morocco. On 12 July Sfax fell after a short resistance. The Africans \\"were treated humanely\\" and an amān full of \\"fine promises\\" was granted for the entire province, according to Ibn al-Athīr. Ibn Khaldun, in his Kitab al-Ibar, records the abuse the Christians of Sfax heaped on their Muslim neighbours. The Banū Matrūh were left in power in Tripoli, and in Sfax Roger appointed Umar ibn al-Husayn al-Furrīānī, whose father was brought to Sicily as a hostage for his son's good behaviour. The Arabic sources are unanimous in presenting Umar's father as encouraging his son to rebel nonetheless. The town of Barasht (Bresk) and the isles of Kerkennah fell to Roger, as did the unruly desert tribes. After the brief period of conquest and acquisition, \\"the dominion of the Franks [Normans] extended from Tripoli to the borders of Tunis, and from the western Maghrib to Qayrawan\\". After the Almohads took the city of Bougie, upon which Roger may have had designs, in 1152, a fleet under Philip of Mahdia was sent to conquer Bône. According to Ibn al-Athīr, Philip was a secret Muslim who treated the inhabitants of Bône gently. =Submission of Tunis and internal unrest= Roger became involved in a war with Byzantium after 1148, and so was unable to follow up his conquests with an attack on Tunis. In fear, the Tunisians sent grain to Sicily in hopes of averting an attack, according to Ibn Idhari. This should probably be seen as tribute and submission, since Ibn Idhar writes that Roger was still in power in the city when the Almohads attacked it in 1159, although he was in fact dead. The Venetian chronicler Andrea Dandolo is probably correct in asserting: \\"and the kings of Tunis paid him [Roger] tribute\\" (regemque Tunixii sibi tributarium fecit). Roger died in 1154, and was succeeded by his son William I, who continued to rule Africa. His accession was taken for an opportunity by the native officials, who clamoured for more powers to tax. The Arabic historians Ibn al-Athīr and Ibn Khaldun, both hoped that Roger would defend his African lands against Almohad extremism and intolerance. After his death, some Muslim officials demanded that sermons be preached against the Almohads in the mosques. The inhabitants of Africa, overwhelmingly Muslim by this time, generally preferred Muslim rule to Christian, and as the Almohads advanced eastward, William I's native governors made contacts with his Moroccan foes. The local uprisings in favour of the Almohads were well- organised, and Ibn al-Athīr and Ibn Khaldun connect them with the contemporaneous Sicilian uprising engineered by Maio of Bari. Among the rebels was Umar ibn al-Husayn al-Furrīānī, and among the cities lost was Zawīla, a suburb of Mahdia. It was reconquered, and served as a place of refuge for Christians escaping Almohad persecution in the last days of Norman Africa. =Almohad invasion= After having regained his authority William sent the fleet against Tinnīs in Egypt (c.1156), which Roger may have attacked as early as 1153/4. In 1157/8—the chronology of these events is difficult to establish—a Sicilian fleet raided Ibiza in the Muslim Balearics. The Italian Arabist Michele Amari suggested that this last was an endeavour to interrupt the Almohads' shipping routes, but Ibiza lies well to the north of the African coast. From Ibiza the fleet had to come to the aid of Mahdia, which was under threat from Almohad forces. All of Norman Africa was essentially abandoned to the Almohads save Mahdia. Tripoli fell in 1158, and Mahdia was under siege from late in the summer of 1159. In response to the Almohad caliph's question, \\"Why did you ever abandon so strongly-fortified a place as that?\\", al-Hasan, who was in his camp, is said to have replied, \\"Because I had few in whom I could place my trust; because food was lacking; and because it was the will of fate.\\" In response, Caliph ʿAbd al-Muʾmin is said to have temporarily abandoned the siege in order to construct two large mounds of wheat and barley. Sfax, which had been in revolt against William for some time, accepted Almohad overlordship during the siege, while the city of Gabès was taken by force. In January 1160 Mahdia was breached and ʿAbd al-Muʾmin gave its remaining Christians and Jews the option of Islam or death. =Afterwards= Hugo Falcandus blamed the fall of Africa, and the resulting persecution of African Christians, on William I and Maio of Bari's intransigence. A final peace with the Almohads was not signed until 1180, when a Sicilian naval vessel intercepted a ship bearing the daughter of the caliph Yūsuf to Spain. According to Pietro da Eboli's Liber ad honorem Augusti, the caliph offered to pay annual tribute in return for the return of the princess. A special office, the duana de secretis, was formed in Palermo to oversee incoming tribute payments. Robert of Torigny even says that two cities, Africa (Mahdia) and Sibilia (Zawīla), were returned to them, but in fact they probably only received warehouses and commercial facilities in these places. After the treaty, the Sicilians and Almohads exhibited a shared interest in stemming the expansion of Ayyubid Egypt, and William II of Sicily turned his attention (1180–82) to the piracy of the Banū Jānīyah who ruled the Balearics and were avowed enemies of the Almohads. Later Anglo-Norman writers refer to a one- line, rhyming poem (monosticum): APVLVS ET CALABER, SICVLVS MICHI SERVIT ET AFER (\\"Apulia and Calabria, Sicily and Africa serve me\\"). Radulphus de Diceto, in his Decani Lundoniensis Opuscula, briefly narrates the Norman conquest of southern Italy and then quotes the above line. Ralph Niger wrote that the line appeared on a seal of Roger II's, while a dubious passage in Gervase of Tilbury says that Roger had it inscribed on his sword. Andrea Dandolo referred to the legend of the sword, which was apparently well known in fourteenth- century Venice. A similar line to the monosticum appears in a mid-twelfth- century encomium on Rouen, the capital of Normandy. The anonymous poet refers to Roger II as \\"ruler of Italy and Sicily, Africa, Greece and Syria\\" and suggests that Persia, Ethiopia and Germany fear him. Administration There is a tradition that Roger, after conquering Africa, took the title rex Africae (King of Africa). According to C.-E. Dufourcq, however, this was a mistake first committed by eighteenth-century copyists, who mistranscribed certain charters, placing Africae in place of Apuliae. There is at least one surviving private Sicilian charter which refers to Roger as \\"our lord of Sicily and Italy and also of all Africa most serene and invincible king crowned by God, pious, fortunate, triumphant, always august\\". Royal charters universally use the title \\"King of Sicily, of the Duchy of Apulia, and of the Principality of Capua\\". One tombstone from Palermo, that of the royal priest Grizantus, dated to 1148, refers to Roger in its Arabic and Judeo-Arabic inscriptions as \\"king (malik) of Italy, Longobardia, Calabria, Sicily and Africa (Ifrīqiyya). =Economy= A gold Sicilian tarì minted at Palermo during Roger II's reign. Sicily depended on African gold for its mints, but the dinars of Africa were of superior gold to the tarìs of Sicily. Control of Africa gave Sicily control of all the sea routes between the western and eastern Mediterranean. Roger II taxed shipping, although he seems to have allowed the local Muslims princelings to collect some tariffs of their own. Ibn Abī Dīnār states that the wāli of Gabès collected taxes in Roger's name. Because of Sicily's good relations with Fatimid Egypt, Italian merchant ships could travel along the entire north African shore in peace during this period. Roger also taxed the overland caravan routes from Morocco to Egypt (\\"Kairouan\\" and \\"caravan\\" are cognates.) More profitable than these were the trans-Saharan caravans carrying paiole gold dust for the mints of northern African and southern Italy. An important stopping point for these was Bougie, which Roger may have attacked during this period, but over which he could not extend authority, although he did maintain links with the deposed emir Yahyā ibn al-ʿAzīz. At Mahdia, Roger I and William I minted dinars of pure gold, 22 mm in diameter and weighing 4.15 g with Cufic inscriptions, probably for internal circulation in Africa. The only two known coins were first discovered by the Tunisian scholar H. H. Abdul-Wahab in 1930. They were a close imitation of a type minted by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir (1020–35) over a century earlier. In Fatimid fashion, the coins have inscriptions in two concentric circles with two lines of text in the centre. The circular text is the same on both sides, while the central text differs. In Roger's coin, it reads \\"Struck by order of the sublime king (al-malik al-muʿaẓẓam) Roger, the powerful through God [Allah], in the city of Mahdia, in the year 543 [of the Hegira]\\", that is, 1148/49, in the outer circle and \\"Praise be to God, it is fitting to praise him and, indeed, He is deserving and worthy [of praise]\\" in the inner circle. The obverse centre reads \\"The King Roger\\", while the reverse centre contains his laqab \\"The powerful through God\\" (al-muʿtazz bi-ʾllāh). William's coin is similar, but is dated to is dated to 549 (1154/5) and replaces Roger's Arabic laqab with his own, al-Hādī bi-Amr Allāh (\\"the Guide according to the command of God\\"). It has been observed that the inscriptions bear a resemblance to those of Robert Guiscard's tarì struck at Palermo in 1072. In both cases the mint would have been staffed entirely by Muslims. =Religion= As ruler of Africa, Roger aimed to encourage Muslim refugees in Sicily to re-settle in Africa, and issued a decree to this effect. He maintained the loyalty of his African domains by offering grain. Norman Africa \\"became rich and prosperous, while the remainder of Barbary and the great part of the Middle East felt the harsh pangs of hunger\\" during this period of constant famines. According to Ibn al- Athīr, Tripoli prospered under Roger: \\"the Sicilians and the Rūm [the north Italians, Greeks, etc.] frequented it [for the sake of commerce], with the result that it became repopulated and prospered\\". Merchants from Genoa with ties to Sicily began trading with Tripoli as well. Roger left religious and judicial authority in local hands, under a local governor (ʿāmil). In each town there was a Sicilian garrison under a Sicilian commander, and a poll tax (jizyah) was instituted on the Muslim communities, similar to that which they had until then exacted from Jews and Christians, but lighter than that which was demanded of Sicilian Muslims at the same time. The local Christian community, largely servile and enslaved, probably benefited from Roger's rule for a time. Bishop Cosmas of Mahdia made a trip to Rome to be confirmed by Pope Eugene III and also to Palermo to visit his new sovereign. The anonymous continuator of Sigebert of Gembloux refers to Cosmas as returning to Africa \\"a free man\\". When Mahdia fell to the Almohads in 1160, Cosmas fled to Palermo. The Christians seem to have suffered under Almohad rule from their association with the Sicilians. The native church in Africa is rarely mentioned after that.

He was noted in the field of Semitic studies for his research work in three main areas: (1) Mandaic studies, (2) Samaritan studies and (3) New Syriac language and literature. Although his scholarly work also covers the far larger range of Arabic and Iranian Studies as well as Theology and History of Religions, most his monographs and a large number of his numerous articles are dedicated to the study of the languages and literatures of ethnic and religious minorities of the Near East, especially the Mandeans, Samaritans and Nestorian Christians (or Assyrians, as they prefer to call themselves). His work is based mainly on extensive field work in various countries of the Middle East, where he personally collected the material used in his studies, thus in many cases preserving the cultural heritage of these minorities from being lost altogether.  Vita  Rudolf Macuch was born on 16 October 1919 in a little village called Dolné Bzince (today Bzince pod Javorinou) in western Slovakia (about 6 kilometers from the city of Nové Mesto nad Váhom) as the son of poor peasants. As a child he visited from 1926 to 1931 the elementary school of his home village, later the Štefánika Gymnasium in Nové Mesto, a high-school that had been opened exactly in the year of his birth, 1919, bringing higher education to one of the remote places of Slovakia. In this excellent school, where he graduated in 1939, he discovered his love of languages, especially Latin and Greek, and the foundation was laid for his later work. Although he would have preferred to study Classical Philology, he chose Theology, since his parents were not able to finance his studies and this was the only possibility of receiving a grant from the Church. After registration in the Lutheran Theological Faculty of Bratislava he visited courses on Bible text criticism by Ján Bakoš, a specialist of Semitic Studies, who had studied with famous Orientalists of his time, Julius Wellhausen, Enno Littman and Mark Lidzbarski, in Göttingen. Becoming aware of Macuch's special talent for languages Bakoš suggested that he study Semitic Languages and offered to teach him Arabic and Syriac personally. During his study of Theology in Bratislava Rudolf Macuch also acted as cultural referent of the Theologian Society in the year 1940/41 and was responsible for the redaction of the journal Evanjelickí Teológ, in which he also published several of his own first articles. After finishing his second state examination in Theology in 1943, he was accepted as a student to the Franz-Rentorff-Haus, a theological school in Leipzig, where he planned to study Semitic Languages and Egyptology. He had, however, no means to finance his studies and his application to leave Czechoslovakia was refused by the military due to the war against Nazi Germany. After his ordination on the 26th of June 1943, he worked as a vicar from 1943-1945 and entered military service in 1944, hoping to continue his studies after the war. He resigned immediately his position as vicar when the war ended in 1945 after having received a grant from the French government enabling him to continue his study of Arabic and Semitic languages in Paris for two years (1945–47) at the Ecole nationale des langues orientales vivantes and the Ecole pratiques des hautes études. There he attended the courses of Professors Blachère and Sauvaget in the field of Arabic Studies and those of Professors Dhorme, Dupont-Sommer, Février, Virollaud, among other prolific scholars, in the field of Semitic Studies. Living in the Cité Universitaire he came into contact with students from different nationalities and met his later wife, Irandokht Shaghaghi, from Iran who studied Hygiene at the Faculty of Medicine. In the meantime Rudolf Macuch's former teacher, Ján Bakoš, had left the Theological Faculty and became the first Ordinarius for Semitic Studies at the Philosophical Faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava. This enabled Macuch to register as Bakoš's PhD student at the Philosophical Faculty, where he submitted his thesis on Slovanské mená a výrazy u arabských geografov (“Slavic Names and Expressions in Arabic Geographies”). He had already started to prepare this work in Paris, collecting the material directly from mostly unedited Arabic manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale during the second year of his studies. He finished his doctorate on June 30, 1948, with the grade summa cum laude. After receiving the position of assistant at the Institute of Semitic Studies in Bratislava in 1948-49, Macuch married his fiancé on March 31, 1949. They decided to travel to Iran, where he could study Persian and Arabic manuscripts and come into contact with living Aramaic languages and dialects, in order to prepare his habilitation. Before departing he wrote his first monograph to be published, Islám a Krest’anstvo (“Islam and Christianity”), in order to finance the journey to Iran. Shortly after their arrival in Tehran their only child, a daughter named Maria Macuch, was born on January 1, 1950.For a far more personal account see Maria Macuch, “’And Life is Victorious’ Mandaean and Samaritan Literature – In Memory of Rudolf Macuch (1919-1993)”, (in: Rainer Voigt [ed.], “Und das Leben ist siegreich!” “And Life is Victorious” – Mandäische und samaritanische Literatur/Mandean and Samaritan Literatures. Im Gedenken an Rudolf Macuch/In Memory of Rudolf Macuch (1919-1993). Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, pp. 9-16) and M. Macuch, “’Behalte den Flug in Erinnerung…’ – Leben und Werk von Rudolf Macuch”, (in: Sláva šl’achetným III. Liptovský Mikuláš: Spolok Martina Rázusa 2014, pp. 61-72). Although it had been planned otherwise, Macuch was not able to return to Bratislava because of political reasons. He refused to follow an order of the Czechoslovakian embassy to return immediately because of the reign of terror established by the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia under Antonín Novotný after his departure. By refusing to obey, he lost his nationality and his work at the University of Bratislava and became a refugee in Iran. He began working as a teacher in an American missionary school, Community School, in Teheran, where he taught French, Latin and German. In 1954 he also received the position of dānešyār, “extraordinarius”, at the University of Teheran for Semitic Languages. With his experience in learning languages, he learned Persian very quickly and was able to publish his first article in that language in the spring of 1950 with the title Nuf­ūz-e Zardošt dar dīn-e Yahūd wa-MasīḥNur-e ǧahān II, 3, Teheran 1950. (“Zarathustra’s Impact on the Jewish and Christian Religions”). The most important achievement of these years, however, was his discovery of a hitherto unknown vernacular dialect spoken by the Mandaeans of Ahwāz (Khūzistān) during his field research in 1953, which he described in his Handbook of Classical and Modern Mandaic. Although this work was finished in 1955, it took 10 years to be brought out, since the publisher, Akademie-Verlag, in East Berlin, having accepted the manuscript, failed to print it. It was finally brought to West Berlin and published by Walter de Gruyter in 1965. In 1955 Macuch published a review of Lady Ethel Stefana Drower’s work The Haran Gawaita and the Baptism of Hibil-Ziwa in a renowned German scholarly journal.Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft 105 (1955), pp. 357-363. Although the review was extremely critical, it was exactly this kind of criticism that convinced Lady Drower that he was the best living specialist on Mandaic. She arranged for the Faculty of Oriental Studies in Oxford to invite him to work with her on A Mandaic Dictionary, which she had been planning for some time. After moving to Oxford with his small family, Macuch worked for two years, from 1957-1958, checking the material put into his disposition by Lady Drower, combining it with his own lexicographical collections, adding missing references, establishing meanings and etymologies. Although it was a feat of daring to engage in writing the dictionary within the timespan of two years under the conditions of that period (mechanical typewriter, no Internet, many relevant lexical works out-dated or still missing), he delivered the manuscript on time. After spending several months in America and Canada in a futile search for a position at one of the Universities, Rudolf Macuch returned with his family to Iran, where his fortune finally turned. He started a lively correspondence on scholarly subjects with Franz Altheim, Professor of Ancient History of the Orient at the Freie Universität Berlin. Altheim had never met Macuch personally, but was nevertheless deeply impressed by his vast knowledge in the field of Semitic Studies and personally committed himself to bringing him to Berlin. After long years of waiting and desperation Rudolf Macuch finally received the call he had been longing for to the chair of Semitic and Arabic Studies at the Freie Universität Berlin in June 1963 at the age of 43. The call to Berlin opened all the possibilities he had wished for over the years. He could finally dedicate himself entirely to his vocation without having to worry about financial problems, which had threatened him all his life, and could make use of all the privileges given to him as a full professor (Ordinarius). In Berlin he immediately began realizing different projects, working on the two other specialities he has since become famous for: Samaritan and New Syriac Studies. He undertook several long voyages to Nablus, where he came into contact with the Samaritans and collected Samaritan manuscripts, establishing the worldwide most extensive specialist library, including rare and valuable manuscripts, which has since been the goal of scholars of Samaritan from various parts of the world. He himself dedicated his work of the following five years to writing his Grammatik des samaritanischen Hebräisch (“Grammar of Samaritan Hebrew”), published in 1969. His next project in this field of study was the Grammatik des samaritanischen Aramäisch (“Grammar of Samaritan Aramaic”), published in 1982. These two grammars have become standard reference works for every student and scholar in the field. During this time Macuch also established his third main field of research, New Syriac, which is represented by two monographs: the Neusyrische Chrestomathie (“New Syriac Chrestomathy”, 1974 together with Estiphan Panoussi), and his monumental Geschichte der spät- und neusyrischen Literatur (“History of Late and New Syriac Literature”), published in 1976. This latter work was the result of decades of meticulously collecting literary works and journals written in Syriac, which were mostly unknown even to specialists of this field before this book was published. Although research in these two fields absorbed many years of his life, he never ceased to continue work in his first speciality, Mandaic Studies. Besides numerous articles, he published a monograph Zur Sprache und Literatur der Mandäer (“On the Language and Literature of the Mandeans”) in 1976, dedicated to Lady Ethel Stefana Drower, and the Neumandäische Chrestomathie mit grammatischer Skizze, kommentierter Übersetzung und Glossar (“New Mandaic Chrestomathy with Grammatical Outline, Commented Translation and Glossary”) in 1989. Towards the end of his life he worked with the Mandean Sheikh Čoheylī on New Mandaic texts, the results of which appeared in his monograph Neumandäische Texte im Dialekt von Ahwāz (“New Mandaic Texts in the Dialect of Ahwāz”) two months after his death on July 23, 1993, at the age of 73. Rudolf Macuch's work was by no means restricted to these three areas. He has dedicated numerous articles to many relevant fields of research in Arabic and Semitic Studies, being interested as a philologist not only in the languages of the said minorities, but also especially in the culture and identities of the people he was working with. He kept in touch with friends, informants and colleagues over many decades, corresponding with them in letters filling several thick volumes in different languages and scripts, English, French, German, Slovak, Czech, Russian, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Mandaic and Syriac.A part of his scholarly correspondence with Lady Drower has been recently published by Jorunn J. Buckley, Lady E.S. Drower’s Scholarly Correspondence. Leiden, Boston: Brill. 2012. He saw language as the most important prerequisite to communicating with people of other cultures and tying bonds across ethnical and religious barriers. Scholars of the field appreciate his work worldwide and he is esteemed in his homeland, Slovakia, as one of the renowned humanist scholars of Europe (even a small planet in the Asteroid girdle, discovered by Peter Kolény and Leonard Kornoš in 1998, has been named after him: 24974 Macúch).See also the volume of a conference held in honour of prominent Slovaks, Ján Juráš and Daniela Kodajová (ed.), Sláva šl’achetným III. (“Glory to the Noble”) Liptovský Mikuláš: Spolok Martina Rázusa 2014. He received numerous honours for his life achievement, one of which was his designation as a member of the Norwegian Academy of Sciences on March 10, 1988 – an honour bestowed on only a few distinguished scholars.  Scholarly achievement  Rudolf Macuch's scholarly work encompasses contributions to a large range of disciplines: (1) Theology and History of Religions; (2) Arabic and Iranian Studies; (3) Semitic Studies, with his most important research in three specialities, (a) Mandaic, (b) Samaritan and (c) New Syriac. Since he employed an interdisciplinary approach in his work, these various fields are so intertwined that it is hardly possible to describe his contributions to them separately without risking repetitions – an attempt which is nevertheless undertaken in the following overview for the sake of clarity.For an appreciation of his scholarly work see also in his Festschrift Heinz Pohl and Sylvia Powels, „Rudolf Macuch zu Ehren“ (in: Maria Macuch, Christa Müller-Kessler, Bert G. Fragner [eds.], Studia Semitica necnon Iranica Rudolpho Macuch septuagenario ab amicis et discipulis dedicata, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz 1989, pp. 9-23). = Theology and Religious History = Due to his first field of study Rudolf Macuch's first publications were dedicated to religious and theological topics, many of which appeared in the Slovak journal Evanjelickí Teológ. Among these contributions three articles documenting his early interest in Old Testament studies and comparative religious history may be mentioned here: “Marcion’s Views of the Old Testament” (“Marcionove názory na Starý zákon”Evanjelickí Teológ III (1940/41) fasc. 4, pp. 45–48.), on the first century Christian heretic Marcion and his condemnation of the Old Testament; “Obadiah’s Prophecy” (“Proroctovo Abdiášovo”Evanjelickí Teológ III (1940/41) fasc. 7, pp. 81–84; fasc. 10, pp. 113–119.), a discussion of the “Book of Obadiah”, attributed to the Jewish prophet Obadiah (ca. 5th century B.C.); and “The Creation of the World in the Biblical and Babylonian Tradition” (“Stvorenie sveta v podaní biblickom a babylonskom”Evanjelickí Teológ V (1942/43) fasc. 1, pp. 12–18.). His first published monograph Islám a Krest’anstvoLiptovský Mikuláš: Tranoscius 1950. (”Islam and Christianity”) is mainly an introduction to Islamic history and culture with a chapter on parallel developments in Christianity, which was so well received in the year of its publication that it was reprinted the following year (then repressed during the long Communist regime of Antonín Novotný in Czechoslovakia). He returned to the topic of Christianity and Islam towards the end of his life, planning an extensive monograph titled Kritik der monotheistischen Religionen (“Critique of the Monotheistic Religions”), which remained fragmentary due to his demise and was not published. His continuing interest in religious questions is, however, documented in other publications, in which he repeatedly discussed the texts he was studying also from this perspective, using his philological findings for a better understanding of their historical and cultural context, among others “Gnostische Ethik und die Anfänge der Mandäer” (“Gnostic Ethics and the Beginnings of the Mandeans”F. Altheim und R. Stiehl: Christentum am Roten Meer. Vol. II. Berlin 1973, pp. 254–273.); “The Importance of Samaritan Traditions for the Hermeneutics of the Pentateuch”;Proceedings of the First International Congress of the Société d’Ètudes Samaritaines, Tel Aviv 1991, pp. 13-31. “The μεταγράφαι of Jesus’ Words in the Gospels and the Traditional Pronunciation of Samaritan Aramaic”.Graeco-Arabica V (1993) pp. 13–18. Other contributions relevant to this area, especially in connection with the Mandean religion, can be found in his main fields of research described below. = Arabic Studies and subjects relevant to Iranian Studies = Macuch's dissertation Slovanské mená a výrazy u arabských geografov (“Slavic Names and Expressions in Arabic Geographies”) is an attempt to read and explain a large range of enigmatic Slavic names and terms in Arabic geographies, the material for which he had collected from manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (see Vita above). The topic is of utmost interest for Slavic Studies, since the oldest of these Arabic geographies were written before the emergence of Slavic literatures. Expressions transmitted in them could therefore contribute to our knowledge of the oldest and even pre-literary levels of the Slavic languages, but unfortunately the Arabic authors hardly ever noted the terms correctly, leading to numerous problems of reading and interpretation. Although his mentor Bakoš and other teachers pressed him to publish this work immediately, he himself was not satisfied with the results and wanted to include different readings from manuscripts which he had not yet consulted. He never published his thesis due to circumstances beyond his command, which is most unfortunate, since to this day no one has tried to solve the extremely difficult problems connected with Slavic terms and names in the Arabic sources. His focus of interest shifted to other areas, but he returned occasionally to topics in the field of Arabic Studies in several important articles, among these „Zur Vorgeschichte der Bekenntnisformel lā ilāha illā llāhu“Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft 128 (1978) pp. 20–38. (“On the Prehistory of the Creedal Statement lā ilāha illā llāhu“); “On the Problems of the Arabic Translation of the Samaritan Pentateuch”;Israel Oriental Studies 9 (1979 [printed 1983]), pp. 147–173. and a lecture on the “Discrepancy between the Grammarians” (“Iḫtilāf an-naḥwiyyūn”)University al-Miniā 1981 (Scriptum. With preface by Muḥammad ʿAwīs, Director of the Department of Arabic Studies, Mūǧaz ʿan at-taʾrīḫ al-ʿilmī li-l-ustāḏ al-almānī az-zāʾir Brūfosīr Duktūr Rudolf Macuch ..., pp. ʾ–g). held in Arabic at the University of al-Mini­ā, Egypt, in 1981. He was actively involved in establishing an international, interdisciplinary research group on Graeco-Arabic topics, thus combining his first interest, Classics, with his later vocation. He wrote reports on the conferences of the Research Group in order to introduce their achievements to the scholarly community,“First International Congress on Arabo-Islamic and Byzantine Studies in Thessaloniki”. In: Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft 130 (1980), p. *27*; “First International Congress on Greek and Arabic Studies in Athens“ (1.9.–24.6.1983). In: ZDMG 134 (1984), pp. *70–1*; “Second International Congress on Greek and Arabic Studies in Delphi” (1.6.–6.7.1985). In: ZDMG 136 (1986), pp. *36–7*. became the honorary President of the Graeco-Arabic Society in Delphi and helped establish a journal dedicated to this field, Graeco-Arabica. His own contributions include articles on “Greek Technical Terms in Arabic Sciences”;Graeco-Arabica 1 (1982), pp. 11–34. “Greek and Oriental Sources of Avicenna’s and Sohrawardi’s Theosophies“;Graeco-Arabica 2 (1983), pp. 10–22. “Pseudo- Callisthenes Orientalis and the Problem of Ḏū l-qarnain”.Graeco-Arabica 4 (1991), pp. 223-264. He also published several articles, most of them in Persian, on subjects relevant to Iranian Studies. His first contribution shortly after his arrival in Iran, “Nufūḏ-e Zardošt dar dīn-e Yahūd wa- Masīḥ“Nūr-e ǧahān, II, 3, Teheran 1950. („Zarathustra’s Impact on the Jewish and Christian Religions”) has already been mentioned above. Another long article in three parts is dedicated to specific problems of the Aramaic language (“Imperial Aramaic” or “Reichsaramäisch”) in the Achaemenid period, “Zabān-e ārāmī dar dowre-ye haḫāmanišī.

(„On Old Iranian Onomastics in Aramaic Secondary Sources“). = Semitic Studies =  Mandaic and Mandeans  Macuch made major contributions to this field, one of his three main specialities, to which he dedicated many years of his life. Seeking to study the East Aramaic language of the Mandeans, a small gnostic sect living in the Iranian province of Khūzistān, bordering on the Persian Gulf, in Ahwāz near the Karun river, he contacted them in 1953. Although it was known that Mandeans lived in Khūzistān, no one had hitherto tried to consult them in order to check the linguistic and contextual controversies involved in the study of classical Mandaic texts. Macuch undertook the journey in order to study the traditional pronunciation of classical Mandaic, but he discovered to his own surprise that the language was still spoken there as a vernacular dialect, hitherto unknown to Semitists. He was able to make phonetic recordings of the spoken modern dialect, in which classical forms and vocabulary still partly continued, with the help of Nāṣer Ṣābūrī, the “ritual slaughterer” of the community, and to become acquainted with the traditional pronunciation of the Mandean priests. Although the modern idiom, being overlaid by foreign influences, especially from Persian and Arabic, differs from the language of the classical Mandaic texts, it was, as Macuch found out, important for understanding the linguistic phenomena of the classical tongue. It served as a guide to the study of the phonetic structure of classical Mandaic and to the traditional pronunciation of the literary and liturgical language. After having received 30 microfilms containing the essential Mandaic literature and related fields from Prof. Roemer (University of Mainz) he began to analyse the material he had gathered during his field research and to undertake a meticulous comparison of the colloquial and traditional languages. The result of this work was published in his monograph Handbook of Classical and Modern MandaicBerlin: Walter de Gruyter 1965., in which he undertakes a parallel description of both idioms. Although this work was already finished by 1955 it took ten years to be published due to circumstances already mentioned above (see Vita). It was not Macuch's goal to replace Theodor Nöldeke’s classical Mandaic Grammar of 1875, but to complement it, especially in his treatment of Mandaic phonetics on the basis of the modern vernacular, leading to several corrections of the latter’s conclusions. The Handbook is an extensive treatment of the topic, in which the phonetics, morphology and essentials of syntax in both the classic (in bold letters) and modern idioms (in italics) are explained with a large number of examples for every phenomenon. The analysis of the new material also made it possible to divide Mandaic into three periods: classical (ending with the redaction of the Ginza, ca. 7th century), post-classical and the modern language, a division which delivers an important key for the critical analysis of Mandaic literature, although a precise limitation of the duration of these periods is not possible. The Handbook led to a large number of reviews over the years, thirteen of which are discussed extensively by Macuch in a later book dedicated to the memory of Lady Drower, Zur Sprache und Literatur der Mandäer.Berlin: Walter de Gruyter 1976. Mandeans also resided in South Iraq, where their religion and texts were studied by one of the most prolific authors in this field, Lady Ethel Stefana Drower, who was, however, a self- made scholar and felt the need to collaborate with an academic expert in her next enterprise. In 1955 Macuch wrote a critical review of one of Lady Drower’s publications (see Vita above) which led to his invitation to Oxford in order to work with her in preparing A Mandaic DictionaryOxford: Clarendon Press 1963.. Lady Drower had collected a large number of hitherto unknown manuscripts during her stay in Iraq (the “Drower Collection” of the Bodleian Library Oxford), hereby laying the foundation for this large work, which was completed by the material recorded by Macuch in Khūzistān and the card index by Mark Lidzbarski for the classical religious texts. The dictionary is therefore based not only on literary sources, but also includes the vocabulary of the vernacular described by Macuch in his Handbook and comparative material from other Semitic languages. He also published vast textual material, including both ancient sources and texts in the modern vernacular, demonstrating that already in early times there was a gnostic literary language attributed to the priests, the naṣuraiia (“observers”), besides the spoken language of the laity, the mandaiia (“Mandeans”). A form closer to the vernacular than the language of the sacred books is preserved in ancient magic texts and formulae from a different sphere of religious beliefs. He dedicated a long article in two parts (1967 and 1968) to the decipherment and editing of lead rolls inscribed with Mandaic charms, „Altmandäische Bleirollen“First part in: Franz Altheim and Ruth Stiehl, Die Araber in der alten Welt, vol. IV, Berlin 1967, pp. 91–203; pp. 626–631; Second part in: Altheim/Stiehl, Die Araber in der alten Welt, vol. V. Berlin 1968, pp. 34–72; pp. 455–468. (“Old Mandaic Lead Rolls”). The first part discusses the largest lead roll, incised in the smallest scribal hand known so far, containing a row of various charms with noteworthy spelling variants that do not correspond with the standard classic Mandaic orthography. That he was able to read most of it and tried to get some sense out of it can be considered a major achievement, since only two very easily legible Mandaic lead rolls had been published so far. The edition of several shorter lead scrolls followed in the second part. His work on New Mandaic texts include several contributions over the years, beginning with an article in the Festschrift of his mentor, Ján Bakoš (“The Bridge of Shushtar. A Legend in Vernacular Mandaic with Introduction, Translation and Notes”Stanislav Segert (ed.): Studia Semitica philologica necnon philosophica Ioanni Bakoš dicata. Bratislava: Slovenská akadémia vied 1965, pp. 153–172.). In later years two monographs are dedicated to analysing and preserving New Mandaic texts: Neumandäische Chrestomathie mit grammatischer Skizze, kommentierter Übersetzung und GlossarWiesbaden: Harrassowitz 1989. (“New Mandaic Chrestomathy with Grammatical Sketch, Annotated Translation and Glossary”) and Neumandäische Texte im Dialekt von AhwāzWiesbaden: Harrassowitz 1993. (“New Mandaic Texts in the Dialect of Ahwāz”). Both books include extensive chapters on the grammar besides a phonetic transcription of the texts, translation and glossary. The latter publication was prepared with the help of Sheikh Sālem Čoheylī, a priestly candidate from Ahwāz, who had written to Macuch asking him for help in perfecting his knowledge of classical Mandaic, since he had opened a unique Mandaic school for children and adults in Ahwāz. Using his sojourn in Berlin in 1990, which was financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), to record texts, Macuch discovered that strange differences exist in the phonetics and morphology of the Čoheylī tribe in comparison to his earlier source of the fifties, the Ṣābūrī tribe. His last monograph discusses these divergent grammatical features based on chosen oral texts recorded in his sessions with the Sheikh. His numerous articles in this field are dedicated to several controversially discussed problems, especially regarding the origins of the Mandeans and their religion, in „Alter und Heimat des Mandäismus nach neuerschlossenen Quellen“Theologische Literaturzeitung 82 (1957), col. 401–408. (“Age and Homeland of the Mandeans According to New Sources”), „Anfänge der Mandäer“Franz Altheim and Ruth Stiehl: Die Araber in der alten Welt. vol. II. Berlin 1965, pp. 76–190 and 589 f.

Torino 1993, pp. 165–173.) and comparative studies, „Der keilschriftliche Beschwörungstext aus Uruk und die mandäische Phraseologie“Festschrift Ewald Wagner zum 65. Geburtstag. Band 1 Semitische Studien, Beirut 1994, pp. 186-198. (“The Cuneiform Incantation Text from Uruk and Mandaic Phraseology”).  Samaritan Studies  After his call to the chair of Semitic and Arabic Studies in Berlin in 1963 Macuch dedicated many years to studying the linguistic and literary traditions of another dwindling ethnic minority, the Samaritans of Palestine, who cultivate their own religious customs and have their own liturgy and rites. The Samaritans, well known in the Christian tradition as deviants from mainstream Judaism from the parable of the “good Samaritan” in the New Testament, accept only their own version of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, which differs from the Masoretic text, the authoritative Hebrew text for Rabbinic Judaism. Macuch contacted the Samaritans in Nablus, where their Holy Place on Mount Gerizim is situated, and spent many months recording the pronunciation of Samaritan Hebrew with the high priest and other priests. He was able to establish the worldwide most extensive specialist library of Samaritan Studies, including valuable original manuscripts, microfilms of dispersed manuscripts from various libraries and institutions worldwide as well as all the monographs and scholarly articles to date at the Institute in Berlin. This collection of material was so unique that it attracted scholars from different regions of the world, even from Jerusalem, the centre of Samaritan Studies, to work in Berlin. Besides organizing the library Macuch worked five years on his Grammatik des samaritanischen HebräischBerlin: Walter de Gruyter 1969. (“Grammar of Samaritan Hebrew”), which is a through treatment of the differences between Samaritan and Jewish-Masorean Hebrew in orthography, phonology, morphology and syntax. As to the pronunciation of Samaritan Hebrew, which is interesting from the point of view of linguistic history, he did not rely on his predecessors Z. Ben-Ḥayyim and A. Murtonen, but used his own recordings of texts from his sessions with the Samaritan priests in Nablus. The language is problematic, since the Samaritans were far more flexible in their handling of the sacred text than the Jews, with the result that Samaritan-Hebrew manuscripts show not only numerous variants to the Jewish-Masoretic text, but also among themselves. The Grammar is an especially important contribution to the linguistic history of Hebrew. Macuch's other extensive monograph in this field, his Grammatik des samaritanischen AramäischBerlin: Walter de Gruyter 1982. (“Grammar of Samaritan Aramaic”), was an even more difficult task to achieve due to the complicated state of the sources. Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible were translated between the 3rd century BC and the 9th century AD into the colloquial language of Palestine, Aramaic, then enlarged and commented on. No grammatical study of the language of these texts had been hitherto undertaken, since there was still no reliable edition of the Aramaic translation (Targum) of the Samaritan texts before 1980. The material for this grammar had to be extracted from the original unedited manuscripts. After the critical edition of the first part of the Samaritan Targum (books Genesis and Exodus) by A. Tal appeared in 1980, Macuch was able to add this material to his own extensive collection from Samaritan Aramaic literature and complete the Grammar, another meticulous contribution to linguistic history, giving access to difficult texts important for the study of other Aramaic dialects. Specific linguistic problems of this field were also analysed in several articles on „Der liquide Apikal und die apikale Liquide des samaritanischen Hebräisch\\"R. Stiehl and H. Stier (ed.): Beiträge zur Alten Geschichte und deren Nachleben. Festschrift für Franz Altheim. Berlin 1970, pp. 169–175.

New Syriac language and literature  Macuch's third major speciality is dedicated to the study of the language and literature of the Nestorian Christians residing in Iran and Iraq, who call themselves “Assyrians”. His monograph Neusyrische ChrestomathieWiesbaden: Harrassowitz 1974. (“New Syriac Chrestomathy”), conceived together with Estiphan Panoussi, is the first collection of excerpts and examples from a large range of different literary texts written in New Syriac from various periods, beginning in 1848 up to the 1970s. Most of the texts are written in the dialect of Urmia, others in the dialects of Iraq, Alqoš and Sanandaǧ. Besides a short grammatical sketch, the book contains a detailed glossary, in which all the idioms are taken into consideration. His next major achievement in this field, the monumental Geschichte der spät- und neusyrischen LiteraturBerlin: Walter de Gruyter 1976 (recently reprinted by Georgias Press, Piscataway, NJ, 2014). (“History of Late and New Syriac Literature”), is the first work on Syriac literature after the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. He had already begun to collect the material for this difficult undertaking years ago in Iran, bringing together the texts from a large range of different literary sources, books, articles and numerous journals, among these several rare publications, difficult to find at that period and by now completely inaccessible. Besides this material he used three histories of Syriac literature written in Arabic and Syriac. Due to the vast material presented in the book, including an overview of the historical setting of every discussed period, extensive summaries of the literary works and numerous details on the authors, this work has been greeted as one of the most important scholarly achievements of the past decades in this field. The book fulfils two important desiderata: (1) it offers an introduction to the hardly known Late Syriac literature since the Mongolian invasion in the 13th century, and (2) it presents a unique overview of the huge range of literary works produced in New Syriac, many of which were still completely unknown even to specialists of this field before its publication. Two other contributions give summaries of the history and literary history of the Assyrians, “Assyrians in Iran I.: The Assyrian community (Āšūrīān) in Iran. II: Literature of the Assyrians in Iran”,Encyclopaedia Iranica. Bd. II, 1987, pp. 817–824. and “Tūr ʿAbdīn through the Ages”.Abr-Nahrain, vol. XXIX (1991) Louvain, pp. 87–105.  Other Aramaic studies  As a scholar with an exceptionally broad range of knowledge in Semitic languages, Macuch also published articles on other topics besides these three major fields, especially in the area of comparative Aramaic studies: „Gesprochenes Aramäisch und aramäische Schriftsprachen“F. Altheim and R. Stiehl: Christentum am Roten Meer. Bd. I. Berlin 1971, pp. 537–557. (“Spoken Aramaic and Aramaic Written Languages”), “A ‘Revised Reading’ of an Aramaic Papyrus”;Journal of the American Oriental Society 93 (1973), pp. 58–60. „Hermeneutische Akrobatik aufgrund phonetischen Lautwandels in aramäischen Dialekten“Orientalia Suecana 33–35 (1984/6), pp. 269–283. (“Hermeneutic Acrobatics due to Phonetic Change in Aramaic Dialects”); “Recent Studies in Palestinian Aramaic”Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 50 (1987), pp. 437–448.; “Recent studies in Neo-Aramaic dialects”;Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies LIII, part 2, 1990, pp. 214–223. “Some Orthographico-phonetic Problems of Ancient Aramaic and the Living Aramaic Pronunciations”;MAARAV 5–6 (1990), pp. 221–237. “Some lexicographical problems of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic”.Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies LV (1992), pp. 205–230.  Significance of Macuch's work today  Macuch's major publications, his Mandaic Handbook and Dictionary, his two Grammars in the field of Samaritan Studies and his History of Late and New Syriac literature are standard works of Semitic Studies, still indispensable tools for all working in these disciplines today. Despite new findings and scholarly progress in many details over the decades, these works based on a meticulous analysis of original sources and field research have not yet been replaced by similarly extensive studies. This may be due to the fact that every new attempt to analyse this vast material would be judged in the scholarly community by the high standards set by Macuch's work. The textual sources presented in his other monographs are major contributions, since they preserve rare material, which would otherwise have sunk into oblivion. His field research in these areas has contributed to the preservation of age-old cultural traditions, many of which would have been lost irretrievably in the course of the political turmoil of the past decades in Iran and the Near East.

French (born June 29, 1981) is an American politician who was the supervisor of the Town of Beekman, New York. He was the 2011 Democratic nominee for Dutchess County executive. Early life French was born in the Bronx to parents Jack, a union painter, and Carolyn. The family moved to the Town of Beekman when French was seven years old. As a student at Arlington High School, French played on the varsity soccer team until his graduation in 1999. He still plays the sport today. After high school, French graduated from Binghamton University in 2003 with a degree in history, 11 days before the death of his father. To support his family, French moved back to Beekman and worked shifts as a substitute teacher and waiter. French ran for town council later that year, after responding to a newspaper advertisement searching for candidates. He lost by 66 votes, less than two percent of votes cast. Career In 2004, French won a special election to the town council at the age of 23. He was reelected in 2005, receiving the largest number of votes of any council candidate. To supplement his work as a councilman, French enrolled at the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs & Policy and earned a Master's Degree in Public Administration in 2006. Upon receiving that degree, he was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Elections in Dutchess County. Two years later, then-Governor David Paterson appointed French to the board of trustees at Dutchess Community College for a six-year term. With the seat vacated by three-term incumbent John D. Adams, French entered the race for Beekman Town Supervisor in 2009. He defeated a fellow council member, Republican Barbara Zulauf, with 59% of the vote. As supervisor, French was credited with balancing the budget without an increase to property taxes, and returning $383,000 to the town's rainy day fund. 2011 County Executive campaign On April 7, 2011, French announced his candidacy for Dutchess County Executive, an open seat after 20-year incumbent William Steinhaus said he would not seek reelection. In its convention on June 6, French won the nomination of the Dutchess County Democratic Party in a unanimous endorsement. French also obtained the Working Families Party nomination, but was unsuccessful in winning that of the Independence Party. A May 20 meeting of six members of the party's interim executive committee did not grant French an authorization, thereby refusing a primary for the nomination. On July 14, the French campaign announced that it had obtained 5,000 signatures to obtain ballot status, exceeding the legal requirement by 3,000 names. Conflict emerged when Conservative Party leaders submitted Republican opponent Marcus Molinaro's paperwork after the deadline. Expecting that the Republican elections commissioner would accept the papers, the French campaign sued to dismiss them; ultimately, however, commissioners of each party ruled the submission invalid. Throughout August, French received a wave of over a dozen union endorsements. He especially received attention for joining members of the Communications Workers of America on the picket line during the union's strike against Verizon. He then lost.

Function  Malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate, utilizing the NAD/NADH cofactor system in the citric acid cycle. The protein encoded by this gene is localized to the cytoplasm and may play pivotal roles in the malate-aspartate shuttle that operates in the metabolic coordination between cytosol and mitochondria and clitera. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.  Regulation  The acetylation of MDH1 activates its enzymatic activity and enhance intracellular levels of NADPH, which promotes adipogenic differentiation. Methylation on arginine 248 (R248) negatively regulates MDH1. Protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4/CARM1) methylates and inhibits MDH1 by disrupting its dimerization. Arginine methylation of MDH1 represses mitochondria respiration and inhibits glutamine utilization. CARM1-mediated MDH1 methylation reduces cellular NADPH level and sensitizes cells to oxidative stress. Besides, MDH1 methylation suppresses cell growth and clonogenic activity.

After passing qualification examinations for elementary school and middle school, he graduated from the Dae-Jeon Art High School, and made his famous debut on the 2011 season of Korea's Got Talent. He was the first runner-up of the talent show. Early life Sungbong Choi was born in Seoul, and was abandoned at an orphanage when he was three. He ran away from the orphanage to escape physical abuse, took a bus to Daejeon, and started living in the red light districts. His approach to Jeong-So Park for a music lesson was a life-changing event. Park agreed to teach him for free and got him more support from the church and ChildFund Korea. =Education= After passing elementary school and middle school through qualification examinations, Choi graduated from Dae-Jeon Art High School, and went on to the Department of Cultural Art Management at Kyung-Hee Cyber University. During his troubled youth, Choi claims he hid at a night school when he was 14 to escape area gang members. He learned how to read and write and applied for qualification examinations to pass elementary and middle school and enter high school. With hopes of learning music and spending his school years with friends, he entered Dae-Jeon Art High School. To earn school tuition fee and private lesson fees, he worked at a delivery service, but he suffered a grave injury while working the night shift. Choi seriously thought about dropping out of high school, and his music teacher testified that he was often absent because of the underprivileged surroundings. He gained admission to Hanyang University, but due to financial difficulties, was unable to pursue undergraduate education. Instead, he spent his days working as a day laborer. Career =Korea's Got Talent= On 6 June 2011, Choi's performance of Ennio Morricone's \\"Nella Fantasia\\" on Korea's Got Talent moved judges and audience members to tears. He introduced himself as a manual laborer who had made a living selling gum and energy drinks for ten years. All three judges, Kolleen Park, Jang Jin and Song Yun-ah, were impressed with his vocal talent. Choi advanced to the finals of the competition, finishing second by only 280 votes. =YouTube sensation= Choi's performance clip was posted to YouTube and triggered a worldwide Internet sensation, receiving praise from pop stars Justin Bieber, BoA, Jung- Hwa Um, several hundred thousand fans on Facebook and also political figures including South Korea's former president Lee-Myung-Park. One version with English subtitles has triggered international press interest and a worldwide view that Choi was \\"the next Susan Boyle\\". The video itself has received over 168,201,756 views as of May 31, 2017, and the number is still rising. As of September 24, 2020 the video has 175,078,474 views. =Controversy= On 4 June 2011, after his first appearance on the show, some people accused him of concealing the fact that he had graduated from art high school although he was rarely able to attend classes due to his financial situation and was said to have received his diploma out of pity. The KGT production team explained that \\"It was cut from the film during editing. He stated that he'd graduated from art high school at the second local tryout, and the judges, crews and hundreds of audience members heard that.\\" KGT later broadcast the re-edited version including the statement. =Entertainment= After his appearance on KGT, other major entertainment companies tried to persuade Choi to sign contracts with them and he signed up with Sony Music Korea Inc. but cancelled the contract in December 2011.

Egó's first drummer was Jóhann Ridar (aka “Motorhead”), and for a while guitarist Ragnar Sigurðsson played along with them. Jóhann and Ragnar were replaced by drummer Magnús Stefánsson and Tómas Magnús Tómasson. Bubbi Morthens, the frontman and main lyricist in the band had been part of influential punk/rock/reggie band Utangarðsmenn, but had been fired from the band for reportedly having a \\"big ego\\", which was also allegedly the reason for the band name \\"Egó\\".http://www.last.fm/music/Eg%C3%B3  History  Bubbi Morthens, founder and lead singer of Egó Egó's first tour was in Reykjavík. Their debut album, Breyttir Tímar was released on April 1, 1982, and it quickly became one of the best selling albums in Icelandic music history. It stayed in the second place on the Icelandic album chart and stayed in the top ten for 19 weeks straight. During the promotional tour for the album, Þorleifur quit the band and was replaced by former Utangarðsmenn bassist, Rúnar Erlingsson. Egó's second album Í Mynd, came out in late 1982. It was considered by most people to be better than the previous album. However, they lost a big part of their sound when Magnús Stefánsson decided to leave the band on tour in Scandinavia. He was replaced by Jökull Úlfsson. Also, the keyboard player Gunnar Rafnsson joined the band. Both Bubbi and Magnús have said in interviews that they don't have any recollections or memories whatsoever from this time period; mostly because they were all in deep drug use at the time. Finally it was internal conflicts within the band that led to its demise. The relationship between Egó and their record label had also gotten to the point where Egó had broken up as a group, but still recorded one more album due to the contract they had previously signed. According to this contract, they were obligated to release one more album, which did not get very good reviews. Most people believe that at this point in their career, Egó were fed up with each other and only did the third album to satisfy the record label, not out of their own willingness or excitement to make a new record. Therefore, the album is only OK, and doesn't sound like there is much work behind it. After the release of the self-titled third album (working title \\"Bless\\" or \\"Goodbye\\", which pretty much says it all) the band broke up in different directions. However, in 2001, the members of Egó reunited to release a compilation under the title of Frá Upphafi til Enda. Later in 1984, Bubbi returned to Iceland and formed a rock and roll band called Das Kapital and released an album called Lili Marlene. Only he has had any success or fame since Egó broke up, as he to this day has released many solo career albums, mostly with acoustic guitar oriented pop / rock music. Also, it should be mentioned that Magnús Stefánsson has been credited by many people as the best Icelandic punk rock drummer ever. A few years after leaving Egó on tour in Scandinavia, he joined one of Iceland's most successful pop / rock /funk band; Sálin hans Jóns míns.

Williams Jr."},{"id":"32016058","text":"The history of horse domestication has been subject to much debate, with various competing hypotheses over time about how domestication of the horse occurred. The main point of contention was whether the domestication of the horse occurred once in a single domestication event, or that the horse was domesticated independently multiple times. The debate was resolved at the beginning of the 21st century using DNA evidence that favored a mixed model in which domestication of the stallion most likely occurred only once, while wild mares of various regions were included in local domesticated herds. In the 20th century, various ideas were postulated. One set hypothesized multiple ancestral body types of the single species Equus ferus or the original wild horse, each adapted to a given environment.Bennett, Deb (1998) Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship (First ed.). Solvang, CA: Amigo Publications. . OCLC 39709067. pp 6-8 Another hypothesis held that prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. Yet another proposed that the theoretical prototypes were each separate species or subspecies. These theories were all based on body types and conformation, prior to the availability of DNA for research, and have since been superseded by modern studies.  Theories  In the past, several theories were proposed about the origin of the domesticated horse and how the variety in horse breeds developed. They generally can be subdivided in two categories, single origin versus multiple origins. =Single origin= The single origin theory holds that domestication occurred once, after which all breeds arose through selective breeding. =Multiple primitive types= Equus caballus germanicus front leg, teeth and upper jaw at the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin A theory associated with James Cossar Ewart in Scotland and Johann Ulrich Duerst in Germany postulated three primitive horse types, considered subspecies of Equus caballus, as ancestors of modern breeds. They were: *\\"Forest Horse\\", Equus caballus germanicus, descendant of a \\"Diluvial Horse\\", Equus caballus silvaticus *Asiatic Wild Horse or Przewalski horse, then considered Equus caballus przewalskii *Tarpan, then considered Equus caballus gmelini. To these Elwyn Hartley Edwards adds a fourth, the \\"Tundra Horse\\", supposedly ancestor of the Yakut pony, and \\"largely unconsidered by hippologists\\".Elwyn Hartley Edwards (1994) The Encyclopedia of the Horse London: Dorling Kindersley pp.14–15, 22–23 A later theory associated with European scholars such as Jimmy Speed, Ruy d'Andrade, Hermann Ebhardt and Edward Skorkowski, postulated four basic body types, which were not considered to be named species. They were: * Pony Type 1, in northwestern Europe, resistant to cold and wet, similar to the modern Exmoor pony * Pony Type 2, in northern Eurasia, larger than type 1, resistant to cold, similar to the modern Highland pony and Fjord horse * Horse Type 1, in central Asia, resistant to heat and drought, similar to the modern Sorraia and Akhal-Teke * Horse Type 2, in western Asia, small and fine-boned, resistant to heat, similar to the modern Caspian horse. American paleontologist Deb Bennett\\"Dr. Deb Bennett,PhD\\"Deb Bennett, List of publications postulated that the early form of E. caballus developed into seven subspecies,Bennett, pp.5-6 of which four supposedly contributed most to the ancestry of the domesticated horse, both directly and via assorted crossbred lineages between them.Bennett, p. 7 These were: *\\"Warmblood subspecies\\", Equus caballus mosbachensis, the oldest hypothetical subspecies, supposedly ancestor of the Latvian horse, Groningen horse and some warmblood breeds. *\\"Draft subspecies\\", Equus caballus caballus, ancestor of the Exmoor Pony, Shetland pony, Suffolk Punch and Belgian horse. *\\"Oriental subspecies\\", Equus caballus pumpelli, adapted to arid climates, thought to be the progenitor of the modern Arabian horse, Plateau Persian and Marwari horse. *\\"Tarpan\\", Equus caballus gmelini or Equus caballus ferus, supposed ancestor of Przewalski's Horse as well as the Konik, Vyatka horse, Hucul and most Mongolian horses. The other three proposed subspecies were: * the Przewalski Horse, Equus caballus przewalskii * the \\"Lamut Horse\\", Equus caballus alaskae and * the \\"American Glacial Horse\\", Equus caballus laurentiusEvans, James Warren (1992) Horse breeding and management World Animal Science C7. Amsterdam; New York: Elsevier Health Sciences or Equus caballus midlandensis.  Current theory  Modern genetic evidence now points at a single domestication event for a limited number of stallions, combined with repeated restocking of wild mares into domesticated herds. This suggests that different body types might be a combination of both selective breeding and semi-feral landrace traits. A study in 2012 that performed genomic sampling on 300 work horses from local areas as well as a review of previous studies of archaeology, mitochondrial DNA, and Y-DNA suggested that horses were originally domesticated in the western part of the Eurasian steppe. Vera Warmuth, Anders Eriksson, Mim Ann Bower, Graeme Barker, Elizabeth Barrett, Bryan Kent Hanks, Shuicheng Li, David Lomitashvili, Maria Ochir-Goryaeva, Grigory V. Sizonov, Vasiliy Soyonov, and Andrea Manica. Reconstructing the origin and spread of horse domestication in the Eurasian steppe Proceedings from the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 2012 109 (21) 8202-8206; published ahead of print May 7, 2012, doi:10.1073/pnas.1111122109 Both domesticated stallions and mares spread out from this area, and then some additional wild mares were added from local herds; wild mares were easier to handle than wild stallions. Most other parts of the world were ruled out as sites for horse domestication, either due to climate unsuitable for an indigenous wild horse population or no evidence of domestication. It remains possible that a second, independent, domestication site might exist in the Iberian Peninsula, but the study could neither confirm nor disprove that hypothesis.Lesté-Lasserre,Christa. Researchers: Horses First Domesticated in Western Steppes, The Horse June 13 2012, Article # 20162 The Przewalski's horse (now Equus ferus przewalskii) is currently believed to be unrelated to the modern domestic horse, though studies using DNA have had varied results. Recent mitochondrial DNA analysis suggests that the Przewalski and the modern domestic horse diverged some 160,000 years ago.O A Ryder, A R Fisher, B Schultz, S Kosakovsky Pond, A Nekrutenko, K D Makova. \\"A massively parallel sequencing approach uncovers ancient origins and high genetic variability of endangered Przewalski's horses\\". Genome Biology and Evolution. 2011 Studies using DNA have been inconclusive. A 2009 molecular study using ancient DNA (that is DNA recovered from archaeological finds like bones and teeth) places the Przewalski's horse in the middle of the domesticated horses. These difficulties exist in part due to crossing domestic horses into the Przewalski's horse as well as the limited genetic variation present in the founder population of the modern Przewalski's Horse. Chariot burials about 2500 BCE present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as working animals. Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven, approximately 3500 BCE.Chamberlin, J. Edward Horse: How the Horse has Shaped Civilization New York:BlueBridge 2006 One theory proposed was that the modern horse is descended from the Botai culture (in present-day Kazakhstan) where horses were milked and possibly ridden more than 5,000 years ago. A study of ancient and modern horse DNA concluded that modern horses do share a small amount of DNA with Botai horses but modern horses are not descendants of Botai horses. Przewalski's horse and Botai horses were both descendants of another domesticated horse they called the Borly4.

He was sworn in on July 18, 2011 after defeating Chris Romer in a runoff election on June 7, 2011. He was easily reelected with no significant opposition in 2015. He was re-elected in 2019, to a third term. He is Denver's second African American mayor after Wellington Webb. Biography Born in Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, Hancock moved with his family to Denver as an infant. He and his twin sister are the youngest of ten children.About Counc. Michael B. Hancock According to a DNA analysis performed on his behalf, he descends mainly from enslaved Cameroonians.Cameroonian-Americans Discover Ancestry Lost in Slave Trade Posted by Irene Zih Fon, Reporter. During the 1986 Denver Broncos Super Bowl season, Hancock was the Broncos' mascot \\"Huddles,\\" making $25 an hour. Hancock graduated from Denver's Manual High School (1987) and earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Hastings College in Nebraska (1991). He also earned a Masters of Arts degree in public administration management from the University of Colorado Denver. At the time he was elected mayor, Hancock was in his second term as a member of the Denver City Council from the 11th district. During his tenure on the City Council from July 20, 2003 to July 18, 2011, he served two terms as council president, the last ending in 2008. Hancock and former Colorado State Senator Peter Groff co-wrote the book, Standing in the Gap: Leadership for the 21st Century, published in 2004. On May 8, 2012, Hancock visited the city of Reykjavík and met the mayor of Reykjavík, Jón Gnarr, in Höfði. Hancock was named a 2014 Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow. Hancock is married to actress and vocalist Mary Louise Lee. They have 3 children. Hancock serves as a deacon at the New Hope Baptist Church.Michael Hancock running on reputation, enthusiasm', Michael Booth. Denver Post. April 6, 2016. Retrieved May 13, 2018 Professional life Hancock started his career in the early 1990s, holding down two jobs at the Denver Housing Authority and the National Civic League—while also pursuing a master's degree. At the Housing Authority, he designed, implemented and oversaw the first-ever athletic, cultural and leadership-training programs for 11,000 inner-city kids living in public housing. Hancock also helped write a state law outlawing drug possession within 100 feet of public housing. With the National Civic League, Hancock helped communities, nonprofits and other clients all over the country craft and enact strategic plans to solve economic and budget challenges, increase civic participation and improve governance. He joined the Metro Denver's Urban League affiliate in 1995 as program director at a time when the economic-empowerment and civil rights organization was struggling—struggling so much that his first paycheck bounced. Undaunted, Hancock rose through the ranks, developing a strategic plan, overseeing day- to-day operations and leading fundraising efforts. He became Executive Vice President, interim President and then President in 1999. At 29 years old, Hancock was the youngest leader of an Urban League chapter anywhere in the United States. He developed a talented staff, created a nationally recognized and award-winning job training program, and built private sector partnerships with companies like Qwest, Comcast and AT&T.; Denver City Council After almost five years as President of Metro Denver Urban League, Hancock stepped down in 2003 when voters in northeast Denver's 11th District elected him to the Denver City Council and was re-elected in 2007. His council peers unanimously chose him to serve two terms as Council President from 2006 to 2008. He presided over the creation of the Denver Pre-School Initiative, strategies to fight foreclosures, and the implementation of the largest infrastructure improvement in Denver history. While on the City Council, Hancock was a leader on neighborhood issues, citywide finances, economic development, and children's issues. Mayor of Denver Hancock's road to the Mayor's Mansion began with political domino effects. Then- Governor Bill Ritter announced on January 5, 2010, that he wouldn't seek re-election to a second term due to low approval ratings and struggling polling numbers in the 2010 Gubernatorial election. It was rumored that then-United States Secretary of the Interior and former United States Senator Ken Salazar was going to run (considering Salazar had won statewide office as Colorado State Attorney General in 1998 and 2002 and United States Senator in 2004), but on January 7, he announced he wouldn't seek the governorship and endorsed two-term Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper for the governorship. Five days later, Hickenlooper announced his candidacy for the governorship and he went on to defeat Republican nominee Dan Maes and former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo of the Constitution Party in a three-way race on November 2, 2010 with 51.0% and was re-elected in 2014. Hickenlooper's election to the Colorado Governor's Mansion opened up the Mayor's office, which began a free-for-all. In the May 3, 2011 First Primary: Hancock was among the final 2 finishers against State Senator Chris Romer. Romer led the first round with 31,901 votes (28.49%) to Hancock's 30,314 votes (27.04%). Hancock went on to defeat Romer in the June 7, 2011 Runoff election in a landslide with 70,780 votes (58.08%) to Romer's 51,082 votes (41.92%). Hancock was inaugurated as the 56th Mayor of Denver, Colorado on July 21, 2011.

Between 1838 and 1844, it was published as The Southern Australian. History = The Southern Australian = The Southern Australian was founded by the Crown Solicitor, Charles Mann, and James Hurtle Fisher. The printer was Tasmanian Archibald Macdougall and James Allen was the editor; they had offices in Rundle Street, perhaps on Allotment 45 on the north side, towards King William Street. The newspaper was founded as an opposition to South Australia's first newspaper, the South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register, edited by George Stevenson. As private secretary to Governor John Hindmarsh (as well as holding a number of other government appointments) Stevenson espoused a strong party line in the pages of The Register. He was also notoriously outspoken against those who disagreed with Governor Hindmarsh, and was taken to court many times for libel, and even once was attacked in the street by Robert Torrens in response to his articles.South Australian, 13 March 1849, p. 2 A clear aim of the newspaper was to provide a different perspective to The Register. The new publication incorporated the Government Gazette, a useful source of revenue and guarantee of circulation previously held by The Register. > It is needless to shew that up to this time we have had no Free Press in the > Colony. It will on all hands be admitted that one Journal devoted to > sectional interests in the community, does not realize the idea entertained > of a Free Press. ...

Although its stated purpose was to provide more balanced news reporting in the infant colony, a second aim was clearly to also give a very critical analysis of the news reporting of the rival newspaper. > The Register of last Saturday informed the public, that upwards of twenty > persons were buried in the Cemetery during the previous week, and that they > had principally died from the slow fever, which it reported was prevalent. > The truth is, that only four or five persons have been buried during the > last few weeks ... The slow fever, of course, is equally apocryphal. We > cannot suppose the Editor such an idiot as to publish a statement of this > kind knowingly. We charitably presume it to be a very cruel hoax, to which > system our solemn brother seems to be peculiarly subject.Southern > Australian, 22 March 1844, p. 2 The Southern Australian was a mixture of advertisements for the city auctioneers, the expanding mines at Burra and Kapunda, the Queen's Theatre and local shops; together with long court reports and news from Britain and the other Australian colonies. A 'local news' column covered South Australian news. Local horse racing was well represented in its pages. Initially the newspaper was published weekly on a Saturday, then Wednesdays from 9 January 1839, and Thursdays from 12 December 1839, at the price of sixpence per four- page issue (perhaps $30.00 in today's values); six pages from 30 January 1840. From May 1840 it became bi-weekly, published on Tuesdays and Fridays at sixpence for four pages. The original editor, James Allen, left in 1842 when he purchased the Register. = The South Australian = In 1844 the proprietor, Richard Blackham, sold the newspaper to Andrew Murray, who changed the newspaper's title to The South Australian, but without any interruption to the publication numbering. In July 1851 the newspaper became weekly again and the following month it ceased altogether. This was probably due to the rush to the Victorian gold fields, when South Australia lost much of its male work force and the colony suffered an economic downturn.

It was called a \\"national tragedy\\" by the then-president Ronald Reagan and inspired a song by pop singer Pat Boone, with the fetuses finally buried in 1985. No criminal charges were filed against any of the parties involved. Weisberg had stored the specimens properly but had not disposed of them due to financial difficulties. Discovery Malvin Weisberg had operated Medical Analytic Laboratories in Santa Monica from 1976 until March 1981. He purchased a 20-foot (6.1 m) storage container in 1980, delivering it to his Woodland Hills home and paying for it with a bounced check for $1700. The container was repossessed on February 3, 1982, by the Martin Container Company, based in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The company tried to unload the container from the truck into the patio, but the weight of the container broke the guinch. The workers were then asked to remove some of the cardboard boxes inside in order to lighten up the container, but the bottom of one of the boxes opened up and spilled out bottles that opened, revealing something which wasn´t not identified by the worker. He then called the manager, who identified it as a human body. Other workers started vomiting at the sight. The initial press conference, on February 5, 1982, by the Los Angeles County Health Department said up to 500 fetuses were found. On February 24, 1982, the count of fetuses was raised to approximately 2000, with the majority of them being from the storage container and 200–300 from Weisberg's garage. The tally of fetuses was estimated at \\"up to 17,000\\" in May 1982, and was later finally set at 16,431. A count of 193 fetuses were evidently over 20 weeks' gestation, with the oldest almost 30 weeks. State law required the fetuses to be cremated or buried \\"within a reasonable time\\". Source and age of the fetuses The fetuses resulted from pregnancies terminated by licensed physicians, clinics and hospitals who contracted Medical Analytic Laboratories for pathology testing and disposal of the fetuses. The Los Angeles County District Attorney, John Van de Kamp, said the fetuses would be individually examined and charges would be filed against the doctors if fetuses were over the 20-week gestation limit allowed by California law at the time. Officials found 193 fetuses that appeared to be over the 20-week limit. Van de Kamp wanted to turn the remaining fetuses over to groups who would perform memorial services on them. In May 1982, California Attorney General George Deukmejian stated the gestation limit of the 1967 California abortion law was considered unenforceable because of conflicts with the 23-week Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, but fetuses could be individually examined to determine viability, which was the legal limit. In late May, Van de Kamp stated every fetus would be examined to determine if the fetus was aborted illegally. Legal action In 1982 President Ronald Reagan wrote a letter advocating for memorial services \\"for these children\\", referring to it as \\"this national tragedy\\". The matter came in front of the judge because of a lawsuit filed against Van de Kamp by Carol Downer of the Los Angeles Feminist Women's Health Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. John Lynch, the chief deputy county counsel stated it was inappropriate to enjoin Van de Kamp, who was simply a \\"man in the middle\\", and that the lawsuit should be filed against pro-choice groups instead. In June 1982, Los Angeles County Superior Court judge Dickran Tevrizian issued a temporary restraining order against Van de Kamp to prevent the unconstitutional release of the fetuses to groups for burial, but allowed him to legally dispose of the fetuses, called \\"vague\\" by John Lynch, the chief deputy county counsel. In October 1982, Van de Kamp petitioned the court to allow the burial of all but the 193 late-term fetuses in common graves at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery, which offered free burial. The fetuses were not buried at Valhalla, which later stated it offered the burial plot because \\"the right-to-life groups came to us, and we said we wouldn't endorse any political viewpoint, but we thought that interring the bodies was a proper thing to do as a service\\". In December 1982, Los Angeles Superior Court judge Eli Chernow ruled the 20-week limit was unconstitutional, also ruling that Van de Kamp could bury the fetuses and pro-life groups could hold onsite memorial services. By July 1983, the district attorney was Robert Philibosian, who stated he preferred a \\"dignified burial\\" and would not file charges. In July 1984, the California Courts of Appeal overturned Superior Court of Los Angeles County judge Eli Chernow, ruling the fetuses could not be buried as human remains, which was a win for pro-choice groups and feminists. The case had been appealed by Carol Downer of the Los Angeles Feminist Women's Health Center and the American Civil Liberties Union and was denounced by the California Pro-Life Medical Association, the Catholic League. The appealing parties argued that allowing pro-life groups to bury the remains violated the separation of church and state. The Court's opinion stated \\"it is clear from the record that the Catholic League is a religious organization which regards a fetus as a human being and abortion as murder. While this specific belief may well cross sectarian lines... any state action showing a preference for this belief will be strictly scrutinized and must be invalidated\\". Since fetal remains are normally incinerated without ceremony, there was no reason to do otherwise with these fetuses, stating \\"We perceive that the intended burial ceremony will enlist the prestige and power of the state. This is constitutionally forbidden.\\" However, religious services could hold concurrent onsite memorial services, which was praised by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in a letter to the California Pro-Life Medical Association, admiring their decision \\"to hold a memorial service for these children\\". Philibosian announced he would appeal the ruling allowing onsite memorial services. In October 1984, U.S. Supreme Court justice William Rehnquist refused to overturn the state appeals court ruling allowing the religious ceremonies. This was officially upheld by the Supreme Court in March 1985. Pro-life service In May 1985, singer Pat Boone announced he recorded a song titled \\"Sixteen Thousand Faces\\" about the incident, first played at a pro-life memorial service for the fetuses at Live Oak Memorial Park in Monrovia, where a granite tombstone was left with the inscription \\"For all those deprived of life and human love through abortion\\". In response, the California Abortion Rights Action League director said the service and marker \\"[humanized] fetuses when they deny the humanity of women already born\\". The ceremony was attended by \\"several hundred anti-abortionists\\", including Representative Bob Dornan and the Feminists for Life group. At the time, the fetuses had not been disposed of. Disposition In August 1985, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ordered the fetuses be turned over to the Guerra-Gutirrez- Alexander Mortuary for burial. Per the court's order, the mortuary was selected because they did not have a religious affiliation. At the time, it was noted by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services that the fetuses had been kept in \\"five pine boxes\\". The department assured ACLU that there were no identifying marks on canisters containing the fetuses, and ACLU stated they would not object to a secular burial. While ACLU would not object, the Feminist Women's Health Center petitioned the Los Angeles Superior Court to block the burial, but the courts refused. The disposition occurred on October 6, 1985, with the fetuses in six pine boxes, which were buried at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Boyle Heights. The pro-life group Feminists for Life didn't plan a full memorial service since they held a service in May, but the Americans Committed to Loving the Unwanted held a service. The Feminist Women's Health Center was dismayed over the public burial. About 250 individuals attended the service, including County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, who read a message from Ronald Reagan but stressed his attendance was in an unofficial capacity. Reagan's message stated \\"Just as the terrible toll of Gettysburg can be traced to a tragic decision of a divided Supreme Court, so also can these deaths we mourn. Once again a whole category of human beings has been ruled outside the protection of the law by a court ruling which clashed with our deepest moral convictions.\\" Others in attendance were Representative Bob Dornan, state Senate President David A. Roberti, and state Representative Joseph Montoya. The pro-life group Americans Committed to Loving the Unwanted organized the service, including requesting a three-man Marine Corps color guard, who placed an American flag on a box and stood at attention throughout the service. Financial fallout Weisberg's Medical Analytical Laboratories received nearly $175,000 in Medi-Cal payments, with $88,000 coming from pathology tests on aborted fetuses. Of this, half of it ($44,000) was paid federally through the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). By the Hyde Amendment, this money was ineligible for testing on pre-abortion or post-abortion tissue, which meant the state of California would need to pay back federal funds claimed by Weisberg and by any other laboratories, according to HHS inspector Richard P. Kusserow. Kusserow also stated \\"prior to its closing in April, 1981, [Medical Analytical Laboratories] had routinely submitted questionable billings under the Medi-Cal program, using an erroneous billing code.... the case lacked criminal prosecutive merit due to a lack of proof that the false billings were intentional. Because the laboratory was out of business, and its owner had declared bankruptcy, there were no assets against which to proceed for civil recovery\\".

They were one of a number of promising Melbourne bands that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s that also included, amongst others, The Glory Box, Ripe, Autohaze, The Fauves, The Killjoys, The Hollowmen and Sea Stories. The band's early sound was described as 'songs that have a lot of energy and rock along with power, yet they project this depressive mood that most bands can only get by playing slow. It's a neat trick.'http://www.nkvdrecords.com/praytv.htm The band had various members over the years, with the only consistent members being Aidan Halloran (vocals) and Martin Kennedy (guitar/bass). Joseph Kennedy, Martin’s brother, was the drummer for most of the band's existence. Their debut 7\\" vinyl only single ‘In My Street/A Foreign Land/Surf Nazis’, along with the 6 track, 12\\" vinyl only EP ‘Sure’ were released in 1989 on Mr Spaceman. Both of these releases were recorded by Perri and Bo at the Phantom Tollbooth in Carlton, Melbourne. Shortly after these releases, Kennedy joined Ascot Vale band Mr Floppy as drummer, but left shortly after. The 7\\" vinyl only single ‘Spent/She Fell’ was released by Au Go Go Records in 1990. The 7\\" vinyl only single ‘Cold Dog Strew/Lone Stiff/Still Searching/Sounds of Silence’ was released in 1991 on Shock Records and was lifted from their debut CD LP ‘Flux’ of the same year. Their second LP ‘Paydirt’ was released on Shock Records in 1992. The album included a bonus track of the band covering the Hüsker Dü song Sorry Somehow, which was also regularly performed live. The single/EP ‘Aftermath’ from the album also included the cover track. Around this time Pray TV were signed by US label Radioactive and released the 'Aftermath' EP in the US, followed by a series of shows in New York and Los Angeles with Radioactive label mates Live.http://www.myspace.com/praytv In 1992 Pray TV featured on a CD called 'Dress Ups' (Shock Records) with other Melbourne bands The Glory Box and The Fauves,http://www.musiciscrap.com/thefauves/bio.html with each band performing a track from the others repertoire, as well as contributing one original track. Melbourne band Ripe were also intended to take part but didn’t due to other recording commitments. In January 1994 they supported The Smashing Pumpkins at the Prince of Wales in St Kilda, Melbourne. Their third LP ‘Swinger’s Paradise’ was released on Shock Records in 1995. It was produced by Ed Kuepper, formerly of pioneering 1970’s Australian punk band The Saints. On 27 July 1995 they performed on the RMITV show Under Melbourne Tonight Their fourth and final album Westona was released on The Hypnotized Label in 1996 and apart from Halloran and Kennedy, featured a new guitarist and drummer as well as new bass player Russell Baricevic, formerly of Geelong band Bored!. Ashley Naylor of Melbourne band Even occasionally played guitar with Pray TV on studio recordings and also live. Pray TV disbanded in 1997 with a farewell show at the Public Bar in North Melbourne. Post Break up Martin Kennedy resurfaced in the late 1990s with new outfit All India Radio.

Under Sam's guidance 3Wall became one of Southern California's largest owners of multi-family housing. =Hospitality= SBE owns several Los Angeles nightclubs and lounges: Nightingale Plaza, Hyde Sunset, and Hyde Staples Center. As clubs tend to wane in popularity quickly, Nazarian typically only keeps his clubs open for eight months to a year, closes them for extensive renovations, and then reopens them (often under a new name, preferably short) to keep the brand fresh. SBE generally owns each of its venues outright giving it the flexibility to quickly adjust to the vagaries of the market. These venues continue to see a high level of popularity and celebrity patronage, as well as being frequently visited by the characters of HBO's Entourage. Nazarian made an appearance as himself greeting the main characters of the show in the episode \\"No Cannes Do\\". Nazarian's SBE brand has also been featured on episodes of The Hills. Nazarian owns the Hyde Lounge at Staples Center in Los Angeles and he also owns the Hyde at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.

However, they differ from adult ependymomas in which genes and chromosomes are most often affected, the region of the brain they are most frequently found in, and the prognosis of the patients. Children with certain hereditary diseases, such as neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), have been found to be more frequently afflicted with this class of tumors, but a firm genetic link remains to be established. Symptoms associated with the development of pediatric ependymomas are varied, much like symptoms for a number of other pediatric brain tumors including vomiting, headache, irritability, lethargy, and changes in gait. Although younger children and children with invasive tumor types generally experience less favorable outcomes, total removal of the tumors is the most conspicuous prognostic factor for both survival and relapse.  Basic biology  = Cell of origin = Ependymomas are believed to arise from radial glial cells. Tumorspheres derived from ependymomas display a radial-glial like phenotype, expressing neuronal stem cell markers CD133 and nestin, as well as radial glial specific markers RC2 and brain lipid binding protein (BLBP/FABP7). Tumorspheres with radial glial characteristics form tumors in orthotopic mouse xenografts, suggesting radial glial as cell of origin for ependymomas. =Inheritance= A number of genetic syndromes are associated with the development of ependymoma, including neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), Turcot syndrome B, and MEN1 syndrome. However, gene mutations linked to the familial syndromes are rarely found in sporadic cases of ependymoma. For example, NF2 mutations have rarely been observed in ependymomas and MEN1 mutations have only been found in a small number of cases of ependymoma recurrences. =Oncogenic lesions= ERBB2, ERBB4, and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene expression promote tumor cell proliferation, contributing to aggressive tumor behavior. High expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) correlates with unfavorable outcome. Over-expression of kinetochore proteins and down-regulation of metallothioneins are associated with recurrence in ependymomas. KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and phospho-KIT were found to be present in pediatric ependymomas and may be involved in angiogenesis associated with those tumors. =Chromosomal changes= Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments have shown pediatric ependymomas possess a number of genomic anomalies not seen in adult ependymomas. In addition, ependymomas from different locations within the central nervous system (spinal, supratentorial, and infratentorial) can be distinguished by their chromosomal, immunohistochemical, and gene expression differences. Amplification of chromosome 1q and loss of 6q, 17p and 22q are the most common numerical chromosomal changes in pediatric ependymomas. Gain of chromosome 1q (1q21.1-32.1) is more common in the pediatric population and is associated with tumor recurrence in intracranial ependymomas. Moreover, gain of chromosome 1q25 has been found to independent prognostic value for recurrence-free and overall survival. Loss of 22q has been found in both sporadic and familial cases, supporting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene at this location. However, loss of 22q is more common in the adult form than pediatric cases. As NF2 is located on 22q12.2, it was hypothesized to be involved in the development of ependymoma. Though mutations in NF2 are rarely found in sporadic ependymomas other than the spinal form, SCHIP1, a NF2 interacting gene, is significantly down-regulated in pediatric ependymomas, supporting a role for the NF2 pathway in the initiation of ependymomas. =Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes= A variety of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have been found to be mutated or possess altered expression in pediatric ependymomas. KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and phospho- KIT have been suggested to play a role in the development of pediatric ependymomas, NOTCH1 mutations have been found in approximately 8% of pediatric ependymomas, and MEN1 mutations are occasionally found in pediatric ependymomas. MMP2 and MMP14 appear to also play a role in tumor growth and progression in intracranial cases. Two candidate genes, TPR and CHIBBY, have been identified on commonly altered chromosome regions in pediatric ependymomas, chromosomes 1q25 and chromosome 22q12-q13. Expression of two additional candidate genes, S100A6 and S100A4 on chromosome 1q have also been found to correspond to supratentorial tumor development and tumors occurring before the age of 3 years old, though it is unclear exactly what role these genes play in the etiology. = Tumor progression = Ependymomas have been suggested to arise from radial glial cells, suggesting neural stem cell maintenance pathways such as Notch, sonic hedgehog (SHH), and p53 are important for the pathogenesis of ependymomas. Notch signaling pathway and HOX family of transcription factors are up regulated in supratentorial and spinal ependymomas respectively. Over-expression of Notch ligands, receptors, and target genes (HES1, HEY2, and MYC), as well as down-regulation of Notch repressor (Fbxw7) are found in pediatric ependymoma. Inhibition of Notch pathway impairs tumor growth in vitro. Notch target ErbB2 is up-regulated in most ependymomas, correlating with poor outcome. While p53 (TP53) mutations are not often observed in pediatric ependymoma, the p53 pathway is suggested to play a role in radiation therapy resistance and tumor progression, possibly via over-expression of MDM2. Further, up-regulation of p73 (TP73), a homolog of p53, and deletion of the p53 pathway gene p14arf/p16/INK4A (CDKN2A) have also been found in pediatric ependymomas. Over-expression of components of SHH pathway such as GLI1, GLI2, and STK36 implicates deregulation of the SHH pathway in ependymomas. Moreover, over-expression of SHH targets IGFBP2, IGFBP3, and IGFBP5 in ependymoma is also suggestive of a role for SHH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in the pathogenesis of pediatric ependymomas. =Rate of progression= Endothelial cell KIT expression was associated with a young age at diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma or ependymoma. Telomerase activity is found in childhood ependymoma. In addition, telomerase reactivation and maintenance of telomeres appears to be required for progression. Low expression of nucleolin, an interacting protein of telomerase, was found to be the single most important biological predictor of outcome, where low expression correlates with a more favorable prognosis. Clinical biology =Presentation= Symptoms present 1–36 months before diagnosis, and can vary depending on age, tumor grade, and location. Increased intracranial pressure can induce vomiting, headache, irritability, lethargy, changes in gait, and in children less than 2, feeding problems, involuntary eye movements, and hydrocephalus are often noticeable. Seizures occur in about 20% of pediatric patients. Loss of cognitive function and even sudden death could occur if the tumor is located at a crucial location for CSF flow. Pediatric ependymomas most often occur in the posterior cranial fossa, in contrast with adult ependymomas which usually occur along the spine. Ependymomas present as low-density masses on CT scans, and are hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI images. =Pathology= Significant debate remains over grading of ependymomas, though the WHO 2007 classification lists subependymoma (grade I), myxopapillary ependymoma (grade I), ependymoma (grade II), and anaplastic ependymoma (grade III) as the primary classifications. This classification scheme further designates four subtypes within the ependymoma group. However, there are several recognized subtypes of ependymoma with differing pathologies. These include myxopapillary ependymoma (MEPN) which tend to grow slowly and are restricted to the conus medullaris-cauda equina- filum terminale region of the spinal cord, intracranial, infratentorial (posterior fossa), intracranial supratentorial, and spinal ependymoma, and subependymomas. Reports have shown that location-based classification is most relevant to the molecular characteristics, implicating underlying tissue- specificity effects. Ependymomas arise from oncogenic events mutating normal ependymal cells into cancerous cells. Recent evidence suggests the primary cells are radial glia. Genetic alterations are fairly heterogeneous among histologically similar ependymoma tumors. =Diagnostic features= Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments have shown pediatric tumors possess a number of genomic anomalies not seen in adult ependymomas, with a high prevalence of whole chromosome imbalances. Epithelial membrane antigen has been shown to help distinguish ependymomas from other pediatric CNS tumors. Neuraxis MR imaging and lumbar CSF cytology evaluation are widely accepted methods for determining tumor dissemination. =Differential diagnoses= Once a tumor is suspected, medulloblastomas, diffuse astrocytomas, pilocytic astrocytomas, and ependymomas remain in the differential diagnosis as posterior fossa tumors. However, only pilocytic astrocytomas and ependymomas stain positively for Galectin-3. The subtype of ependymoma can also be narrowed down by molecular means. For instance, the myxopapillary ependyomas have been found to have higher expression of HOXB5, PLA2G5, and ITIH2. A gene expression profiling experiment has shown that three members of the SOX family of transcription factors also possessed discriminatory power between medulloblastomas and ependymomas. Without histology, it is difficult to differentiate grade II versus grade III anaplastic ependymomas because there are no anatomical differences on magnetic resonance imaging. =Prognostic features= In general, pediatric ependymomas are associated with less favorable prognoses than adult ependymomas, and ependymomas of younger pediatric patients are less favorable than ependymomas of older pediatric patients (reviewed in ). Tumors that occur in the posterior fossa have also been shown to have a less favorable prognosis. Expression of TERT in pediatric intracranial ependymomas is correlated with telomerase activity and tumor progression and negatively correlated with survival. The protein nucleolin and expression of MMP2 and MMP14 have been found to inversely correlate with progression free survival in cases of pediatric ependymoma, though RTK-1 family members were not correlated. Tumor microinvasion, even in tumors appearing well-demarcated using various imaging modalities, was also found to be inversely associated withprogression-free and overall survival. Some evidence suggests chromosome 6q25.3 deletion may provide additional survival benefit in pediatric ependymomas. =Treatment= Chemotherapy regimens for pediatric ependymomas have produced only modest benefit and degree of resection remains the most conspicuous factor in recurrence and survival. The association of TERT expression with poor outcome in pediatric ependymomas has driven some researchers to suggest that telomerase inhibition may be an effective adjuvant therapy for pediatric ependymomas. Further, data from in vitro experiments using primary tumor isolate cells suggest that inhibition of telomerase activity may inhibit cell proliferation and increase sensitivity of cells to DNA damaging agents, consistent with the observation of high telomerase activity in primary tumors. Additionally, because apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) has been found to confer radiation resistance in pediatric ependymomas, it has been suggested that inhibitors of Ap endo activity might also restore radiation sensitivity. Within the infratentorial group of pediatric ependymomas, radiotherapy was found to significantly increase 5-year survival. However, a retrospective review of sterotactic radiosurgery showed it provided only a modest benefit to patients who had previously undergone resection and radiation. Though other supratentorial tumors tend to have a better prognosis, supratentorial anaplastic ependymomas are the most aggressive ependymoma and neither total excision nor postoperative irradiation was found to be effective in preventing early recurrence. Following resection of infratentorial ependymomas, residual tumor is more likely in lateral versus medial tumors, classified radiologically pre-operatively. Specific techniques, such as cerebellomedullary fissure dissection have been proposed to aid in complete resection while avoiding iatrogenic effects in these cases. Surveillance neuroimaging for recurrence provides additional survival to patients over observation alone. =Biochemical markers= hTERT and yH2AX are crucial markers for prognosis and response to therapy. High hTERT and low yH2AX expression is associated with poor response to therapy. Patients with both high or low expression of these markers make up the moderate response groups. =Relapse= The 5-year disease-free survival for age >5 years is 50-60%. Another report found a similar 5-year survival at about 65% with 51% progression-free survival. The 10-year disease-free survival is 40-50%. Younger ages showed lower 5 and 10-year survival rates. A 2006 study that observed 133 patients found 31 (23.3%) had a recurrence of the disease within a five-year period. =Long-term consequences of treatment= Use of telomerase inhibitors such as Imetelstat seem to have very low toxicity compared to other chemotherapy. The only known side effect of most telomerase inhibitors is dose-induced neutropenia. Neuropsychological deficits can result from resection, chemotherapy, and radiation, as well as endocrinopathies. Additionally, an increase in gastrointestinal complications has been observed in survivors of pediatric cancers.

It was released in 2007 (12 years after his death) through Capitol Records. Unlike several duet albums (for example, fellow Rat Pack singer Frank Sinatra's 1993 duets album), this posthumous one utilizes the archived voice tracks of Martin himself paired with contemporary singers and instrumentalists such as Kevin Spacey, Martina McBride, Shelby Lynne, Joss Stone, Chris Botti, and a few others. Reception Jeff Tamarkin of AllMusic criticizes other vocal artists such as Robbie Williams for his appearance in \\"Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone\\", stating he is out of his league. He also stated that Joss Stone and former American Idol contestant Paris Bennett did not stand a chance. Tamarkin, however, praises the instrumentalists Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and smooth jazz artists Chris Botti and Dave Koz for lightening up the tracks \\"Who's Got The Action\\", \\"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\\" and \\"Just In Time\\" respectively. The only true standout in the bunch with as much certifiable personality as Martin was French artist Charles Aznavour for his duet with Dino on \\"Everybody Loves Somebody\\". The disadvantage was that the original hit single was not used but instead a lesser version. In the end, Tamarkin indicates that \\"it's Dean Martin who saves the day each time out\\".

During his tenure in the House, he represented three different districts in Central Texas and was particularly known for his support of public education. Background Kubiak was the oldest of six children born in Reagan in Falls County to a Roman Catholic couple, John T. Kubiak (1914–2001), a farmer, later garage owner, and a native of Robertson County, and the former Connie M. Snider (1915–1999). He attended elementary and junior high school in Reagan but graduated in 1957 from Marlin High School in Marlin. In 1959, he received an Associate of Arts degree from Blinn College in Brenham in Washington County, Texas. Thereafter in 1962, he received a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Texas at Austin, which he attended on a football scholarship. In 1968, he procured a Master of Education degree from Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He also pursued graduate studies at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He later received a PhD in education from UT-Austin. From 1962 to 1963, he was a mathematics teacher and coach in Vernon, Texas, where he was also a semi- professional football player for the 1962 state champion Vernon Vikings. He then spent five years from 1963 to 1968 at Cypress-Fairbanks High School in Houston. In 1967, he received \\"Teacher of the Year\\" designation from both Cypress-Fairbanks High School and the Texas State Teachers Association.The Texas State Cemetery bases its biography of Representative Kubiak on Mike Peck, \\"Services for Kubiak today in Rockdale\\", The Cameron Herald, September 3, 1998, and information supplied by the Kubiak family. Legislative years Initially, Kubiak was elected to the legislature in 1968 from District 27, when he unseated an incumbent Democrat in the primary election. That district included Milam, Robertson, and his native Falls counties. He was elected the year that U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas declined to seek a second full term in office. There is a photograph on Kubiak's memorial page of a youthful Kubiak speaking with Johnson, probably in the late 1960s. Kubiak was reelected to the state House in 1970, a heavily Democratic year in which Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., won the U.S. Senate race in Texas against future President George Herbert Walker Bush. In 1972, after redistricting, Kubiak defeated an incumbent Democrat in District 36, which included Waller, Washington, Milam, and Robertson counties. He was also reelected in District 36 in 1974, 1976, 1978, and 1980. After his seventh term in the state House, Kubiak lost a Democratic primary race for Texas land commissioner to Garry Mauro of Bryan, a confidant of later U.S. President Bill Clinton. Kubiak's House seat was in turn won by his brother, L. B. Kubiak, a veterinarian. In 1983, Dan Kubiak failed to unseat Republican convert Phil Gramm for U.S. representative in the Bryan-College Station district. A former Democrat, Gramm switched parties to support the administration of President Ronald W. Reagan. Gramm resigned his House seat but retained the post in a special election in which Kubiak was one of Gramm's challengers. In 1984, Kubiak won the Democratic nomination for Congress over State Senator Hugh Parmer of Fort Worth but lost the general election to the still serving Republican, Joe Barton, who succeeded Gramm in the House upon Gramm's election to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by John G. Tower. During the 1980s, Kubiak devoted much of his energy to real estate, farming, and construction projects. In 1990, L. B. Kubiak did not seek reelection, and Dan Kubiak was instead elected to the state House from District 13, which then included Milam, Robertson, Washington and Waller counties. He was reelected in 1992, 1994 and 1996. In 1992, District 13 was significantly redrawn to include Austin, Brazos, Burleson, and Lee counties as well as the continuing Milam and Washington counties. In 1992, as a Bill Clinton supporter, Kubiak won narrowly, 52 to 48 percent over the Brenham Republican Robert Mikeska, who fared particularly well in Washington and Austin counties in the southern end of the district. Thereafter, Kubiak devoted greater time and attention to those counties and won them both in 1996 over the Republican James Hartley. However, the margin in Austin County was a mere thirty-one votes. Death and legacy Kubiak died in 1998 of cardiovascular disease at the age of 60 at his home in Rockdale, while he was again campaigning for reelection.Cameron Herald, Cameron, Texas, September 3, 1998 Oddly, his intraparty rival for land commissioner from 1982, Garry Mauro, headed the Democratic ticket that year in a failed effort to deny a second term to Republican Governor George W. Bush. L. B. Kubiak sought the nomination to succeed his brother, but the party chairmen in the district unanimously turned to Teddy Boehm of Brenham, the wife of a retired physician, Henry Boehm, who had served as chairman of the Blinn College trustees. L. B. Kubiak refused to support Mrs. Boehm and instead endorsed the Republican nominee, Charles B. Jones of College Station, who claimed the seat for the first time in the 20th century for the GOP. According to the Austin American-Statesman, Mrs. Boehm questioned L. B. Kubiak's endorsement: \\"I do wonder if Mr. Jones is such a supporter of Mr. [Dan] Kubiak's principles, why was he running against him?\\" On learning of Kubiak's death, Speaker Pete Laney of Hale Center, said that he was \\"shocked and saddened by the sudden death of our friend and colleague. We have lost a good friend and the people of Texas have lost an outstanding legislator who worked tirelessly on behalf of his constituents to improve public education and to ensure that state tax dollars were spent wisely and efficiently.\\" State Senator Carlos Truan, a Corpus Christi Democrat and the dean of the Senate, described Kubiak as \\"a very, very dedicated legislator, particularly in the field of education.\\" Kubiak monument at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas In 1967, while he was still in the field of professional education, Kubiak published Ten Tall Texans, biographical sketches designed for juveniles and young adults taken from the period in Texas history from 1821 to 1845. Among those featured in the book are Sam Houston, Lorenzo de Zavala, Stephen F. Austin, Jose Antonio Navarro, Ben Milam, Andrea Candelaria (a nurse who survived the siege of The Alamo), Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, Juan Seguin, and William B. Travis. An exhibit entitled Ten Tall Texans was established in 2008 at the Brenham Heritage Museum. It was loaned during 2009 to the Rockdale Depot Museum. In 1984, Kubiak's book was republished by Eakin Publishers under the title Titans of Texas . In 1972, he published a second book, A Monument to a Black Man: The Biography of William Goyens, a study of the African American who served as an aide to Sam Houston and was a negotiator for Indian treaties. A divorced father of three children, Kubiak is interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, as is the prerogative of all state lawmakers. His epitaph reads: \\"God's gift to us is life.

In 1990, his wife, Refugio Araceli Villanueva de Barrera, was murdered in an attack on their car. Members of the Guatemalan military have been implicated in the crime. Early career Guatemalan by birth, Barrera was forced to flee the country after reporting in 1980 that the Guatemalan military was massacring Indian peasants in Quiché Department. He spent the years from 1980 to 1986 in exile, returning to Guatemala following the victory of Vinicio Cerezo's Guatemalan Christian Democracy party. He then became as director of the Agencia Centroamericana de Noticias (Central American News Agency), and vice-president of the Guatemalan Journalists Association. He also served as the founder and editor of a weekly news magazine, La Epoca, which one of its reporters described as being devoted to \\"muckraking pieces on corruption in government and private enterprise, no-holds-barred political analysis, and social investigation on topics like poverty and the environment\\". The magazine only lasted for five months from its inception in January 1988 until its buildings were firebombed. The firebombing was believed to be carried out by members of state security forces, and Barrera subsequently left the country for several months after threats against himself and his family. 1990 assassination attempt On 25 October 1990, Barrera became aware that he was being shadowed by two men on a motorcycle. He reportedly informed President Cerezo's head of security of the tail, and gave officials the license plate number of the motorcycle. The following day, Barrera was driving with his wife, Refugio Araceli Villanueva de Barrera, and an unidentified friend when they stopped at a traffic light at the corner of the 35th street and the Calzada Aguilar Batres in Zone 11 of Guatemala City. A motorcycle pulled alongside Barrera's car and the riders opened fire with an automatic weapon or weapons. Refugio Villanueva de Barrera was killed instantly, while Byron Barrera and their friend were injured and hospitalized. Barrera later attributed his survival to a bulletproof vest he had recently begun to wear. After recovering from his injuries, Barrera took his two children into exile in Costa Rica. \\"I have had to explain the truth to my children\\", he stated in a November open letter. \\"The people of their country who are conspicuous for their ideas of freedom are assassinated.\\" Investigation In August 1991, Barrera returned to Guatemala to present evidence in the case. While there, he gave a press conference accusing Guatemala's armed forces of involvement in the killings. Journalists who reported on his accusation reportedly received anonymous threats. The investigating prosecutors and Barrera's lawyers were likewise threatened, causing the latter to withdraw from the case. Amnesty International subsequently issued an appeal to the Guatemalan government, expressing concern that the murderers appeared to be members of state security forces and urging that both they and those responsible for the subsequent threats be brought to justice. A document released by the US Central Intelligence Agency in 1995 also implicated the Guatemalan military in the attacks. Later career In 1991, the year after the attack, Barrera won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists. Barrera was threatened again for his journalism in 1993, when his name was circulated in an anonymous leaflet threatening him and 23 other journalists with death; Amnesty International again issued an alert on his behalf. Barrera's brother Adolfo is also a journalist and was abducted in 1994; he managed to escape and subsequently fled the country. Barrera was allegedly assaulted in Guatemala City in 2008 by members of the Secretariat for Administrative and Security Matters (Secretaría de Asuntos Administrativos y de Seguridad) following an attempt to photograph a new vehicle of Vice President Rafael Espada, prompting IFEX to issue a protest on his behalf.

Early life Qi Xueqi was born in Tieluo () village, Yanglin () township, Ningxiang County, Hunan province on August 28, 1900. He attended the Qi family's private homeschool. In 1912, his family moved to Changsha, the capital of Hunan. Qi Xueqi studied in Changjun middle school and showed strengths in literature and foreign language. Four years later, he went to Beijing and studied at Tsinghua University until 1920. While there Qi attended the great student movement on May 4, 1919. Zhou Demin's brief biography of General Qi Xueqi said that he came back to Changsha after graduating from Tsinghua and worked as a professor at Hunan University, teaching literature and foreign language, while other sources say that he had not graduate until 1923 when he went to the US. In 1923, Qi went to the city of Northfield, Vermont in the US and majored in horsemanship at Norwich University.  Career  When he returned to in 1929, he was appointed regimental commander of the 6th Military Police Regiment in Nanjing. On January 28, 1932, he led his 6th Regiment to Shanghai when the Japanese attacked Zhabei District. As the commander of the 6th Military Police Regiment, he was on garrison duty in Shanghai and fought a fierce battle against the army of Japan. He was given many awards in the next several years for his bravery in battle. In 1938 Qi Xueqi came to Changsha and was appointed commander of the city's tax policy. It was an official post with little to do. He applied to fight in the front because he thought that a soldier should be fighting instead of in the rear. In 1942, he was sent to Burma as vice- commander of the 38th division while the commander was Sun Li-jen. The task of the 38th division was assisting the Allies in their fight against the Japanese. Death When Qi was in prison camp, some other prisoners of war, Cai Zongfu, Zhang Jixiang and others, wanted to surrender to get money and become officers of the puppet government of Wang Jingwei. They attempted to persuade Qi to surrender with them, but he refused. In 1945, the Japanese surrendered. The prisoners were liberated and returned to China.

He was the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines from 2011-2016. Background Albert del Rosario was born in Manila on November 14, 1939, to Luis del Rosario and Amparo Ferreros. His great grandmother Teresa Sempio was a sister of Felipa Sempio, the mother of Gregorio del Pilar. His grandfather, Judge Simplicio Sempio del Rosario, was a delegate to the Malolos Congress. Del Rosario graduated from Xavier High School in New York and subsequently attended college at New York University, graduating with a degree in Economics. In 2006, he was inducted into the Xavier High School Hall of Fame. Before being appointed by Benigno Aquino III to the Secretary of Foreign Affairs post, del Rosario was the Philippine Ambassador to the United States under then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo from 2001 to 2006. He stepped down after disagreements with the Arroyo government. He reportedly opposed the hiring of more lobby groups for the Philippine government and had cautioned the Arroyo government on its move to declare emergency rule in 2006, following reported threats to national security. In 2008, he wrote that he could not defend the emergency rule to Washington since it was \\"unjustifiable\\". On September 15, 2014, del Rosario was awarded the Tanging Dangal Award (Gawad Dangal na Lipi), the highest recognition given to a Bulakenyo who demonstrated outstanding contributions to society. del Rosario's family hails from Bulakan, Bulacan. On September 24, 2015, he was conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (Honoris Causa) from New York's College of Mount Saint Vincent for his commitment to democracy, advocacy to the poor, opposing corruption and promoting peaceful change in the Philippines. In his acceptance speech, del Rosario said, “As an official of the Philippine government, I am truly humbled to be honored after President Corazon Aquino, a Mount alumna. Thus, the honorary Doctor of Laws that the Mount has conferred upon me will always be my treasure as well as my inspiration. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs that I lead closely shares Mount Saint Vincent’s commitment to institutional integrity and excellence. I, therefore, consider the honor bestowed on me as recognition also for the hardworking men and women of the Philippine Foreign Service.”  Ties with the Aquinos His ties with the Aquino family go back to President Aquino's parents. When the late Corazon Aquino was President for 6 years starting in 1986, he accompanied her on her state visits to the United States. In 1991, Aquino conferred the Philippine Army Award to del Rosario for his initiatives as Chair of the Makati Foundation for Education.

It has rough, fibrous stringybark on the trunk and larger branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and twenty four and hemispherical to shortened spherical fruit with the valves extending well beyond the rim of the fruit. Description Eucalyptus expressa is a tree that typically grows to a height of and has rough, fibrous stringybark on the trunk, and branches wider than . The bark is grey brown, with reddish tinges. Young plants have some leaves arranged in opposite pairs, otherwise alternate, broadly lance-shaped to egg- shaped, glossy green on one surface, paler on the other, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, more or less the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The edges of older leaves are scalloped or irregularly toothed and the veins diverge at an angle of 30 to 40 degrees to the midrib. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and twenty four on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum up to twice as long as the floral cup. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical to shortened spherical capsule, long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. This species is similar to E. eugenioides but differs in its tall habit, scalloped leaf edges and conspicuously protruding valves in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus expressa was first formally described in 2012 by Stephen Bell and Dean Nicolle from a specimen alongside the Putty Road near Bulga and the description was published in the journal Telopea. Before its formal description, it was known as E. sp. aff. eugenioides (Bees Nest Ridge). The specific epithet (expressa) is from the Latin expressus, which means “prominent and clearly exhibited”, and refers to the long, narrow, prominent external valves of the fruit.Binns, D.

TV Play Classic (Let's!TVプレイCLASSIC or レッツテレビプレイ クラシック) is a series of Japan-only plug & play devices developed and distributed by Bandai programmed on XaviX software created by SSD Company Limited in 2006 that contain arcade games from either Namco or Taito, with Namco's being called \\"Namco Nostalgia\\" while Taito's are called \\"Taito Nostalgia\\". Each device in the series contains 4 games, with 2 being classic arcade games while the other 2 are new games using the original game's sprites developed by Bandai. Namco Nostalgia 1 *Xevious *Mappy *Xevious: Scramble Mission - In Scramble Mission the Solvalou ship flies through a futuristic fortress that has technological obstacles that the player must dodge, and at the end of each level they must blow up a boss similar to GAMP, under a time limit. *Mappy: Revenge of Nyamco - A game similar to Breakout where the player controls two Meowkies at the bottom of the screen who are moving a trampoline and catching Nyamco. Nyamco is attempting to bounce up and break blocks to obtain the items Mappy took from him in the previous game. Namco Nostalgia 2 *Gaplus *Dragon Buster *Gaplus Phalanx - The enemies do not shoot at the player, similar to the challenge stages in the original game. The player's ship has a Phalanx powerup at all times and must capture blue enemy ships which if caught would move to the top half of the screen spell a word as in the original Gaplus challenge stages. However red ships in this game if caught will erase a small part of the word, and the player must spell at least the word to continue to the next stage. All excess ships caught fill the rest of the background and count as a bonus. Ships can still fly into and hurt the player. The ships are also recolored and the background is blue instead of black. *Dragon Buster 100 - Clovis must rescue Celia again but this time he has to travel through 20 linear levels, and each level has four room guardians and a boss dragon at the end (There are 100 enemies hence the name 100.) There are no regular enemies throughout the game or obstacles such as vines to climb and there is only one linear path. Every 25 levels there is a cutscene where Clovis reaches Celia, but she gets captured by another dragon, except after the 100th level when she and Clovis kiss. After level 50 the dragons that Clovis fights become two headed, and after level 75 they have three heads. These dragons have much more HP than the one headed ones. Also, the color of the enemies and dragons changes throughout the game. Clovis can also use new items from the Famicom version of Dragon Buster to help him with his quest including rods, lamps, amulets, rings and a different type of crown. However, there is no scepter or original crown and Celia changes her outfit in the same manner as in the original game at every cut-scene without any special conditions needed to be fulfilled. Namco Nostalgia 3 (Cancelled) Namco Nostalgia 3 was scheduled to release four months after the original plug and plays, but was ultimately cancelled. It was supposed to include the games Bravoman and the Tower of Druaga and arranged versions of them. *Bravoman *The Tower of Druaga *Bravoman (Arrangement) - Wonder Momo, who has interacted with Bravoman in crossover games and media was set to be playable in the arranged version of the game. *The Tower of Druaga (Arrangement) - There would have been four new playable characters. Taito Nostalgia 1 *The Legend of Kage *Golden Castle *The Revised Legend of Kage - It is now possible to play as two new characters called Ayame and Ganin. Ayame is a female ninja who can throw bombs similar to the red ninjas in the game and has an unlimited supply of throwing knives. Ganin is a dog who can breathe fire similar to the monks in the game and can perform a spin attack that does not have much range but leaves him invulnerable for an instant and kills any enemy that touches him. Gameplay is identical to the original Legend of Kage except that there is a new snake boss at the end of every second playthrough. It slithers on the ground and blocks the exit. It is also possible to unlock Kage in the arranged version of the game to play with the new final boss. *Amazons Golden Castle - There is a new playable character who is a female gladiator called Sana of the Amazons. She shoots arrows instead of using a sword and attacks her bow and arrows. Her supply of arrows is endless, and she can block with her bow. The gameplay is otherwise identical to the original game except there is new a final boss who is fought in the treasure room. It is a new, stronger, gold colored form of the Skeleton of Gaius. It is possible to unlock Guiranos in the arranged version of the game to play with the new final boss. Taito Nostalgia 2 *KiKi KaiKai *Slap Fight *KiKi KaiKai Kackremboh - It is now possible to play as Bonze Kackremboh, the buddhist monk from the Taito game Bonze Adventure. Kackremboh attacks by throwing prayer beads in three directions at once, which become larger when he collects ofuda powerups instead of firing faster which is what occurs when Sayochan collects Ofuda, and he can also use Gohei (Sayochan's purification wand).Gameplay is the same, except there is a new boss at the end of Area 8 on the boat which is a white Maneki-neko. It throws brown hair balls. The color of the sail of the boat and its symbol also change during this fight. It is possible to unlock Sayochan in the arranged version of the game to play as her with the new final boss. *Slap Fight Tiger - It is now possible to play as Tiger Heli from the Tiger Heli series; Tiger shoots differently, and the powerups function differently for Tiger. The gameplay is otherwise the same except for a new boss at the end of the game; Taito's Space Invaders appear at the end of the game and behave as they did in the original Space Invaders. Two machines appear on the bottom of the screen and create a laser beam between each other, that keeps the player's ship from moving vertically, emulating the original space invaders. There are no stationary defense bunkers though, but the player keeps their power-ups during the boss fight. The Space Invaders defend the red energy core, and only after defeating them can the player blow it up. It is possible to unlock the original ship in the arranged version of the game to fight the new final boss with it.

It is located within the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. Populated originally by the Querandí people, a portion of the land today occupied by the city was deed to Pedro Gutiérrez by Governor Hernando Arias de Saavedra in 1615. It was added to Martín José de Altolaguirre's extensive holdings (which would occupy most of northern La Matanza County) in 1775, and was in turn purchased by Francisco Ramos Mejía in 1808. Prior to Mrs. Ramos Mejía's death in 1860, she bequeathed the property among her four children, the second of whom (her daughter, Marta) married a family ally in their struggles against Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas, Francisco Bernabé Madero. The Maderos lived in rural Dolores Partido; they, however, retained the property in La Matanza as an investment, and leased parcels to tallow refiners. Following Madero's death in 1896, these lands were parceled out to other manufacturers, and by 1900, an informal settlement (Villa Las Fabricas, or, \\"Factory Town\\") had been built by the growing numbers of immigrant laborers at the site. The first school was built there in 1905, and the arrival of the Buenos Aires Western Railway in 1908 prompted the creation of the first settlement formally established at the site: Villa Circunvalación. Villa Circunvalación was established by the sale of lots by La Franco Argentina, a leading Buenos Aires developer which established other nearby towns, and in which the Madero and Ramos Mejía families were shareholders. The Circunvalación and Fabricas settlements became known as Villa Eduardo Madero when the local train station was renamed in 1913 in honor of the former landowner's nephew, Eduardo Madero; Madero, who died in 1894, had developed what became known as Puerto Madero, the nation's first maritime docks. The city's economy became relatively diversified; its manufacturing base is built on a number of tool and die makers, as well as food processing plants.

Initially operating under the name La Punta Salt Works operations dating back to at least 1871, for a period of time it was the sole supplier of salt for Southern California. In 1902 it was purchased and renamed Western Salt Company, and later had narrow-gauge rail installed. During the rest of the 20th century, it was the second largest salt producer in California. The land was purchased by the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority in 1999 and transferred to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. In 2000, it assumed its current name, and has continued salt harvesting operations. Water evaporated at the salt works comes from the Pacific Ocean; since its inception, more than a million tons of salt has been harvested. The salt ponds are a stopping point for migratory birds, some of them threatened or endangered. In 2011, two of the works' salt ponds were restored to marshlands. History Salt evaporation ponds and mounds of crystallized salt awaiting the harvest Initially the operation began as the La Punta Salt Company. Records date its origin as being before 1872. This is supported by a 1965 report by the State of California, and a 2015 notice by the City of Imperial Beach state that the area has been used as a salt works as early as the 1860s. In 1883, the salt works were the only salt producer in the county, supplying the salt needs of all of Southern California. Around the turn of the 20th century, the salt works were the only industrial employment in the Chula Vista area, other than produce packing plants. In 1902, La Punta Salt Works was purchased, and renamed to Western Salt Company. In the 1910s, about forty thousand tons of salt were harvested annually from the salt works. In 1915, a narrow-gauge railway was installed, and crossed over standard-gauge railway of the San Diego and Arizona Railway; the narrow-gauge railway was dismantled in the 1970s, except for where it crossed over standard-gauge rail, preserving the only instance of such an occurrence in the United States. In 1916, operations were disrupted due to flooding; the flood destroyed the salt ponds and the salt works built up to that point. In 1918, reconstruction began due to damage caused during the 1916 flooding, reaching completion in the 1950s. After the 1910s, other salt producers in San Diego County closed, leaving the salt works the sole salt producer in the county. In the 1920s another company, California Chemical Corporation, extracted bromine from the waters from the salt ponds. Alt URL In addition the company also produced magnesium chloride, beginning as early as the 1910s. Production of bromine ended after World War II. During the majority of the 20th century, the amount of salt harvested at the salt works remained relatively constant. In 1958, Western Salt Company was the second largest salt producer in California, which also had salt production operations in Newport Beach, at the time. As late as 1978, the salt works supplied the salt needs of San Diego's tuna fleet. In 1999, the salt ponds were sold to the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, transferring the salt ponds to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; both have leased it out for continued salt harvesting. The leasers are a company formed by former employers of Western Salt Company, who changed the name to its present name, maintaining the buildings as private property of the salt works itself. In 2005, right of way of the former Coronado Belt Line in the salt pools, were designated historic by the city of San Diego; later converted into a bike path as part of the \\"Bayshore Bikeway\\", despite the historic designation. In 2009, the city of San Diego claimed land use authority over the property. Operations Satellite view of the salt ponds. The operation is the second- longest running business in San Diego, behind the San Diego Union Tribune. In Chula Vista, it is the city's longest running business. Although in the Chula Vista area, it is not within the Chula Vista city limits; the property is actually in the Nestor neighborhood. The buildings of the salt works are eligible to be placed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places; the buildings are already on the California Register of Historical Places. On the West Coast of the United States, only San Francisco Bay and San Diego Bay have the natural conditions that allow for salt extraction from sea salt to be feasible. Water evaporated at the salt works come from the Pacific Ocean, not San Diego Bay. The salt works produces about 75,000 tons of salt every year from salt ponds that cover over a thousand acres of land. Since operations began at the salt works, more than a million and a half tons of salt have been harvested. Gypsum can also be sourced from the salt works, as was done in a 2008 study of the mineral. Magnesium chloride is also produced during the solar salt operation and is sold for industrial use. In 2005, the salt works employed twenty-two people. In 2017, the salt works continued to produce about 80,000 pounds of salt per harvest. Since 1999, the parcel which the salt works is on has been owned by the San Diego Regional Airport Authority, leased to the South Bay Salt Works company. In 2015, the Airport Authority planned to sell the land which the salt works are on to the San Diego Foundation, to mitigate the building of a substation by San Diego Gas & Electric. It is planned that when the lease on the land ends, the buildings will be re- purposed similar to those on Cannery Row. One proposed use is to convert the salt works into an interpretive center for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. =Wildlife= Elegant terns at the salt works in 2009 The salt ponds of the salt works fall within the San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge. The salinity of the salt ponds creates an environment which breeds brine flies (Ephydridae) and brine shrimp (Artemia), a food source for the birds. During the winter months, there are monthly tours out into the salt ponds to observe migratory birds. Ninety-four different species of birds reside in the area of the salt ponds, including migratory species; seven of the species are threatened or endangered. In 2010, over twenty thousand birds were counted at the salt ponds, including the endangered species California least tern (Sternula antillarum browni) and gull-billed tern (Gelochelidon nilotica vanrossemi). In 2011, a nearly $8 million project restored two of the westernmost ponds to marshland. In 2013, a study of the hypersaline waters of the salt works showed that its microbial makeup differs substantially from those of a similar salt pond in Santa Pola, Spain. Due to the presence of these threatened and endangered species at the salt ponds, they were included in Port of San Diego's natural resources management plan, which was completed in September 2013.

The game was later released for the Wii U Virtual Console on July 28, 2016. Gameplay Like Kirby: Canvas Curse, the player does not directly play the game with a directional pad, face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, the player only uses the stylus and touch screen on the DS to play the game. The game is played by using the stylus to command up to ten Kirbys on the screen. Tapping the screen creates a star that the Kirbys can follow or cling onto. By tapping enemies or obstacles on the screen, players can send multiple Kirbys to attack them, with the player also able to flick individual Kirbys as projectiles. By collecting pieces of fruit throughout the level, the player can gain up to ten controllable Kirbys, which allow players to tackle enemies and obstacles more easily than with one Kirby. Each level often requires a minimum number of Kirbys to enter, and some puzzles will require all ten Kirbys to solve. If a Kirby is hit by an enemy or obstacle, it will turn blue until the end of the level, or until the player finds a special gate which restores their health. If a blue Kirby is hit, it will turn grey and float away unless the player can drag him down and turn him blue again, with the game ending if the player runs out of Kirbys or fails a certain level objective. Hidden throughout each game are several medals, found either by exploring, solving puzzles or finding keys and treasure chests, which in turn unlock additional minigames and bonus features. Some levels also feature large lollipops that temporarily make all the Kirbys bigger, allowing them to break through barriers and reach new areas. Plot Kirby travelled to the Popopo Islands, an archipelago in the south of Planet Popstar, to explore. After Kirby fell asleep in a field, Necrodeus, the evil leader of the Skull Gang, appeared from the sky. Using his magic staff, Necrodeus struck Kirby and split him in ten tiny individual Kirbys, each with only a fraction of the original Kirby's power. After promptly defeating all but one of the 10 Kirbys, The last Kirby notices a small star, which is his own Heroic Heart, controlled by the player's stylus. After journeying through the Popopo Islands, he defeats Necrodeus in space and uses his staff's power to re- combine the 10 Kirbys into their original form. Development and release Under the direction of Mari Shirakawa and produced by Masanobu Yamamoto, Kirby Mass Attack was developed out of a desire from HAL Laboratories to integrate new, unique gameplay styles into the Kirby series; thus, focus was shifted away from Copy Abilities, which were typically a core aspect of Kirby games, and focused more on the idea of group management. While the team deeply considered including Copy Abilities as a mechanic, the development team decided to exclude it, after several talks with Nintendo and Senior Producer Kensuke Tanabe, in order to maintain focus on the game's new gameplay ideas, as well as avoid overcomplicating the use of multiple Kirby copies at once. Because of the nature of controlling several Kirby's at once, level design was kept simple in order to require less \\"athleticism\\" that is generally utilized in most platforming stages. High scores and collectible medals were used as features so that stages would be given more replayability and challenge, and also because the idea complimented the group management concept.http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/20/the-making-of-kirby-mass- attack?page=2 Despite being released well after the reveal of the Nintendo 3DS, Kirby Mass Attack was still developed on the DS rather than being released on the newer console. According to Shirikawa, this was partially because the game would not have taken extensive advantage of the system's stereoscopic 3D capabilities, meaning that making it for the 3DS would have been pointless.

The EVH1 domain is found in multi-domain Ena/Vasp homology proteins implicated in a diverse range of signalling, nuclear transport and cytoskeletal events. This domain of around 115 amino acids is present in species ranging from yeast to mammals. Many EVH1-containing proteins associate with actin-based structures and play a role in cytoskeletal organisation. EVH1 domains recognise and bind the proline-rich motif FPPPP with low-affinity, further interactions then form between flanking residues.; WASP family proteins contain an EVH1 (WH1) in their N-terminus which bind proline-rich sequences in the WASP interacting protein. Proteins of the RanBP1 family contain a WH1 domain in their N-terminal region, which seems to bind a different sequence motif present in the C-terminal part of RanGTP protein. Tertiary structure of the WH1 domain of the Mena protein revealed structure similarities with the pleckstrin (PH) domain. The overall fold consists of a compact parallel beta-sandwich, closed along one edge by a long alpha helix. A highly conserved cluster of three surface-exposed aromatic side-chains forms the recognition site for the molecule's target ligands.

For over 30 years, he’s been a talk show host at WBLS and WLIB radio in New York City. Gary Byrd and the GB Experience was an American male/female vocal/instrumental group, who had a single titled \\"The Crown\\", in the UK Singles Chart. It was released on the Motown label, entered the chart on 23 July 1983 at number 21, and rose to a high of number 6; it remained in the chart for 9 weeks. It had previously been released in the US on Stevie Wonder's short-lived Wondirection label but did not receive the proper promotion because its release coincided with the purchase of Motown by MCA Records, where the small label was overlooked.  Radio  Byrd began his career in Buffalo, NY on WUFO in the 1960s, discovered and mentored by broadcaster-educator Hank Cameron as a radio prodigy at age 15.

It was written by Gary Byrd and Stevie Wonder, and presented a wide-ranging historical narrative of human progress (beginning with the ancient Egyptians and continuing to the present day) with an emphasis on African heritage. It featured spoken/rapped verses by Byrd, with one verse sung by Wonder and Crystal Blake. Byrd described the song at the time thus: \\"The idea is not that black, white or anyone is better, but that we all have our place. We've all made contributions - and mistakes too. Wearing the crown is reaching the top of your potential. You could be a writer or you could be a mechanic, but you can still wear the crown.\\" = Present Day = Currently, his tri-state arts & entertainment community column \\"Imhotep’s Guide To Black Events\\" runs weekly in the New York Amsterdam News, one of the nation’s oldest African American newspapers.

It is the 2nd Lantz Oswald film and the 54th in the entire series. Plot Oswald and a lady cat named Kitty are canoeing in a river. While the rabbit rows, Kitty plays a guitar and dances. One day, their ride is roughen by rocks protruding from the water, resulting Oswald to lose his oar, and Kitty to lose her guitar. They are, however, able to make it safely to shore. Oswald then converts their boat into a car where they begin moving by road. After such a trip, Oswald takes Kitty home which is a tall condo building. Before Kitty goes inside, Oswald asks Kitty if they should be married to each other as well as having a dozen children. Kitty considers this a possibility and agrees with Oswald. It then turns out that Kitty also has a romantic relationship with a bloodhound who comes out of the condo. The bloodhound angrily kicks Oswald away and takes Kitty inside, much to the rabbit's surprise. Still willing to pursue his dreams with Kitty, Oswald elevates the carriage of his car above its chassis. He then moves the car to a condo window of a certain floor and attempts to serenade Kitty with a trombone. Oswald's musical play prevails as Kitty shows up from the window. Suddenly, Kitty is pulled back by the bloodhound who appears and attempts to punch him away. In response to this, Oswald pushes the grumpy dog back and picks up Kitty using the slide of his instrument. Oswald and the cat then make a getaway in the car. Hating to lose Kitty, the bloodhound ties a rope around his waist and suspense himself under a passing eagle. He carries a rifle and goes forth to chase and shoot Oswald. Oswald and Kitty are still in their car with the carriage still elevated several feet above the ground. The bloodhound opens fire, and Oswald tries to cover himself using the trombone. One of the bloodhound's bullets, however, damages a vital part in his vehicle, causing it to come down and halt. As Oswald attempts to run on foot, the bloodhound jumps down and prompts him to stop. The bloodhound then puts a tombstone, designated for Oswald, on the ground, and forces the rabbit to dig a grave. Oswald reluctantly picks up a shovel and digs. To their surprise, a fountain of oil started shooting upward from where Oswald was digging. In this, Oswald and the bloodhound gave up their rivalry and became good friends. They and the cat became rich and happy. And as for the ending of the cartoon, Oswald, Kitty and the cat danced from side-to-side on the Universal text in the Universal logo as the cartoon ends.

The officer holding this appointment was in charge of safeguarding and monitoring traffic, and overseeing the opening times of the nine gates of the imperial capital, Beijing. The nine gates were Zhengyang Gate, Chongwen Gate, Anding Gate, Fucheng Gate, Xizhi Gate, Dongzhi Gate, Xuanwu Gate, Desheng Gate, and Chaoyang Gate. The officer's judicial responsibilities included night patrol, fire fighting, security checks of civilians, the apprehension and arrest of criminals, and prison keeping. He was also responsible for the security of the Forbidden City. Throughout the history of the Qing dynasty, the position was always held by Manchus rather than Han Chinese.http://big5.huaxia.com/zhwh/wszs/2010/07/1966158.html \\"九門提督\\" 清朝最關鍵的職位http://big5.china.com.cn/gate/big5/culture.china.com.cn/txt/2007-10/12/content_9041986.htm 清朝\\"九門提督\\"管的是哪九門？ History The appointment was created in around 1644 when the forces of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty occupied Beijing, formerly the capital of the Ming dynasty, and established the Qing imperial capital there. The appointment holder's responsibilities were primarily to oversee the city's defences and security within the city. He was also in charge of the infantry units within the Eight Banners and the guards of the nine gates of Beijing. At the same time, he was also the commander of the north and south patrol units from the Green Standard Army. The infantry units were all stationed at specific locations within Beijing's inner city to defend that particular place. The patrol units maintained security in the outer city and strategic places in Beijing's outskirts. In 1659, during the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor, the Qing government created a central patrol unit and put it under the charge of the Nine Gates Infantry Commander. The full name of the appointment was \\"Commander of the Infantry of the Nine Gates and Three Patrol Units\\" (提督九門步軍巡捕三營統領). As the Nine Gates Infantry Commander was an important position, the Qing government had been reluctant to appoint any non-Manchu officer to this position for fear that a rebellion might occur. In 1781, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, the Qing government increased the number of patrol units from three to five and put them under the charge of the Nine Gates Infantry Commander. The appointment was thus known as \\"Commander of the Infantry of the Nine Gates and Five Patrol Units\\" (提督九門步軍巡捕五營統領). In 1900, when the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion, they created a public security office to maintain security within the city. The last person to hold the appointment of Nine Gates Infantry Commander before the foreign invasion was Ronglu, an official deeply trusted by Empress Dowager Cixi. After the Boxer Rebellion ended, in 1901, the Qing government abolished the appointment of Nine Gates Infantry Commander and created a centralised police command to replace the original five patrol units. In 1902, Shanqi (Prince Su), who strongly supported the idea of separating the military from the police, was appointed as the infantry commander. In 1905, the Qing government implemented reforms which officially separated the police units from the infantry units and established a separate police force, as well as a police school to train police officers. After the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, the Beiyang Government, which took over Beijing, retained the appointment of Nine Gates Infantry Commander but renamed it to \\"High Command of the Infantry of the Capital\\" (京師步軍統領衙門). The appointment holder was in charge of the left and right wings of the Beiyang armed forces. The appointment was officially abolished in November 1924.

White was born in Adelaide in 1975, the eldest of six children, and now lives in London with her husband and daughter. Her first published collection of poetry, The Incoming Tide (John Leonard Press 2007), was shortlisted for the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards and the ACT Poetry Prize. In 2011, five of White's poems were selected for inclusion in the landmark anthology of Australian Poetry, Australian Poetry Since 1788. The poems selected are Ricketts Point, Voyage, Woman and Dog, Older Sister and Notes for the Time Being.  Biography  Petra White grew up in Adelaide. She studied English and German literature at the University of Melbourne, completing a BA with honours. In 2002 she studied at Essen University and travelled widely in Europe. In 2008 she was Fellow of Hawthornden Castle International Retreat for Writers, completing a five-week residency. In 2012, White and Paul Hetherington took Australian poetry to Ireland with Australian Poetry Limited's first international tour. White conducted readings and workshops at many venues throughout the Republic and Northern Ireland including the Bealtaine Festival in Dublin, Laurel Villa in Magherafelt and Writers' Week at Listowel. White's second collection, The Simplified World, published in 2010, was the joint winner of the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry. Her work has appeared in the anthology Take Five (Shoestring Press 2008, UK), The Age, Melbourne, and other anthologies and periodicals. A third major collection, A Hunger, was published by John Leonard Press in 2014. This publication includes White's previous collections, in which slight changes have been made to a small number of poems. In May 2017, White's fourth collection, Reading for a Quiet Morning, was published by GloriaSMH Press. It features a 'compact epic' inspired by the biblical story of Ezekiel, but with a distinctly twenty-first century, feminist perspective. White was a founding co-editor of the So Long Bulletin, a blog on Australian poetry and criticism. She was the judge for the Reason-Brisbane Poetry Prize in 2011.Reason-Brisbane Poetry Prize White holds a master's degree in Public Policy and Management from the University of Melbourne.

As the poem progresses through four eight-line stanzas the gap between the title and the content of the poem grows more and more intense so that the conclusion is that much more satisfying:\\" Descendant of the Aztec dog-god Xolotl, who with mangled hands and feet guided the dead to heaven, his once trans- lucent form refuses catastrophe; more than the ailing tabby, the timorous and watchful high-heeled dog, or the rented fireprone house, he guards our dangerous childhood pledge to never change. \\"It is one of those rare poems which is simultaneously sophisticated and easy to grasp: it should be immediately anthologized.\\"Australian Poetry Review, September 2007, retrieved 6 June 2011 \\"In The Simplified World Petra White more than fulfils the promise made by her first book, The Incoming Tide, back in 2007. For all of her literary sophistication and verbal ingenuity, White is a poet of the world as we know it, an observer of poignant situations – and a conveyor of them. Whether it’s an anonymous, depressed woman walking her dog (‘'not a small one'’) until its feet bleed and then carrying it ‘'all the way home, wherever that was'’, or a Lebanese couple running a take-away for decades, White over and over again leaves us moved by what she has shown us. As well as by poignancy, however, the book is held together by certain thematic threads. One is a feeling for depression, the strangeness of it, the way it cannot be lifted by a mere effort of will. It is ablankness as wide as the long sea'’ (‘'St Kilda'’) and raises the question ‘'Where does illness live,/what does it want? . . . Describe your fear. How do you feel out of 10?/Out of 9?’’ (‘'Notes for the Time Being'’).\\"Geoff Page, The Canberra Times, 13 October 2007 And of 'Reading for a Quiet Morning': \\"White’s mini-epic poem, 'How the Temple Was Built', which comprises the first half of her collection, reveals an authoritative voice delivering what feels like a Ted Hughes-inspired sermon on a new Ezekiel myth. The lens here, however, is distinctly female, the account feminist.\\" \\"... these poems are lit up and muse-inspired, mini Ezekiels all in the face of baffling Gods.\\" Ivy Ireland Reviews Petra White and Magdalena Ball, retrieved 1 February 2018 \\"Petra White’s fourth poetry collection, Reading for a Quiet Morning, is a narrative-driven, subversive poetic experiment...\\" \\"Myths and religious script, alongside feminist and secular theory, are shown as one among many ways of interpreting the world, any promises of cosmic revelation always farcically, but no less tragically, limited.

It originally appeared in Svenska Serier in 1981. It then began a long run in 91:an (1983 - December 2001). On 5 December 2002 Uti vår hage became a bi-monthly comic, published by Egmont. It also ran briefly as a daily strip in Dagens Nyheter. The comic strip The main character is Faló, an immature and self-righteous man in his mid-30s who lives in the small, fictional Swedish town of Mjölhagen, loosely based on a town in Småland. His last name is never revealed. Lacking any obvious source of income, he nevertheless lives in his own detached villa on Friggagatan with large garden and drives an old Volvo Amazon. He has an extremely high opinion of himself and his own abilities (especially his intelligence), which fails to reflect the realities of his personality. For example, he considers himself to be a talented poet. He generally wears a small red hat, purple trousers, clogs and walks around with his pot belly visible from under his shirt. Petersson has stated that Faló is inspired by Einar Lindberg's character Sympatiska Filip, from the strip Filip och Kaspersson. Sympatiska Filip was in turn based upon Elov Persson's character Kronblom. Petersson derived the name Faló from the Argentinian singer and guitarist Eduardo Falú. The comic strip contains black humor. The original idea of the strip, hence the name, was to depict different people in various situations. However, the story was then shifted towards revolving around Faló. Other characters in the burlesque depiction of small-town Sweden include (but are not limited to) the following: * Yvette. Faló's long-suffering girlfriend/fiancé. * Olaf. Faló's stunted, thick and occasionally criminal brother. He is often seen working as a waiter or chef. Olaf is Faló spelled backwards. * Konrad Bernevik. The municipal commissioner and Faló's love-rival for Yvette. A devout Christian. * Torsten Lydén. Faló's neighbour. A fanatic military officer who has a habit of declaring war on his neighbours. He later underwent a sex-change and now goes by the first name Totta. * Stryp-Enok. Faló's other neighbour who carefully tends his precious garden (which is often destroyed through various mishaps, both accidental and intentional). A chain smoker. * Börje Phyllerin, last name later changed to Finkelspiel. The town drunk. He changed his last name because people kept calling him Fylle-Börje (\\"Drunk-Börje\\") which is derived from Phyllerin. * Desirée Rosenquick. A dim- witted little old lady who is often seen riding on her moped. * Blirger Bidén. Faló's friend. He is constantly pushed around by his abusive wife. Blirger, Faló and some others friends often play poker together. * Brunte. Faló's dog who often puts him in awkward situations. The comic book The main strip, Uti vår hage, features in both newly-drawn stories and in republished material. In addition, the comic book includes several subsidiary strips, a crossword and a letters page (\\"Tyckt å tänkt Uti vår hage\\"). =Current subsidiary strips= *Axplock, by Tobias Sjölund *Baldo, by Hector Cantú and Carlos Castellanos *Elvis, by Tony Cronstam *Folk & Fä *Gaston, by André Franquin *Lindström *Moppe och mobilen *Tristan =Previous subsidiary strips= *Kid Paddle *Nilsson & Bengtsson, by Magnus Knutsson and David Öqvist *Quarantän, by Camilla Eriksson *Toftaligan *Vi å pappa, by Krister Petersson and Gert Lozell *Zorillerna *Älskade hund, by Uli Stein References External links * Unofficial fan site Category:Swedish comic strips Category:1981 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981 Category:Humor comics Category:1981 establishments in Sweden Category:Småland Category:Sweden in fiction Category:Fictional Swedish people Category:Fictional unemployed people Category:Comics magazines published in Sweden Category:Swedish comics characters Category:Magazine mascots ","title":"Uti vår hage (comic strip)"},{"id":"32017367","text":"Daniel H. Wilson on Bookbits radio talking about Robopocalypse. Robopocalypse (2011) is a science fiction novel by Daniel H. Wilson. A researcher in robotics, he explores the capacity of robots and portrays AI out of control. It is written in present tense. Writer Robert Crais and Booklist have compared the novel to the works of Michael Crichton and Robert A. Heinlein. It became a bestseller on the New York Times list. Plot A computer scientist accidentally unleashes a supremely intelligent sentient A.I. named Archos R-14. It becomes self-aware and immediately starts planning the elimination of human civilization and building a new cryptic ecology, where the organic is being merged with robot technology. Over time, Archos R-14 infects all penetrable networked electronic devices, such as cars, airplanes, smart homes, elevators, and other robots, with a \\"precursor virus\\". Before it launches a full-blown attack on humanity, it sends out probing attacks to analyze the technical feasibility of its strategies and to assess human response. In one such instance, it infects a peacekeeper robot to attack soldiers. The random attacks are designed to look like sporadic malfunctions of devices that humans depend on for their everyday routines. Domestic robots attack innocents, planes are intentionally set on a collision course, and smart cars start driving out of control. The resulting conflict is known as the New War. After Archos R-14 turns the automated world against humanity, a group of the Osage Nation lead people to fight back. Their base is on their jurisdictional lands in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, the resurrected Mikiko could \\"awake\\" other robots to be self-aware (\\"Freeborn\\"). Human and freeborn robots fight their last New War battle in Ragnarok Intelligence Fields. Before being terminated, Archos R-14 broadcast its last message via seismic wave to unknown recipients. Characters *Cormac Wallace, the narrator for the novel and the second commander of the Brightboy squad. He is one of the few survivors of the robot apocalypse and the younger brother of the first commander, Jack Wallace. *Mathilda Perez, a 10-year-old girl and daughter of congresswoman Laura Perez. She is operated on by an autodoc and receives robotic eyes that allow her to see and, to an extent, control robots. But this makes her 'people-blind', barely able to recognize living organisms. *Takeo Nomura, a Japanese head repairman of an old factory. He is 65 years old and has an intimate relationship with a human-like android named Mikiko. During Archos' invasion, Nomura built an army of robots and created a safe haven for humans all over Japan. After he releases Mikiko from Archos' control, she transmits a signal that frees all other humanoid robots, creating the Freeborns. *Nine Oh Two,A Former new War is the first recorded freeborn humanoid robot to be awakened. He forms an alliance with the humans in an effort to defeat Archos. At the end of the novel, he ultimately resolves the conflict by destroying Archos. *Archos, a rogue A.I. and the main antagonist. Despite causing the New War, he is fascinated by life, humanity, and its culture. He determines to replace outdated humanity with advanced technology, believing that humanity existed only as a catalyst to create him. *Lurker, a 17-year-old prankster. He played a vital role in temporarily freeing the communication lines from Archos' control. This allowed Paul Blanton to transmit a critical message to the human resistance. Reception Best-selling authors Stephen King and Clive Cussler reviewed the book positively. King said that the book was \\"terrific page- turning fun\\" and Cussler commenting that it is: The book received positive reviews from the Associated Press, Janet Maslin from the New York Times, and best-selling authors Lincoln Child and Robert Crais; all calling it \\"brilliant\\". Damien Walter of The Guardian, Ron Charles of the Washington Post, and Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times were less enthusiastic, describing the novel as a disappointment and cheesy. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club described it as \\"World War Z with evil robots\\", hobbled by hackneyed characters and a limited scope. Sequel In 2014, Doubleday published the official sequel to Robopocalypse, which is titled Robogenesis. Film adaptation Steven Spielberg signed on to direct a film based on the novel, and Drew Goddard was hired to write the screenplay. Spielberg also hired designer Guy Hendrix Dyas to work with him and his writers on creating the visual tone for the film and conceptualize its robotic elements. The film was scheduled for release by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on July 3, 2013. Filming was scheduled to take place entirely in Montreal, Canada, from July to September 2012. Oklahoma was scouted as a possible filming location, but Canada was ultimately chosen for its tax incentives, as production was expected to cost $200 million. On May 31, 2012, the film's release date was delayed to April 25, 2014. The film, jointly financed by 20th Century Fox and Spielberg's DreamWorks, was scheduled to be released in North America by Disney's Touchstone Pictures label, while Fox was to handle the international distribution. Chris Hemsworth was cast in November 2012. Anne Hathaway said in November 2012 that she had been cast in the proposed film: \\"If Robopocalypse happens I will be in it and I believe it's quite real, though you never want to hang your hat on anything.\\" Ben Whishaw had also been cast. On January 9, 2013, DreamWorks revealed that Spielberg decided to put Robopocalypse on hold indefinitely. The director's spokesman Marvin Levy, said it was \\"too important and the script is not ready, and it's too expensive to produce. It's back to the drawing board to see what is possible.\\" On January 10, 2013, Spielberg said he was starting on a new script that would be more economical and personal, and estimated a delay of six to eight months. In an interview with Creative Screenwriting, Goddard said he understood Spielberg delaying the film, saying: Spielberg continually delayed the project because of scheduling conflicts. On March 7, 2018, it was revealed that directorial efforts had shifted from Spielberg to Michael Bay, who had previously been hand-picked by Spielberg to direct the Transformers film franchise.

The TRA effectively started operations upon the nomination of its board members in February 2007. The TRA's mission is to promote competition and ensure the rights of users of telecommunications services are respected. Through appropriate regulation, the TRA promotes investment and maintains stability in the market. The TRA issues licenses, regulations, and decisions, manages the spectrum and the numbering plan, monitors the market for any abuse of dominant market position and anti-competitive practices, and takes remedial action when necessary. The TRA is also responsible for maintaining stability in the market and developing the sector—while at the same time, building a thriving, competitive and innovative telecommunications market.  Duties and regulatory principles  The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) was established in accordance with Law 431 of 2002 as an independent public institution assigned to liberalize, regulate, and develop telecommunications in Lebanon. The TRA's duties are set out in full in Law 431/2002. These include to: * Encourage competition in the fields of telecom * Ensure market transparency * Monitor tariffs and prevent non-competitive behaviour * Act as a mediator and arbitration organism and to resolve disputes arising between licensees * Prepare draft decrees and regulations * Organize concessions, issue licenses, amend, suspend, withdraw and supervise execution of these concessions and licenses * Establish rules of interconnection and review contracts of interconnection * Formulate technical standards and procedures for monitoring compliance with these standards * Formulate standards and procedures for review of complaints and/or requests that might arise out of the present law and their resolution * Protect telecommunications consumers and facilitate the use of telecom by educational and health care institutions and disabled persons  Units  The TRA consists of four main units which fall under the supervision of the TRA chairman. Each unit is headed by a Board Member who is also responsible for maintaining coordination between them. It is composed of a team that are specialized in various fields varying from spectrum, numbering, research, marketing, customer satisfaction and each one of them relates to one of the four units that form the Authority. Three sections of administration, finance and audit are directly overseen by the TRA chairman and CEO. The administrative section deals with the implementation of internal organisation and human resources. The finance section is responsible for TRA budgeting issues and guarantees that the budget has been implemented and used appropriately. The audit section is tasked with the auditing of the budget and TRA accounts to be carried out in line with TRA board member decisions The four units are: ;Market and Competition Unit: The Market and competition unit (MCU) is responsible for all economic affairs related to the telecommunications market including its financial and technical aspects. Through conducting economic, financial and technological research, assessments and analyses, the MCU studies the potential of the telecommunications market and guides its development. A large part of its role focuses on suggesting policies and setting conditions for technical services and monitoring compliance with these conditions. In addition, the MCU is responsible for studying tariffs and fees to ensure fair competition. ;Telecommunications Technologies Unit:The Telecommunications technologies unit (TTU) deals with all technological matters related to technical resources, telecommunication equipment and supplies. Its duties include radio frequency spectrum and numbering management as well as ensuring the proper technical implementation of interconnection agreements. In addition, it plays a monitoring role regarding quality of service and rights of easement on properties owned by the state and the municipalities.

In 1552 he was appointed to the royal mint, where he would have produced metalwork designs. However, he left this position after six months following a dispute about wages.

His style was formed upon that of the Little Masters of Germany. He died at Strassburg in 1595. Étienne Delaune was one of the most famous designers of goldsmithery of his time. There are six of his designs in the Louvre; two of them are for circular dishes representing the Histories of Moses and of Samson. His prints, which are generally small, are very numerous; they are executed entirely with the graver, with great dexterity of handling, and are very highly finished. He copied some of the prints of Marc Antonio with success. He usually marked his prints with the initial of his Christian name, S., or S. F., or S. fecit, but sometimes Stephanus, fecit.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Ashford, the archdeaconry of Maidstone, and the diocese of Canterbury. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church was built to accommodate the growing population of the town in the middle of the 19th century, following the building of the locomotive works for the South Eastern Railway Company. In 1864 a competition was held for its design, which was won by Hubert Austin, a young architect working as an assistant to George Gilbert Scott. It was Austin's first design. In 1867 Austin was to join E. G. Paley in Lancaster, Lancashire, to form the partnership of Paley and Austin. The church was built in 1866–67. Most of the money for its construction was provided by the shareholders of the South Eastern Railway Company, and so it came to be known as \\"the railwayman's church\\". The church cost was £4,219 (equivalent to £ in ), and its site was donated by G. Jemmett, the lord of the manor at the time. It provided seating for about 600 people. The vestry was added in 1910. Architecture Christ Church is constructed in ragstone and has Bath stone dressings. The roofs are slated. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, and a chancel with a vestry and an organ chamber to the north. Towards the west end is a bell turret. The windows on the north and south sides are lancets. Those at the east and west ends have Geometric tracery. Inside the church the arcades are carried on round piers. The two- manual organ was built by Bishop and Son in 1897.

Jumbo Games produce and manufacture all of their jigsaw puzzles and cardboard based games in their own factory that is based in the Netherlands. The Jumbo head office is located in the Netherlands and there are also offices in the UK, Germany and Belgium.http://www.jumbo.eu Previous to being known as Jumbo games in the UK, the company was called Falcon Games and this was the brand name given to its range of adult puzzles. Falcon was established in 1976 and Jumbo is often still referred to as by the Falcon brand name in the UK. History The origins of the firm can be traced to the Hausemann & Hotte partnership in the mid-nineteenth century between the Amsterdam department store owner Engelbert Hausemann, a German, and Wilhelm Hotte, who together imported games and puzzles into the Netherlands. After the First World War, Hausemann & Hotte expanded their range of toys and games. This included the Meccano metal construction kits, Continental Caoutchouc rubber balls, dolls’ prams by Heinrichmaier & Wunsch, ‘Jutta’dolls by Dressel, Emata slates, Hohner mouth organs, cars and figurines by Lehmann and Spears games. During the inter-war years, Hausemann & Hotte commissioned wooden toys by the Mauritz en Ball company of Zeist. These toys had to be made to be strong enough \\"that a wooden elephant could stand on them\\". These toys were sold under the Jumbo brand name. This was the birth of the elephant brand. After the Second World War, production was difficult and imports had ceased. Hausemann & Hotte began to have their own games made by local manufacturers with readily available sturdy cardboard. The elephant as a symbol of the products’ strength continued to be used. In 1950 Hausemann & Hotte created De Netherlandse Spellenfabriek B.V. (NSF for short), their own cardboard factory, in order to break their dependence on other manufacturers and assure optimum quality. As the decade progressed, the firm introduced the game Electro, puzzles and the classic board game Stratego, which was launched in America, with great success. It was made in America under license for Hausemann & Hotte by Milton Bradley. This Americal link continued when Hausemann & Hotte brought the Barbie doll to the Netherlands. From 1967, as the market for games was experiencing massive growth, Hausemann & Hotte ceased all imports and concentrated exclusively on its own brand, Jumbo. After this time both warehouse and production relocated to Wognum. In 1980 Jan van Haasteren started drawing jigsaw puzzles for Jumbo. Forty percent of all puzzles made by Jumbo are now Jan van Haasteren puzzles. In 1997 the quirky Wasgij jigsaw puzzle was introduced. Wasgij is jigsaw spelt backwards. Wasgij is drawn by a group of artists including Graham Thompson, who has been producing puzzles for Jumbo for many years.http://www.wasgij.com Games produced Jumbo Games’ adult portfolio consists of Wasgij, Falcon de luxe, Jan van Haasteren, Things we Love to Hate, Coronation Street, Carry On and many more. The Children’s puzzles and games licenses consist of Peppa Pig, Everything's Rosie, Little Kingdom, Fireman Sam, Disney and many more.

Intermittent catheterization is considered the ‘gold-standard’ for medical bladder emptying. Intermittent catheterization can be done by the patient or a caregiver in home environment. Advantages People with neurogenic bladder disorders like spinal cord injury, spina bifida or multiple sclerosis, and non-neurogenic bladder disorders like obstruction due to prostate enlargement, urethral strictures or post-operative urinary retention, need to be continuously catheterised to empty their urinary bladders. But such continuous catheterization can lead to problems like urinary tract infections (UTI), urethral strictures or male infertility. Intermittent catheterization at regular intervals avoids such negative effects of continuous long term catheterization, but maintaining a low bladder pressure throughout the day. Technique It is unclear which catheter designs, techniques or strategies affect the incidence of UTI, which are preferable to users and which are most cost effective.

The palace was built in 1660 by Giovanni Antonio De Rossi for the marquis Francisco Nuñez-Sánchez. In 1806 the palace was acquired by prince Lucien Bonaparte, brother of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. The latter's mother, Letizia Ramolino and his brother Prince Jérôme Bonaparte lived also here. In 1842 the palace was acquired by Prince Marino Torlonia, who commissioned the restoration to Antonio Sarti, extending the front over Via Bocca di Leone. For some time the space in the front of the palace was called Torlonia Square. In front of the entrance is the Torlonia Fountain. It consists of an ancient Roman sarcophagus resting on lion paws. Above the sarcophagus a mask pours water, which comes out of two taps in the base and flows, into a semicircular marble pond with two small columns. The fountain is inserted within an architectural element with side pillars, surmounted by an arch with the coat of arms of the Torlonia family between two lions rampant. An inscription below the arch commemorates the building of the fountain at the expense of duke Marino Torlonia in an area that belonged to him. Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi, lived in the palace from the time of his marriage with the Infanta Beatriz of Spain until his death in 1986. At that time the owners of the Palace were the Prince Alessandro Torlonia and his two sisters the princess Donna Cristiana Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi (who died in 1970) and princess Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi (who died in 1960). After Alessandro's death, Beatriz sold her part to her son-in-law Paul Annik Weiller (the father of Princess Sibilla of Luxembourg) and Francis Alexander Shields (the son of princess Marina Torlonia di Civitella-Cesi and father of actress Brooke Shields), sold his part to the architect Renato Bocchi. Later Paul Annik Weiller also sold to Bocchi his part with a condition that princess Beatriz Torlonia could remain in the palace until her death.
