The village has a population of 1,300. History Until the mid-19th century the town lay within the estate of Krasi≈Ñski family. The Jews, who had begun to settle there in the mid-18th century, made up 60% of its population by 1841. The Jewish district was defined by a legal document according to which Jews were obliged to pay rent to count J√≥zef Krasi≈Ñski. A Jewish kahal was established in Krasnosielc in 1844 following an official complaint about improprieties of the kahal in Przasnysz. Krasnosielc lost its municipal status in 1869, soon after its last Polish owner Karol Krasi≈Ñski died childless. In 1883 a synagogue was built. The town changed hands several times before Poland regained its independence in 1918. The Jewish community of Krasnosielc ceased to exist in early September 1939. Following the German invasion of Poland, SS units of Panzer Division Kempf forced the Jews into the synagogue and massacred them there.

One solution offered was the marriage of Moray to Huntly's daughter, and Huntly's son to a daughter of the Earl of Argyll. However, in February 1603 Anne of Denmark proposed an alternative solution, that Huntly's son, Lord Gordon, would marry Moray's sister in a double marriage.

A Misunderstanding on the Thames In 1606 when Christian IV was preparing to leave London he had an argument with the Earl of Nottingham aboard ship about time and tide. The Danish king insisted it was two o'clock and waved two fingers at the Earl. Nottingham or the countess thought he made a joke about their age difference.Courtney Erin Thomas, If I lose Mine Honour I Lose Myself (Toronto, 2017), pp. 87-9. An angry correspondence ensued. Arbella Stuart attempted to mediate in the scandal in letters to Christian's chamberlain, Sir Andrew Sinclair.Sara Jayne Steen, The Letters of Lady Arbella Stuart (Oxford, 1994), pp. 211-7, 282-4. Margaret insisted in a letter to Sinclair that Christian IV should know \\"that I deserve as little that name he gave me as either the mother of himself or his children\\". Sinclair had to pass the letter on to Christian IV. Anne of Denmark asked James to banish her from court.Agnes Strickland, Lives of the Queens of England vol. 4 (London, 1869) pp. 93-5, quoting a letter in the British Library, Egerton MSS, printed in J.

The French ambassador Antoine Le F√®vre De La Boderie was aware of the quarrel, and wrote of the age difference between Lady Nottingham and the Admiral. He describes the argument centering on a clock and the time of departure. Christian IV two or three times indicated the time two o'clock with his fingers. Boderie knew that Margaret had written to Sinclair, and Anne of Denmark had expelled her from court, berating her as the grandchild of an illegitimate son of James V. His letter is an important source for our knowledge of the incident.Ambassades de M. de La Boderie en Angleterre, vol. 1 (Paris, 1750), pp. 307-9 Material culture An inventory of luxury goods belonging to Margaret and the Earl of Nottingham written by the notary David Moysie in 1606 gives an idea of the material culture of Jacobean courtiers.

The valley, extending for some and passing through the Dresden Basin, is one of two major cultural landscapes built up over the centuries along the Central European river Elbe, along with the Dessau-W√∂rlitz Garden Realm downstream. With respect to its scenic and architectural values, including the Dresden urban area as well as natural river banks and slopes, the Elbe Valley was entered on the World Heritage Site list of the UNESCO in 2004. However, in July 2006 it was designated a World Heritage in Danger and finally delisted in June 2009, in the course of the construction of the Waldschl√∂sschen Bridge river crossing. Description Filmn√§chte outdoor cinema in the Elbe Valley with Dresden skyline The cultural landscape comprises the Dresden urban area along the Elbe meanders, stretching from the Loschwitz district in the southeast down to the Ostragehege plains in the northwest. The forested Elbe slopes of the Lusatian Plateau and the Dresden Heath in the northeast protect the Valley from harsh winds; with an average annual temperature between 9.3 and 10 ¬∞C, even viticulture (Saxon wine) is common. The Elbe banks are characterised by extended meadows (Elbwiesen) which have remained free of any building developments due to regularly occurring floods. The landscape is a conservation area according to the 1992 EU Habitats Directive, including numerous smaller protected areas (Naturschutzgebiete). Settlements and architecture in the Elbe Valley reflect the development of Dresden as Saxon residence since the Renaissance era. Points of interest include Albrechtsberg Palace on the northern slopes, Pillnitz with its castle and old village, works of engineering such as the 'Blue Wonder' bridge at the Loschwitz Schillerplatz, the nearby Dresden Funicular and Suspension Railway or the Yenidze tobacco factory. Grouped around Br√ºhl's Terrace, the 'Balcony of Europe' built in the historic city centre high above the Elbe river, are the Frauenkirche, Semperoper, Zwinger, Dresden Castle, and Dresden Cathedral, the Catholic court church of the Saxon electors and kings. Vis-√†-vis on the right bank is the Innere Neustadt district with the government quarter around the State Chancellery building and the Japanese Palace. Recently erected buildings such as the New Synagogue or the Saxon Landtag complete the picture. Parts of the area such as Blasewitz are historic suburbs of the city, while there are also industrial districts. Revoked World Heritage status Elbe Valley with Waldschl√∂sschen Bridge Plans to build the four-lane Waldschl√∂sschen Bridge across the valley proved controversial. In 2006, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee placed the Dresden Elbe Valley on its list of World Heritage in Danger and threatened to remove it from the World Heritage List. According to the Committee's official website, the committee determined that \\"plans to build a bridge across the Elbe would have such a serious impact on the integrity of property's landscape that it may no longer deserve to be on the World Heritage List,\\" and therefore decided to place the Dresden Elbe Valley on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger \\"with a view to also consider, in a prudent manner, delisting the site from the World Heritage List in 2007 if the plans were carried through.\\"\\"\\"World Heritage Committee threatens to remove Dresden Elbe Valley (Germany) from World Heritage List,\\" UNESCO World Heritage News, July 11, 2006. Though the bridge was approved in a referendum in 2005, the city council decided on 20 July 2006 to stop the invitation to bid on contracts to build the bridge. However, after several court decisions the city was forced to begin building the bridge at the end of 2007 until further court hearings could be held in 2008. In July 2008, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee decided to keep the Dresden Elbe Valley on the World Heritage List in the hope that the construction would be stopped and the integrity of the landscape restored. If not, the property would be deleted from the World Heritage List in 2009.\\"World Heritage Committee keeps Dresden Elbe Valley on UNESCO World Heritage List, urging an end to building of bridge,\\" UNESCO World Heritage News, July 4, 2008.

The cathedral is dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, and is the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon. History The cathedral was founded by Saint Pothinus and Saint Irenaeus, the first two bishops of Lyon. The cathedral is also known as a \\"Primatiale\\" because in 1079 the Pope granted to the archbishop of Lyon the title of Primate of All the Gauls with the legal supremacy over the principal archbishops of the kingdom. It is located in the heart of the old town (Vieux Lyon) and it backs up to the Sa√¥ne river, with a large plaza in front of it and a metro stop nearby providing easy access to and from the city center. Patiens of Lyon, who was bishop about 450, built a new cathedral, dedicated to Saint Stephen. Later, in the seventh century, a baptistery dedicated to Saint John was constructed as an accessory building to the church. The Church of St. Croix was also near. This location later became the site of the Cath√©drale Saint-Jean-Baptiste.\\"Penny Magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge\\", Vol. 9, G.

Festival of Light Each December, Lyon holds an annual Festival of Lights. The tradition dates to 1643, when on December 8, the people of Lyon would place a lit candle in the window, a custom still maintained by many residents to this day. During the Festival, a choreographed lighting display appears on the fa√ßade of the cathedral. Description Begun in 1180 on the ruins of a 6th-century church, it was completed in 1476. The building is 80 meters long (internally), 20 meters wide at the choir, and 32.5 meters high in the nave. The apse and choir are of Romanesque design; the nave and fa√ßade are Gothic. Noteworthy are the two crosses to right and left of the altar, preserved since the Second Council of Lyon of 1274 as a symbol of the union of the churches, and the Bourbon chapel, built by the Cardinal Charles II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother Pierre de Bourbon, son-in-law of Louis XI, a masterpiece of 15th century sculpture. The cathedral also has the Lyon Astronomical Clock from the 14th century. The cathedral organ was built by Daublaine and Callinet and was installed in 1841 at the end of the apse and had 15 stops. It was rebuilt in 1875 by Merklin-Sch√ºtze and given 30 stops, three keyboards of 54 notes and pedals for 27. Until the construction of the Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi√®re, it was the pre-eminent church in Lyon. Organists in residence *Edouard Commette - most of the first half of the 20th century.

He was the director of the Waldorf-Astoria-Zigarettenfabrik, and with Rudolf Steiner co-founded the first Waldorf school. Hence, Waldorf education was named after the company.  Background  Molt was born in southern Germany and was orphaned as a teenager. He enlisted in the military and worked for Emil Georgii after he was discharged. Georgii's son Emil Jr. hired Molt to work at Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory at Stuttgart. He later became its general manager and owner. A biography written by Molt's daughter detailed how he purchased the Waldorf Astoria brand name from the tobacconist shop in a New York hotel owned by the Astor family.  Waldorf school  Molt's association with Steiner began due to his interest in spirituality, particularly after he signed up as a member of the Theosophical Society in 1906. Steiner was regularly invited to speak in its gatherings.Robert A. McDermott, \\"Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy\\", in Faivre and Needleman, Modern Esoteric Spirituality, , p. 288ff The industrialist also became a follower of Steiner's esoteric philosophy called anthrosophy. After World War I people believed it was possible to initiate new social arrangements. It was the same for Molt who decided to address the educational needs of his factory workers and their children. For this initiative, he was drawn to Steiner's holistic proposition in education, which holds that teaching must attend to multiple aspects of human experience. Following a series of consultations, Molt and Steiner founded the Waldorf school after meeting and seeking the approval of the German minister of culture in May 1919. Molt bought the Uhlandeshohe Restaurant as school's first school building and altered it according to Steiner's specifications. The adjoining properties were later purchased as the school expanded. The Waldorf School opened with twelve teachers. Waldorf school became the largest independent school movement in the world.drazil, Tomas (2018). \\"Theorie-Praxis Verh√§ltnis in der Waldorfp√§dagogik\\".

Pius IX was elected Pope in June 1846, during a time of political agitation which ultimately led to the Revolutions of 1848. In Quibus quantusque, Pius gives a retrospective analysis of his first three years as Pope. He discusses some of the most important events, his intentions and the maneuvering of certain revolutionary elements who worked to capitalize on them.Spada, Giuseppe.

Measuring 312 m by 200 m (62,000 m¬≤ or 15 acres),Virtual Tourist it is one of the largest open squares (i.e. without any patches of greenery or trees) in Europe, and the third biggest square in France, behind the Place des Quinconces in Bordeaux (126,000 m¬≤) and the Place de la Concorde in Paris (86,400 m¬≤). It is also the largest pedestrian square in Europe: vehicles are allowed in Places de la Concorde and des Quinconces. In the middle is an equestrian statue of king Louis XIV by Fran√ßois-Fr√©d√©ric Lemot (1825). Another statue, representing the Petit Prince and Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, is at the west end of the square. The square also has two pavilions, housing the tourist information office of Lyon and an art gallery. The square is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Location The Ferris wheel, on the place Bellecour This square forms the central focus of the Presqu'√Æle (peninsula), between the Sa√¥ne and the Rh√¥ne, in the 2nd arrondissement of Lyon. It hosts the Lyon tourist office and the central post office. It is a focus of the city's shopping streets: four major streets (two of them pedestrianised) start here: the Rue de la R√©publique, leading to the H√¥tel de Ville and the Opera Nouvel; the Rue Victor-Hugo and the Rue du Plat both lead to Perrache; and the Rue du Pr√©sident √âdouard Herriot, with a concentration of luxury shops and leading to the Place des Terreaux. The quarter of Vieux Lyon and the Lyon Cathedral face the square over the Sa√¥ne. Place Bellecour is the kilometer 0 of Lyon: all distances are counted from this point. The square's metro station, also called Bellecour, is the intersection of lines A and D. The square is also served by many buses, including 10, 14 and 88. History During the Gallo-Roman era, the quarter of Bellecour was an alluvial island. In Roman times, the quarter had military and commercial activities: remains of huts which served as warehouses for traders and Gallo-Roman boatmen, called Canabae, have been found in this area.Jean Pelletier, Connaitre son arrondissement, le 2e, Lyonnaises d'art et d'histoire editions, p. 14 In the late 12th century, the archbishop of Lyon had a vineyard there called Bella curtis (Beau jardin in French). Abandoned, the area became swampy. In 1562, Fran√ßois de Beaumont, baron des Adrets attacked Lyon, installed his soldiers on the \\"Pr√© de Belle- cour\\".Jean Pelletier, Conna√Ætre son arrondissement, le 2e, Lyonnaises d'art et d'histoire editions, p. 28 In 1604, Henry IV forced the Lyon City Council to acquire what by then had become a pasture in order to create a public square, but the heirs of the Archbishop challenged this order in court, resulting in an interminable trial. Many years later, in 1708, Louis XIV obtained the ownership of the square. In 1715, it became the Place Royale. Named Place Louis-le-Grand, it was adorned with a bronze statue of the king made by Martin Desjardins. Around the square, some buildings were then constructed whose fa√ßades were designed by Robert de Cotte, the first architect of Louis XIV. During the French Revolution, an altar dedicated to Liberty was erected on the square on 14 July 1790. The square changed its name and became the Place de la F√©d√©ration. A guillotine was installed here in 1792. The royal statue was destroyed in 1793, and the square was then named Place de l'√âgalit√©. On 21 June 1800, Napoleon I, after his victory at Marengo, laid the foundation stone for new buildings. The square was renamed Place Bonaparte, later Place Napol√©on. During the Bourbon Restoration, in 1825, a new statue of Louis XIV was erected. It was only under the French Third Republic that the square took its current name: Place Bellecour. Statues Equestrian statue of Louis XIV, by Fran√ßois-Fr√©d√©ric Lemot, with the Ferris wheel in the background In the center of the square, there is an equestrian statue of Louis XIV by Fran√ßois- Fr√©d√©ric Lemot. It is accompanied, at his feet, by two allegorical statues of the Sa√¥ne and the Rh√¥ne, created by the brothers Nicolas and Guillaume Costou in 1720. The base came from a village in the Beaujolais: Le Perr√©on. The first statue was created in 1713 and destroyed during the French Revolution, in 1793, to make cannon. In 1825, the current statue, sculpted in Paris by Fran√ßois-Fr√©d√©ric Lemot, was installed in the square. It was transported to Lyon in twelve days on a coupling drawn by twenty-four horses. The entrance of the statue into the city was a festive occasion that attracted a big audience. There is also a statue of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry sitting in front of the Little Prince. It was erected in 2000 for the centenary of the aviator's birth. Allegorical statue of the Rh√¥ne, under the statue of Louis XIV Main events Throughout the year, a number of events take place on Place Bellecour : * In winter, an ice rink is installed. * There are sometimes concerts and events, including a book fair or a distribution of the \\"Petit Paum√©\\". * Student or trade union demonstrations often pass through. * On the weekend of Pentecost, there is a p√©tanque competition. * Every Friday night, the square is the starting point of a roller ride. * In winter, a 60-meter Ferris wheel is installed.

He was the youngest son of Huan Wen.  Early career  Huan Xuan was born in 369, as the youngest son of Huan Wen, then the paramount general of Jin, and his wife, Sima Xingnan (Âè∏È¶¨ËààÁî∑) the Princess of Nankang, the daughter of Emperor Ming of Jin. (An alternative account has him as born of Huan Wen's concubine Lady Ma.) When Huan Wen died in 373, his title should have gone to his heir apparent Huan Xi (Ê°ìÁÜô), his oldest son. However, Huan Chong, Huan Wen's brother whom Huan Wen entrusted the command of the army to, believed (correctly) that Huan Xi was in a plot with another brother of Huan Wen's, Huan Mi (Ê°ìÁßò), and another son of Huan Wen's, Huan Ji (Ê°ìÊøü), to assassinate him and take power, and so detained Huan Xi, Huan Ji, and Huan Mi. Instead, he declared that it was Huan Wen's desire that his title be passed to Huan Xuan, and so Huan Xuan, at age four, inherited the title of Duke of Nan Commandery, with the dukedom roughly corresponding to modern Jingzhou, Hubei. As Huan Xuan grew in age, he became ambitious and wanted high posts, but the imperial government was highly suspicious of him and did not give him governmental posts until 391, when he became an assistant to Emperor Xiaowu's crown prince Sima Dezong (later Emperor An). Around this time, he had an encounter with Emperor Xiaowu's younger brother Sima Daozi, the Prince of Kuaiji, that went badly‚Äîas at one feast where Sima Daozi invited Huan Xuan as a guest, after Sima Daozi became drunk, he made the statement, \\"Was it not true that when Huan Wen became old, he planned treason?\\" Huan Xuan was so struck by the statement that he fell prostrate on the ground, fearing that Sima Daozi would kill him, and from this point he bore a grudge against the prince. Eventually, Huan Xuan became the governor of Yixing Commandery (Áæ©Ëàà, roughly modern Wuxi, Jiangsu), but felt that the post was not sufficient for his talent, and he therefore resigned and returned to his dukedom, and he wrote a report to Emperor Xiaowu that was highly accusatory in tone in which he claimed that Emperor Xiaowu had much to owe to Huan Wen, and Emperor Xiaowu ignored the report. During Huan Xuan's year at Nan Commandery, the people of the commandery were far more fearful of him than of the governor of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan), Yin Zhongkan (ÊÆ∑‰ª≤Â†™). Yin himself was very respectful and fearful of Huan as well. Effectively, Huan Xuan got his way with both the people and the governor, whatever he wanted.  Gradual increase in power  After Emperor Xiaowu's death in 396, Emperor An became emperor, and as he was developmentally disabled, Sima Daozi, as his uncle, served as regent. Sima Daozi was incompetent, and his trusted associates Wang Guobao (ÁéãÂúãÂØ∂) and Wang Xu (ÁéãÁ∑í) took the opportunity to become wealthy from corruption. They feared the military powers that Yin Zhongkan and Wang Gong (ÁéãÊÅ≠) the governor of Yan (ÂÖóÂ∑û) and Qing (ÈùíÂ∑û) Provinces (at that time, roughly modern central Jiangsu) possessed and persuaded Sima Daozi to reduce their domains. In response, Wang Gong sent messengers to Yin to discuss a campaign to seek the removal of Wang Guobao and Wang Xu. Huan Xuan, believing that a disturbance would help his cause, encouraged Yin to join Wang Gong's campaign. Wang Gong, believing that Yin would join him, then started the campaign, and quickly intimidated Sima Daozi into executing Wang Guobao and Wang Xu. In 398, Huan Xuan requested the post of governor of Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, modern Guangdong and Guangxi), and Sima Daozi, afraid that he would start a new disturbance with Yin, was quite willing to give him the post. Huan Xuan accepted the post but did not actually report to Panyu (Áï™Á¶∫, modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), the capital of Guang Province. Later that year, angry that Sima Daozi had seized part of his domain and given it to his associate Wang Yu (ÁéãÊÑâ), Yu Kai (Â∫æÊ•∑) the governor of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, then modern central Anhui) persuaded Wang Gong and Yin to start another rebellion aimed at the removals of Wang Yu and another associate of Sima Daozi's, Sima Shangzhi (Âè∏È¶¨Â∞ö‰πã) the Prince of Qiao. However, not being actually a military man himself, Yin gave the commands of the forward armies to Huan Xuan and Yang Quanqi (Ê•ä‰Ω∫Êúü). They quickly advanced toward the capital Jiankang, but Wang Gong's general Liu Laozhi (ÂäâÁâ¢‰πã) then turned against him, capturing and executing him. With Wang Gong dead, Sima Daozi next tried to destroy Yin's coalition by ordering him deposed and giving his post to Huan Xuan's cousin Huan Xiu (Ê°ìËÑ©), while giving Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi and Fujian) to Huan Xuan and Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, then modern northern Hubei and southwestern Henan) to Yang. Huan and Yang hesitated‚Äînot willing to turn against Yin immediately but wanting to accept the powerful posts. This caused an immediate withdrawal of Yin's troops, as Yin wanted to resecure his Jing Province, and soon forced Sima Daozi to return the post to him, but the seeds of dissension between Huan, Yin, and Yang were sown. Yin, apprehensive of Huan, soon entered into an alliance with Yang. However, he was also apprehensive of Yang, and therefore repeatedly stopped Yang's plans to attack Huan together. Around the new year 400, Jing Province was suffering under a major flood, and Yin exhausted his food supplies for flood relief. Huan took this opportunity to make a major attack on Yin. Yang came to Yin's aid, but with the troops poorly supplied, Huan defeated both Yin and Yang and killed them, seizing their provinces, becoming effectively in control of two thirds of Jin territory. Huan became even more ambitious, and often had people offer him signs of fortune to try to show that he was being favored by the gods. He further wrote to Sima Daozi (who had, by this point, been displaced as regent by his son Sima Yuanxian), accusing him of falsely having Wang Gong killed. In 401, at the suggestion of the strategist Zhang Fashun (ÂºµÊ≥ïÈ†Ü), Sima Yuanxian declared Huan a renegade and started a campaign against him, but was thoroughly reliant on Liu Laozhi for support. Liu, who was more concerned that Sima Yuanxian would become uncontrollable if he were victorious against Huan, again changed sides and joined Huan, who was initially fearful of attacking the capital but eventually did so at the urging of Bian Fanzhi (ÂçûÁØÑ‰πã), soon reached Jiankang, and Sima Yuanxian's forces collapsed. Huan Xuan took over the control of the imperial regime, executed Sima Yuanxian, and exiled Sima Daozi (but soon had him killed in exile). Not trusting of the treacherous Liu, Huan stripped him of his military command, and Liu tried to rebel again‚Äîbut his own army officers were tired of repeated rebellions and deserted him, and he committed suicide. Huan was now in control of the entire Jin empire. Huan, however, soon displayed signs of over confidence and lack of actual fortitude. He had Emperor An issue an edict ordering him to advance north against Later Qin, but then had Emperor An issue another edict ordering him not to do so. Further, as he prepared his fleet, he set aside the treasures on a small ship, ready to flee if the battle turned against him. He was also hypercritical of his officials; any small error would draw a serious punishment from him. He was also very attached to treasures, and whenever he saw precious paintings, calligraphy, or houses, he would find some way to obtain them. Some ambitious individuals began to see signs of weakness in him and considered rising against him. In 403, Huan Xuan had himself created the Prince of Chu and given the nine bestowments, both signs of coming usurpation. In winter 403, he had Emperor An yield the throne to him, and he became emperor of a new Chu state.  Brief reign and death  Huan Xuan posthumously honored his parents as emperor and empress, and he created his wife Lady Liu empress. He was, however, described as being constantly in fear after he became emperor, not being able to sleep well. He forced his officials to spend all day on minutiae, and he further started major palatial construction projects that imposed great burden on the people. Initially, the only major official who dared to oppose Huan Xuan was Mao Qu (ÊØõÁí©) the governor of Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). However, a conspiracy soon formed among the general Liu Yu, Liu Laozhi's nephew He Wuji, and Liu Yi the brother of Huan Xuan's official Liu Mai (ÂäâÈÇÅ). They were soon joined by a number of other conspirators, and in spring 404 they started the uprising against Huan from the cities of Jingkou (‰∫¨Âè£, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and Guangling. Huan Xuan panicked, and as soon as his cousin Huan Qian (Ê°ìË¨ô) the Prince of Xinye lost some relatively minor battles to Liu Yu, Huan fled west with Emperor An, yielding Jiankang to Liu Yu's coalition. Once Liu Yu was in the capital, he declared the reestablishment of Jin, even though the former Jin emperor was still in Huan's hands. Huan Xuan soon arrive at his old headquarters of Jiangling. Fearful that his officials would no longer respect him, he dealt out even harsher treatments, which led to even greater alienation among his subordinates. He Wuji and Liu Yi quickly advanced on Jiangling, and Huan planned to flee again. His subordinate Mao Xiuzhi (ÊØõËÑ©‰πã), Mao Qu's nephew, falsely informed him that Mao Qu would support him, and Huan Xuan headed west toward Yi Province. He soon encountered Mao Qu's troops, which made heavy bow- and-arrow attacks on his fleet, causing it to scatter. The officer Feng Qian (È¶ÆÈÅ∑) boarded Huan's ship and beheaded him. His five-year-old son Huan Sheng (Ê°ìÊòá) was delivered to Jiangling and beheaded as well. After Huan Xuan's death, his cousins and nephews would hold out at their various posts for more than a year, but eventually were all killed or forced to flee to other states. Huan Xuan's hopes of establishing a new dynasty was no more.

After he had finished building them he bought land and raised his family there. Tarar√° was developed in the 1940s by American Royal Sylvester Webster as a complete town, with a church (Santa Elena), a club known as the Tarar√° Yacht Club, 400 residences, stores, a movie theater, a marina, a public park and beach facilities. Many considered the Tarar√° beach to be one of the most beautiful on the island, with its boardwalk being a popular weekend destination. Tarar√° was a fast and easy trip to Havana and the airport, with newly paved highways going directly to the resort. Mr. Webster lived there, as did all of his children. The entire Webster family, numbering ten who were born on Cuba, and ten who were originally U.S. citizens, were later forced to leave the island, however, after Castro's police confiscated their homes. Now a British hotel company wants to buy it from the Webster family, and the family disagrees whether they should sell or not. The older generation does not want to sell but the new generations do want to sell some of the land. Beach in Tarara After the Cuban Revolution, in January 1959, Che Guevara went to live at a summer villa in Tarar√° to recover from a violent asthma attack.Castaneda, p. 145-146. While there he started the Tarar√° Group, a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba's social, political, and economic development.Castaneda, p. 146. In addition, Che began to write his book Guerrilla Warfare while resting at Tarar√°. Che returned to Tarar√° in June 1959 for his honeymoon after his marriage to his second wife Aleida March.Castaneda, p. 159. At the height of tight Cuban-Soviet relations, the town housed Russian officials stationed in Cuba, and for a while (early 1990s) functioned as a recovery resort for Ukrainian children affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.Medical treatment of Chernobyl children After 2000 (and the partial opening of Cuba to foreign investments), this was a place of choice for representatives of foreign companies that were doing business in Cuba, with the residences functioning as rental villas. In 2005, the town was turned into a recovery resort for blind patients from Venezuela, in part of a deal between Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch√°vez, in which Cuba offered medical expertise in return for Venezuelean oil.Venezuela trade In 2007, the town began to receive Chinese students, especially high school graduates. This is under a project in which the Cuban government provides scholarships and facilities for those Chinese to learn Spanish. The Tarar√° beach houses can now be leased for a minimum one year from the government for foreign and embassy employees. In previous years Canadians, Italians and Spanish visitors rented the beach houses for long stay vacations for 1‚Äì6 months, but this has not been re-established yet as of 2009. Many houses have been renovated recently again due to interior destruction from the Venezuelan people's misuse. The Cuban doctors now go to Venezuela to treat eye patients.

Gwalior state was a semi-autonomous Maratha state. It was focused in modern-day Madhya Pradesh, arising due to the rise of the Maratha Empire and fragmentation of the Mughal Empire. It was ruled by the House of Scindia, a Hindu Maratha dynasty and was entitled to a 21-gun salute when it became a princely state of the British Empire. The state took its name from the old town of Gwalior, which, although never the actual capital, was an important place because of its strategic location and the strength of its fort. The state was founded in the early 18th century by Ranoji Sindhia, as part of the Maratha Confederacy. The administration of Ujjain was assigned by Peshwa Bajirao I to his faithful commander Ranoji Shinde and his Sarsenapati was Yeshaji Aravandekar.The diwan of Ranoji Shinde(Scindia) was Ramchandra Baba Shenvi who was very wealthy he re-built the famous Shri Mahakala Temple in Ujjain during the 4th-5th decades of Eighteenth century AD. Under Mahadji Sindhia (1761‚Äì1794) Gwalior State became a leading power in Central India, and dominated the affairs of the confederacy. The Anglo-Maratha Wars brought Gwalior State under British suzerainty, so that it became a princely state of the British Indian Empire. Gwalior was the largest state in the Central India Agency, under the political supervision of a Resident at Gwalior. In 1936, the Gwalior residency was separated from the Central India Agency, and made answerable directly to the Governor-General of India. After Indian Independence in 1947, the Sindhia rulers acceded to the new Union of India, and Gwalior state was absorbed into the new Indian state of Madhya Bharat. Geography The state had a total area of , and was composed of several detached portions, but was roughly divided into two, the Gwalior or Northern section, and the Malwa section. The northern section consisted of a compact block of territory with an area of , lying between 24¬∫10' and 26¬∫52' N. and 74¬∫38' and 79¬∫8' E. It was bounded on the north, northeast, and northwest by the Chambal River, which separated it from the native states of Dholpur, Karauli, and Jaipur in the Rajputana Agency; on the east by the British districts of Jalaun and Jhansi in the United Provinces, and by Saugor District in the Central Provinces; on the south by the states of Bhopal, Khilchipur, and Rajgarh, and by the Sironj pargana of Tonk State; and on the west by the states of Jhalawar, Tonk, and Kotah in the Rajputana Agency.Great Britain India Office. The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908. The Malwa section, which included the city of Ujjain, had an area of . It was made up of several detached districts, between which portions of other states were interposed, and which were themselves intermingled in bewildering intricacy. In 1940 Gwalior State had 4,006,159 inhabitants.Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer, p. 740 History The predecessor state of Gwalior was founded in the 10th century. In 1231 Iltutmish captured Gwalior and from then till 1398 it was a part of Delhi Sultanate. In 1398, the Gwalior came under the control of the Tomars. The most distinguished of the Tomar rulers was Man Singh Tomar, who commissioned several monuments within the Gwalior fort. It came under the Mughals in 1528 and was a part of the empire till 1731. The founder of the Gwalior house was Ranoji Sindhia, who belonged to the Shinde or Sindhia house which traced its descent from a family of which one branch held the hereditary post of patil in Kannerkhera, a village east of Satara. The head of the family received a patent of rank from the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, while a daughter of the house was married to the Maratha king Chattrapati Shahu Maharaj. In 1726, Ranoji along with Malhar Rao Holkar, the founder of the house of Indore, and the Pawars (Dewas Junior & Dewas Senior), were authorized by the Peshwa Baji Rao I to collect chauth (25% of the revenues) and sardeshmukhi (10% over and above the chauth) in the Malwa districts, retaining for his own remuneration half the mokassa (or his remaining 65 percent). Ranoji fixed his headquarters in the ancient city of Ujjain, which ultimately became the capital of the Sindhia dominion, and on 19 July 1745 he died near Shujalpur, where his centotaph stands. He left three legitimate sons, Jayappa, Dattaji, and Jotiba, and two illegitimate, Tukaji and Mahadji. Jayappa succeeded to the territories of Ranoji, but was killed at Nagaur in 1759. He was followed by his son Jankoji, who was taken prisoner at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 and put to death, and Mahadji succeeded. RulersMahadji Sindhia (1761‚Äì1794)= Mahadaji Shinde Standard of the Maharaja of Gwalior. Madhavrao I, Mahadji, and his successor Daulatrao took a leading part in shaping the history of India during their rule. Mahadji returned from the Deccan to Malwa in 1764, and by 1769 reestablished his power there. In 1772 Madhavrao Peshwa died, and in the struggles which ensued Mahadji took an important part, and seized every chance of increasing his power and augmenting his possessions. In 1775 Raghoba Dada Peshwa threw himself on the protection of the British. The reverses which Sindhia's forces met with at the hands of Colonel Goddard after his famous march from Bengal to Gujarat (1778) the fall of Gwalior to Major Popham (1780), and the night attack by Major Camac, opened his eyes to the strength of the new power which had entered the arena of Indian politics. In 1782 the Treaty of Salbai was made with Sindhia, the chief stipulations being that he should withdraw to Ujjain, and the British north of the Yamuna, and that he should negotiate treaties with the other belligerents. The importance of the treaty can scarcely be exaggerated. It made the British arbiters of peace in India and virtually acknowledged their supremacy, while at the same time Sindhia was recognized as an independent chief and not as a vassal of the Peshwa. A resident, Mr. Anderson (who had negotiated the treaty) was at the same time appointed to Sindhia's court. Between 1782 and December 1805 Dholpur State was annexed by Gwalior. Sindhia took full advantage of the system of neutrality pursued by the British to establish his supremacy over Northern India. In this he was assisted by the genius of Beno√Æt de Boigne, whose influence in consolidating the power of Mahadji Sindhia is seldom estimated at its true value. He was from the Duchy of Savoy, a native of Chamb√©ry, who had served under Lord Clare in the famous Irish Brigade and Fontenoy and elsewhere and who after many vicissitudes, including imprisonment by the Turks, reached India and for a time held a commission in the 6th Madras Infantry. After resigning his commission he had proposed to travel overland to Russia, but was prevented by the loss of his possessions and papers, stolen, it appears, at the instigation of Mahadji, who was suspicious of his intentions. De Boigne finally entered Mahadji's service, and by his genius for organization and command in the field, was instrumental in establishing the Maratha supremacy. Commencing with two battalions of Infantry, he ultimately increased Sindhia's regular forces to three brigades. With these troops Sindhia became a power in northern India. In 1785 Sindhia reinstated the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II on his throne at Delhi, receiving in return the title of deputy Vakil-ul-Mutlak or vice-regent of the Empire, that of Vakil-ul-Mutlak being at his request conferred on the Peshwa, his master, as he was pleased to designate him. Many of the principal feudal lords of the empire refused to pay tribute to Sindhia. Sindhia launched an expedition against the Raja of Jaipur, but withdrew after the inconclusive Battle of Lalsot in 1787. On 17 June 1788 Sindhia's armies defeated Ismail Beg, a Mughal noble who resisted the Marathas. The Afghan chief Ghulam Kadir, Ismail Beg's ally, took over Delhi, and deposed and blinded the Emperor Shah Alam, placing a puppet on the Delhi throne. Sindhia intervened, taking possession of Delhi on 2 October, restoring Shah Alam to the throne and acting as his protector. Mahadji sent de Boigne to crush the forces of Jaipur at Patan (20 June 1790) and the armies of Marwar at Merta on 10 September 1790. After the peace made with Tipu Sultan in 1792, Sindhia successfully exerted his influence to prevent the completion of a treaty between the British, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the Peshwa, directed against Tipu. Mahadji shinde's role was instrumental in establishing Maratha supremacy over North India . De Boigne defeated the forces of Tukaji Holkar at Lakheri on 1 June 1793. Mahadji was now at the zenith of his power, when all his schemes for further aggrandizement were cut short by his sudden death in 1794 at Wanowri near Pune. Mahadji's death was mystery. =Daulatrao Sindhia (1794‚Äì1827)= Company style painting of Daulatrao Scindia, c. 1825 Mahadji left no heir, and was succeeded by Daulat Rao, a grandson of his brother Tukaji, who was scarcely 15 years of age at the time. Daulat Rao looked upon himself as the chief sovereign in India and not as member of the Maratha Confederacy. At this time the death of the young Peshwa, Madhav Rao II (1795), and the troubles which it occasioned, the demise of Tukaji Holkar and the rise of the Yashwant Rao Holkar, together with the intrigues of Nana Fadnavis, threw the country into confusion and enabled Sindhia to gain the ascendancy. He also came under the influence of Sarje Rao Ghatke, whose daughter he had married (1798). Urged possibly by this adviser, Daulat Rao aimed at increasing his dominions at all costs, and seized territory from the Maratha Ponwars of Dhar and Dewas. The rising power of Yashwant Rao Holkar of Indore, however, alarmed him. In July 1801, Yashwant Rao appeared before Sindhia's capital of Ujjain, and after defeating some battalions under John Hessing, extorted a large sum from its inhabitants, but did not ravage the town. In October, however, Sarje Rao Ghatke took revenge by sacking Indore, razing it almost to the ground, and practicing every form of atrocity on its inhabitants. From this time dates the gardi-ka-wakt, or 'period of unrest', as it is still called, during which the whole of central India was overrun by the armies of Sindhia and Holkar and their attendant predatory Pindari bands, under Amir Khan and others. De Boigne had retired in 1796; and his successor, Pierre Cuillier-Perron, was a man of a very different stamp, whose determined favouritism of French officers, ind defiance of all claims to promotion, produced discontent in the regular corps. Finally, on 31 December 1802, the Peshwa signed the Treaty of Bassein, by which the British were recognized as the paramount power in India. The continual evasion shown by Sindhia in all attempts at negotiation brought him into conflict with the British, and his power was completely destroyed in both western and northern India by the British victories at Ahmadnagar, Assaye, Asirgarh, and Laswari. His famous brigades were annihilated and his military power irretrievably broken. On 30 December 1803, he signed the Treaty of Surji Anjangaon, by which he was obliged to give up his possessions between the Yamuna and the Ganges, the district of Bharuch, and other lands in the south of his dominions; and soon after by the Treaty of Burhanpur he agreed to maintain a subsidiary force to be paid for out of the revenues of territory ceded by the treaty. By the ninth article of the Treaty of Sarji Anjangaon he was deprived of the fortresses of Gwalior and Gohad, The discontent produced by the last condition almost caused a rupture, and did actually result in the plundering of the Resident's camp and detention of the Resident as a prisoner. In 1805, under the new policy of Lord Cornwallis, Gohad and Gwalior were restored, and the Chambal River was made the northern boundary of the state, while certain claims on Rajput states were abolished, the British government at the same time binding itself to enter into no treaties with Udaipur, Jodhpur, Kotah, or any chief tributary to Sindhia in Malwa, Mewar, or Marwar. In 1811, Daulat Rao annexed the neighboring kingdom of Chanderi. In 1816 Sindhia was called on to assist in the suppression of the Pindaris. For some time it was doubtful what line he would take, but he ultimately signed the Treaty of Gwalior in 1817 by which he promised full cooperation. He did not, however, act up to his professions, and connived at the retention of the fort of Asirgarh, which had been ceded by the treaty. A fresh treaty in 1818 effected a readjustment of boundaries, Ajmer and other lands being ceded. =Jankojirao II Sindhia (1827‚Äì1843)= Jayaji Rao Sindhia, studying English, 1846 In 1827 Daulat Rao died, leaving no son or adopted heir. His widow, Baiza Bai, adopted Mukut Rao, a boy of eleven belonging to a distant but legitimate branch of the family, who succeeded as Jankojirao Sindhia. Jankojirao was a weak ruler and feuds were constant at his court, while the army was in a chronic state of mutiny. Upon his succession, difficulties arose as to whether the Bai should ruler in her own right or as regent, and her behaviour towards the young king finally caused a rise in feeling in his favour which impelled the Bai to take refuge in British territory. She returned after an interval and lived at Gwalior until her death in 1862. The chief's maternal uncle, known as Mama Sahib, had meanwhile become minister. The most important event during this period was the readjustment of the terms for maintaining the contingent force raised under the treaty of 1817. =Jayajirao Sindhia (1843‚Äì1886)= Jayajirao Scindia, in 1875 Jankojirao died in 1843; and in the absence of an heir, his widow Tara Bai adopted Bhagirath Rao, a son of Hanwant Rao, commonly called Babaji Sindhia. He succeeded under the name of Jayajirao Sindhia, the Mama Sahib being chosen as regent. Tara Bai, however, came under the influence of Dada Khasgiwala, the comptroller of her household, an unscrupulous adventurer who wished to get all power into his own hands. A complicated series of intrigues followed, which it is impossible to unravel. The Dada, however, succeeded in driving Mama Sahib from the state and became minister. He filled all appointments with his relatives, and matters rapidly passed from bad to worse, ending in the assemblage of large bodies of troops who threatened an attack on Sironj, where Mama Sahib was then residing. War was impending in the Punjab, and, as it was essential to secure peace, the British Government decided to interfere. Colonel Sleeman, the Resident, was withdrawn, and the surrender of Dada Khasgiwala was demanded. A British force under Sir Hugh Gough moved on Gwalior, and crossed the Chambal in December 1843. On 29 December followed the simultaneous battles of Panniar and Maharajpur, in which the Gwalior army was annihilated. A treaty was then made, under which certain lands to the value of 1.8 million, including Chanderi District, were ceded for the upkeep of a contingent force, besides other lands for the liquidation of the expenses incurred in the late war, the State army was reduced, and a Council of Regency was appointed during the minority, to act under the residents advice. In 1852 Dinkar Rao became minister, and under his able management radical reforms were introduced into every department of the administration. Srimant Maharaja Jayavirao (also called as Maharaj Jayajirao saheb Shinde) was in favor to have a fight with British army. On 17 June 1858 Gwalior was captured by Sir Hugh Rose and Maharaja sri Jayajirao was reinstated. For his services lands worth 300,000 per year, including the portion of Chanderi District west of the Betwa River, were made over, and he was allowed to increase his infantry from 3000 to 5000 men, and his artillery from 32 to 36 guns. In 1858 Gwalior annexed Chanderi State. Development in the Gwalior State Madhav Rao Scindia about 1903. George Jivajirao Sindhia Jayajirao Shinde was the Founder of Development in Gwalior after 1857 and worked for the peoples of gwalior to establish their own business. He was a very good artist of Gwalior Gharana Classical Music and opened a school for learning music. The Gwalior got its music in his regein. It was his sole efforts that made Gwalior the most advanced city of India. GCB - Knight Grand Cross Order of the Bath (medal 1.1.1877), GCSI - (25.6.1861), CIE (1.1.1878). In 1872 the state lent 7.5 million for the construction of the Agra-Gwalior portion of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, and a similar amount in 1873 for the Indore-Nimach section of the Rajputana-Malwa railway. A personal salute of 21 guns was conferred in 1877, and Jayajirao became a Counsellor of the Empress and later on a GCB and CIE. In 1882 land was ceded by the state for the Midland section of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway. In 1885 Gwalior fort and Morar cantonment, with some other villages, which had been held by British troops since 1858, were exchanged for Jhansi city.Markovits, Claude (ed.) (2004). A History of Modern India: 1480-1950. Anthem Press, London. =Madhavrao II Sindhia (1886‚Äì1925)= Jayaji Rao died in 1886 and was succeeded by his son, Madho Rao Sindhia, then a boy in his tenth year. A council of Regency conducted the administration until 1894, when the Maharaja obtained powers. He took a deep and active interest in the administration of the state, and had a comprehensive grasp of the work done in each department. In 1900 the Maharaja went to China during the Boxer Rebellion, at the same time presenting a hospital ship for the accommodation of the wounded. =Jivajirao Sindhia (1925‚Äì1948)= Jivajirao Sindhia ruled the state of Gwalior as absolute monarch until shortly after India's independence on 15 August 1947. The rulers of Indian princely states had the choice of acceding to either of the two dominions (India and Pakistan) created by the India Independence Act 1947 or remaining outside them. Jivajirao signed a covenant with the rulers of the adjoining princely states that united their several states to form a new state within the union of India known as Madhya Bharat. This new covenanted state was to be governed by a council headed by a ruler to be known as the Rajpramukh. Madhya Bharat signed a fresh Instrument of Accession with the Indian dominion effective from 15 June 1948. Jivajirao became the first rajpramukh, or appointed governor, of the state on 28 May 1948. He served as Rajpramukh until 31 October 1956, when the state was merged into Madhya Pradesh.

Northern Gwalior comprised seven zilas or districts: Gwalior Gird, Bhind, Sheopur, Tonwarghar, Isagarh, Bhilsa, and Narwar. The Malwa Prant comprises four zilas, Ujjain, Mandsaur, Shajapur, and Amjhera. The zilas were subdivided into parganas, the villages in a pargana being grouped into circles, each under a patwari. The administration of the state was controlled by the Maharaja, assisted by the Sadr Board. This Board consisted of seven members, the Maharaja himself being president and the members being in charge of different departments, of which the most important were the Revenue, Land Records and Settlement, Forest, Accounts, Public Works, Customs, and Post Office. The Maharaja had no minister, but a staff of secretaries, supervised by a chief secretary, prepared cases for the final orders of the Maharaja. The zilas were overseen by subahs, or district magistrates; in Northern Gwalior, the subahs answered directly to the Sadr Board, while in Malwa, a Sar Subah was in general charge of the Malwa prant, and controlled and oversaw the work of the four Malwa subahs. The numerous feudal estates under Gwalior were administered by the local rulers, and were outside the administration of the zilas and prants. The small estates (thakurs or diwans) of Sangul Wardha'Agra ' were nominally under the authority of Gwalior state, but the British Resident had certain administrative and judicial powers.

Future plans  There is a new junction planned at Albern, as part of the lengthening of the Donauuferautobahn A22, which in the future should be extended into a so-called Halbknoten or half-junction. This would mean, for instance, that it would only be possible to go from Schwechat onto the A22, meaning one would have to travel from the A22 to the A4, in the direction of Schwechat. In the future there are plans to connect the six-lane extension between the Schwechat junction and the airport.

The stations are owned by Brian A. Larson. WNGN is licensed to Troy, while WNGX is licensed to Schenectady and is officially considered to be a WNGN translator. WNGN-LP started as W04AT, then received the call-sign and channel W26BL on channel 26 on September 21, 1994, before receiving its current channel and call-sign on December 23, 1994. In 1992, Larson acquired WNGN-LP (then W26BL), a small TV translator in Hoosick Falls, that rebroadcast educational programming for the Hoosick Falls Central School District. He applied to switch the city of license (COL) to Troy, NY, and eventually moved the transmitter to its current site on Bald Mountain. WNGX-LD started with an experimental license and callsign of 940414FX on January 18, 1996. It was upgraded to become W04DA on channel 4 later that same day. On July 13, 1998, the station was upgraded again to become WGNX-LP and gained its current channel allocation. On September 11, 2009, the station converted to digital broadcasting and its call sign changed to WNGX-LD. Larson holds a construction permit to convert the station to a Low-power Digital (-LD) transmitter with an effective radiated power of only 0.14 kW. He will retain the analog channel number by using what is known as digital flash. WTEN-DT has decided to use channel 35 for its digital home, thus displacing WNGN-LP from the dial. Under the Commission's rules, low power stations must surrender their channel to a full power applicant. On February 2, 2007, WNGN-LP applied to move its analog channel to 38. This is the second time WTEN has displaced WNGN-LP. For over ten years WNGN-LP broadcast on channel 26 until that was designated for WTEN to use for digital transmissions causing WNGN-LP to move to channel 35. History The table of allotments for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy metro originally designated channel 35 as a reserved non-commercial channel. Local public station WMHT had expressed interest in the allotment for years but switched focus to digital upgrades on channel 17. Prior to being reserved for noncommercial use, channel 35 originally signed on the air in 1952 as the first UHF station in the region. After only two years on the air the station failed because most television receivers were incapable of receiving UHF signals. The owners switched to VHF Channel 13 in Saratoga Springs which later moved to Albany, where today they still operate as NBC affiliate WNYT. WNGN-LP also transmits on channel 35 from the same tower and transmitter building as the original 35 used. For the station's entire history, WNGN was affiliated with FamilyNet. FamilyNet ceased network operations in 2017 when it transitioned to the subscription-only Cowboy Channel. External links  NGN-LP ","title":"WNGN-LP"},{"id":"4437941","text":"Mark W. Messner (born December 29, 1965) is a former American football player. Messner played college football for the University of Michigan. He started every game, 49 in all, at defensive tackle for Michigan from 1985 to 1988. He was the first position player ever to be selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player all four years. He was selected as a first-team All-American by the Sporting News in 1987 and was a consensus All-American in 1988. He set still holds Michigan records for quarterback sacks in a game (5), career tackles for loss (70), and career sacks (36). He was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 2014. Messner later played in the National Football League (NFL) as a linebacker for the Los Angeles Rams during the 1989 NFL season. He sustained a serious knee injury in the 1989-90 NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers and never played in another game. Early years and family Messner was born in Riverview, Michigan, a southern suburb of Detroit, in 1965. His biological father, Max Messner, was a linebacker for the Detroit Lions and Pittsburgh Steelers from 1960 to 1965. Messner's parents divorced when he was young, and he was raised by his mother and stepfather, Del Pretty, who ran a piano store in Livonia, Michigan. Messner referred to his biological father as the \\"fun\\" dad and Pretty as the \\"disciplinarian.\\" In a 1988 interview with Mitch Albom, Messner referred to Pretty as \\"the most important person in my life. He's the reason I do what I do, and try as hard as I try.\\" He later noted that Pretty \\"raised me, fed me, spanked me, hugged me, took me to school, wrote me poems, came to all my football games and made me feel like the most important person in the world. Pretty was diagnosed with lymph node cancer in 1980 and eventually died from the disease in December 1989 when Messner was a rookie with the Los Angeles Rams. Messner was a hyperactive child for whom football was an outlet to unleash his energy. He grew up in Hartland, Michigan, and attended Hartland High School from 1980 to 1981 before transferring to Detroit Catholic Central High School, which was then located in Redford, Michigan. He played at the tight end and nose guard positions for Catholic Central in 1982 and 1983 and earned all-state and high school All-American honors as a senior, and graduated in 1984. He was later inducted into both the Catholic Central and Catholic League Halls of Fame. University of Michigan Messner enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1984 and played college football as a defensive tackle for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1985 to 1988. At six feet, three inches, Messner was small for his position. He adjusted for his size by playing with speed and intelligence. Messner once described his approach as follows: \\"I try to move with quickness toward his weakness. I try to get away from where he is leaning, like a matador steps around a bull.\\" The Los Angeles Times in January 1989 called him \\"a quarterback's worst enemy.\\" Another writer described him as \\"a combination Dennis the Menace and Henry David Thoreau, a philosopher with a cowlick\\" and \\"Aristotle in a jockstrap.\\" Messner noted that it was his goal to play with \\"youthful intensity\\" like \\"a young kid.\\" 1985 season Messner was a redshirt who did not play during the 1984 season. As a redshirt freshman, he started all 12 games at defensive tackle for the 1985 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-1-1 record, was ranked #2 in the final AP Poll, held opponents to 75 points in the regular season (6.8 points per game), and defeated Nebraska in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl. Despite his lack of college experience, Messner set a new Michigan record in 1985 with 11 quarterback sacks and also totaled 71 tackles and 14 tackles for loss. He was also named the Defensive Player of the Game in the 1986 Fiesta Bowl after he registered nine tackles, forced a fumble, and recovered another. He was also selected as a first-team defensive lineman on the 1985 All-Big Ten team. 1986 season In his second year, Messner started all 13 games at defensive tackle for the 1986 Michigan team that compiled an 11-2 record, tied for the Big Ten Conference championship, and lost to Arizona State in the 1987 Rose Bowl. For the second consecutive year, Messner was selected as a first-team defensive lineman on the All-Big Ten team. 1987 season As a junior, Messner again started every game, 12 in all, at defensive tackle for the 1987 Wolverines. He had 11 sacks during the 1987 season. His five sacks against Northwestern on October 31, 1987, remains a Michigan single-game record. At the end of the season, he was selected by the Sporting News as a first-team defensive lineman on the 1987 All-America Team. He was also voted by his teammates as Michigan's defensive player of the year. 1988 season Prior to the 1988 season, the Sporting News featured a photograph of Messner and coach Schembechler on the cover of its preseason issue ranking Michigan #1 in the country. During the 1988 season, Messner started every game at defensive tackle for the fourth consecutive year. In all, he started 49 consecutive games for Michigan starting with the opening game of his redshirt freshman year. He was selected as a co-captain and Most Valuable Player on the 1988 Michigan team that lost its opening two games against #1-ranked Miami (by one point) and eventual national champion Notre Dame (by two points), then went undefeated for the remaining 10 games, and defeated USC in the 1989 Rose Bowl. Messner had eight sacks and set a Michigan record in 1988 with 26 tackles for loss. After the 1988 season, Messner was selected as a consensus first-team defensive lineman on the 1988 All-America Team. He was also selected to play in the Hula Bowl and the Japan Bowl post-season all-star games. Career overview and honors Messner was the first position player in the Big Ten Conference to be selected as a first-team all-conference player in four consecutive years. Only one other Michigan player, Chris Hutchinson (1989-1992), has matched the feat. In four years at Michigan, Messner totaled 248 tackles and five fumble recoveries.(to retrieve Messner's statistics, enter \\"messner\\" in the box for the player's last name) He remains Michigan's all-time career leader in tackles for loss (70), tackles for sack yardage (376 yards), sacks (36), and sack yardage (273 yards). He was also Michigan's sack leader each year from 1985 to 1987. In 2014, Messner was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor. He has also been included on the ballot for possible induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in both 2013 and 2014. Professional football Messner was drafted in the sixth round (161st overall pick) of the 1989 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams. He was drafted lower than had been anticipated, and an Associated Press story reported that NFL representatives believed his speed and size (6'3\\", 255 pounds) made him \\"too small for an NFL defensive tackle and too slow for a linebacker.\\" Messner appeared in only four regular season games, none as a starter, for the Rams during their 1989 season. On January 14, 1990, he sustained a career-ending knee injury in the 1989-90 NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers and never played in another game. The injury resulted in tears to his anterior (ACL), lateral and medial cruciate ligaments. Messner recalled, \\"My knee injury was a dandy for my one and only football injury ... Last time I ever put on football gear. Bad day!\\" Later years and family Messner married Jennifer Rybarz Messner in January 2002. He has four children, Mitchell Messner, Justin Messner, Bailey Reiter and Mckenna Reiter. After retiring from football, Messner worked for Eastman Kodak Company and later for Canon Business Solutions and Konica Minolta Business Solutions U.S.A. He was a region vice president for Canon from March 2009 to July 2010 based in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Since July 2010, he has been a vice president of Konica Minolta in Tampa, Florida.

Quran The Qur'an refers to puberty in 6:152; 12:22; 17:34; 18:82: 22:5; 28:14; 40:67: 46:15 and 3 times in chapter 24 An-Nisa (31, 58, 59), where reference is made to a prepubescent child's unawareness of sexual matters, which allows him or her to be with an adult whose state of dress would preclude more mature individuals from being present. One includes children who have not reached puberty in a list of those before whom woman may adopt a more relaxed standard of dress than what is normally stipulated in the verse 31 of An-Nur (24:31). The other makes a distinction between children who have reached puberty and those who have not, with the latter having access to parents who might be in a state of undress. Hadith and before the age of puberty, his faults and crimes are generally considered as irrevocable according to the hadith. According to another ahadith, at starting puberty, the recording angels start recording bad deeds such as missing regular prayers. In another hadith of Abu Dawood, Muhammad told Muslims to order to pray when they can distinguish between left hand and right hand which means before puberty. Jurisprudence In Islam, human life is divided into two parts, the first is before adolescence or childhood, when man is considered innocent, and the second is after adolescence (bulugiyat) or adulthood, when the Islamic law is fully applied to man and the hereafter is judged. If a person dies before he becomes an adult, he is considered to be in heaven. According to Islamic jurists, human irads or niyah or qasd or free will, aqal or ability to judge right and wrong, and courage are formed before the age of puberty (Tamyiz) and between the age of puberty, and after the age of puberty (Taklif), his intellect (Aql), that is, wisdom and judgment, attains perfection. Therefore, from childhood, that is, before the age of seven, the child is taught the Kitab or knowledge, Adab or etiquette, Ibadat or worship and Taharat or cleanliness, because at this time the child is easily fit to receive education. In marriage In issues pertaining to marriage, baligh is related to the Arabic legal expression, hatta tutiqa'l-rijal, which means that the a wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in sexual intercourse. In comparison, baligh or balaghat concerns the reaching of sexual maturity which becomes manifest by the menses. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called rushd, or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her bridewealth.Masud, Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas, Harvard University Press, 1996 See also * Islam and children * Ibadah * Islamic family jurisprudence NotesExternal links *https://web.archive.org/web/20090115082648/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/reference/glossary/term.SINALBULUGH.html Category:Adulthood Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Islamic jurisprudence Category:Modesty in Islam Category:Puberty Category:Sexuality in Islam Category:Sharia legal terminology ","title":"Baligh"},{"id":"4437958","text":"The Yudh Seva Medal is one of India's military decorations for distinguished service during wartime.

History The Balder was constructed in 1978 as semi- submersible crane vessel by Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.. Balder and sister vessel, Hermod were the world's first semi-submersible crane vessels. In the early 1980s these vessels set several lift records while operating in the North Sea. Conversion to a DCV was carried out in 2001 by Verolme Botlek BV in the Netherlands. Design The hull consists of two floaters with three columns each. The transit draught of 12 meters is normally ballasted down to 25 meters for lifting operations, with the floaters (with a draught of 12 meters) are well-submerged, reducing the effect of waves and swell. It is powered by seven 3,500 kW azimuth thrusters and two propellers. There is accommodation for 350 persons. Lightship weight is 49,631 tonnes. In the 2001 conversion, it was fitted with seven thrusters and a J-lay system. The 98 m J-Lay tower, designed and constructed by Huisman Itrec, is capable of laying pipe in water depths to . Balder was also equipped with class III dynamic positioning system and a mooring line deployment winch. The winch is the largest in the world, with a diameter of 10.5 meters and a safe working load (SWL) of 275 t. Cranes The Balder has two cranes (3600 t, 2700 t). Originally the starboard-side crane was rated at 3000 short ton and the port- side at 2000 short ton. In 1984, the lifting capacities were upgraded to 4000 and 3000 short tons respectively in a fixed mode (and 3300 & 2200 in revolving mode). To accommodate the J-Lay tower, the port crane jib was converted to a fly jib in 2001. Remarkable projects * In 1978 Occidental‚Äôs Piper Alpha was the first platform installation with a Semi Submersible Crane Vessel. It was a British platform that blew out and burned to the water, killing 167 of its crew. * In 2005 the world's largest semi-submersible platform, BP's Thunder Horse, was installed. Later in the year, Balder assisted in righting Thunder Horse, found listing dramatically after Hurricane Dennis. * In 2006 it installed BP‚Äôs Mardi Gras Atlantis gas export pipeline (0.6 m / 24 in diameter) in a record breaking water depth of 2220 meters (7217 feet). * in 2007 it moored the Independence Hub Facility in a record breaking water depth of 2438 m (8000 ft), with a world record for the deepest flow line installation of 2743 m (9000 ft).

Plot  Players play as Stan Gonzo, who receives a will from his father, whom he has never before met. Stan assumes his role as leader of the largest cyber technology company, the Kanary, and tries to unravel how his dad died, who he was, and what to do next. The game starts when Stan is already sitting in his office in the Kanary where a police officer asks if he has any information to further the investigation into his father's murder. Stan's own investigation starts by looking around the Kanary and meeting the rest of his family.  Gameplay  Players move around the ZeroZone world through a semi-3D interface, that lets players look 360 degrees around with panorama like scenery. Players move around by clicking a section of the panorama image, to go to another semi-3D panorama scene; the game advances in the same style. Game obstacles are mainly solving puzzles, find clues and talking and interacting with other people. Some 1st person shooting action comes around every now and then, but this is more to further the plot than true fighting. The ZeroZone virtual world is quite large, with many places to visit. Players can communicate with almost all people in the game, often they reveal clues or give hints on what to do next.  Reception  When the game was released, it was criticised for having low quality graphics. Yet some say the plot and music created the right setting for enjoyment. Another noticeable drawback is the seemingly buggy code, which can make the game crash for no apparent reason.

Biography Karl K√∂nig with his professors in Vienna, 1925 K√∂nig was born in Vienna, in Austria-Hungary, on 25 September 1902, the only son of a Jewish shoemaker. He studied medicine at the University of Vienna and graduated in 1927 with a special interest in embryology. After graduating, he was invited by Ita Wegman to work in her Klinisch-Therapeutisches Institut, an institute for people with special needs in Arlesheim, Switzerland. He married Mathilde Maasberg in 1929.Biography retrieved from Official Karl K√∂nig Institute and Archive K√∂nig was appointed paediatrician at the Rudolf Steiner-inspired Schlo√ü Pilgrimshain institute in Strzegom, where he worked until 1936 when he returned to Vienna and set up a successful medical practice. In 1938 he was forced to flee Vienna due to Hitler's invasion of Austria and relocated, at Dr. Wegman's suggestion, to Aberdeen, Scotland, where she had friends who could help recommence his work. He was briefly interned due to the outbreak of World War II, but on his release in 1940, he set up the first Camphill Community for Children in Need of Special Care at Camphill, by Milltimber, on the outskirts of Aberdeen. At this time, he was supported also by George MacLeod, founder of the Iona Community. From the mid-1950s, K√∂nig set up more communities, including the first to care for those with special needs beyond school age in North Yorkshire. In 1964, K√∂nig moved to Brachenreuthe, near √úberlingen on Lake Constance, Germany, where he set up a community. He died there in 1966.

It was a further development of Supermarine's famous Spitfire and Spiteful aircraft, which by that point was a 10-year-old design following a rapid period of aviation development in history. It was outmoded by jet aircraft, and only 18 were built.Price, 2001 Design and development The Seafang was essentially a Spiteful redesigned for Royal Navy carrier use, with the addition of an arrester hook, a contra-rotating propeller to eliminate engine torque effects, and power folding outer wing panels. Two prototype Type 396 Seafang Mark 32s were ordered on 12 March 1945 followed by an order for 150 Type 382 Seafang Mark 31s on 7 May 1945. To expedite entry into service the interim Mark 31 was ordered which was a navalised Spiteful, basically a Spiteful with an arrestor hook. This would allow the Mark 32 to be developed; it would be the definitive naval variant, again with an arrestor hook but also folding outer wing panels and a contra-rotating propeller. The first Seafang flew in 1946; it was the first interim production Mark 31 VG471. Although 150 of the interim variant were ordered, only nine were completed before the order was cancelled as the urgency of an interim type was removed due to the end of the war. The first prototype definitive Mark 32 VB895 was first flown in June 1946. It was powered by a Griffon 89 engine rated at 2,350 hp (1,752 kW) driving two three-bladed contra-rotating propellers. In August 1946, VB895 was demonstrated to the Royal Netherlands Navy at Valkenburg. The same aircraft was flown by noted test pilot Mike Lithgow in May 1947, during deck landing trials on . Compared to the Seafire F.47, its performance advantage was not deemed to be enough to disrupt series production of new navalised Meteor and Vampire jet fighters. Also, the Seafang's low-speed handling characteristics were not as good as hoped, and the contemporary Hawker Sea Fury was preferred as a fleet fighter. Seafang Mark 31 VG474 was used as a development aircraft for the Supermarine Attacker including the fitment of power-operated ailerons and contra-rotating propellers. The Attacker was a jet-powered development of the Spiteful/Seafang design which used the Spiteful laminar-flow wing and landing gear. Supermarine Type 391 In 1943, as the design of the Spiteful was developing, Supermarine presented a brochure to the Air Ministry describing a \\"High-Performance Aeroplane for the Royal Navy\\", also known as the Supermarine Type 391. This design was intended to be used as a carrier- borne fighter, with a secondary role as a strike aircraft, able to carry an 18-inch (45.7 cm) Mark XV aerial torpedo. Bombs or rockets could also be carried and the fixed armament was four Hispano Mk. V 20mm cannon. The 391 used the Spiteful/Seafang wing and undercarriage mated to a wide centre- section incorporating leading edge air intakes feeding the coolant radiators for a 3,550 hp, 24 cylinder 46-H-24 (later known as the \\"Eagle\\"); this engine drove contra-rotating, four-bladed propellers. The fuselage was longer with a redesigned fin and rudder unit.Buttler 2004, p. 30. Specifications for the Type 391 include a wingspan of 43 ft 6 in (13.3 m), a fuselage length of 39 ft 9 in (12.1 m) and a wing area of 335 ft¬≤ (31.2 m¬≤). Maximum weights were 15,750 lb (7,144 kg) as a fighter and 17,250 lb (7,825 kg) when armed with a torpedo. The maximum speed was projected to be 546 mph (879 km/h) at 25,000 ft (7,620 m).Buttler 2004, p. 32. Variants ;Type 382 Seafang F.31 :Interim production variant with a 2,375 hp Griffon 61 engine, five-bladed constant- speed Rotol airscrew. 150 ordered but only 9 built; the rest were cancelled. ;Type 396 Seafang F.32 :Two prototypes built powered by a 2,350 hp (1,752 kW) Griffon 89 piston engine, folding wings, increased fuel capacity, dual contra- rotating 3-bladed propellers.

The earliest known reference to the \\"Windy City\\" was actually to Green Bay in 1856. The first known repeated effort to label Chicago with this nickname is from 1876 and involves Chicago's rivalry with Cincinnati. The popularity of the nickname endures to this day‚Äî126 years after the Cincinnati rivalry ended. Origins There are four main possibilities to explain the city's nickname: the weather, as Chicago is near Lake Michigan; the World's Fair; politics; and the rivalry with Cincinnati. Weather While Chicago is widely known as the \\"Windy City\\", it is not the windiest city in the United States. Some of the windier cities recorded by the NOAA/NCDC are Dodge City, Kansas, at 13.9 mph (22.3 km/h); Amarillo, Texas, at 13.5 mph (21.7 km/h); and Lubbock, Texas, at 12.4 mph (20 km/h). Chicago is not significantly windier than any other U.S. city. For example, the average annual wind speed of Chicago is ; Boston: ; Central Park, New York City: ; and Los Angeles: . The following \\"windy city\\" explanation involving a \\"wind tunnel\\" effect is from the Freeborn County Standard of Albert Lea, Minnesota, on November 20, 1892: An explanation for Chicago being a naturally breezy area is that it is on the shores of Lake Michigan. Chicago had long billed itself as an ideal summer resort because of its cool lake breeze. The Boston Globe of July 8, 1873, wrote that \\"a few years ago, Chicago advertised itself as a summer resort, on the strength of the lake breezes which so nicely tempered the mid-summer heats.\\" The Chicago Tribune of June 14, 1876, discussed \\"Chicago as a Summer Resort\\" at length, proudly declaring that \\"the people of this city are enjoying cool breezes, refreshing rains, green fields, a grateful sun, and balmy air‚Äîwinds from the north and east tempered by the coolness of the lake, and from the south and west, bearing to us frequent hints of the grass, flowers, wheat and corn of the prairies.\\" The February 4, 1873, Philadelphia Inquirer called Chicago \\"the great city of winds and fires.\\" Cincinnati rivalry Cincinnati and Chicago were rival cities in the 1860s and 1870s. Cincinnati was well known in the meatpacking trade and it was called \\"Porkopolis\\" from at least 1843. Starting from the early 1860s, Chicago surpassed Cincinnati in this trade and proudly claimed the very same \\"Porkopolis\\" nickname. The baseball inter-city matches were especially intense. The 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings were the pride of all of baseball, so Chicago came up with a rival team called the White Stockings to defeat them. \\"Windy City\\" often appeared in the Cincinnati sporting news of the 1870s and 1880s. Four of the first known citations of \\"Windy City\\" are from 1876, all involving Cincinnati: # Chicago Tribune, April 20, 1876, headline: \\"The WINDY CITY Jay-Rollers La-Crosse Team Wins Inaugural Game against Cincinnati Nannies.\\" # The Cincinnati Enquirer, May 9, 1876, headline: \\"THAT WINDY CITY. Some Freaks of the Last Chicago Tornado.\\" # The Cincinnati Enquirer, May 13, 1876: \\"Only the plucky nerve of the eating-house keeper rescued the useful seats from a journey to the Windy City.\\" # Chicago Tribune, July 2, 1876: \\"The Cincinnati Enquirer, in common with many other papers, has been waiting with great anxiety for the fulfillment of its prophecy: that the Chicago papers would call the Whites hard names when they lost. Witness these scraps the day after the Whites lost to the Athletics: There comes a wail to us from the Windy City.\\" World's Fair Myth It is a popular myth that the first person to use the term \\"Windy City\\" was The New York Sun editor Charles Dana, in a New York Sun article in the 1890s complaining about Chicago's victory in 1890 over New YorkChicago Tribune, Feb. 25, 1890, p.1 (reporting the Congressional votes for the host city) in its bid to host the World's Fair. However, the term was in common use since at least 1886, while the first known use of it was from 1876. As Chicago did not win the bid to host the World's Fair until 1890, Dana cannot possibly have been the source of the term. Politics Nineteenth-century journalists frequently referred to Chicago as the windy city because they allegedly believed Chicagoan politicians were nothing but profit-centric. However, it's worth noting the rivalry between Chicago, a growing metropolis in the nineteenth century, and other cities such as New York City, from where most of these journalists came. In other words, the Windy City is not a nickname Chicago gave itself, but rather something that the city has embraced over time.Surprising Reason Chicago Is Called the ‚ÄúWindy City‚Äù, Meghan Jones, Reader's Digest, 2018 The Hawk wind, or Hawkins Chicago's wind is often called \\"The Hawk\\". This term has long been popular in African American Vernacular English. The Baltimore Sun's series of columns in 1934 attempted to examine the origin of the phrase, \\"Hawkins is coming\\", for a cold, winter wind. The first recorded Chicago citation is in the Chicago Defender, October 20, 1936: \\"And these cold mornings are on us‚Äîin other words 'Hawkins' has got us.\\" In the 1967 song, \\"Dead End Street\\", Chicago native Lou Rawls speaks the following intro: It is also referenced in the first line of Steve Goodman's song, \\"A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request\\", is \\"By the shores of old Lake Michigan / Where the Hawk Wind blows so cold...\\" Other cities Various other cities have also claimed the nickname \\"Windy City\\".

The unit was surrendered by an Army General and subsequently captured by enemy forces on May 6, 1942. After this 4th Marines temporarily ceased to exist. On February 1, 1944, four Marine Raider battalions were amalgamated into a re- established 4th Marine Regiment, bearing the name and honors of the original 4th Regiment lost in the Philippines in 1942. The 1st, 4th, and 3rd Raider Battalions became respectively the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions, 4th Marines. The 2nd Raider Battalion became the regimental weapons company. Forming part of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade and later 6th Marine Division, the 4th Marines fought in the battles of Guam and Okinawa. Vietnam War On April 14, 1965 3rd battalion 4th Marines was deployed to an area near Chu Lai, South Vietnam. Two companies were sent north to Phu Bai to secure a small airfield just 8 miles south of Hu·∫ø City. First contact was made on April 22 southwest of Da Nang with a VC unit. The Marines at Phu Bai made their first contact on April 24. Both sides lost 2 men. These patrols continued until the whole battalion re-deployed back to Okinawa on December 24, 1965. In March 1966, the Battalion returned to the Phu Bai, Hu·∫ø City areas. They participated in company and platoon size patrols and ambushes against the VC in the Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø Province till the end of June 1966. At that time the entire Battalion moved north and just south of the DMZ, in the Song Ngan River Valley also known as \\"Helicopter Valley\\", because of all the helicopters that were shot down with Marines on board. There they participated in Operation Hastings which was a multi-battalion operation that ran from July 15 to August 3, 1966. This was the first major Marine campaign against the North Vietnamese Army. A total of 8,000 Marines participated in this large operation. It stop the NVA from further advancing into South Vietnam. The 324B NVA Division losses were put at 824 killed and 17 POW's. Total Marine losses were put at 126 killed and 448 wounded. Capt. Robert J. Modrzejewski and SSgt. John J. McGinty were both awarded the Medal of Honor for their action and leadership during this time. This operation was also the most costly of the war to this point. A U.S. Marine from 3d Battalion, 4th Marines moves forward during Operation Prairie In August 3/4 was back in Phu Bai again running patrols and ambushes in search and destroy missions. Early September the battalion moved its HQ 55 miles north to ƒê√¥ng H√†. On September 22, 1966, the battalion was again in action against the 324B NVA Division in Operation Prairie which ran from August 3 to October 27, 1966. Fighting for Hill 400 and Hill 484 and also called Mutter's Ridge in the Razor Back Mountains, a heavily fortified Nui Cay Tri ridge. It was very costly for both sides, losses were put at nearly 1300 NVA killed and total Marine losses were put at 200 killed and over a 1000 wounded. Captain James J. Carroll was later posthumously awarded a Navy Cross for valor on Hill 484. Photojournalist Larry Burrows took a large collection of Time-Life photos during the operation. The most recognizable is a Pulitzer Prize winning photo, taken on Hill 400, showing a wounded Gunnery Sergeant Jeremiah Purdie being guided by a Hospital Corpsman Darrell Hinde as he reaches out to Sergeant [Larry Mitchel] whom was also seriously wounded waiting to be medevaced. Photo is called \\"Reaching Out\\" Shown in many special Time-Life issues. At the end of 1966 the 4th Marine Regiment was pulled out of the DMZ and sent south to participate in Operation Chinook around Hu·∫ø. When that operation ended the battalion went into a rebuilding stage. On January 31, 1967 Operation Prairie II started. On February 27 L/3/4 and a tank platoon was involved in a battle near Hill 48 to save a recon team that ran into a NVA Regiment. On the 28th other Marine companies including M/3/4 were brought in for ground operation. When the operation ended total casualties for both sides were put at 93 Marines killed 483 wounded and the NVA losses were put at 694 killed. Prairie II ended on March 18, but Operation Prairie III started the next day. The battalion was pulled back to regroup and rebuild. For the next couple of months the battalion worked Route 9 guarding lines near Cam Lo, The Rockpile and Camp Carroll, which was the largest concentration of artillery pieces in northern I Corp. July and parts of August it was time for the battalion to spend time in the \\"Barrel\\", Con Thien. On September 4 the Battalion was ambushed just south of Con Thien with heavy casualties. 3/4 was pulled back for rebuilding its manpower. Some of the other major Operations in 1967 were Operation Hickory (May 18 to May 28), Operation Kingfisher (July 16 to Oct 31) and Operation Kentucky near Con Thien in the western area of Leatherneck Square in the latter part of 1967 and in January 1968. Other operations the Battalion participate in 1968 and 1969 were Operation Lancaster II (Jan 21 to Nov 25, 1968), and Operation Robin (2‚Äì19 June) along Route 9 southeast of Khe Sanh. After November 6, 3/4 was the last infantry battalion of the 3rd Marine Division left in South Vietnam. On November 24, 1969, the battalion sailed from Vietnam to Okinawa. 1980s & 1990s The first Marine unit in combat in Panama during Operation Just Cause was India Company, 3/4. They landed in Panama on April 6, 1988, and by April 10 were engaged in combat with clandestine units from Cuba. Some might have been from the 7th Company of the Panamanian Defense Forces, known as the \\"Macho de Monte\\" or \\"mountain machos\\", a special ops / guerrilla warfare unit named after a sort of aggressive wild boar. 1996‚Äì1997 saw the battalion participate in Operation Hunter Warrior (Sea Dragon). The objective of the operation was to test experimental gear, weapons and other equipment essential to a Marine Rifle Squad. In 1998 the battalion was transferred from Camp Pendleton, California, to Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in 29 Palms, California. There they worked back to full battalion strength and prepared for deployment to Camp Schwab, Okinawa in 1999‚Äì2000. During this time the battalion also completed the summer and winter warfare training packages at Marine Corps Cold Weather Training Bridgeport,Ca. Global War on Terrorism - Iraq The April 2003 toppling of Saddam Hussein‚Äôs statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad shortly after the Iraq War invasion. Marines and Sailors tend to the medical needs of an injured boy in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. 3/4 deployed to Kuwait in January 2003 and went on to participate in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The group was led by Lt. Col. Brian P. McCoy. They were the first U.S. Marine unit to enter Baghdad. This battalion was shown in the famous scene of the statue of Saddam in Firdos Square being pulled down. The battalion redeployed to Iraq in March 2004 and subsequently took part in Operation Vigilant Resolve while attached to the 1st Marine Regiment. They subsequently deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in January 2005 and provided oversight for Iraq's first national election in decades. 3/4 deployed again in September 2006 to the Al Qaim region in the Euphrates River Valley of Iraq, in Western Al Anbar Province, conducting counter insurgency combat operations and support and security operations. 3/4 saw heavy fighting throughout the deployment. The Marines were spread out in individual platoon- sized combat outposts along the river side, where fighting was especially intense, particularly in the first half of their extended 9-month deployment. Around Spring time in the second half of the Marines' deployment, the fighting turned to more small scale ambushes and IED attacks conducted by the enemy, who had become increasingly affected by losses in manpower and equipment in the large scale fighting that took place throughout the Fall and Winter months of 2006 and 2007. The battalion suffered 12 KIA, and over 100 WIA during the nearly 9-month deployment, which was due to being extended for the Troop Surge in early 2007. After returning home to Twentynine Palms in late May, 2007, the battalion again deployed in early 2008 to Al Anbar with dual missions of carrying out combat operations, training Iraqi security forces, and supervising the Iraqi peacekeeping effort. Their area of operations reached from Haditha to Hit, becoming the largest area any military unit had controlled in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion also became the first U.S. military unit to reach 5 straight Iraq deployments and returned from their deployment in early September 2008. They are also one of only two Marine battalions with eight straight combat deployments, the other being 3/7. Global War on Terrorism - Afghanistan The battalion deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan from October 2009 to May 2010, April to October 2011 and from March to September 2013. Marine Unit Deployment Program The battalion deployed in 2017 from April to October to Darwin Australia under the Marine Corp's Unit Deployment Program as Marine Rotational Force - Darwin (MRF-D). Multinational training programs were executed with participants from Australia, Japan, France and elements from the United States Army and the United States Special Operations Command. During the deployment 3rd Battalion 4th Marines established itself as a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF). Supporting elements came from tilt wing and rotary wing helicopter squadrons, logistics units, and engineering elements. The mission of the MAGTF was to build cohesion with the Australian Defence Force and the United States Marine Corps. The most notable exercise was Talisman Sabre. 3/4 Medal of Honor recipients * Robert J. Modrzejewski * John J. McGinty III * Donald E.

The novel was based upon the short story \\"To Outlive Eternity\\" appearing in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1967. It was first published in book form in 1970. The book is regarded as a quintessential example of \\"hard sci-fi\\", as its plot is guided by technology. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1971. Plot Tau Zero follows the crew of the starship Leonora Christine, a colonization vessel crewed by 25 men and 25 women aiming to reach the nearby star Beta Virginis. The ship is powered by a Bussard ramjet, which was proposed 10 years before Anderson wrote the book. This engine is not capable of faster-than-light travel, and so the voyage is subject to relativity and time dilation: the crew will spend 5 years on board, but 33 years will pass on the Earth before they arrive at their destination. The ship accelerates at a modest constant rate for most of the first half of the journey, eventually achieving an appreciable percentage of the speed of light, and the goal is to decelerate at the same rate during the second half of the journey by reversing the ram scoop fields. However, the Leonora Christine passes through a small nebula before the half-way point, damaging the deceleration field generators. Since the Bussard engines must be kept running to provide particle/radiation shielding, and because of the hard radiation produced by the engines, the crew can neither repair the damage nor turn off their ramjet. The text consists of narrative prose interspersed with paragraphs in which Anderson explains the scientific basis of relativity, time dilation, the ship's mechanics and details of the cosmos outside. As there is no hope of completing the original mission, the crew increase acceleration even more; they need to leave the Milky Way altogether in order to reach a region where the local gas density, and the concomitant radiation hazard, are low enough that they can repair the decelerator. The ship's ever-increasing velocity brings the time dilation to extreme levels and takes the crew further and further away from any possibility of contact with humanity. The initial plan is to locate and land on a suitable planet in another galaxy. Millions of years would have passed since their departure, and in any case they would be millions of light years from Earth. However, they find the vacuum of intergalactic space insufficient for safety; they must instead travel to a region between superclusters of galaxies to make repairs. They do, but the extremely thinly spread matter is then too dispersed to use for deceleration. They must wait, flying free but essentially without the ability to change course, until they randomly encounter enough galactic matter to decelerate enough to search for habitable planets. To make the waiting time shorter, they continue accelerating through the galaxy clusters they encounter, more and more closely approaching the speed of light with tau, or proper time, decreasing closer and closer to zero. Throughout the story, Charles Reymont, the ship's Constable, fights to keep hope alive in the confined community and at the same time maintain order and discipline, sometimes at great emotional cost to himself. He explains his system to his partner Chi-Yuen Ai-Ling: The storyline is similar to that of the long poem and later opera Aniara, in which the ship was unable to stop and doomed to travel endlessly, but Tau Zero has a more upbeat ending. By the time the ship is repaired, tau has decreased to less than a billionth and the crew experience \\"billion-year cycles which pass as moments\\". But by the time that they are ready to attempt to find a future home, they realize that the universe is approaching a Big Crunch. The universe collapses (a process the starship survives because there is still enough uncondensed hydrogen for maneuvering outside the growing singularity) and then explodes in a new Big Bang. The voyagers then decelerate and finally disembark at a planet with a habitat suitably similar to Earth, on which the vegetation has a vivid bluish- green color. Prominent characters * Ingrid Lindgren, Ship's First Officer ‚Äì Swedish; she and Reymont had a relationship until he learned of her liaisons with Boris Federoff; she becomes the \\"face\\" of authority and the link between crew and passengers. * Charles Reymont, Ship's Constable ‚Äì Interplanetarian (i.e. no Earth-country citizenship, by choice), veteran of two previous interstellar flights; determined to maintain order and ensure survival in the face of disaster and hopelessness, he becomes the ship's de facto leader (although he defers to the ship's hierarchy). * Boris Fedoroff, Ship's Chief Engineer ‚Äì Russian * Chi-Yuen Ai-Ling, Planetologist ‚Äì Chinese; after Reymont's break-up with Ingrid, she and Reymont begin a long-term relationship. * Lars Telander, Ship's Captain ‚Äì Swedish; a devout Protestant and a strong leader, but the dangers, uncertainties and responsibilities piled on him following the disaster seem to slowly erode him. * Johann Friewald, Machinist ‚Äì German; a man of courage and good nature; after the disaster, he becomes Reymont's right-hand man in maintaining order and ensuring survival. * Elof Nilsson, Astronomer ‚Äì Swedish; a brilliant scientist, but arrogant, physically unattractive and completely lacking in social graces to the point where he is unable to maintain relationships with people; his relationship with Sadler quickly self-destructs, but later he and Ingrid begin a partnership. * Jane Sadler, Bio-Technician ‚Äì Canadian; after a brief relationship at the book's beginning and her failed relationship with Nilsson, she and Friewald become permanent partners. * Emma Glassgold, Molecular Biologist ‚Äì Nationality not stated, lived most of her life in Israel; apparently (though not specifically stated) a devout Christian; as the story develops, she develops a deep (but non-sexual) relationship with Norbert Williams. * Norbert Williams, Chemist ‚Äì American; brash and somewhat loud- mouthed and hot-headed, but capable of deep feeling (proved by his relationship with Emma Glassgold). Origin of the title The novel's title is derived from the value of the time contraction factor Tau (\\\\tau), where \\\\tau = \\\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} where v is the velocity of the ship and c the speed of light. At a given velocity, the duration that is experienced on the non- accelerating Earth may be multiplied by tau to yield the duration experienced on board the ship. Therefore, as Anderson writes, \\"the closer that [the ship's velocity] comes to [the speed of light], the closer tau comes to zero\\", and the longer the time that passes outside the ship for a duration inside. The ship in the story intended to attain a tau of 0.015, but as they continue to accelerate beyond the original schedule, it decreases much further. This usage of tau is somewhat idiosyncratic. In physics, tau is more usually used to represent the total elapsed time of the moving clock, so Anderson's \\"tau factor\\" is what would conventionally be written d\\\\tau/dt. Physicists also prefer to use gamma (Œ≥) to represent the Lorentz factor in time dilation, which in Anderson's terminology would be 1/\\\\tau. Themes Much of the novel deals with the crewmembers' reactions to being the last remnants of humanity, and the prospect of being confined with their colleagues indefinitely. Though they were prepared to \\"lose\\" twenty Earth years during their journey and spend five on board the ship, the knowledge that they are being carried further and further into the future has various effects on the psychology of the characters. The novel describes the changing and extreme time dilation effects as well as events from the perspective of both the ship and an external observer. Incidental to the main themes is the political situation on the Earth from which the protagonists set out: a future where the nations of the world entrusted Sweden with overseeing disarmament and found themselves living under the rule of the Swedish Empire. This sub-theme reflects the great interest which Anderson, an American of Danish origin, took in Scandinavian history and culture. In later parts of the book, characters compare their desperate situation to that of semi-mythical characters of Scandinavian legend, with the relevant poetry occasionally quoted.

WMRQ-FM is owned by Red Wolf Broadcasting and operates at 104.1 MHz with an effective radiated power of 14,000 watts from West Peak in Meriden, Connecticut (on a tower with former sister station WKSS). Its studios are located on Blue Hills Avenue in Bloomfield, Connecticut with other radio stations. The station broadcasts in HD Radio. Its HD-2 channel carries a Spanish tropical music radio format known as \\"Bomba FM,\\" also heard on translator stations 97.1 W246CC in Bolton, 99.5 W258AL in Clinton and 104.5 W283BS in Bridgeport.  History  On December 25, 1967, the station began broadcasting as WWCO-FM, sister station to AM 1240 WWCO, and carrying a country music format.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-25 The station was acquired by entertainer and TV host Merv Griffin in 1972, with the station changing call letters to WIOF (standing for \\"1-0-Four\\", its dial position) and branded as \\"Nashville Connecticut, W-104\\". In 1978, the station dropped country to become soft adult contemporary-formatted \\"Magic 104\\" using the syndicated \\"TM Beautiful Rock\\" service. During the switch to \\"Magic\\", WIOF upgraded its signal by moving its transmitter from near its studios in Prospect to West Peak in Meriden. Lou Terri was the Program Director and midday host until his death in an automobile accident in 1989. Steve Wiersman later became Program Director until 1994. Morning announcers included Bill Cleveland, Greg O'Brien and Ray Petraca. Jack Carney, who was also the voice of WVIT at the time, hosted the afternoon show. Jim Scott did nights, and Rick O'Connor did middays, later replaced by Ron O'Brien (also known as Ron O, who later went to WZMX). Weekend DJs included Greg LaPorta and Don Clark. In 1992, the station rebranded as \\"Star 104.1\\", WYSR, with a more uptempo Adult Contemporary sound. DJs on \\"Star\\" included Brett Provo in mornings, then later afternoons (now Afternoon Drive/Production Director at WMAS in Springfield); Paul DeFrancisco in afternoons; Jay Hanson (now at WFMX in Skowhegan, Maine) and Long John on weekends; Jim Severine; Rich Kilbourne (also known as Big Rich Baker) on news; Cathy Foxx in middays; Neil Jackson in mornings; Lee Gordon as Production Director; and Race Bannon, who later stayed on the station after the flip to modern rock. Ron O became WYSR's PD after Steve Wiersman departed. In October 1994, all programming staff were released. On October 31, 1994, at midnight, the format flipped to modern rock as WMRQ \\"Radio104\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-11-04.pdf Personalities such as \\"Jake & Beth\\", \\"Nick the Intern\\", \\"Mudbone\\" Dee Snider and Bubba the Love Sponge were on the station in the mornings at various points during the station's history, with Wilcow, Chaz, \\"Darkside Dave,\\" The Carlito Show, and Logan following after the mornings. The station also hosted popular annual events such as \\"The Big Day Off\\" and \\"104fest\\". Lee Gordon remained as Production Director, and Bud Fisher became WMRQ's first sales manager. (Bud had appeared on \\"Magic 104\\" as \\"Gary Hunter\\".) Due to struggling ratings, the station flipped to WPHH, \\"Power 104.1\\", at 5:00 p.m. on September 15, 2003.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-09-19.pdf As a station playing hip hop and R&B; music, WPHH solidified its position as the only mainstream urban station in the Hartford and New Haven market. Its main competitor was urban-leaning rhythmic CHR WZMX. Nicole Siedman served as Program Director for a short period until 2004. Mychal Maguire assumed the Program Director position thereafter. Spank Buda served as Assistant Program Director and night host for the entire duration of WPHH. Popular events included the \\"Hoop It Up\\" basketball tournament and the \\"Legends of Hip Hop\\" concert. Other DJs on \\"Power\\" were Mia Mendez, DJ Showtime, TT Torrez, DJ Londonn, and PJ. On October 25, 2007, at 10:00 a.m., WPHH flipped back to modern rock. The station was programmed similar to WRFF in Philadelphia. On December 20, 2007, WPHH changed its call letters to WURH. In May 2008, almost six months after Clear Channel launched \\"FM 104-One,\\" the station named a Program Director, Becky Pohotsky, who had been the station's APD/MD and de facto PD for most of its existence. On August 4, 2008, Clear Channel placed the station's assets into an entity called the Aloha Station Trust in order to sell off the station. This was due to Clear Channel being above the ownership limits set by the Federal Communications Commission. These limits were imposed when Clear Channel was officially taken private by Bain Capital Partners on July 30, 2008. On February 19, 2009, Ledyard-based Red Wolf Broadcasting Corp., who owns WBMW and WWRX in the New London area, announced that it had agreed to buy WURH for $8,000,000. On May 14, 2009, Red Wolf Broadcasting took over control of the station. The first action was to revert the station back to its WMRQ call letters, and the \\"Radio 104.1\\" moniker. Under the direction of Brian Ram, WMRQ's VP/Programming, the alternative rock lineup includes \\"Amy Grey & Holden in the morning\\" (morning drive), Michael Maze (middays), John Moug (afternoons), and Dirty Dave (nights), plus weekend programs \\"Digital Takeover with DJ Darth Fader\\" and \\"HomeBrew Local Music Show\\".  HD Radio  Logo of WMRQ-HD2 In November 2009, a Spanish tropical format, \\"Bomba 97.5\\" (\\"The Bomb\\") was launched on WMRQ-HD2. The format was initially simulcast on 60-watt Bolton-licensed translator W248AB (97.5 FM). Recently, Red Wolf moved the translator to 97.1 FM (which forced a change of call letters to W246CC) to provide more coverage and increase signal strength. \\"Bomba 97.1\\" is now licensed for 100 watts, reaching as far as Springfield. In addition, the station added translators in Clinton and Bridgeport. W272DO was sold to Red Wolf Broadcasting from Connoisseur Media in January 2018. On January 15, the translator immediately ceased simulcasting WPLR-HD2, the alternative format known as \\"Mod,\\" and began carrying \\"Bomba.\\"  Translators = References  External links   Dee Snider Radio - archives of morning show Category:Waterbury, Connecticut Category:Mass media in New Haven County, Connecticut MRQ-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"WMRQ-FM"},{"id":"4438079","text":"Francis John Walker, QC (7 July 1942 ‚Äì 12 June 2012) was an Australian politician and judge. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing Georges River between 1970 and 1988 and subsequently a member of the Australian House of Representatives representing Robertson between 1990 and 1996, both for the Australian Labor Party. During his parliamentary careers, Walker held a range of ministerial responsibilities. He was the first New South Wales Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and was responsible for some of the first legislation that recognized the obligation to financially compensate indigenous Australians for the loss of their land. He has been given credit for achieving one of the first big breakthroughs in the protection of Australia's natural environment, the saving of the Terania Creek rainforest. Early life Walker was born in Sydney and spent early formative years with his father, a blacklisted communist, and Walker's brother in a jungle village in Papua New Guinea. Aged 12, the family moved to the New South Wales north coast regional centre of Coffs Harbour where he completed his secondary schooling. As a teenager, he was beaten by police for sitting with Aborigines in the segregated part of the local theatre. Walker developed early empathy for the budding Aboriginal rights movement. He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1964, with an LLB, progressing to an LLM in 1969. An articled clerk from 1960 to 1965, a solicitor from 1965 to 1976 and a barrister from 1976 to 1988, he was appointed as a Queens Counsel in 1981. Political career=New South Wales political career A prominent figure of the left-wing, Walker was elected as the member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1970 to 1988, representing Georges River for the Australian Labor Party. He became the Attorney General with the election of Neville Wran's government in 1976 and was the youngest person to have held this post, aged 34. During his term as Attorney General between 1976 and 1983, Walker was notable for a reform agenda that included the first state-based land rights legislation, repealing the , which allowed police to act with impunity against the poor and homeless, major changes to the so-called \\"rape\\" laws, and opening up corporate fraud to greater scrutiny. Walker suffered a number of reprisals as a result of his reform agenda. He served as Minister for Justice from 1978 to 1983, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 1981 to 1984, Minister for Youth and Community Services from 1983 to 1986, Minister for Housing from 1983 to 1988 and Minister for the Arts from 1986 to 1988. When the Unsworth government was defeated at the 1988 poll, he lost his seat. Federal political career Walker was elected as the member for Robertson in the Federal Parliament in 1990. He was Special Minister of State and Vice- President of the Executive Council from March 1993 to March 1994 and then Minister for Administrative Services until the defeat of the Keating government in 1996, when he also lost his seat. Career after politics Frank Walker served as a Judge of the Compensation Court of New South Wales between 1997 and 2003. On the abolition of the Compensation Court in 2003, he was appointed to the District Court of New South Wales and the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales. His caseload in Dust Diseases Tribunal predominantly consisted of mesothelioma-related cases, and he retired in 2006. He was also president of the Schizophrenia Fellowship from 1998 until his death in 2012. His two sons, who were sufferers of schizophrenia, both committed suicide when they were 33. Walker died of cancer, aged 69. His family accepted the offer of a state funeral that was held on 19 June 2012 at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and was attended by several hundred people, including former Prime Minister Paul Keating, and three ex-premiers, including Nick Greiner, Aborigines, lawyers, judges (including former High Court Judge, Mary Gaudron QC), party faithful, unionists, friends and family. Michael Gallacher MLC represented the NSW Premier, and Anthony Albanese MP represented the Prime Minister. A memorial lecture is held each year to commemorate Walker's life and achievements by the NSW Society of Labor Lawyers.

The pitch itself was sponsored by Bank of Ireland, and featured their crest. Since then, a modern electronic scoreboard has been added, and dugouts have been refurnished. The ground bar has full sports coverage, including Setanta for Live GAA. In 2016, the stadium was closed while a new stand was built, at a cost of ¬£4.17m. On May 28th, 2017, the stadium was reopened, with the name changed from Emerald GAA Grounds to McGovern Park. It is named after local businessman Tony McGovern, who helped fund the redevelopment. London GAA The Pitch is the home ground of the London hurling team, hosting the Christy Ring Cup, and the NHL. The grounds is also the home of the London Football Team, and their Allianz NFL matches are held there. The female teams play in the Brendan Martin Cup (the ladies senior football cup), and the O'Duffy Cup (camogie). Railway Cup Final 2009 Final Score: Munster 1-08 ---- 0‚Äì15 Ulster On the 125th anniversary of the GAA, it was decided that the Railway Cup final of 2009 would be held in England. GAA president Christy Cooney said that this was because of England's Gaelic Development: > \\"It's one way of acknowledging and supporting the games in Britain by having > such a high profile final here with the quality players that we have. > \\"Secondly Britain were keen to organise a celebration for the 125th year. > We‚Äôre thrilled to be staging the final here and the players will be thrilled > to come and play here.\\" There was, on the night before the match, a gala ceremony, with tickets costing ¬£50. The Irish ambassador to England was there, with numerous other Irish diplomatic and Gaelic games players present. The game was held the next day, with Ulster narrowly winning by three points, which upset predictions that it would be game belonging to Munster. Other The GAA holds annual refereeing courses and fitness tests in the grounds. Recently, Irish rock band Bagatelle played a music festival at the clubhouse. The clubhouse hosts numerous charity events on behalf of Hillingdon. Facilities The grounds features a 1,950-seat stand, a renovated clubhouse, with complete changing rooms and toilets for the home and away teams respectively. There is a balcony for trophy presentations and speeches, and a large scoreboard. The grounds features special function rooms for hire. The ground floor houses a bar and dressing room, whilst the first floor holds a multi-function room. Two full size car parks are also available. The Irish national Anthem, Amhr√°n na bhFiann, is played through speakers surrounding the grounds. The pitch is not floodlit, meaning most games are played in the afternoon.

Life Richard Marshal held lands in Longueville, Normandy; in Wales; and also in Ireland. Richard Marshal portrayed by Matthew Paris as unhorsing Baldwin of Guines at a skirmish before the Battle of Monmouth in 1233. He came to the fore as the leader of the baronial party, and the chief antagonist of the foreign friends of King Henry III of England, a notable Poitevin, Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester and Peter de Rivaux.Powicke (1962), pp. 53-5. Fearing their treachery, he refused to visit King Henry III at Gloucester in August 1233, and he was declared a traitor. According to the chronicler Roger of Wendover in his Flores Historiarum (Flowers of History), Marshal and his knights then came to Monmouth to reconnoitre the town before besieging it. However, they were seen coming towards the castle walls by Baldwin III, Count of Gu√Ænes. He was a nobleman of Flanders who, with his mixed force of Flemings and Poitevins, had been entrusted by King Henry with defending the town. The local lord, John of Monmouth, was absent from the battle. Baldwin wrongly thought that Marshal had only a few followers with him, and rode out with his forces to pursue him, but Marshal turned the tables. It was said of Marshal that he put up a gallant defense against Baldwin's men in this skirmish and his army defeated Baldwin's forces at the Battle of Monmouth (1233) on 25 November. Roger of Wendover, Flowers of History: the history of England from the descent of the Saxons to A.D. 1235. vol.2, pp.575-576. In March 1234, a truce was reached between the king and Marshal, the condition of which was the removal of Peter de Rivaux from court.Power (2004). In the meanwhile, however, conflict had broken out in Ireland between Marshal's brothers and some of the king's supporters. Hostilities followed, and Richard made an alliance with the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great. Pembroke crossed from Wales to Ireland, where Peter des Roches had allegedly instigated his enemies to attack. In April 1234 he was overpowered and wounded at the Battle of the Curragh by forces led by Maurice FitzGerald, Justiciar of Ireland and died of his wounds on 16 April 1234 while being held prisoner.Frame, p.367. Marshal's popularity also meant that his death was mourned in England, while the Poitevinswho were rumoured to have instigated the Irish warfell further into disregard.Powicke (1962), pp.57-9. He had married Gervaise de Dinan, daughter of Alan de Dinan, Baron de Dinan, and did not produce any offspring. He was buried at Kilkenny and was succeeded by his brother Gilbert.

The WHCN studios are located on Columbus Boulevard in Hartford, while the station transmitter is located at West Peak State Park in nearby Meriden. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WHCN broadcasts over two HD Radio digital subchannels, and is available online via iHeartRadio. History=Early years WHCN traces its history back to the earliest days of FM Radio. It was first licensed as experimental station W1XSL in 1936. It originally broadcast in the old FM band between 42 and 50 MHz. It subsequently used the call letters W1XPW, W65H, WDRC-FM (not related to today's WDRC-FM) and WFMQ before arriving at WHCN in 1958 as a classical music outlet. The call letters stood for the \\"Hartford Concert Network\\", because the station often aired classical music concerts. Rock music era WHCN shifted from classical music to progressive rock in 1969. The format was later flipped to mainstream album rock in late 1976. Known as \\"106-WHCN\\", it was very successful in the 1970s and the 1980s. WHCN was home to the morning show \\"Picozzi and The Horn\\", up until the mid-1990s. Mike Picozzi would later move to rival rock station WCCC-FM, eventually becoming program director there. WHCN flipped to classic rock in the mid-1990s to compete for the older rock audience that grew up with the station. New owners switched the moniker to \\"105-9 WHCN,\\" moving to a harder-edged classic rock format billed as \\"Classic Rock That Really Rocks\\". WHCN would be snapped up by Liberty Broadcasting, then SFX Broadcasting/Capstar, and then AMFM, which merged with iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) in 2000. Move to adult hits After years of declining ratings, the 33-year run of the WHCN brand would come to an abrupt end in March 2002, when WHCN became known as \\"The River 105.9\\", retaining most of its on-air staff from its previous Classic Rock incarnation. The station's \\"The Rock\\" slogan and later the station's former Asylum Street studios would be adopted by one-time rival WCCC. WHCN's playlist was different and more diverse than other stations in the market, which helped it shoot up in ratings from 13th place to 5th place within a year. \\"The River 105.9\\" targets listeners who enjoy both rock and hot adult contemporary formats, by blending classic rock hits of the 1970s and 1980s with current and recent hits. The WHCN call letters have been retained to reflect the station's past. The station appeals to baby boomers and Generation X listeners with specialty programs such as the \\"80s at 8\\", which is an hour of 80s music starting at 8am and 8pm, \\"The 10 o'clock Artist Spotlight\\" at 10am, and the \\"High School Reunion\\" at 6pm, focusing on a specific year.

He was the grandson of the composer Sergei Prokofiev and his first wife Lina Prokofiev, and the son of Oleg Prokofiev and his first wife Sofia Korovina. Born in Moscow, he studied fine arts and painting at the Moscow School of Art. He encountered anthroposophy in his youth, and soon made the decision to devote his life to it. Prokofieff, who published as Sergei O. Prokofieff, wrote his first book, Rudolf Steiner and the Founding of the New Mysteries, while living in Soviet Russia. The book was first published in German in 1982 and in English translation in 1986. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he was a co-founder of the Anthroposophical Society in Russia. At Easter 2001, he became a member of the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society in Dornach, Switzerland. Prokofieff was a prolific author; at the core of his work is an attempt to develop a deepened understanding of Christianity on the basis of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual- scientific research.Cf. Peter Selg: The Destiny of the Michael Community, SteinerBooks, Great Barrington, MA, 2014, pp. 70ff. In 1989, Prokofieff wrote The Spiritual Origins of Eastern Europe and the Future Mysteries of the Holy Grail, a book which analysed the spiritual currents affecting Russia and the Slavonic world generally and in relation to worldly societal and geopolitical events and change. Later in his life, Prokofieff wrote two works, The Case of Valentin Tomberg and Valentin Tomberg and Anthroposophy: a problematic relationship, in which he put forward the view that Valentin Tomberg, the Christian Hermeticist and author (like Prokofieff) of profound Christian occultic books, developed, in his later years, into an apologist for Jesuitism (that term being understood or used, however, in a specifically Anthroposophical sense, not simply relating to the Jesuits as usually understood).

Specifically, DFA reveals the dependencies of hazards and their impacts on the insurance company's financial well being such as business mix, reinsurance, asset allocation, profitability, solvency, and compliance. In addition to projecting stochastic future economic scenarios through using scenario generators such as interest rate, underwriting cycle and jurisdictional risk models, DFA also links the scenarios with the financial models of the targeted insurance company that is being analyzed. Such models not only reveal the operation and the business structure of the company, but also uncover the dependencies among its business practices. Because DFA tries to account for every aspect of the company, it produces a vast amount of data. As a result, analyzing and presenting the outputs effectively is of great importance. Objectives DFA is used primarily by financial practitioners to manage profitability and financial stability (the risk control function of DFA)Kaufmann, Roger. Andeas Gadmer. Ralf Klett.

(2004) Dynamic Financial Analysis , Retrieved October 23, 2009, from Converium Ltd website: http://www.scor.fr/www//index.php?id=350&L;=2 * Business mix: estimates relative and absolute value of each line of business (e.g. premium and commission level) compared to the company's financial. * Reinsurance: uncovers the structure of the company's line of businesses such as contract types, interrelation among contracts, and cost of reinsurance. * Asset allocation: determines whether a company is taking on too much investment risk, which could be minimized through diversification of investments. * Profitability: measures the profitability of the company's each line of business. * Solvency: reveals liquidity problems, which are mismatches of cash flows that a company might experience if it did not have enough cash to immediately meet financial obligations. * Compliance: assesses the likelihood of insurance regulators intervening the company's business due to change in regulations or deteriorating business operations. * Sensitivity: explores the company's reaction to a change in strategies and economic conditions in the future. * Dependency: uncovers dependencies of all kinds of risks that are hard to understand without a holistic modeling and analysis tool. Elements DFA consists of the following 3 parts: * Scenarios, generating expected and extreme economic scenarios to assess the company's reaction to changes * Business Models, quantifying the company's business models and uncovering the dependencies among them * Analysis Presentation, presenting the analysis to the executives who make strategic decisions Careful calibration is required to ensure the accuracy of the scenarios and the correlations among business models. Scenario The scenario generator must meet the following criteria: * Generate individual risks while keeping track of their dependencies with one another and with time (e.g., an increase in the price of gasoline might lead to less driving mileages of automobile policy holders, thus leading to fewer car accidents). * Produce both normal and abnormal behavior of the risk factors (e.g., a 1% change in S&P; index is normal; a 40% change is extreme). * Simulate stochastic scenarios, meaning that scenarios are not the same every time you run the analysis. * Assign mathematical models that best imitate the behaviors of the risk factors. Such models could be found in, though not exclusively, actuarial science, finance and economic disciplines. * Track the incurred losses and the development of the losses, specifically the cash flows of the company's operation. This may help managers recognize the need to implement better asset liability management strategies. =Interest rate generator= The interest rate generator is the core fundamental of DFA. Many sophisticated interest rate models were created in the effort to best imitate the real world interest rate behavior. Although none of the existing models are perfect, they have their own advantages and disadvantages. The following is a simple interest rate model used in a publicly access DFA model.D'arcy, Stephen P. Richard W. Gorvett. Thomas E. Hettinger. Robert J. Walling III. (1998, Summer) Using the Public Access DFA Model, Retrieved October 23, 2009, from Casualty Actuarial Society website: http://www.casact.org/pubs/forum/98sforum/ Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (CIR) interest rate generator The CIR interest rate model characterizes the short-term interest rate as a mean-reverting stochastic projection. Although CIR was first used to project continuous changes in the interest rates, it is also acceptable to use it to project discrete changes from one time period to another. Below is the formula. dr_t = a(b-r_t)\\\\, dt + \\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{r_t}\\\\, dW_t where * b = the long-run mean to which the interest rate reverts; the expected interest rate in the long run * a = the speed of reversion of the interest rate to its long-run mean (e.g., a = 2 means the interest is expected to return to its long-term mean within half a year, and a = 1/5 means it would take 5 years). * r_t = the current short-term interest rate * \\\\sigma\\\\, = the volatility of the interest rate process expressed as the standard deviation of historical or projected interest rate changes. The CIR model has two components: a deterministic a(b-r_t) and a stochastic part\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{r_t}\\\\, . The deterministic part will go in the reverse direction of what the current short term rate is heading. In other words, the further the current interest rate is from the long term expected rate, the harder the deterministic part tries to reverse it back to the long term mean. The stochastic part is purely random; it can either help the current interest rate deviate from its long term mean or the reverse. Because this part is multiplied by the square root of the current interest rate, when the current interest rate is low, its impact is minimum, thus leading to the unlikelihood of the interest rate going below zero, and the interest rate cannot be negative. However, the reverse is true if the current rate is high. Jurisdictional Risk Generator In the United States, each state has its own regulatory, jurisdictional and legislative bodies, and there are advantages and disadvantages for an insurance company conducting businesses in different states. For example, some states have restrictions on how much rate increase that an insurance company can charge for the risks on which it takes. Such risk can severely hamper the insurance entity's profitability and operation. In DFA, jurisdiction risk is reflected in two ways. # \\"Acceptable\\" rate changes: each state has its own limit for how much rate increase in percentage proportional to the existing rate an insurance company can charge without attracting regulators' scrutiny. Under the scenarios, if DFA indicates that the insurance company needs to charge more than the state's maximum limit for the risks, that should raise a red flag to the executives overseeing the insurance business in that region. # Lag in implementing indicated rate changes: insurance companies often do not immediately implement the approved rate changes, and in fact there is often a lag of 3 to 6 months. The lag, shown in the model in terms of years, is longer in states with harsh rate regulation. Underwriting Cycles Generator The number of policies an insurance company can sell depends on the macroeconomic environment of the insurance industry. The DFA scenario accounts for this risk factor to best simulate the nature of insurance business. Below are four underwriting cycles that an insurance company may experience. * Mature Hard: Rates can be increased and may still sell more policies * Mature Soft: Rates need to be decrease in order to sell more policies * Immature Hard: Transition state from mature soft to mature hard * Immature Soft: Transition state from mature hard to mature soft Company and Strategy modeling To estimate the impacts that the scenarios have on an insurance company, the company's business practices needed to be quantified and linked to the scenario factors such as interest rate and underwriting cycles. Types of Models * Cash Flow Oriented Model: Such model tries to imitate the cash flows of the insurance company's assets and liabilities. Also it assess the impacts on the company's financial statement. ** Advantages: It might not be difficult to project cash flows linked to economic factors for the company's assets. ** Disadvantages: Liabilities are often unknown for an insurance company, and thus it is hard to generate outgoing cash flows for claims. * Simple Model: Such model only account for part of the economic factors of the scenarios ** Advantages: The model is mathematically tractable, and accuracy can be achieved. ** Disadvantages: It defeats the purpose of implementing a DFA, which is to analyze potential impacts that changes in economic factors can have on the insurance company's financial performance. * Complex Model: Such model not only tries to account for all the economic factors that the scenarios generate, but also the dependencies among the company's lines of business. It involves sophisticated mathematical models and parameter to achieve its goal. ** Advantages: This approach helps executives truly understand the dependencies among its business models and the external impacts on the company's profitability. ** Disadvantages: Such model is very unlikely to be mathematically tractable. In other words, the model can be totally wrong because no one may know the exact dependencies among the business models and the impacts that economic risks can pose to the company. Analysis and presentation Without effective analysis and presentation, managers can hardly make any sense out of the vast amount of data that DFA produces. The goal of DFA is to help the managers to find out whether the company's current strategies are in line with its financial goals. Below are some tricks of conducting and presenting DFA analysis.Wiesner, Elizabeth R. Charles C. Emma. (2000, Summer) A Dynamic Financial Analysis Application Lined to Corporate Strategy, Retrieved October 23, 2009, from Casualty Actuarial Society website: http://www.casact.org/pubs/forum/00sforum/. # Keep communication concise and focused. # Eliminate, if needed, part of the DFA's outputs that are irrelevant to the company's financial objectives. # Include no more than four most important results in a brief executive summary, and support your statements with graphs and exhibits in the appendix. # Focus on business development trend, as opposed to over emphasis on specific numbers or the details of the model. Keep in mind that DFA is only an estimate of what might happen. # Support the DFA analysis with other available information within the company.

The parashah deals with ritual impurity. It constitutes The parashah is made up of 3,667 Hebrew letters, 1,010 Hebrew words, 67 verses, and 128 lines in a Torah Scroll (, Sefer Torah). Jews read it the 27th or 28th Sabbath after Simchat Torah, generally in April or, rarely, in late March or early May. The lunisolar Hebrew calendar contains up to 55 weeks, the exact number varying between 50 in common years and 54 or 55 in leap years. In leap years (for example, 2019, 2022, 2024, and 2027), parashah Tazria is read separately. In common years (for example, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2025, 2026, and 2028), parashah Tazria is combined with the next parashah, Metzora, to help achieve the number of weekly readings needed. Readings In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , aliyot.See, e.g., The Schottenstein Edition Interlinear Chumash: Vayikra/Leviticus. Edited by Menachem Davis, pages 74‚Äì88. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2008. . First reading ‚Äî Leviticus 12:1‚Äì13:5 In the first reading (, aliyah), God told Moses to tell the Israelites that when a woman at childbirth bore a boy, she was to be unclean 7 days and then remain in a state of blood purification for 33 days, while if she bore a girl, she was to be unclean 14 days and then remain in a state of blood purification for 66 days. Upon completing her period of purification, she was to bring a lamb for a burnt offering and a pigeon or a turtle dove for a sin offering, and the priest was to offer them as sacrifices to make expiation on her behalf. If she could not afford a sheep, she was to take two turtle doves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. God told Moses and Aaron that when a person had a swelling, rash, discoloration, scaly affection, inflammation, or burn, it was to be reported to the priest, who was to examine it to determine whether the person was clean or unclean. Second reading ‚Äî Leviticus 13:6‚Äì17 In the second reading (, aliyah), the priest was to examine the person again the seventh day to determine whether the person was clean or unclean. The reading goes on to describe the features of skin disease. Third reading ‚Äî Leviticus 13:18‚Äì23 The third reading (, aliyah) further describes features of skin disease. Fourth reading ‚Äî Leviticus 13:24‚Äì28 The fourth reading (, aliyah) further describes features of skin disease. Fifth reading ‚Äî Leviticus 13:29‚Äì39 The fifth reading (, aliyah) describes features of skin disease on the head or beard. Sixth reading ‚Äî Leviticus 13:40‚Äì54 The sixth reading (, aliyah) continued the discussion of skin disease on the head or beard. Unclean persons were to rend their clothes, leave their head bare, cover over their upper lips, call out, \\"Unclean! Unclean!\\" and dwell outside the camp. When a streaky green or red eruptive affection occurred in wool, linen, or animal skin, it was to be shown to the priest, who was to examine to determine whether it was clean or unclean. If unclean, it was to be burned. Seventh reading ‚Äî Leviticus 13:55‚Äì59 In the seventh reading (, aliyah), if the affection disappeared from the article upon washing, it was to be shut up seven days, washed again, and be clean. In inner-biblical interpretation The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these Biblical sources:For more on inner-Biblical interpretation, see, e.g., Benjamin D. Sommer. \\"Inner-biblical Interpretation.\\" In The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition. Edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, pages 1835‚Äì41. New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. . Leviticus chapter 12 associates childbirth with uncleanness. In the Hebrew Bible, uncleanness has a variety of associations. 11; 11; and and associate it with death. And perhaps similarly, associates it with skin disease. associates it with various sexuality-related events. And 23; and associate it with contact with the worship of alien gods. While required a new mother to bring a burnt-offering and a sin-offering, and Psalm make clear that having children is a blessing from God; and 1 Samuel characterize childlessness as a misfortune; and and threaten childlessness as a punishment. Leviticus chapter 13 The Hebrew Bible reports skin disease (, tzara'at) and a person affected by skin disease (metzora, ) at several places, often (and sometimes incorrectly) translated as \\"leprosy\\" and \\"a leper.\\" In to help Moses to convince others that God had sent him, God instructed Moses to put his hand into his bosom, and when he took it out, his hand was \\"leprous (m'tzora'at, ), as white as snow.\\" In the Torah sets out regulations for skin disease (, tzara'at) and a person affected by skin disease (metzora, ). In after Miriam spoke against Moses, God's cloud removed from the Tent of Meeting and \\"Miriam was leprous (m'tzora'at, ), as white as snow.\\" In Moses warned the Israelites in the case of skin disease (, tzara'at) diligently to observe all that the priests would teach them, remembering what God did to Miriam. In 2 Kings part of the haftarah for parashah Tazria, the prophet Elisha cures Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was a \\"leper\\" (metzora, ). In part of the haftarah for parashah Metzora, the story is told of four \\"leprous men\\" (m'tzora'im, ) at the gate during the Arameans' siege of Samaria. And in 2 Chronicles after King Uzziah tried to burn incense in the Temple in Jerusalem, \\"leprosy (, tzara'at) broke forth on his forehead\\".

Leviticus chapter 12 Rabbi Simlai noted that just as God created humans after creating cattle, beasts, and birds, the law concerning human impurity in follows that concerning cattle, beasts, and birds in Leviticus Rabbah 14:1 (Land of Israel, 5th century) in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 4, pages 178‚Äì79. Reading ‚ÄúIf a woman conceives,‚Äù Rabbi Levi said three things: It is only natural that if a person has given into another‚Äôs keeping an ounce of silver in private, and the latter returns a pound of gold in public, the former will surely be grateful to the latter; and so is it with God. Human beings entrust to God a drop of fluid in privacy, and God openly returns to them completed and perfected human beings. Rabbi Levi said a second thing: It is natural that, if a person is confined without attention to a chamber, and someone comes and kindles a light for the person there, the former should feel gratitude towards the latter. So too is it with God. When the embryo is in its mother‚Äôs womb, God causes a light to shine for it there with which it can see from one end of the world to the other. Rabbi Levi said a third thing: It is natural that, if a person is confined without attention to a chamber, and someone comes and releases the person and takes the person out from there, the former should feel gratitude to the latter. Even so when the embryo is in its mother‚Äôs womb, God comes and releases it and brings it forth into the world.Leviticus Rabbah 14:2. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Leviticus. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 4, page 180. Rabbi Ammi taught in the name of Rabbi Johanan that even though Rabbi Simeon ruled that a dissolved fetus expelled by a woman was not unclean, Rabbi Simeon nonetheless agreed that the woman was ritually unclean as a woman who bore a child. An old man explained to Rabbi Ammi that Rabbi Johanan reasoned from the words of \\"If a woman conceived seed and bore.\\" Those words imply that even if a woman bore something like \\"conceived seed\\" (in a fluid state), she was nonetheless unclean by reason of childbirth.Babylonian Talmud Nidah 27b. Babylonia, 6th century. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words \\"in the [eighth] day\\" in to teach that one must perform circumcision even on the Sabbath.Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 132a. The Gemara read the command of to require an uncircumcised adult man to become circumcised, and the Gemara read the command of to require the father to circumcise his infant child.Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 132b. The Mishnah taught that circumcision should not be performed until the sun has risen, but counts it as done if done after dawn has appeared.Mishnah Megillah 2:4 (Land of Israel, circa 200 CE), in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), page 319; Babylonian Talmud Megillah 20a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Gedaliah Zlotowitz and Hersh Goldwurm, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1991), volume 20, page 20a. The Gemara explained that the reason for the rule could be found in the words of \\"And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised\\".Babylonian Talmud Megillah 20a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Gedaliah Zlotowitz and Hersh Goldwurm, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr, volume 20, page 20a. A Baraita interpreted to teach that the whole eighth day is valid for circumcision, but deduced from Abraham's rising \\"early in the morning\\" to perform his obligations in that the zealous perform circumcisions early in the morning.Babylonian Talmud Pesachim 4a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Abba Zvi Naiman, Eliezer Herzka, and Moshe Zev Einhorn, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997), volume 9, page 4a; Babylonian Talmud Yoma 28b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Abba Zvi Naiman, Michoel Weiner, Yosef Widroff, Moshe Zev Einhorn, Israel Schneider, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1998), volume 13, pages 28b. The disciples of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai asked him why ordained that after childbirth a woman had to bring a sacrifice. He replied that when she bore her child, she swore impetuously in the pain of childbirth that she would never again have intercourse with her husband. The Torah, therefore, ordained that she had to bring a sacrifice, as she would probably violate that oath.Babylonian Talmud Niddah 31b. Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai that because she fluttered in her heart, she had to bring a fluttering sacrifice, two turtle-doves or two young pigeons.Genesis Rabbah 20:7. Land of Israel, 5th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Genesis. Translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 1, pages 165‚Äì66. London: Soncino Press, 1939. . The disciples asked Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai why permitted contact between the father and mother after 7 days when the mother bore a boy, but permitted contact after 14 days when she bore a girl. He replied that since everyone around the mother would rejoice upon the birth of a boy, she would regret her oath to shun her husband after just 7 days, but since people around her would not rejoice on the birth of a girl, she would take twice as long. And Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai taught that ordained circumcision on the eighth day so that the parents could join their guests in a celebratory mood on that day. Turtledove (1897 painting by Johann Friedrich Naumann) Pigeons (painting circa 1832‚Äì1837 by John Gould) and provided that people of lesser means could bring less-expensive offerings. The Mishnah taught that one who sacrificed much and one who sacrificed little attained equal merit, so long as they directed their hearts to Heaven.Mishnah Menachot 13:11, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 765; Babylonian Talmud Menachot 110a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Yosef Davis, Eliezer Herzka, Abba Zvi Naiman, Zev Meisels, Noson Boruch Herzka, and Avrohom Neuberger, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2003), volume 60, page 110a3; see also Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 5b, in, e.g., Koren Talmud Bavli: Berakhot. Commentary by Adin Even-Israel (Steinsaltz) (Jerusalem: Koren Publishers, 2012), volume 1, page 29. Rabbi Zera taught that provided a Scriptural proof for this when it says, \\"Sweet is the sleep of a serving man, whether he eat little or much.\\" Rav Adda bar Ahavah taught that provided a Scriptural proof for this when it says, \\"When goods increase, they are increased who eat them; and what advantage is there to the owner thereof.\\" Rabbi Simeon ben Azzai taught that Scripture says of a large ox, \\"An offering made by fire of a sweet savor\\"; of a small bird, \\"An offering made by fire of a sweet savor\\"; and of a meal-offering, \\"An offering made by fire of a sweet savor.\\" Rabbi Simeon ben Azzai thus taught that Scripture uses the same expression each time to teach that it is the same whether people offered much or little, so long as they directed their hearts to Heaven.Babylonian Talmud Menachot 110a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Yosef Davis, Eliezer Herzka, Abba Zvi Naiman, Zev Meisels, Noson Boruch Herzka, and Avrohom Neuberger, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 60, page 110a3‚Äì4. And Rabbi Isaac asked why the meal-offering was distinguished in that uses the word \\"soul\\" (, nefesh) to refer to the donor of a meal-offering, instead of the usual \\"man\\" (, adam, in or , ish, in ) used in connection with other sacrifices. Rabbi Isaac taught that uses the word \\"soul\\" (, nefesh) because God noted that the one who usually brought a meal-offering was a poor man, and God accounted it as if the poor man had offered his own soul.Babylonian Talmud Menachot 104b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Yosef Davis, Eliezer Herzka, Abba Zvi Naiman, Zev Meisels, Noson Boruch Herzka, and Avrohom Neuberger, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 60, page 104b2. Rabbi Simeon noted that Scripture always lists turtledoves before pigeons, and imagined that one might thus think that Scripture prefers turtledoves over pigeons. But Rabbi Simeon quoted the instructions of \\"a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin-offering\\", to teach that Scripture accepted both equally.Mishnah Keritot 6:9, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 850‚Äì51; Babylonian Talmud Keritot 28a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Eliahu Shulman, Dovid Arye Kaufman, Dovid Nachfolger, Menachem Goldberger, Michoel Weiner, Mendy Wachsman, Abba Zvi Naiman, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2004), volume 69, page 28a. Rabbi Eleazar ben Hisma taught that even the apparently arcane laws of bird offerings in and the beginning of menstrual cycles in are essential laws.Mishnah Avot 3:18, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 681. Tractate Kinnim in the Mishnah interpreted the laws of pairs of sacrificial pigeons and doves in and and Mishnah Kinnim 1:1‚Äì3:6. Reprinted in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 883‚Äì89. Interpreting the beginning of menstrual cycles, as in the Mishnah ruled that if a woman loses track of her menstrual cycle, there is no return to the beginning of the niddah count in fewer than seven, nor more than seventeen days.Mishnah Arakhin 2:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 811; Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 8a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman, Feivel Wahl, Yosef Davis, Henoch Moshe Levin, Israel Schneider, Yeshayahu Levy, Eliezer Herzka, Dovid Nachfolger, Eliezer Lachman, and Zev Meisels, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2004), volume 67, page 8a. The Mishnah (following ) taught that a sin-offering of a bird preceded a burnt-offering of a bird; and the priest also dedicated them in that order.Mishnah Zevachim 10:4, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 722; Babylonian Talmud Zevachim 89a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Israel Schneider, Yosef Widroff, Mendy Wachsman, Dovid Katz, Zev Meisels, and Feivel Wahl, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1996), volume 57, page 89a. Rabbi Eliezer taught that wherever an offerer (because of poverty) substituted for an animal sin-offering the offering of two birds (one of which was for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering), the priest sacrificed the bird sin-offering before the bird burnt-offering (as instructs). But in the case of a woman after childbirth discussed in (where a poor new mother could substitute for an animal burnt- offering two birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt- offering), the bird burnt-offering took precedence over the bird sin-offering. Wherever the offering came on account of sin, the sin-offering took precedence. But here (in the case of a woman after childbirth, where the sin- offering was not on account of sin) the burnt-offering took precedence. And wherever both birds came instead of one animal sin-offering, the sin-offering took precedence. But here (in the case of a woman after childbirth) they did not both come on account of a sin-offering (for in poverty she substituted a bird burnt-offering for an animal burnt-offering, as required her to bring a bird sin-offering in any case), the burnt-offering took precedence. (The Gemara asked whether this contradicted the Mishnah, which taught that a bird sin-offering took precedence over an animal burnt-offering, whereas here she brought the animal burnt-offering before the bird sin-offering.) Rava taught that merely accorded the bird burnt-offering precedence in the mentioning. (Thus, some read Rava to teach that lets the reader read first about the burnt-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first. Others read Rava to teach that one first dedicated the animal or bird for the burnt-offering and then dedicated the bird for the sin-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first.)Babylonian Talmud Zevachim 90a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Israel Schneider et al., volume 57, page 90a. called for \\"two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt- offering, and the other for a sin-offering\\". Rav Hisda taught that the designation of one of the birds to become the burnt-offering and the other to become the sin-offering was made either by the owner or by the priest's action. Rabbi Shimi bar Ashi explained that the words of \\"she shall take . . . the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering\\", indicated that the mother could have made the designation when taking the birds, and the words of \\"the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering\\", and of \\"the priest shall offer the one for a sin- offering, and the other for a burnt-offering\\", indicated that (absent such a designation by the mother) the priest could have made the designation when offering them up.Babylonian Talmud Yoma 41a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Abba Zvi Naiman et al., volume 13, page 41a. Leviticus chapter 13 Reading a Midrash taught that in 18 verses, Scripture places Moses and Aaron (the instruments of Israel‚Äôs deliverance) on an equal footing (reporting that God spoke to both of them alike),See and thus there are 18 benedictions in the Amidah.Numbers Rabbah 2:1. 12th century. Reprinted in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Numbers. Translated by Judah J. Slotki, volume 5, page 22. London: Soncino Press, 1939. . Tractate Negaim in the Mishnah and Tosefta interpreted the laws of skin disease in Mishnah Negaim 1:1‚Äì14:13, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 981‚Äì1012; Tosefta Negaim 1:1‚Äì9:9 (Land of Israel, circa 300 CE), in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction, translated by Jacob Neusner (Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson Publishers, 2002), volume 2, pages 1709‚Äì44. A Midrash compared the discussion of skin diseases beginning at to the case of a noble lady who, upon entering the king's palace, was terrified by the whips that she saw hanging about. But the king told her: \\"Do not fear; these are meant for the slaves, but you are here to eat, drink, and make merry.\\" So, too, when the Israelites heard the section of Scripture dealing with leprous affections, they became afraid. But Moses told them: \\"These are meant for the wicked nations, but you are intended to eat, drink, and be joyful, as it is written in \\"Many are the sufferings of the wicked; but he that trusts in the Lord, mercy surrounds him.\\"Leviticus Rabbah 15:4. Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Joseph ben Zimra that anyone who bears evil tales (, lashon hara) will be visited by the plague of skin disease (, tzara'at), as it is said in \\"Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy (azmit).\\" The Gemara read azmit to allude to , tzara'at, and cited how says \\"in perpetuity\\" (la-zemitut). And Resh Lakish interpreted the words of \\"This shall be the law of the person with skin disease (metzora),\\" to mean, \\"This shall be the law for him who brings up an evil name (motzi shem ra).\\" And the Gemara reported that in the Land of Israel they taught that slander kills three persons: the slanderer, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom the slander is told.Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 15b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman et al., volume 67, pages 15b2‚Äì5. Similarly, Rabbi Haninah taught that skin disease came only from slander. The Rabbis found a proof for this from the case of Miriam, arguing that because she uttered slander against Moses, plagues attacked her. And the Rabbis read to support this when it says in connection with skin disease, \\"remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam\\".Deuteronomy Rabbah 6:8 (Land of Israel, circa 775‚Äì900 CE), in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon (London: Soncino Press, 1939), volume 7, pages 125‚Äì26. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that skin disease results from seven sins: slander, the shedding of blood, vain oath, incest, arrogance, robbery, and envy. The Gemara cited Scriptural bases for each of the associations: For slander, for bloodshed, for a vain oath, for incest, for arrogance, for robbery, (as a Tanna taught that those who collect money that does not belong to them will see a priest come and scatter their money around the street); and for envy, Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 16a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman et al., volume 67, page 16a. Worshiping the golden calf (illustration from a 1901 Bible card published by the Providence Lithograph Company) Miriam Shut Out from the Camp (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) Similarly, a Midrash taught that skin disease resulted from 10 sins: (1) idol-worship, (2) unchastity, (3) bloodshed, (4) the profanation of the Divine Name, (5) blasphemy of the Divine Name, (6) robbing the public, (7) usurping a dignity to which one has no right, (8) overweening pride, (9) evil speech, and (10) an evil eye. The Midrash cited as proofs: (1) for idol-worship, the experience of the Israelites who said of the Golden Calf, \\"This is your god, O Israel\\", in and then were smitten with leprosy, as reported in where \\"Moses saw that the people had broken out (parua, )\\", indicating that leprosy had \\"broken out\\" (parah) among them; (2) for unchastity, from the experience of the daughters of Zion of whom says, \\"the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and ogling eyes\\", and then says, \\"Therefore will the Lord smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion\\"; (3) for bloodshed, from the experience of Joab, of whom says, \\"Let it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper,\\" (4) for the profanation of the Divine Name, from the experience of Gehazi, of whom says, \\"But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said: ‚ÄòBehold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take of him somewhat (me'umah, ),\\" and \\"somewhat\\" (me'umah, ) means \\"of the blemish\\" (mum, ) that Naaman had, and thus Gehazi was smitten with leprosy, as reports Elisha said to Gehazi, \\"The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave to you\\"; (5) for blaspheming the Divine Name, from the experience of Goliath, of whom says, \\"And the Philistine cursed David by his God\\", and the says, \\"This day will the Lord deliver (sagar, ) you\\", and the term \\"deliver\\" (sagar, ) is used here in the same sense as uses it with regard to leprosy, when it is says, \\"And the priest shall shut him up (sagar)\\"; (6) for robbing the public, from the experience of Shebna, who derived illicit personal benefit from property of the Sanctuary, and of whom says, \\"the Lord . . . will wrap you round and round\\", and \\"wrap\\" must refer to a leper, of whom says, \\"And he shall wrap himself over the upper lip\\"; (7) for usurping a dignity to which one has no right, from the experience of Uzziah, of whom says, \\"And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death\\"; (8) for overweening pride, from the same example of Uzziah, of whom says, \\"But when he became strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly and he trespassed against the Lord his God\\"; (9) for evil speech, from the experience of Miriam, of whom says, \\"And Miriam . . . spoke against Moses\\", and then says, \\"when the cloud was removed from over the Tent, behold Miriam was leprous\\"; and (10) for an evil eye, from the person described in which can be read, \\"And he that keeps his house to himself shall come to the priest, saying: There seems to me to be a plague in the house,\\" and thus describes one who is not willing to permit any other to have any benefit from the house.Leviticus Rabbah 17:3. Similarly, Rabbi Judah the Levite, son of Rabbi Shalom, inferred that skin disease comes because of eleven sins: (1) for cursing the Divine Name, (2) for immorality, (3) for bloodshed, (4) for ascribing to another a fault that is not in him, (5) for haughtiness, (6) for encroaching upon other people's domains, (7) for a lying tongue, (8) for theft, (9) for swearing falsely, (10) for profanation of the name of Heaven, and (11) for idolatry. Rabbi Isaac added: for ill-will. And our Rabbis said: for despising the words of the Torah.Numbers Rabbah 7:5. Reading \\"My ordinances (, mishpatai) shall you do, and My statutes (, chukotai) shall you keep\\", the Sifra distinguished \\"ordinances\\" (, mishpatim) from \\"statutes\\" (, chukim). The term \\"ordinances\\" (, mishpatim), taught the Sifra, refers to rules that even had they not been written in the Torah, it would have been entirely logical to write them, like laws pertaining to theft, sexual immorality, idolatry, blasphemy and murder. The term \\"statutes\\" (, chukim), taught the Sifra, refers to those rules that the impulse to do evil (, yetzer hara) and the nations of the world try to undermine, like eating pork (prohibited by and ), wearing wool-linen mixtures (, shatnez, prohibited by and ), release from levirate marriage (, chalitzah, mandated by ), purification of a person affected by skin disease (, metzora, regulated in ), and the goat sent off into the wilderness (the \\"scapegoat,\\" regulated in ). In regard to these, taught the Sifra, the Torah says simply that God legislated them and we have no right to raise doubts about them.Sifra Aharei Mot pereq 13, 194:2:11. Reprinted in, e.g., Sifra: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 3, page 79. Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1988. . It was taught in a Baraita that four types of people are accounted as though they were dead: a poor person, a person affected by skin disease (, metzora), a blind person, and one who is childless. A poor person is accounted as dead, for says, \\"for all the men are dead who sought your life\\" (and the Gemara interpreted this to mean that they had been stricken with poverty). A person affected by skin disease (, metzora) is accounted as dead, for says, \\"And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous (, metzora'at). And Aaron said to Moses . . . let her not be as one dead.\\" The blind are accounted as dead, for says, \\"He has set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old\\". And one who is childless is accounted as dead, for in Rachel said, \\"Give me children, or else I am dead\\".Babylonian Talmud Nedarim 64b. Reprinted in, e.g., Talmud Bavli. Elucidated by Eliezer Herzka, Asher Dicker, Nasanel Kasnett, Noson Boruch Herzka, Reuvein Dowek, Michoel Weiner, Mendy Wachsman, and Feivel Wahl; edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 30, page 64b3. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000. . In the priest's examination of skin disease mandated by 9, and 14:2, the Mishnah taught that a priest could examine anyone else's symptoms, but not his own. And Rabbi Meir taught that the priest could not examine his relatives.Mishnah Negaim 2:5, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 984; Deuteronomy Rabbah 6:8, in, e.g., Midrash Rabbah: Deuteronomy, translated by Harry Freedman and Maurice Simon, volume 7, pages 125‚Äì26. The Mishnah taught that anyone could inspect skin disease, but only a priest could declare it unclean or clean.Mishnah Negaim 3:1, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, page 984. The Mishnah taught that the priests delayed examining a bridegroom ‚Äî as well as his house and his garment ‚Äî until after his seven days of rejoicing, and delayed examining anyone until after a holy day.Mishnah Negaim 3:2, in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation, translated by Jacob Neusner, pages 984‚Äì85. The Gemara taught that the early scholars were called soferim (related to the original sense of its root safar, \\"to count\\") because they used to count all the letters of the Torah (to ensure the correctness of the text). They used to say the vav () in gachon, (\\"belly\\"), in marks the half-way point of the letters in the Torah. They used to say the words darosh darash, (\\"diligently inquired\\"), in mark the half-way point of the words in the Torah. And they used to say marks the half-way point of the verses in the Torah. Rav Joseph asked whether the vav () in gachon, (\\"belly\\"), in belonged to the first half or the second half of the Torah. (Rav Joseph presumed that the Torah contains an even number of letters.) The scholars replied that they could bring a Torah Scroll and count, for Rabbah bar bar Hanah said on a similar occasion that they did not stir from where they were until a Torah Scroll was brought and they counted. Rav Joseph replied that they (in Rabbah bar bar Hanah's time) were thoroughly versed in the proper defective and full spellings of words (that could be spelled in variant ways), but they (in Rav Joseph's time) were not. Similarly, Rav Joseph asked whether belongs to the first half or the second half of verses. Abaye replied that for verses, at least, we can bring a Scroll and count them. But Rav Joseph replied that even with verses, they could no longer be certain. For when Rav Aha bar Adda came (from the Land of Israel to Babylon), he said that in the West (in the Land of Israel), they divided into three verses. Nonetheless, the Rabbis taught in a Baraita that there are 5,888 verses in the Torah.Babylonian Talmud Kiddushin 30a. (Note that others say the middle letter in our current Torah text is the aleph () in hu, (\\"he\\"), in the middle two words are el yesod, (\\"at the base of\\"), in the half-way point of the verses in the Torah is and there are 5,846 verses in the Torah text we have today.)E.g., Michael Pitkowsky, \\"The Middle Verse of the Torah\\" and the response of Reuven Wolfeld there. Rava recounted a Baraita that taught that the rule of regarding one with skin disease, \\"the hair of his head shall be loose\\", also applied to a High Priest. The status of a High Priest throughout the year corresponded with that of any other person on a festival (with regard to mourning). For the Mishnah saidSee Mishnah Horayot 3:5. Reprinted in, e.g., The Mishnah: A New Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, page 695. Babylonian Talmud Horayot 12b. that the High Priest could bring sacrifices on the altar even before he had buried his dead, but he could not eat sacrificial meat. From this restriction of a High Priest, the Gemara inferred that the High Priest would deport himself as a person with skin disease during a festival. And the Gemara continued to teach that a mourner is forbidden to cut his hair, because since ordained for the sons of Aaron: \\"Let not the hair of your heads go loose\\" (after the death of their brothers Nadab and Abihu), we infer that cutting hair is forbidden for everybody else (during mourning), as well.Babylonian Talmud Moed Katan 14b. Rabbi Abbahu, as well as Rabbi Uzziel the grandson of Rabbi Uzziel the Great, taught that requires that the person afflicted with skin disease \\"cry, ‚ÄòUnclean! Unclean!'\\" to warn passers-by to keep away. But the Gemara cited a Baraita that taught that requires that the person \\"cry, ‚ÄòUnclean! Unclean!'\\" so that the person's distress would become known to many people, so that many could pray for mercy on the afflicted person's behalf. And the Gemara concluded that reads \\"Unclean\\" twice to teach that is intended to further both purposes, to keep passers-by away and to invite their prayers for mercy.Babylonian Talmud Moed Katan 5a. A Midrash taught that Divine Justice first attacks a person's substance and then the person's body. So when leprous plagues come upon a person, first they come upon the fabric of the person's house. If the person repents, then requires that only the affected stones need to be pulled out; if the person does not repent, then requires pulling down the house. Then the plagues come upon the person's clothes. If the person repents, then the clothes require washing; if not, they require burning. Then the plagues come upon the person's body. If the person repents, provides for purification; if not, then ordains that the person \\"shall dwell alone\\".Leviticus Rabbah 17:4. Ruth Rabbah 2:10. Similarly, the Tosefta reported that when a person would come to the priest, the priest would tell the person to engage in self-examination and turn from evil ways. The priest would continue that plagues come only from gossip, and skin disease from arrogance. But God would judge in mercy. The plague would come to the house, and if the homeowner repented, the house required only dismantling, but if the homeowner did not repent, the house required demolition. They would appear on clothing, and if the owner repented, the clothing required only tearing, but if the owner did not repent, the clothing required burning. They would appear on the person's body, and if the person repented, well and good, but if the person did not repent, required that the person \\"shall dwell alone\\".Tosefta Negaim 6:7, in, e.g., The Tosefta: Translated from the Hebrew, with a New Introduction, translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 2, pages 1731‚Äì32. Rabbi Samuel bar Elnadab asked Rabbi Haninah (or others say Rabbi Samuel bar Nadab the son-in-law of Rabbi Haninah asked Rabbi Haninah, or still others say, asked Rabbi Joshua ben Levi) what distinguished the person afflicted with skin disease that ordains that the person \\"shall dwell alone\\". The answer was that through gossip, the person afflicted with skin disease separated husband from wife, one neighbor from another, and therefore the Torah punished the person afflicted with skin disease measure for measure, ordaining that the person \\"shall dwell alone\\".Babylonian Talmud Arakhin 16b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman et al., volume 67, page 16b. In a Baraita, Rabbi Jose related that a certain Elder from Jerusalem told him that 24 types of patients are afflicted with boils. The Gemara then related that Rabbi Jo·∏•anan warned to be careful of the flies found on those afflicted with the disease ra‚Äôatan, as flies carried the disease. Rabbi Zeira would not sit in a spot where the wind blew from the direction of someone afflicted with ra‚Äôatan. Rabbi Elazar would not enter the tent of one afflicted with ra‚Äôatan, and Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi would not eat eggs from an alley in which someone afflicted with ra‚Äôatan lived. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, however, would attach himself to those afflicted with ra‚Äôatan and study Torah, saying this was justified by ‚ÄúThe Torah is a loving hind and a graceful doe.‚Äù Rabbi Joshua reasoned that if Torah bestows grace on those who learn it, it could protect them from illness. When Rabbi Joshua ben Levi was on the verge of dying, the Gemara told, the Angel of Death was instructed to perform Rabbi Joshua‚Äôs bidding, as he was a righteous man and deserves to die in the manner he saw fit. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asked the Angel of Death to show him his place in paradise, and the Angel agreed. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asked the Angel to give him the knife that the Angel used to kill people, lest the Angel frighten him on the way, and the Angel gave it to him. When they arrived in paradise, the Angel lifted Rabbi Joshua so that he could see his place in paradise, and Rabbi Joshua jumped to the other side, escaping into paradise. Elijah the Prophet then told those in paradise to make way for Rabbi Joshua.Babylonian Talmud Ketubot 77b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Mendy Wachsman, Abba Zvi Naiman, and Eliahu Shulman, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, and Mordechai Marcus Hersh Goldwurm (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2000), volume 27, pages 77b1‚Äì3. The Gemara told that Rabbi Joshua ben Levi asked Elijah when the Messiah would come, and Elijah told Rabbi Joshua ben Levi that he could find the Messiah sitting at the entrance of the city of Rome among the poor who suffer from illnesses.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 98a, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz (Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1995), volume 49, page 98a5. In medieval Jewish interpretation The parashah is discussed in these medieval Jewish sources:For more on medieval Jewish interpretation, see, e.g., Barry D. Walfish. \\"Medieval Jewish Interpretation.\\" In The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition. Edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, pages 1891‚Äì1915. Maimonides Leviticus chapter 12 Maimonides taught that the laws of impurity serve many uses: (1) They keep Jews at a distance from dirty and filthy objects. (2) They guard the Sanctuary. (3) They pay regard to an established custom. (4) They lightened the burden. For these laws do not impede people affected with impurity in their ordinary occupations. For the distinction between pure and impure applies only with reference to the Sanctuary and the holy objects connected with it; it does not apply to other cases. Citing \\"She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary,\\" Maimonides noted that people who do not intend to enter the Sanctuary or touch any holy thing are not guilty of any sin if they remain unclean as long as they like, and eat, according to their pleasure, ordinary food that has been in contact with unclean things.Maimonides. The Guide for the Perplexed, part 3, chapter 47. Cairo, Egypt, 1190. Reprinted in, e.g., Moses Maimonides. The Guide for the Perplexed. Translated by Michael Friedl√§nder, page 368. New York: Dover Publications, 1956. . In modern interpretation The parashah is discussed in these modern sources: Leviticus chapter 12 Dr. Elaine Goodfriend of California State University, Northridge, observed that and its focus on menstruating women had an enormous effect on Jewish women's lives. Goodfriend reported that \\"the view that women ‚Äî via their normal, recurring bodily functions ‚Äî generate a pollution antagonistic to holiness served as a justification for women's distance from the sacred throughout Jewish history.\\" Goodfriend speculated the priesthood excluded women because of \\"fear that the sudden onset of menstruation would result in the clash of impurity and holiness, with presumed dire consequences.\\" Goodfriend noted that these laws and associated customs affected both women's public religious life and private family life, as they and their husbands were prohibited from sex for extensive periods of time, affecting their fertility and married life in general.Elaine Goodfriend, \\"Tazria: Leviticus 12:1‚Äì13:59: Purity, Birth, and Illness,\\" in Tamara Cohn Eskenazi and Andrea L. Weiss, editors, The Torah: A Women's Commentary (New York: URJ Press, 2008), pages 637‚Äì38. Professor Shaye Cohen of Harvard University noted that the only element in common between the ‚Äúritual‚Äù or physical impurities of and the ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù or sinful impurities of is intercourse with a menstruant.Shaye J.D. Cohen, \\"Menstruants and the Sacred in Judaism and Christianity,\\" in Women‚Äôs History and Ancient History, edited by Sarah B. Pomeroy (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1991), page 275. Leviticus chapter 13 Professor Ephraim Speiser of the University of Pennsylvania in the mid 20th century wrote that the word ‚ÄúTorah‚Äù () is based on a verbal stem signifying ‚Äúto teach, guide,‚Äù and the like, and the derived noun can carry a variety of meanings, including in 54, and 57, specific rituals for what is sometimes called leprosy. Speiser argued that in context, the word cannot be mistaken for the title of the Pentateuch as a whole.Ephraim A. Speiser. Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes, volume 1, page xviii. New York: Anchor Bible, 1964. Commandments=According to Maimonides Maimonides cited verses in this parashah for 3 positive and 1 negative commandments:Maimonides.

Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 2007. . The Weekly Maqam In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews each week base the songs of the services on the content of that week's parashah. For parashah Tazria, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Saba, the maqam that symbolizes a covenant (brit). This is appropriate, because this parashah commences with the discussion of what to do when a baby boy is born. It also mentions the brit milah, a ritual that shows a covenant between man and God. Haftarah The haftarah for the parashah (when read individually on a Sabbath that is not a special Sabbath) is Summary A man from Baal- shalishah brought the prophet Elisha bread of the First Fruits ‚Äî 20 loaves of barley ‚Äî and fresh grain in his sack to give to the people to eat. Elisha's servant asked Elisha how he could feed a hundred men with these rations, but Elisha told his servant to give the food to the people, for God said that they would eat and have food left over. So the servant set the food before the men, they ate, and they had food left over, just as God had said. Elisha Refusing Gifts from Naaman (1630 painting by Pieter de Grebber) Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God with power over life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel. Elisha refusing the gifts of Naaman (1637 painting by Pieter de Grebber) When Elisha heard, he invited the king to send Naaman to him, and so Naaman came to Elisha's house with his horses and his chariots. Elisha sent a messenger to Naaman to tell him to wash seven times in the Jordan River and be healed, but that angered Naaman, who expected Elisha to come out, call on the name of God, and wave his hands over Naaman. Naaman asked whether the Amanah and Pharpar rivers of Damascus were not better than any river in Israel, so that he might wash in them and be clean. But Naaman's servants advised him that if Elisha had directed him to do some difficult thing he would have done it, so how much more should he do what Elisha directed when he said merely to wash and be clean. So Naaman dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, and his flesh came back like the flesh of a little child. Naaman returned to Elisha, avowed that there is no God except in Israel, and asked Elisha to take a present, but Elisha declined. Naaman asked if he might take two mule loads of Israel's earth so that Naaman might make offerings to God, and he asked that God might pardon Naaman when had had to bow before the Aramean idol Rimmon when the king of Aram leaned on Naaman to bow before Rimmon. And Elisha told Naaman to go in peace. Connection to the parashah Both the parashah and the haftarah report the treatment of skin disease, the parashah by the priests,See and the haftarah by the prophet Elisha.See Both the parashah and the haftarah frequently employ the term for skin disease (, tzara'at). 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 42, 43, 49, 51, 52, 59; 6, 7. A Midrash deduced from the characterization of Naaman as a \\"great man\\" in that Naaman was haughty on account of his being a great warrior, and as a result was smitten with leprosy. And fundamentally, both the parashah and the haftarah view skin disease as related to the Divine sphere and an occasion for interaction with God. The haftarah in classical rabbinic interpretation The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael considered Naaman a more righteous convert than Jethro. Reading Jethro‚Äôs words in \\"Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods,\\" the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael reported that they said that there was not an idol in the world that Jethro failed to seek out and worship, for Jethro said \\"than all gods.\\" The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that Naaman, however, knew better than Jethro that there was no other god, for Naaman said in \\"Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel.\\"Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael, tractate Amalek, chapter 3.

Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1933, reissued 2004. .

Ezekiel (1510 fresco by Michelangelo from the Sistine Chapel) On Shabbat HaChodesh When the parashah coincides with Shabbat HaChodesh (\\"Sabbath [of] the month,\\" the special Sabbath preceding the Hebrew month of Nissan ‚Äî as it does in 2019 and 2022), the haftarah is: *for Ashkenazi Jews: *for Sephardi Jews: Connection to the Special Sabbath On Shabbat HaChodesh, Jews read in which God commands that \\"This month [Nissan] shall be the beginning of months; it shall be the first month of the year,\\" and in which God issued the commandments of Passover. Similarly, the haftarah in discusses Passover. In both the special reading and the haftarah, God instructs the Israelites to apply blood to doorposts. Parashah Tazria- Metzora When parashah Tazria is combined with parashah Metzora (as it is in 2018, 2020, 2021, 2025, and 2028) and it is not a special Sabbath, the haftarah is the haftarah for parashah Metzora, The lepers went into a tent (illustration by Charles Joseph Staniland (1838‚Äì1916)) =Summary= During the Arameans' siege of Samaria, four leprous men at the gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them no worse than they were. When at twilight, they went to the Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and clothing from the tents and hid it. The four lepers bring the news to the guards at the gate of Samaria (illumination from Petrus Comestor's 1372 Bible Historiale) Feeling qualms of guilt, they went to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's household within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, they would be able to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted the Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said. =Connection to the double parashah= Isaiah (fresco circa 1508‚Äì1512 by Michelangelo from the Sistine Chapel) Both the double parashah and the haftarah deal with people stricken with skin disease. Both the parashah and the haftarah employ the term for the person affected by skin disease (metzora, ). 8. In parashah Tazria, provides that the person with skin disease \\"shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be,\\" thus explaining why the four leprous men in the haftarah lived outside the gate. Rabbi Johanan taught that the four leprous men at the gate in were none other than Elisha's former servant Gehazi (whom the Midrash, above, cited as having been stricken with leprosy for profanation of the Divine Name) and his three sons.Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 107b, in, e.g., Talmud Bavli, elucidated by Asher Dicker, Joseph Elias, and Dovid Katz, edited by Yisroel Simcha Schorr and Chaim Malinowitz, volume 49, page 107b. In parashah Metzora, when there \\"seems\\" to be a plague in the house, the priest must not jump to conclusions, but must examine the facts. 39, 44. Just before the opening of the haftarah, in the captain on whom the king leaned jumps to the conclusion that Elisha's prophecy could not come true, and the captain meets his punishment in and 19.See Lainie Blum Cogan and Judy Weiss.

Historically this was a rural hamlet surrounded by farmland. The residents are fortunate enough that to the east of the village is attractive rolling countryside, with views of lansdown, and the surrounding hills. The village is on the eastern outskirts of Bristol and approximately halfway between Bristol city centre and the neighbouring city of Bath. North Common is a semi rural village, adjacent to the villages of Warmley, Oldland Common and Bridgeyate. To the east of the village is open farmland and greenbelt which is only a few minutes walk. The village is home to the Bath Ales brewery. The Bristol and Bath Railway Path passes through North Common and steam trains from the Avon Valley Steam Railway travel as far as North Common where the rail track terminates. Many local children attend St Barnabas CE Primary School, Redfield Edge Primary School, The Meadows Primary School in bitton or St Anne's CE VC Primary school in nearby Oldland Common. Older students attend Sir Bernard Lovell Academy or other local secondary schools such as Digitech or Wellsway School in Keynsham. North Common has its own village hall located in Millers Drive and is served by several pubs in particular The Griffin and White Harte pubs at Bridgeyate, the Doplhin at Oldland Common and the Hollybush Inn on the North Common - Bridgeyate border. There is suitable public transport with the 42 to Bristol city centre, the 19A to Bath city centre or Cribbs Causeway, or around 10 minutes walk away outside the griffin there's the 35 from Marshfield to Bristol city centre. There are good road links to the Avon Ring Road (and hence the motorway network) via nearby Warmley village and Bath lies some east and is easily accessible by road.

He also worked in films throughout his career, playing more than fifty cinema roles. From 1935 he performed in radio broadcasts and, from 1956, had considerable success in television roles. After attending drama school, Olivier began his professional career with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. In 1926 he joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, where he was given the chance to play a wide range of key roles. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in No√´l Coward's Private Lives, and in 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, and by the end of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a highly respected company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1964) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970). In 1930, to gain money for his forthcoming marriage, Olivier began his film career with small roles in two films. In 1939 he appeared as Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights in a role that saw him nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. The following year he was again nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Maxim de Winter in Rebecca. In 1944 he produced, directed and appeared as Henry V of England in Henry V. There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and the film instead won a \\"Special Award\\". He won the Best Actor award for the 1948 film Hamlet, which became the first non- American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He later received Oscar nominations for roles in Richard III (1955), The Entertainer (1960), Othello (1965), Sleuth (1972), Marathon Man (1976) and The Boys from Brazil (1978). In 1979 he was also presented with an Honorary Award, at the Academy Awards, to recognise his lifetime of contribution to the art of film. He was nominated for nine other acting Oscars and one each for production and direction. Throughout his career Olivier appeared in radio dramas and poetry readings, and made his television debut in 1956. During the making of the 1983 movie The Jigsaw Man Olivier walked away from the film after receiving no pay, with Michael Caine following not long after. They returned only when $4 million was secured as finance by Pakistani businessman, filmmaker and best seller author Mahmud Sipra. After being ill for the last twenty-two years of his life, Olivier died of kidney failure on 11 July 1989. In reflection, and about Olivier's pioneering of Britain's National Theatre, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg wrote: \\"[N]o one doubts that the National is perhaps his most enduring monument\\". Olivier's claim to theatrical greatness lay not only in his acting, but as, in the words of the English theatre director Peter Hall, \\"the supreme man of the theatre of our time\\".

Pierre- Fran√ßois Hugues, known as 'baron d'Hancarville' (Nancy 1719 - Padua 1805) was an art historian and historian of ideas. Biography Pierre Francois Hugues was born in 1719 at Nancy, France, the son of a bankrupt cloth-merchant. He himself later added the title of ‚Äòbaron d'Hancarville‚Äô to his name. An amateur art dealer, he introduced William Hamilton, British ambassador at Naples, to the Porcinari family, whose collection of antiquities Hamilton bought, and subsequently sold to the British Museum in London. With Hamilton Hugues compiled the Collection Of Etruscan, Greek And Roman Antiquities From The Cabinet Of The Honble. Wm. Hamilton ... = Antiquit√©s Etrusques, Grecques Et Romains, Tirees Du Cabinet De M. Hamilton ... (4 volumes, Naples 1766-67 but possibly published 1767-76). The 'Antiquities' shown and discussed in these volumes are nearly all ancient Greek vases, collected from Herculaneum, Pompeii and other parts of south Italy and Greece. Hamilton and Hugues intended this collection of vases not only to provide models for contemporary designers but also, because of their great number, to serve as a help in tracing the historic development of the 'stiles of the different periods in the Art of the Ancients' (vol. 1, p. 168). As well as discussing the technique and aesthetic of ancient vase-painting Hugues also propounds some innovative ideas on the difference between art as symbol and art as representation - ideas which he would develop in his Recherches Sur L'Origine, L'Esprit Et Les Progres Des Arts De La Grece; Sur Leur Connections Avec Les Arts Et La Religion Des Plus Anciens Peuples Connus ... (3 vols., A Londres, 1785). Engraving for d'Hancarville In 1772 Hamilton's first collection of vases was bought by the British Museum. The four volumes of the Antiquites, printed by Francesco Morelli and copiously illustrated (and with many copies hand- painted), form one of the most beautiful books ever made. Their illustrations were directly copied by Josiah Wedgwood and other pottery manufacturers, and fostered the Neoclassical taste for outline drawing and engraving adopted by John Flaxman and others. In 1769 Hancarville was forced to flee his creditors in Naples. Hancarville also produced two pornographic volumes under fictitious imprints: *Monumens de la vie priv√©e des XII C√©sars d‚Äôapres une suite de pierres et m√©dailles grav√©es sous leur r√®gne. Capree, chez Sabellus, 1780 *Monumens du culte secret des dames romaines. Rome: De l'Imprimerie du Vatican, 1787 These were widely pirated, in variously incompetent editions, during his lifetime. Hugues died at Padua in 1805. Further reading * F. Haskell, 'The Baron d'Hancarville', in F. Haskell, Past and Present in Art and Taste (1987), p. 30-45, 230-32 * A.

Centered on its interchange with the New York State Thruway outside New Paltz, it provides access from that road to the popular recreational attractions of the Shawangunk Ridge to the west and Poughkeepsie to the east. Only the eastern section is a state highway; from Shawangunk to New Paltz, it is owned and maintained by Ulster County. Route description NY 299 through downtown New Paltz NY 299 begins at an intersection with the concurrent US 44 and NY 55 just south of Lake Minnewaska in the town of Gardiner. NY 299 winds northeast through the deep woods of Gardiner, paralleling US 44 and NY 55 as it climbs through the Shawangunk Mountains . Passing well to the south of the hairpin turn on US 44 and NY 55, NY 299 bends eastward under control of Ulster County, with the County Route 8 (CR 8) designation. Near Hasbrouck Road, the dense woods recede and NY 299 crosses east through fields through Gardiner. Soon crossing into the town of New Paltz, NY 299 runs along the flood plain of the Wallkill River. NY 299 and CR 8 make a dart to the northeast near a dirt extension of Jacobs Lane, straightening east again at Mohonk Private Road. At the junction with CR 7 (Libertyville Road), CR 8 ends and NY 299 and CR 7 continue east until crossing the river into the village of New Paltz. In the village, NY 299 proceeds northeast as Main Street, reaching a junction with NY 32 (North Chestnut Street) and the northern terminus of NY 208 (South Chestnut Street). NY 299 and NY 32 become concurrent through the village, crossing through the commercial center of the village on Main Street. The routes bend eastward at North Front Street, crossing through a residential/commercial section of the village. NY 299 east of New Paltz At the junction with Manheim Boulevard, NY 32 turns off to the south while NY 299 continues eastward along Main Street. After leaving downtown New Paltz, the route re-enters the town of New Paltz, crossing into exit 18 of the New York State Thruway (I-87). Continuing east along Main Street, NY 299 continues through the town of New Paltz, crossing the northern terminus of CR 22A (South Ohioville Road). Paralleling a former alignment of itself, NY 299 crosses through the hamlet of Ohioville and enters the town of Lloyd. In Lloyd, NY 299 remains a two-lane commercial road, crossing a junction with CR 22 (South Street / South Elting Corners Road). Bypassing the hamlet of Elting Corners to the south, NY 299 becomes a residential road through the town of Lloyd, passing north of a mobile home park. Crossing a junction with CR 12 (New Paltz Road), the route bends northward and begins a parallel with CR 15 (South Riverside Road). CR 15 soon merges into NY 299, which continues east past a junction with another piece of CR 15 (North Riverside Road). Paralleling each other once again, NY 299 turns southeastward, continuing past residences in the town of Lloyd before reaching a junction with US 9W. This junction marks the eastern terminus of NY 299, just north barely within town of Highland. History NY 299 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to the portion of its modern alignment east of New Paltz. It was extended westward to its current western terminus in Gardiner in the early 1950s.

It is divided into two volumes and three parts. It is a report on controversial missionary activities in India. The Committee which was chaired by M. Bhawani Shankar Niyogi, a retired Chief Justice of the Nagpur High Court included five other members viz. M.B.Pathak, Ghanshyam Singh Gupta, S.K.George, Ratanlal Malviya and Bhanu Pratap Singh. The report, set up by a Congress Party government, recommended the \\"legal prohibition\\" of religious conversion not \\"completely voluntary\\", which was not implemented as it would have been \\"difficult to formulate and indeed to apply without violating the precepts of religious liberty enshrined in the Indian Constitution\\".  The Niyogi Committee Report  The Committee contacted 11,360 persons, interviewed people from 700 different villages and received 375 written statements and 385 replies from a questionnaire.Vindicated by Time: The Niyogi Committee Report (edited by Sita Ram Goel, 1998) They visited hospitals, schools, churches and other institutions in 14 districts. It toured several areas and talked to witnesses who were \\"mostly prejudiced\\". The questionnaire had 99 questions, and was described by the High Court thus: > a long and searching document.. in many places it amounts to an accusation. > Some of the questions border on an inquisition, and may well be equated to a > \\"fishing expedition\\" on the supposition that something discreditable can be > discovered. The Committee recorded that \\"there was a general complaint from the non- Christian side that the schools and hospitals were being used as means of securing converts.\\" It said that \\"Reference was also made to the practice of the Roman Catholic priests or preachers visiting newborn babies to give ‚Äòashish‚Äô (blessings) in the name of Jesus, taking sides in litigation or domestic quarrels, kidnapping of minor children and abduction of women and recruitment of labour for plantations in Assam or Andaman as a means of propagating the Christian faith among the ignorant and illiterate people.\\" (Goel 1998, p.13) The report writes that especially Roman Catholic missions used money-lending as a device for proselytisation. They gave loans which were later written off if the debtor became a Christian. (Goel 1998, p.115)  Controversy  The Committee was set up in response to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh's protest movement, \\"The Anti-Foreign Missionary Week\\"; the movement was suspended once the Committee was formed. The Roman Catholic Church withdrew its co-operation with the Committee, and filed a petition against the Committee at the High Court in 1955. The High Court dismissed the Petition in April 1956. The report stirred controversy in India. It was criticized by theologians, Christians and politicians. The recommendations of the report influenced Bills passed by the State Governments against forcible conversions.  The recommendations of the report  The committee gave the following recommendations: *(1) those missionaries whose primary object is proselytisation should be asked to withdraw and the large influx of foreign missionaries should be checked; *(2) the use of medical and other professional services as a direct means of making conversions should be prohibited by law; *(3) attempts to convert by force or fraud or material inducements, or by taking advantage of a person‚Äôs inexperience or confidence or spiritual weakness or thoughtlessness, or by penetrating into the religious conscience of persons for the purpose of consciously altering their faith, should be absolutely prohibited; *(4) the Constitution of India should be amended in order to rule out propagation by foreigners and conversions by force, fraud and other illicit means; *(5) legislative measures should be enacted for controlling conversion by illegal means; *(6) rules relating to registration of doctors, nurses and other personnel employed in hospitals should be suitably amended to provide a condition against evangelistic activities during professional service; and *(7) circulation of literature meant for religious propaganda without approval of the State Government should be prohibited.

History Southeast of the town of Sussex, with which it shares a border, the village was settled by Loyalists during the American Revolution. It is part of what was originally called Pleasant Valley due to the weather and natural wealth it contains. Sussex Corner was home to the fastest half-mile horse racetrack in North America during the mid-19th century. The track was one of many thriving enterprises operated by businessman and sportsman Hugh McMonagle. Among his many contributions to the area, McMonagle introduced the first Holstein cattle to the region, leading to its strong reputation of being the Dairy Capital of the Maritimes. He also brought in the first Morgan horses to New Brunswick and was a strong promoter of agricultural progress for his community. The community was known as the half-way mark for stagecoach travel between Saint John and Moncton. The Pitfield Elm, a massive elm tree that stood outside the Spicer Inn, was a welcome sight for travelers cresting the valley walls as they knew they would soon be enjoying a respite from their bone-jarring journey. Sussex Vale was the economic centre of Kings County in the mid-19th century, with growth slowing after the railroad arrived. McMonagle protested the original plans for the tracks to cross his land and racetrack, and so the railroad was built two miles west of the community. Area businesses soon moved next to the new train station to benefit from the travelers, and the emphasis moved from Sussex Vale to the growing community of Sussex. This history is told in the three murals created in the community. They are part of the 26 murals painted by internationally renowned artists during the summers of 2006 and 2007 that make Sussex and Sussex Corner the Mural Capital of Atlantic Canada. The village became an important road junction during the 20th century and was renamed Sussex Corner.

The Army built the fort shortly after its rout at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas) in late July 1861. The Army named the fort after General Israel B.

The structure, which was the highest fortification on the Arlington Line, occupied a commanding position on the crest of a ridge.

In some instances, the Army compensated the owners for the use of the properties and for damages that had resulted from the Army's wartime activities. In addition, the Army sold at auction many of the fortifications' materials.

This is also known as the \\"slippage\\". Agency trading is largely concerned with minimizing implementation shortfall and finding liquidity.  Decision price  The decision price is the price of the stock that prompted the decision to buy or sell. The most common decision price is the close price or the arrival price. If we split the decision to buy a stock from the actual trading of the stock, as is often the case with fund managers (decision makers) and brokers (trade executors), you can see why both are used. From the fund manager's point of view, his decision to trade is often based on the closing price of the day's trading (along with the entire history of the stock and other signals/indicators). When he decides to buy a particular stock the next day, it is because he believes that the price will go up from that closing price. Thus his decision price is the close price. However the broker, unless she is explicitly told what levels to buy at or what prompted the desire to buy, does not know when or why the decision was made. Her best guess is that the current price at the time the order is received is what prompted the decision and thus her decision price is the arrival price. There is no common definition of this price, but the broker normally uses the last traded price or the \\"mid price\\" - equal to the average of the current bid and ask prices being quoted at the time the order was received. Brokerage firms specialize in developing algorithmic strategies, and providing them to the institutional investment community, that aid in the quest to minimise slippage from benchmarks such as implementation shortfall, volume-weighted average price or time-weighted average price. Alpha Profiling is an example of an algorithmic method of minimising implementation shortfall.

He served as a rabbi in ≈Åom≈ºa, Mezritch, Kovno, Shklov, Brisk, and, finally, Jerusalem, after moving to Eretz Yisrael in 1878. He opened what today is known as the Diskin Orphan Home in 1881. Biography Yehoshua Leib Diskin was born on December 8, 1818, in Grodno, then part of the Russian Empire. His father, Binyamin Diskin, was rabbi of that city, (also known as Grodno) then Volkovisk, and later ≈Åom≈ºa.\\"quote=Our Rav, Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin, was born on Kislev 10, 5579 (1818), to the Gaon Rabbi Binyamin, the Rav of Grodno and later of Lomza. He married Hinda Rachel, daughter of Rabbi Broder, and lived with his father-in- law in Wolkowitz. He received rabbinic ordination at the age of 18, and inherited his father's rabbinate of ≈Åom≈ºa at the age of 25. Diskin's second wife, Sarah, was known as the \\"Brisker Rebbetzin\\". She had a very strong mind, and came from a prestigious family descended from Rabbi Yechezkel Landau (the Nodah bi-Yehudah) and Joshua Zeitlin. She died in 1907. Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin had a brother, Avraham Shmuel, born 1827 in ≈Åom≈ºa, later a rabbi. The brother pre-deceased his older brother. Rabbinic career In 1878, Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin left his rabbinical position in Brest-Litovsk and moved to Palestine, where he became recognized as a leading rabbinic figure in the Ashkenazi community of Jerusalem. In the 1880s, Diskin was offered the position of Chief Rabbi of New York City, which he declined. Diskin established a yeshiva by the name of Ohel Moshe (Tent of Moses). He held the line against attempts by maskilim to introduce secular institutions to Jerusalem. His son was Rabbi Yitzhak Yerucham Diskin. Diskin Orphanage The city's large religious community was then living under near impossible conditions. The persecution and disease from which the Jews of the Holy Land suffered moved Diskin to open a home for orphans in the Old City, after bringing needy children into his own home. The Diskin Orphanage (initially known as the Diskin Orphan Home) was formally established in 1881. From the Jewish Quarter, it moved to Street of the Prophets outside the walls of the Old City. Diskin's second wife, Sarah (Sonia Rotner),p. 9 known as the Brisker Rebbetzin, brought 40,000 rubles into the marriage which was used for the support of this institution. Death and legacy Diskin died on January 23, 1898 (29 Tevet 5658). He is buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, Israel. Y.L. Diskin Street in Jerusalem is named after him.

Krafft-Ebing also coined the terms sadism and masochism in the book. The Psychopathia Sexualis is notable for being one of the earliest works on homosexuality. Krafft-Ebing combined Karl Ulrichs' Urning theory with B√©n√©dict Morel's theory of disease and concluded that most homosexuals have a mental illness caused by degenerate heredity.

An Odyssey of the Self from Kant and Hegel to Steiner, Ashgate, 2005, Metaphysics as Christology is part of a larger project in which Schickler was engaged when he died to demonstrate an organic continuity and development between Aristotelian ontology, the 'Kantian turn' and Hegelian dialectic, reaching its fulfilment in the work of Rudolf Steiner. Two other parts of the project exist in complete, albeit unpublished form, From Dialectic to Phenomenology and Aristotle: Man and Metaphysics, and may be published in the future. Other planned parts of the project for which only notes exist are: Phenomenology and Depth Psychology (which was to discuss Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein and Jung), Structural Phenomenology (an idea taken from Herbert Witzenmann), and The Recovery of Nature (which included an assessment of the prospects for a rebirth of alchemy). In Metaphysics as Christology, Schickler examines the key philosophical problems with which Kant and Hegel grappled, and finds in the work of Rudolf Steiner the essence of a solution to them; he claims that Steiner returned to Hegel's philosophical problems but was better able to solve them. Schickler uses these philosophical debates about knowledge and truth to understand the significance of Christ.Martin Wendte (2007). Review of Metaphysics as Christology. An Odyssey of the Self from Kant and Hegel to Steiner, Ars Disputandi, 7 As theologian Martin Wendte describes, Schickler's \\"general ontology, according to his philosophical thesis, implies a theological telos, resurrection.

Found in Gortyn (late 2nd century AD), now in Heraklion Archaeological Museum, Crete. Life of Apollonius of Tyana () is a text in eight books written in Ancient Greece by Philostratus (c. 170 ‚Äì c. 245 AD). It tells the story of Apollonius of Tyana (c. 15 ‚Äì c. 100 AD), a Pythagorean philosopher and teacher. Contents The book extensively describes the alleged travels of Apollonius to Italy, Hispania, Nubia, Mesopotamia and India. Some scholars view it as fiction, and contend that Apollonius probably never reached any of these countries, but spent his entire life in the East of the Roman Empire.Maria Dzielska, Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, Rome 1986, p. 51-84, 186-187. According to Philostratus, his book relies on a multiplicity of sources: * A book on the youth of Apollonius, written by Maximus of Aegae * Memoirs written by a disciple of Apollonius, Damis. * The \\"Memorabilia of Apollonius of Tyana, magician and philosopher\\", written by a Moeragenes, although Philostratus considers that account rather unreliable. * Local knowledge from towns like Ephesus, Tyana, Aegae, and Antioch. The eastward travel of Apollonius is described in Book I. Apollonius receives from the Parthian king Vardanes (40‚Äì47) a safe-conduct to the Parthian ruler Phraotes in India: > And with that, he showed them a letter, written to that effect, and this > gave them occasion to marvel afresh at the humanity and foresight of > Vardanes. For he had addressed the letter in question to the satrap of the > Indus, although he was not subject to his dominion; and in it he reminded > him of the good service he had done him, but declared that he would not ask > any recompense for the same, \\"for\\", he said, \\"it is not my habit to ask for > a return of favors.\\" But he said he would be very grateful, if he could give > a welcome to Apollonius and send him on wherever he wished to go. And he had > given gold to the guide, so that in case he found Apollonius in want > thereof, he might give it him and save him from looking to the generosity of > anyone else. ‚Äì Book II:17 Life of Apollonius Tyana II 17 The description of Apollonius's visit to India is made in Book II, and particularly the visit to the city of Taxila, described in chapters 20 to 24. He describes constructions of the Greek type in Taxila, probably referring to Sirkap: > Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly > well after the manner of Greek cities.Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20 I have > already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it > was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in > Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at > them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of > them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the > level of the earth as did the chambers above. ‚Äì Book II:23Life of Apollonius > Tyana, II 23 He also explains that the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, named Phraotes, speaks Greek fluently, a language in which he had been educated while in exile to the east, beyond the river Hyphasis: > Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and > whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place? ‚Äì Book > II:29 Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 29 > My father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age > somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they > brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek > tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of > the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves. ‚Äì Book > II:31 Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 31 Editions * Philostratus: The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, trans.

Illustration of Niva (Niva, 19th Century) Prior to the 17th century China and Russia were on opposite ends of Siberia, which was populated by independent nomads. By about 1640 Russian settlers had traversed most of Siberia and founded settlements in the Amur River basin. From 1652 to 1689, China's armies drove the Russian settlers out, but after 1689, China and Russia made peace and established trade agreements. By the mid-19th century, China's economy and military lagged far behind the colonial powers. It signed unequal treaties with Western countries and Russia, through which Russia annexed the Amur basin and Vladivostok. The Russian Empire and Western powers exacted many other concessions from China, such as indemnities for anti-Western riots, control over China's tariffs, and extraterritorial agreements including legal immunity for foreigners and foreign businesses. Meanwhile, Russian culture and society, especially the elite, were westernized. The ruler of Russia officially was no longer called tsar but emperor, an import from Western Europe. Issues that affected only Russia and China were mainly the Russian-Chinese border since Russia, unlike the Western countries, bordered China. Many Chinese people felt humiliated by China's submission to foreign interests, which contributed to widespread hostility towards the emperor of China. In 1911, public anger led to a revolution, which marked the beginning of the Republic of China. However, China's new regime, known as the Beiyang government, was forced to sign more unequal treaties with Western countries and with Russia. In recent years, Russia and China signed a border agreement. In late 1917, Moscow and Petrograd were taken over by a communist group, the Bolsheviks, during the October Revolution, which caused the Russian Civil War between the Bolshevik Red Army and the anticommunist White forces. China's Beiyang government sided with the Whites and, along with most of the West, sent troops to fight against the Reds. In 1922, the Reds won the civil war and established a new country: the Soviet Union. In 1923, the Soviets provided aid and support to the Kuomintang, a Chinese faction that had been opposed to the Beiyang government. In alliance with the small Chinese Communist Party (CCP),The CCP is officially the Communist Party of China (CPC), but CCP and CPC are interchangeable the Kuomintang seized power in 1928, and both countries established diplomatic ties. Sino-Soviet relations remained fractious, and both countries fought two wars for the next ten years. Nevertheless, the Soviets, under Joseph Stalin, helped Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang government against Imperial Japan. Stalin told the Communists' leader, Mao Zedong, to co-operate with China's Kuomintang regime, but Mao attacked the Kuomintang anyway. The communists failed to overthrow Chiang's government. In 1937, the Kuomintang and the communists formed a new alliance to oppose the Japanese invasion of China, but they resumed fighting each other in 1942. After Japan had been defeated in 1945, both Chinese factions signed a truce, but the Chinese Civil War soon erupted again between them. In 1949, with Soviet support, the communists won the Chinese Civil War and established the People's Republic of China, which made an alliance with the Soviets. Mao became the first leader of Communist China. Mao's most radical supporters, who became known as the \\"Gang of Four,\\" gradually eliminated most of his rivals throughout his 27 years in power. Ideological tension between the two countries emerged after Stalin's death in 1953. Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes in 1956, and both regimes started to criticise each other. At first, the criticism was indirect and muted, but in 1961, Mao accused the Soviet leadership of revisionism, and the alliance openly ended. Both countries competed for control over foreign communist states and political movements, and many countries had two rival communist parties that concentrated their fire on each other. In 1969, a brief border war between the two countries occurred. Khrushchev had been replaced by Leonid Brezhnev in 1964, who abandoned many Soviet reforms criticized by Mao. However, China's anti-Soviet rhetoric intensified under the influence of Mao's closest supporters, the Gang of Four. Mao died in 1976, and the Gang of Four lost power in 1978. After a period of instability, Deng Xiaoping became the new leader of China. The philosophical difference between both countries lessened somewhat since China's new leadership abandoned anti-revisionism. China's internal reforms did not bring an immediate end to conflict with the Soviet Union. In 1979, China invaded Vietnam, which was a Soviet ally. China also sent aid to the mujahedin against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1982, Brezhnev made a speech offering reconciliation with China, and Deng agreed to restore diplomatic relations. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became President of the Soviet Union, reduced the Soviet garrisons at the Sino-Soviet border and in Mongolia, resumed trade, and dropped the border issue that had caused open war 16 years earlier. In 1989, he withdrew Soviet support from the communist government of Afghanistan. Rapprochement accelerated after the Soviet Union fell and was replaced by the Russian Federation in 1991. Sino- Russian relations since 1991 are currently close and cordial. Both countries maintain a strong geopolitical and regional alliance and significant levels of trade. Imperial period Chumbalik Kingdom\\" as Russia's southeastern neighbor, which could be reached by traveling from Yugra up the Ob River toward \\"Lake Kythay\\". (Map by Giacomo Gastaldi, 1550) Lying at opposite ends of Eurasia, the two countries had little contact before about 1640.The section down to the Treaty of Nerchinsk is largely a summary of G. Patrick March, 'Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific, 1996, who in turn summarizes Mark Mancall, Russia and China: Their Diplomatic Relations to 1728,1971. Both had to deal with the steppe nomads, Russia from the south and China from the northwest. Russia became a northern neighbor of China when in 1582‚Äì1643 Russian adventurers made themselves masters of the Siberian forests. There were three points of contact: 1) south to the Amur River basin (early), 2) east along the southern edge of Siberia toward Peking (the main axis) and 3) in Turkestan (late). The Oirats transmitted some garbled and incorrect descriptions of China to the Russians in 1614, the name \\"Taibykankan\\" was used to refer to the Wanli Emperor by the Oirats. South to the Amur (1640‚Äì1689) About 1640 Siberian cossacks spilled over the Stanovoy Mountains to the Amur River basin. This land was claimed by the Manchus who at this time were just beginning their conquest of China (Qing dynasty). By 1689 the Russians were driven back over the mountains and the Stanovoy Mountains remained the Russo-Chinese frontier from the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) to the Treaty of Aigun in 1859. For a full account see Sino-Russian border conflicts.R. A. Pierce, Eastward to Empire: Exploration and Conquest on the Russian Open Frontier, to 1750 (Montreal, 1973). Russian expansion eastward along the southern edge of Siberia Russian expansion in Siberia was confined to the forested area because the Cossacks were skilled in forest travel and were seeking furs while the forest natives were weak and the steppe nomads warlike. In the west, Siberia borders on the Kazakh steppe. North of what is now Mongolia, there are mountains, Lake Baikal and more mountains until the Argun River separates Trans-Baikalia from Manchuria. West of Siberia, Russia slowly expanded down the Volga, around the southern Urals and out into the Kazakh steppe. Early contacts From the time of Kievan Rus' there was trade (fur, slaves) down the Volga to the Caspian Sea and Persia. Later trade extended southeast to the main Asian trade routes at Bukhara. Under the Mongol Yoke, Russian princes would regularly travel to Sarai for investiture. When Marco Polo returned from China he mentioned Russia as an obscure country in the far north. In 1466/73 Afanasy Nikitin made a journey southeast to India and left an interesting account. After the English reached the White Sea, Anthony Jenkinson travelled through Muscovy to Bukhara. In 1608 the Voivode of Tomsk tried and failed to reach China via the Altan Khan in western Mongolia. In 1616 a second attempt got as far as the Khan (Vasilly Tyumenets and Ivan Petrov). The first Russian to reach Peking was probably Ivan Petlin in 1618/19. After the Russians reached Trans-Baikalia in the 1640s, some trade developed, but it is poorly documented. At this point there were three routes: 1) Irtysh River and east across Dzungaria and Mongolia, 2) Lake Baikal, Selenga River and southeast (the shortest) and 3) Lake Baikal, east to Nerchinsk, and south (slow but safe). Early Russo-Chinese relations were difficult for three reasons: mutual ignorance, lack of a common language and the Chinese wish to treat the Russians as tributary barbarians, something that the Russians would not accept and did not fully understand. The language problem was solved when the Russians started sending Latin-speaking westerners who could speak to the Jesuit missionaries in Beijing. In 1654 Fyodor Baykov was sent as the first ambassador, but his mission failed because he was unwilling to comply with the rules of Chinese diplomacy. Setkul Ablin, a Central Asian in the Russian service travelled to Peking in 1655,1658 and 1668. It was apparently on his third trip that the Manchus realized that these people from the west were the same as those who were raiding the Amur. In 1670 the Nerchinsk voyvode sent Ignatiy Milovanov to Beijing (he was probably the first Russian to cross Manchuria). The next ambassador, Nicholae Milescu (1675‚Äì78) was also unsuccessful. After months of fruitless arguments, he was given a blunt lecture about the proper behavior of tributary barbarians and sent home. After the capture of Albazin in 1685, a few Russians, commonly referred to as Albazinians, settled in Beijing where they founded the Chinese Orthodox Church. Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) After their first victory at Albazin in 1685, the Manchus sent two letters to the Tsar (in Latin) suggesting peace and demanding that Russian freebooters leave the Amur. The resulting negotiations led the Treaty of Nerchinsk. The Russians gave up the Amur valley but kept the land between Lake Baikal and the Argun River. The treaty said nothing about what is now Mongolia since that area was then controlled by the Oirat Zunghar Khanate.Peter C. Perdue, \\"Boundaries and trade in the early modern world: Negotiations at Nerchinsk and Beijing.\\" Eighteenth- Century Studies 43#3 (2010): 341-356 online. After Nerchinsk regular caravans started running from Nerchinsk south to Peking. Some of the traders were Central Asians. The round trip took from ten to twelve months. The trade was apparently profitable to the Russians but less so to the Chinese. The Chinese were also disenchanted by the drunken brawls of the traders. In 1690 the Qing defeated the Oirats at the Great Wall and gained complete control over the Khalka Mongols in Inner Mongolia. In 1696 the Oirats were defeated and driven back to the Altai Mountains (Kangxi Emperor in person with 80,000 troops in a battle near Ulan Bator). This opened the possibility of trade from Baikal southeastward and raised the problem of the northern border of Outer Mongolia. In March 1692 Eberhard Isbrand Ides, a Dane in the Russian service, was sent from Nerchinsk as ambassador. The Manchus raised the question of the border west of the Argun. Ides returned to Moscow January 1695. From this time it was decided that the China trade would be a state monopoly. Four state caravans travelled from Moscow to Peking between 1697 and 1702. The fourth returned via Selenginsk (near Lake Baikal) in 90 days and bore a letter from the Li-Fan Yuan suggesting that future trade use this route. A 1720 letter from Russian officials to Kangxi's court In 1712 Tulishen became the first Manchu or Chinese official to visit Russia (not counting earlier visits to Nerchinsk). He was mainly interested in the Kalmyks along the Caspian Sea and how they might be used to deal with their cousins, the Oirats. He left Peking in June 1712 and reached Tobolsk in August 1713. Here he learned that he could not see the Tsar because of the Swedish wars. He went to Saratov and down the Volga to visit Ayuka Khan of the Kalmyks. He returned to Peking in April 1715. His report, 'Yiyilu' of 'Record of Strange Regions' was long the main source of Chinese knowledge of Russia. About this time the Kangxi Emperor began to put pressure on Saint Petersburg to delineate the Mongolian border west of the Argun, and several Russian caravans were held up. In July 1719 Lev IzmailovJohn Bell, (Travels from St Petersburg in Russia to diverse parts of Asia, Edinburgh,1808 and OCR reprint) has a record of this journey was sent as ambassador to Peking where he dealt with Tulishen, but the Chinese would not deal with the trade problem until the border was dealt with. Izmailov returned to Moscow in January 1722. Lorents Lange was left as consul in Peking, but was expelled in July 1722. He returned to Selenginsk and sent reports to Petersburg. Treaty of Kyakhta (1729) Just before his death, Peter the Great decided to deal with the border problem. The result was the Treaty of Kyakhta. This defined the northern border of what is now Mongolia (except for Tuva) and opened up the Kyakhta caravan trade southeast to Peking. The needs for communication between the Russian and Chinese traders at Kyakhta and elsewhere resulted in the development of a pidgin, known to linguists as Kyakhta Russian-Chinese Pidgin. The treaties of Nerchinsk and Kyakhta were the basis of Russo-Chinese relations until the Treaty of Aigun in 1858. The fixed border helped the Chinese to gain full control of Outer Mongolia and annex Xinjiang by about 1755. Russo-Chinese trade shifted from Nerchinsk to Kyakhta and the Nerchensk trade died out by about 1750. (Local trade in this area shifted east to a border town called Tsurukhaitu on the Argun River).Peter C. Perdue, \\"Boundaries and trade in the early modern world: Negotiations at Nerchinsk and Beijing.\\" Eighteenth-Century Studies (2010): 341-356. Turkestan After the Russians reached Tobolsk in 1585, it was natural to continue up the Irtysh River to the Kazakh steppes north of Lake Balkhash to Dzungaria and western Mongolia, which was the route used by Fyodor Baykov to reach China. In 1714, Peter the Great sent Ivan Bukholts with 1,500 troops, including Swedish miners who were prisoners of war, up the Irtysh to Lake Zaysan to search for gold. The next year, he ascended the river again with 3,000 workers to build a fort. Tsewang Rabtan (or Tseren-Donduk) of the Zunghar Khanate attacked them and drove them back to Omsk. In 1720, an expedition, under Ivan Likharev, ascended the river and founded a permanent settlement at Ust-Kamenogorsk just west of the lake. Meanwhile, the Zunghars were severely defeated by the Manchus and driven out of Tibet. In 1721 to 1723, Peter sent Ivan Unkovsky to attempt to discuss an alliance. A major reason for the failure was that Lorents Lange at Selenginsk had turned over a number of Mongol refugees to the Manchus as part of the buildup to the Treaty of Kyakhta. In 1755, the Qing destroyed the remnants of the Zunghar Khanate, creating a Russo-Chinese border in Xinjiang. The area did not become active again until the Russian conquest of Turkestan.Nicholas Vakar, \\"The Annexation of Chinese Turkestan.\\" Slavonic and East European Review 14.40 (1935): 118-123. 1755‚Äì1917Meeting in Central Asia As the Chinese Empire established its control over Xinjiang in the 1750s, and the Russian Empire expanded into Kazakhstan at the beginning and in the middle of the 19th century, the two empires' areas of control met in what is today eastern Kazakhstan and Western Xinjiang. The 1851 Treaty of Kulja legalized trade between both countries in the region. Russian encroachment In 1858, during the Second Opium War, China grew increasingly weaker as the \\"Sick man of Asia\\" while Russia strengthened and eventually annexed the north bank of the Amur River and the coast down to the Korean border in the \\"Unequal Treaties\\" of Treaty of Aigun (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860). Russia and Japan gained control of Sakhalin Island. The Manza War (1868) was the first attempt by Russia to expel the Chinese from the territory that it controlled.Sergey Glebov, \\"Between Foreigners and Subjects: Imperial Subjecthood, Governance, and the Chinese in the Russian Far East, 1860s‚Äì1880s.\\" Ab imperio 2017.1 (2017): 86-130 online. Hostilities broke out around Peter the Great Gulf, Vladivostok, when the Russians tried to shut off gold mining operations and to expel Chinese workers there. The Chinese resisted a Russian attempt to take Askold Island and in response, two Russian military stations and three Russian towns were attacked by the Chinese, and the Russians failed to oust the Chinese. =Russia's special status= Unlike other Western countries, who deal with the Qing court on a monarch to monarch basis, Sino-Russian relations were governed by administrative bodies, the Qing's Board of Foreign Affairs (Lifan Yuan) and the Russian Senate (Senat). Unlike the Netherlands and Russia in the 18th century, who were considered part of the tribute system, Russia was able to trade directly with Beijing, and their relations were under the jurisdiction of Mongolian and Manchu border officials. Russia established an Orthodox mission in Beijing in the early 18th century, and was able to escape the anti Christian persecutions of the Qing dynasty. The Great Game and the 1870s Xinjiang border Dispute A British observer, Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger, suggested a British-Chinese alliance to check Russian expansion in Central Asia. During the Ili crisis, when Qing China threatened to go to war against Russia over the Russian occupation of Ili, a British officer, Charles George Gordon, was sent to China by Britain to advise China on its military options against Russia in a potential war between China and Russia. The Russians occupied the city of Kuldja, in Xinjiang, during the Dungan revolt (1862‚Äì1877). After General Zuo Zongtang and his Xiang Army crushed the rebels, they demanded for Russia to return the occupied regions. General Zuo Zongtang was outspoken in calling for war against Russia and hoped to settle the matter by attacking Russian forces in Xinjiang with his Xiang army. In 1878, tension increased in Xinjiang, and Zuo massed Chinese troops toward Russian-occupied Kuldja. Chinese forces also fired on Russian expeditionary forces originating from Yart Vernaic, expelled them, and caused a Russian retreat. The Russians observed that the Chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the Ili crisis since they had bought thousands of rifles from Germany. In 1880, massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe. A Russian military observer, D. V. Putiatia, visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China (Manchuria), along the Chinese-Russian border, the Chinese soldiers could become adept at \\"European tactics\\" under certain circumstances and were armed with modern weapons, like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles. Compared to the Russian-controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz in the Chinese-controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that a war would have China defeat Russia. The Qing dynasty forced Russia to hand over disputed territory in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881) in what was widely seen by the west as a diplomatic victory for the Qing. Russia acknowledged that China could pose a serious military threat. Mass media in the West was portraying portrayed China as a rising military power because of its modernization programs and as a major threat to the West. They even invoked fears that China would manage to conquer western colonies like Australia. Russian sinologists, the Russian media, the threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, and the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in Saint Petersburg and to return most of Ili to China. Historians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness although it achieved military success against Westerners on land. Historian Edward L. Dreyer stated, \\"China's nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go.... In the Arrow War (1856‚Äì60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884‚Äì85). But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.\\" According to Henry Hugh Peter Deasy in 1901 on the people of Xinjiang: \\"insurrection is about the last course to which the natives would of their own accord resort. Any riots and disturbances which occur are got up by the officials for the purpose of inflicting injury on foreigners. The population have no fighting courage, no arms, no leaders, are totally incapable of combined action, and, so far as the government of their own country is concerned. may be regarded as of no account. They have been squeezed to the utmost, but would prefer to remain under the dominion of China. If they are questioned, they say 'The Chinese plunder us, but they do not drive and hustle us, and we can do as we please.' This opinion agrees with that of the Andijanis, or natives of Russian Turkestan, who assert that Russian rule is much disliked among them, owing to the harassing administration to which they are subjected.\\" Deasy 1901, pp. 356‚Äì357. 1890s alliance Russian Finance Minister Sergei Witte controlled East Asian policy in the 1890s.Andrew Malozemoff, Russian Far Eastern Policy, 1881‚Äì1904 (U of California Press, 1958) His goal was the peaceful expansion of trade and the increase of Russian influence over China. Japan's greatly-expanded and -modernized military easily defeated the antiquated Chinese forces in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895). Russia now faced the choice of working with Japan, which had fairly good relations for some years, or acting as protector of China against Japan. Witte chose the latter policy, and in 1894 Russia joined Britain and France in forcing Japan to soften the peace terms that it had imposed on China. Japan was forced to return the Liaodong Peninsula and Port Arthur (both territories in southeastern Manchuria, a Chinese province) to China. The new Russian role angered Tokyo, which decided that Russia was the main enemy in its quest to control Manchuria, Korea, and China. Witte underestimated Japan's growing economic and military power and exaggerated Russia's military prowess.B. V. Ananich and S. A. Lebedev, \\"Sergei Witte and the Russo-Japanese War.\\" International Journal of Korean History 7.1 (2005): 109‚Äì131. Online Russia concluded an alliance with China in 1896 by the Li‚ÄìLobanov Treaty, with China a junior partner and practically a protectorate.S. E. O. K. Huajeong, \\"International Rivalry in Korea and Russia‚Äôs East Asian Policy in the Late Nineteenth Century.\\" Korea journal 50.3 (2010): 176‚Äì201. online It led in 1898 to an occupation and administration by Russian personnel and police of the entire Liaodong Peninsula and to a fortification of the ice-free Port Arthur. Since Russia was receiving large- loans from France, Witte used some of the funds to establish the Russo-Chinese Bank, which provided 100 million rubles for China to fund the reparations that it owed to Japan. Along with the International Commercial Bank of St- Petersburg, it became the conduit through which Russian capital was funneled into East Asia. Furthermore, the Russo-Chinese Bank bankrolled the Russian government's policies towards Manchuria and Korea. That enormous leverage allowed Russia to make strategic leases of key military ports and defense stations.Ananich and Lebedev, \\"Sergei Witte\\" pp 109‚Äì131. The Chinese government ceded its concession rights for building and owning the new Chinese Eastern Railway, which was to cross northern Manchuria from the west to the east, to link Siberia with Vladivostok, and strengthen the military capabilities of the Russian forces in the Far East greatly. It was built in 1898 to 1903 and operated by the Russo-Chinese Bank and allowed Russia to become economically dominant in Manchuria, which was still nominally controlled by Peking.Henry B. Miller, \\"Russian Development of Manchuria.\\" National Geographic Magazine 15 (1904): 113+. online In 1899, the Boxer Rebellion broke out with Chinese nativist attacks on all foreigners. A large coalition of eleven major Western powers, led by Russia and Japan, sent an army to relieve their diplomatic missions in Peking and to take control of the Chinese capital.Alena N. Eskridge-Kosmach, \\"Russia in the Boxer Rebellion.\\" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 21.1 (2008): 38‚Äì52. The Russian government used it as an opportunity to bring a substantial army into Manchuria, which became a fully-incorporated outpost of Russia in 1900. Japan started to prepare for a war with Russia over Korea and Manchuria.Ananich and Lebedev, \\"Sergei Witte\\" pp 109‚Äì131. Russo-Japanese War Chinese Honghuzi bandits were nomads who came from China, roamed the area around Manchuria and the Russo-Chinese border, and raided Russian settlers in the Far East from 1870 to 1920. Revolutions Both countries saw their monarchies abolished during the 1910s, the Chinese Qing dynasty in 1912, following the Xinhai Revolution, and the Russian Romanov dynasty in 1917, following the February Revolution. Soviet Union, Republic of China, People's Republic of China=Russian Civil War and Mongolia The Beiyang government, in Northern China, joined the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. It sent 2,300 troops in Siberia and North Russia in 1918 after the request by the Chinese community in the area. Mongolia and Tuva became contested territories. After being occupied by Chinese General Xu Shuzheng in 1919 and then by the Russian White general turned independent warlord, Ungern von Sternberg, in 1920, Soviet troops, with the support of Mongolian guerrillas, led by Damdin S√ºkhbaatar, defeated the White warlord and established a new pro-Soviet Mongolian client state. By 1924, it had become the Mongolian People's Republic. KMT, CCP, and the Chinese Civil War Soviet Foreign Minister Georgy Chicherin played a major role in establishing formal relations with China in 1924, and in designing the Kremlin's China policy. He focused on the Chinese Eastern Railway, Manchuria, and the Mongolian issue.Anastasiya Kartunova, \\"Georgy Chicherin's Role in the Chinese Policy of Soviet Russia.\\" Far Eastern Affairs (2014) 42#4 pp 92‚Äì119.Louis Fischer, Russia's Road from Peace to War: Soviet Foreign Relations 1917-1941 (1969) pp 67‚Äì74Tianfang Cheng, A history of Sino-Russian relations (1957)pp 114‚Äì116. In 1921, the Soviet Union began supporting the Kuomintang, and in 1923, the Comintern instructed the Communist Party of China to sign a military treaty with the KMT. But in 1926, KMT leader, Chiang Kai- shek abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers, and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By 1927, when the Northern Expedition was nearly concluded, Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance, resulting in the Chinese Civil War which was to last until 1950, a few months after the People's Republic of China, led by Mao Zedong, was proclaimed. During the war, some Soviet support was given to the CCP, who in 1934 were dealt a crushing blow when the KMT brought an end to the Chinese Soviet Republic, beginning the CCP's Long March to Shaanxi. Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II Soviet aviators in Wuhan In 1931, the Empire of Japan invaded Manchuria and created the puppet state of Manchukuo (1932), which signalled the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1937, a month after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Soviet Union established a non-aggression pact with the Republic of China. During the World War II-period, the two countries suffered more losses than any other country, with China (in the Second Sino-Japanese war) losing over 35 million and the Soviet Union 27 million people. Joint- victory over Imperial Japan On August 8, 1945, three months after Nazi Germany surrendered, and on the week of the American Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (August 6 and 9), the Soviet Union launched the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, a massive military operation mobilizing 1.5 million soldiers against one million Kwantung Army troops, the last remaining Japanese military presence. Soviet forces won a decisive victory while the Kwantung suffered massive casualties, with 700,000 having surrendered. The Soviet Union distributed some of the weapons of the captured Kwantung Army to the CCP, who would go on to battle the KMT in the Chinese Civil War. Independence of Mongolia The China, Soviet Union: Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed by the Soviet Union and the Republic of China. It stated that possible Mongolian independence was in exchange for the Soviets' failure to support the communists in China. War of Liberation and the People's Republic of China Between 1946 and 1950, the CCP was increasingly enjoying massive support from the Chinese people in the \\"War of Liberation\\" and effectively implemented a people's war, but the KMT became increasingly isolated and only belatedly attempted to stem corruption and to introduce popular reforms. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed by Mao Zedong, and by May 1950, the civil war was brought to an end by the Battle of Kuningtou, which saw the KMT expelled from Mainland China but remaining in control of Taiwan. With the creation of the People's Republic of China, the supreme political authority in the two countries became centered in two communist parties, which both espoused revolutionary Marxist-Leninist ideology: the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1951, Chinese Muslim General Bai Chongxi made a speech in Taiwan to the entire Muslim world that called for a war against the Soviets and the avoiding of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was accused of being blind to Soviet imperialism. From camaraderie to the Sino-Soviet Split After the PRC was proclaimed, the Soviet Union became its closest ally for several years. Soviet design, equipment, and skilled labour were sent out to help the Industrialization and the modernization of the PRC. In the 1960s, relations became deeply strained by the Sino-Soviet Split. In military terms, there was the low-level Sino-Soviet border conflict. The split was ideological and forced communist parties around the world to take sides. Many of them split, and the pro-Soviet communists were battling the pro-Chinese communists for local control of global communis. The split quickly made a dead letter of the 1950 alliance between Moscow and Beijing, destroyed the socialist camp's unity, and affected the world balance of power. Internally, it encouraged Mao to plunge China into the Cultural Revolution to expunge traces of Soviet ways of thinking. The quarrel began in 1958, after several years of close relations. Mao was always loyal to Stalin, and Nikita Khrushchev felt insulted. However, when the Warsaw Pact crushed the dissident movements in Eastern Europe in 1956, Beijing was pleased that Moscow had apparently realized the dangers of de-Stalinization and would no longer tolerate independence or encourage revisionism. Beijing was also pleased that the success of the Soviet Union in the space race (the original Sputniks) demonstrated that the international communist movement had caught up in high technology with the West. Mao argued that as far as all-out nuclear war was concerned, the human race would not be destroyed, but a brave new communist world would arise from the ashes of imperialism. That attitude troubled Moscow, which had a more realistic view of the utter disasters that would accompany a nuclear war. Three major issues suddenly became critical in dividing the two nations: Taiwan, India, and China's Great Leap Forward. Although Moscow supported Beijing's position of Taiwan entirely belonging to China, it demanded ro be forewarned of any invasion or serious threat that would bring an American intervention. Beijing refused, and the Chinese bombardment of the island of Quemoy in August 1958 escalated the tensions. Moscow was cultivating India, both as a major purchaser of munitions and as a strategically-critical ally. However China escalated its threats to the northern fringes of India, especially from Tibet, and was building a militarily significant road system that would reach disputed areas along the border. Moscow clearly favored India, and Beijing felt betrayed as a result. By far, the major ideological issue was the Great Leap Forward, which represented the Chinese rejection of the Soviet form of economic development. The Soviets were deeply resentful, especially since they had spent heavily to supply China with cutting-edge technology, even including some nuclear tech. The Soviets withdrew their vital technicians and economic and military aid. Khrushchev was increasingly crude and intemperate in ridiculing China and Mao to both communist and noncommunist audiences. China responded through its official propaganda network of rejecting Moscow's claim to Lenin's heritage. Beijing insisted that it was the true inheritor of the great Leninist tradition. At one major meeting of communist parties, Khrushchev personally attacked Mao as an ultraleftist and a left revisionist and compared him to Stalin for dangerous egotism. The conflict was now out of control and was increasingly fought out in 81 communist parties around the world. The final split came in July 1963, after 50,000 refugees escaped from Sinkiang, in Western China, to Soviet territory to escape persecution. China ridiculed the Soviet incompetence in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as adventurism and capitulationism that ended up in defeat. Moscow was increasingly prioriti,ing friendly relationships and test ban treaties with the United States and the United Kingdom.Richard Evans, Deng Xiaoping and the making of modern China (1997) pp 155‚Äì161. William Taubman, Khrushchev: the man and his era (2003) pp 389‚Äì395.Donald S. Zagoria, The Sino-Soviet Conflict, 1956-1961 (Princeton UP, 1962).Gordon H. Chang, Friends and enemies : the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, 1948-1972 (1990) online Increasingly, China began to consider the Soviet Union, which it viewed as social imperialist, as the greatest threat it faced, more so than even the leading capitalist power, the United States. In turn, overtures were made between the PRC and the US, such as in the Ping Pong Diplomacy and the 1972 Nixon visit to China. From 1965 to 1988, the Sino-Soviet border, including the Tumen River area, became highly militarized and fortified. That included a large concentration of tactical nuclear-armed missile sites on both sides of the zone. Until 1991, foreigners, consulates and nonresidents had not been permitted in Vladivostok since 1948 or in Yanbian or the border areas of Heilongjiang Province since 1965. Political, social, and economic conditions deteriorated further, as the Cultural Revolution disrupted Chinese life and institutions from 1966 to 1972. Periods of extreme tension in 1968 to 1970 along the eastern Sino-Soviet border (with Primorsky) resulted in border skirmishes on the Ussuri River in 1969 and again from 1979 to 1980, when Vietnam invaded Cambodia, and China retaliated with a border war with Vietnam. The skirmishes led to the intensification of border fortifications and the mobilization of the civilian populations on both sides.The Tumern River area development program, 1990‚Äì2000: In search of a model for regional economic cooperation in Northeast Asia Chinese Muslims say that the Soviet Union was worse in its treatment of Islam than China was during the \\"ten black years\\" of the Cultural Revolution. Post-Mao era and stabilizing relations In September 1976, Mao died. A month later, the Gang of Four were overthrown by his successor, Chairman Hua Guofeng, with the support of Deng Xiaoping, who was to soon implement pro- market economic reform. With the PRC no longer espousing the anti-revisionist notion of the antagonistic contradiction between classes, relations between the two countries became gradually normalized. In 1979, however, the PRC launched the Sino-Vietnamese War. The invasion of Vietnam, a Soviet ally, was in response to Vietnam's invasion and subsequent occupation of Cambodia, which overthrew the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge from power. Even though Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev went on to criticize the post-Maoist CCP for allowing PRC millionaires to have lost the socialist path, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, Russia itself turned to privatization. Dissolution of the Soviet Union Unlike in the PRC, a much more extreme, highly -unregulated form of privatization occurred during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin, which resulted in asset grabs by Russians in a highly unregulated fashion and in deep socio-economic inequalities in Russia and the collapse of the economy as well as various Russian institutions. Thus, after the Cold War, the PRC emerged in a far more favourable and stable financial position. The PRC is currently seeing the fastest rate of economic growth of any large economy, several percentage points higher than Russia, which has been growing at an annualized rate of some 5‚Äì6%. The economy of Russia in the early 2000s was largely driven by demand for export of natural resources to Europe and Asia, with a gradual move up the value-added chain as Russian aluminum and steel mills upgrade to international standards. China is the growth market, and with the ESPO pipeline, Russia will continue to diversify energy exports away from Europe and towards Asia. China and the Russian Federation China and Russia have generally had good relations since 1991.

He is noted for his memoirs of World War II (including his time as a prisoner-of-war), and for a major work on James Cook's Endeavour voyage. Early life Parkin was born in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood on 6 November 1910, the youngest of three children. An early interest in ships saw him join the sea scouts. He also became interested in art and drawing (especially the drawing of ships), and after leaving school at age 14, he took a job at an engraving firm. In 1928, aged 18, he joined the Royal Australian Navy. He rose through the ranks of the navy to become a chief petty officer and, in 1939, he was drafted onto the newly commissioned light cruiser HMAS Perth. Its first peace-time mission was a voyage to New York to represent Australia at the World's Fair, after which the vessel saw service in World War II. World War II Parkin began writing during his war service. He started a novel, which was lost when Perth was sunk by Japanese action in the Sunda Strait in the early hours of 1 March 1942. After about 11 hours in the water, Parkin and nine other survivors washed up on a small island. They found a steel lifeboat and rigged a sail and tried to get back to Australia. For 16 days they managed to slip past enemy shipping and endured tropical storms before reaching occupied Tjilatjap where they were captured by Japanese troops. In June 1942, Parkin was imprisoned in Bandoeng camp. There he met Dutch soldier and author Laurens van der Post and they became friends. Among other prisoners with an interest in art was Dutch artist Keis von Willigen, and together they would source paper from wherever they could. Van der Post managed to get Parkin a set of watercolour paints from a Chinese contact and with these he would create portraits of fellow prisoners. In November 1942, Parkin was among the \\"Dunlop 1,000\\", a group of prisoners under the authority of Australian army surgeon Lieutenant Colonel \\"Weary\\" Dunlop who were sent to work on the infamous Burma-Thailand Railway. Despite the hardship, Parkin continued to draw, focusing on the beauty that could be found: plants, butterflies, nature generally. Others, like English-born artist Jack Chalker, recorded the horrors of the camps. In March 1944, Parkin was among a group of prisoners selected to be shipped to Japan. He couldn't keep his collection of drawings and diary notes concealed on that trip, so Dunlop offered to look after them for him. Dunlop had a false bottom in his operating table, where he could hide things like Chalker's medical drawings and Parkin's papers. Parkin ended up working in an underground coal mine near the Japanese village of Ohama and remained there until the Japanese surrender in August 1945. Post war experience Back in Melbourne and reunited with his wife and children, he went to work as a tally clerk on the wharves. Weary Dunlop had kept his drawings, and Parkin made them into a little volume dedicated to Dunlop. Some of the sketches were printed in Dunlop's published diaries about the camps. Parkin too wrote about his experiences as a prisoner-of-war. His memoirs he wrote in novel form; the character of John (or Jack) is Parkin in all but name. Sir Laurens van der Post recommended them to the Hogarth Press in London, and these were published as Out of the Smoke (1960) Into the Smother (1963), and The Sword and the Blossom (1968). The books were praised for the simple and direct quality of the writing. He continued to work on the Melbourne waterfront till retirement in 1975. H. M. Bark Endeavour In 1967, Parkin started researching James Cook's voyage to Australia aboard HM Bark Endeavour. He was first inspired by an inaccurate picture of the ship when searching for a representation on which to base a Christmas card. Over the years he discovered and dispelled several misconceptions built up about Cook, his crew, and the ship, including rehabilitating the reputation of Sydney Parkinson's drawings of the ship. Parkinson was a draftsman on the voyage and his sketches are the only surviving contemporaneous drawings of the ship, but the received wisdom among historians was that Parkinson had taken artistic license, since the drawings seemed inexact and differed from Admiralty plans. Parkin's detailed knowledge of the ship and seafaring showed that what had been thought just squiggles were actual equipment on the ship, and where the sketches and the plans differed it was almost certainly from variations during building (it being fairly common at the time for shipwrights to have some freedom in how plans were executed). Some of Parkins research was done in London. Parkin's neighbour, history professor Max Crawford, encouraged him to continue the research and publish the results. The research took 13 years, and it then took a further 17 years to find a publisher. In the end John Clarke (best known as a satirist) showed it to publisher Mark Kelly, who in turn recommended it to the speciality academic imprint The Miegunyah Press at the Melbourne University Press. The result was H. M. Bark Endeavour published in two volumes in 1997. It won the Douglas Stewart Prize for non- fiction and the NSW Book of the Year in the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards for 1999.Past winners Premier's Literary Awards, at the New South Wales Ministry for the Arts Parkin thought himself a little out of place at the awards ceremony, as he put it, \\"It was funny, though, this doddering old bloke who used to work on the wharves-what did I have in common with the intellectual literary crowd?\\".An interview with Ray Parkin by Murray Waldren, after the Premier's Literary Awards Parkin died in Melbourne on 19 June 2005. He was survived by his three children, six grand-children and eight great- grandchildren. In 2005, Parkin's three wartime memoirs were republished in a single paperback volume by Melbourne University Publishing. The volume was reviewed by critic Max Harris who described it as, ‚Äúprobably the finest POW writing in English.‚ÄùOn a POW‚Äôs survival, mup.com.au, retrieved 24 October 2019 A biography of Parkin, Ray Parkin's Odyssey, by Pattie Wright, was published in 2012.Ray Parkin‚Äôs Odyssey, panmacmillon.com.au retrieved 24 October 2019 Bibliography * Out of the Smoke * Into the Smother * The Sword and the Blossom * H.

Biography Jackson was born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, the son of a railway fettler. He was educated at Harefield Public School and Junee, and Sutherland High Schools. He became a rail employee, professional boxer and printer. He married his wife, Irene, in 1949. Jackson was the member for Bulli from 1955 to 1971, and the member for Heathcote from 1971 to 1986, representing the Labor Party. He was Minister for Youth and Community Services from May 1976 to October 1981 and then Minister for Corrective Services from October 1981 to October 1983. He was also Minister for Roads from February to October 1983. Jackson resigned his ministerial portfolios on 27 October 1983 and from parliament on 13 August 1986. He was charged with corruption and sent to trial in 1987. The District Court found that Jackson accepted a bribe of 12,000 in 1983 and that he conspired to organise the early release of three prisoners from Broken Hill Correctional Centre to meet gambling debts. He was initially sentenced to serve seven and a half years in custody (with three years without parole). However, in 1988 The Crown appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the leniency of the sentence. Jackson was subsequently sent to prison for ten years, with a non-parole period of five years,R v Jackson (1988) 33 A Crim R 413, Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW). . serving time at Berrima Correctional Centre. Following his early release from prison in November 1990, after serving three years and two months of his 10-year term, he returned to his Helensburgh home and was welcomed back by many in his community. For some years, Jackson operated an ice cream van with business partner Col Alexander, called \\"Col and Rex's Hot Dogs and Ice Cream\\" which regularly parked at the top of Bald Hill, a popular hang-gliding spot in Stanwell Tops, south of Sydney. Jackson's wife Irene suffered from arthritis and diabetes, and had a stroke just six weeks after his homecoming. She was hospitalised and then placed in a nursing home, dying in early 1993. Jackson died on 31 December 2011, aged 83. Minister for Youth and Community Services From May 1976 to October 1981, Jackson held the post of Minister of Youth and Community Services (DoYCS).

It opened as an open-air shopping center in 1954, and was converted to an enclosed mall in 1975. The mall underwent a rapid decline in the 21st century. In under a year it went from 52 to 7 stores, and at the time of its closure in March 2020, it had only five tenants and no anchor tenants. History ShoppingTown opened in 1954 as one of Syracuse's first suburban open-air shopping centers. Early tenants included Dey Brothers department store, The Addis Company (later merged into Addis and Dey's), Woolworth, W.T. Grant, and a Kallet movie theater. A Grand Union supermarket was added on the eastern end. Television station WNYS-TV opened its first studios in the basement of ShoppingTown when it began broadcasting in 1962. The studio caught fire in April 1967. The call letters were changed to WIXT-TV in 1978, and the station moved from ShoppingTown to new studios on nearby Bridge Street in East Syracuse in 1985. After expanding several times in the 1960s, ShoppingTown was converted to an enclosed shopping mall in 1975, and was substantially remodeled in 1991. The mall was owned by Macerich, which acquired it from Wilmorite Properties in 2005, but was sold in 2011 to Jones Lang LaSalle. Macerich continued to manage the mall until 2012, when the new owners took over for management. In 2014, MoonBeam Capital Investments bought the mall for 13.6 million. In 2010 CNY Gymnastics'opened. This was part of a trend in which local businesses and community groups filled some of the space created by the loss of national retail tenants. The mall lost three of its four anchor tenants. Macy's was the first anchor tenant to go, closing for good in March 2015. Dick's Sporting Goods closed permanently in October 2015 and moved to its new location down the road. JCPenney threw in the towel, leaving ShoppingTown Mall and closing permanently in April 8th, 2016. In February 2015, Moonbeam Capital Investments proposed plans to demolish the Sears wing and turn it into a strip mall. This has been halted indefinitely because of a tax dispute. As of 2017, future plans include repurposing facilities to include office, healthcare, and education tenants. Decline and closure As of April 2018, the mall only had about 50 stores and services left in the mall, and 2/5 of the tenants shown are considered services or studio tenants, rather than stores. The food court is also now abandoned after its last tenant, Ming Wok, closed in January 2018. Sears closed at ShoppingTown Mall in September 2, 2018 and this left the mall anchorless. On June 24, 2019, the mall's owner, Moonbeam Capital Investments, went into default after failure to paying back $9.7 million in taxes. Onondaga County, New York is now attempting to seize the mall. The owners have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, delaying the foreclosure process. The mall closed in mid-March 2020 along with all others in the state as a result of stay-at-home orders issued during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York and never reopened when malls were permitted to reopen in July. On September 23, 2020, the mall's ownership served all of its remaining tenants with eviction notices, ordering them to remove their property from the premises within 30 days.

Hickerson was a six-time Pro Bowler from 1965 to 1970. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 4, 2007. Biography=Collegiate career Hickerson was born in Trenton, Tennessee located in Gibson County, but played fullback at Trezevant High School in neighboring Carroll County. Hickerson became a tackle at Ole Miss. He was considered one of the best offensive linemen in Southeastern Conference history at the end of his collegiate career. Professional career Gene was drafted in the seventh round of the 1957 NFL Draft by the Browns. He was promptly shifted to the guard position on the offensive line in 1958 to better utilize his speed. He was used as a \\"messenger\\" guard by Coach Paul Brown, or a guard that delivered the plays in the huddle, while blocking for Hall of Famers Jim Brown, Bobby Mitchell, and Leroy Kelly. But after three seasons in the league, he broke his leg in 1961 and fractured the leg again later in the season while watching a game from the sidelines. After missing two games in 1962, he recovered from the injury and never missed another game in his professional tenure. Hickerson only earned accolades after Jim Brown had retired and he was blocking for Leroy Kelly, but he earned first-team all-NFL honors five straight seasons from 1966 to 1970 and was voted to six consecutive Pro Bowls from 1966 to 1971. During his career, Hickerson's Browns never experienced a losing season and was a starter in four NFL title games, including a 1964 NFL Championship win over the Baltimore Colts 27‚Äì0. During Gene's 10 pro seasons, the Browns featured a 1,000-yard rusher every season but one in the era where the NFL season consisted of 14 games. They also had the NFL's leading rusher seven seasons of those ten. He was elected to the Browns' legends team and the NFL 1960s All-Decade Team. In 2007, during his induction at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, and already suffering from the health problems that plagued the final years of his life, including dementia, Hickerson was brought onstage in his wheelchair, propelled by Bobby Mitchell, Jim Brown, and Leroy Kelly. It was announced as \\"one last time, Gene Hickerson leads Bobby Mitchell, Jim Brown, and Leroy Kelly.\\" He was inducted by his friend and former teammate at The University of Mississippi and the Cleveland Browns, Bobby Franklin.

It is commonly used in clothing and upholstery to gather a wide piece of fabric to a narrower circumference.Picken, Mary Brooks, The Fashion Dictionary, Funk and Wagnalls, 1957, pp. 256‚Äì257 Pleats are categorized as pressed, that is, ironed or otherwise heat-set into a sharp crease, or unpressed, falling in soft rounded folds. Pleats sewn into place are called tucks. Types=Accordion Knife pleat Accordion pleats or knife pleats are a form of tight pleating which allows the garment to expand its shape when moving. Accordion pleating is also used for some dress sleeves, such as pleating the end of the elbow, with the fullness of the pleat gathered closely at the cuff. This form of pleating inspired the \\"skirt dancing\\" of Loie Fuller. Accordion pleats may also be used in hand fans. Box Box pleatsDouble box pleats Box pleats are knife pleats back-to-back, and have a tendency to spring out from the waistline.Picken, Mary Brooks, The Fashion Dictionary, p. 257 They have the same 3:1 ratio as knife pleats, and may also be stacked to form \\"stacked-\\" or \\"double-box pleats\\". These stacked box pleats create more fullness and have a 5:1 ratio. They also create a bulkier seam. Inverted box pleats have the \\"box\\" on the inside rather than the outside. Cartridge Cartridge pleats Cartridge pleats are used to gather a large amount of fabric into a small waistband or armscye without adding bulk to the seam. This type of pleating also allows the fabric of the skirt or sleeve to spring out from the seam. During the 15th and 16th centuries, this form of pleating was popular in the garments of men and women. Fabric is evenly gathered using two or more lengths of basting stitches, and the top of each pleat is whipstitched onto the waistband or armscye. Cartridge pleating was resurrected in 1840s fashion to attach the increasingly full bell-shaped skirts to the fashionable narrow waist.Tozer, Jane and Sarah Levitt, Fabric of Society: A Century of People and their Clothes 1770‚Äì1870, Laura Ashley PressArnold, Janet: Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560‚Äì1620, Macmillan 1985Arnold, Janet: Patterns of Fashion 1 (cut and construction of women's clothing, 1660‚Äì1860), Wace 1964, Macmillan 1972. Fluted Fluted pleats or \\"flutings\\" are very small, rounded or pressed pleats used as trimmings.Caulfield and Saward, The Dictionary of Needlework, p. 212 The name comes from their resemblance to a pan flute. Fortuny Fortuny pleats are crisp pleats set in silk fabrics by designer Mariano Fortuny in the early 20th century, using a secret pleat-setting process which is still not understood. Honeycomb Honeycomb pleats are narrow, rolled pleats used as a foundation for smocking. Kick Kick pleats are short pleats leading upwards from the bottom hem of garments such as skirts or coats, usually at the back. They allow the garment to drape straight down when stationary while also allowing freedom of movement. Kingussie Kingussie pleats Kingussie pleats, named after the town in Scotland, are a very rarely seen type of pleat used in some Scottish kilts. They consist of a single centrally located box pleat in the rear of the kilt with knife pleats fanning out on either side. Knife Knife pleats are used for basic gathering purposes, and form a smooth line rather than springing away from the seam they have been gathered to. The pleats have a 3:1 ratio‚Äìthree inches of fabric will create one inch of finished pleat. Knife pleats can be recognized by the way that they overlap in the seam. Organ Organ pleats are parallel rows of softly rounded pleats resembling the pipes of a pipe organ. Carl K√∂hlerK√∂hler, Carl: A History of Costume, Dover Publications reprint, 1963 suggests that these are made by inserting one or more gores into a panel of fabric. Pliss√© Pliss√© pleats are narrow pleats made by gathering fabric with stitches, wetting the fabric, and \\"setting\\" the pleats by allowing the wet fabric to dry under weight or tension. Linen chemises or smocks pleated with this technique have been found in the 10th century Viking graves in Birka.Owen-Crocker, Gale R., Dress in Anglo-Saxon Englandrevised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, , p. 42, 218 Rolled Rolled pleats create tubular pleats which run the length of the fabric from top to bottom. A piece of the fabric to be pleated is pinched and then rolled until it is flat against the rest of the fabric, forming a tube. A variation on the rolled pleat is the stacked pleat, which is rolled similarly and requires at least five inches of fabric per finished pleat. Both types of pleating create a bulky seam. Watteau Watteau pleats are one or two box pleats found at the back neckline of 18th century sack-back gowns and some late 19th century tea gowns in imitation of these. The term is not contemporary, but is used by costume historians in reference to these styles as portrayed in the paintings of Antoine Watteau.Picken, Mary Brooks, The Fashion Dictionary, pp. 257, 370 File:Knife pleat.jpgThe knife pleat is the basic pleat used in sewing. File:Pleats with seam.jpgKnife pleats with the construction and seam stitches shown. File:Box pleats 1.jpgBox pleats for a skirt. Modern usage Clothing features pleats for practical reasons (to provide freedom of movement to the wearer) as well as for purely stylistic reasons. Shirts, blouses, jackets Shirts and blouses typically have pleats on the back to provide freedom of movement and on the arm where the sleeve tapers to meet the cuff. The standard men's shirt has a box pleat in the center of the back just below the shoulder or alternately one simple pleat on each side of the back. Jackets designed for active outdoor wear frequently have pleats (usually inverted box pleats) to allow for freedom of movement. Norfolk jackets have double-ended inverted box pleats at the chest and back. Skirts and kilts plaid skirt. Skirts, dresses and kilts can include pleats of various sorts to add fullness from the waist or hips, or at the hem, to allow freedom of movement or achieve design effects. *One or more kick pleats may be set near the hem of a straight skirt to allow the wearer to walk comfortably while preserving the narrow style line. *Modern kilts may be made with either box pleats or knife pleats, and can be pleated to the stripe or pleated to the sett (see main article Kilts: Pleating and stitching). Trousers Jumpsuit with pleated legs. The thin fabric is often lined. Or in this case worn with skin coloured bra and tights to avoid shining through Pleats just below the waistband on the front of the garment are typical of many styles of formal and casual trousers including suit trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction. When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called reverse pleats (typical of khakis and corduroy trousers) and when they open toward the zipper, they are known as forward pleats. Utilitarian or very casual styles such as jeans and cargo pants are flat-front (without pleats at the waistband) but may have bellows pockets. Pleated trousers were popular before World War II; fabric rationing during the war precluded the style, and flat front became the standard by necessity of cloth shortages.Pleated pants, especially of the double reverse pleat variety, were commonplace in the 1980s and 1990s, but by the late 2000s they had fallen out of favour. Pockets A bellows pocket is patch pocket with an inset box pleat to allow the pocket to expand when filled. Bellows pockets are typical of cargo pants, safari jackets, and other utilitarian garments.

Sheffield United played West Bromwich Albion at their home ground, Bramall Lane, in the old Football League First Division on 16 March 2002. He dismissed three players during the course of the game, all from Sheffield United. First to go was the goalkeeper, Simon Tracey, after 9 minutes for a handball outside the penalty area (an incident totally unrelated to the chaos that would ensue in the second half). Then, after Georges Santos crashed into Albion's Andy Johnson on 65 minutes, he was also sent off. A minute later, Patrick Suffo was dismissed after a head-to-head confrontation with Derek McInnes. When two other players then had to be withdrawn injured after 77 minutes (coincidentally, immediately after West Brom scored their third goal), and with no replacements available, Wolstenholme had to abandon the game due to United having less than 7 players left on the field. Amongst other sanctions taken by the Football Association, Sheffield United were fined ¬£10,000 and their manager Neil Warnock ¬£300.

JM has faced legal charges of obscenity in the U.S., and the studio has also won many adult industry awards. History The company was founded by Jeff Steward. On 21 May 2001, the company's offices were raided by twenty officers from the LAPD. They confiscated several bukkake-themed videos. In response, Steward stated: \\"Some guy swims in feces on MTV, and that's OK? But for a girl to swallow eighty loads of cum is obscene? I don't think so.\\" On the evening of the raid, Jim Powers was in North Hollywood shooting another bukkake film. In reference to what he considered the injustice of the raid, he announced to the men involved: \\"We're doing this for all of America\\".pp. 31-37, My, My American Bukkake by Susannah Breslin in Greta Christina & Daniel Clowes, Best Erotic Comics 2008, illustrated edition, Last Gasp, 2007, On 31 May 2006, the company, Jeff Steward, Mike Norton, and distributor Five Star Video were indicted for distribution of obscenity by the Department of Justice. The defendants faced a maximum sentence of five years for each of the obscenity counts. Jeff Steward was defended by lawyer Al Gelbard, who also represented Evil Angel in its obscenity trial. In his opening arguments at the trial, the prosecutor cited \\"the sacred place of mothers in society\\", in reference to the treatment of the film's actresses. On 16 October 2007, all obscenity charges against JM and Jeff Steward were dropped, due to lack of evidence that JM had sold the films to Five Star. Cast interviews demonstrating that actresses appearing in roles that simulated abuse or degradation did so willingly played a role in the acquittal. A Phoenix jury later found Five Star guilty of interstate transportation of obscene materials, due to it having posted Gag Factor 18 to an FBI agent in Virginia. JM is the distributor for Brandon Iron Productions, Khan Tusion's Pariah Pictures, Grip & Cram Johnson's Chatsworth Pictures, and FuckYouCash.com. In 2005, it signed a deal to make JM content available on HotMovies.com's pay- per-minute video-on-demand site. Its films are also available on Fyre TV and on AdultRental.com's pay-per-view service. Actresses Former contract star Ashley Blue In March 2004, Ashley Blue signed a three-year contract with JM, and she appeared in the Girlvert series. In 2005, the company bought her a Jaguar car after she extended her contract by a year. On February 14, 2007, she ended her contract, entering immediately into a one-year commitment with LA Direct Models. Hillary Scott appeared in American Bukkake 29, Swirlies 2, Irritable Bowel Syndrome 2, and Hillary Scott Cock Star. The 2004 production Guttermouths 30 featured the first pornographic scene enacting the urban legend of the donkey punch, showing Gia Paloma being punched on the back of her head by Alex Sanders. Criticism Gag Factor 10 is discussed in a piece by Robert Jensen of the School of Journalism at the University of Texas. He includes it as an example of pornography which he alleges is dangerous and denigrates women, as the actresses appear to be in pain in the film. The Tough Love series was criticized in an article in The Age as an example of pornography that contains sexual violence and \\"images that are gratuitous or offensive towards women\\". The Tough Love films feature, among other things, naked women having their heads flushed down a toilet bowl. Some of the film covers feature the slogan: \\"Love should leave marks.\\" In 2005, JM released Donkey Punch, which features actresses receiving a donkey punch. Actress Alex Divine reportedly posted on ExtremeGirlForum.com that \\"Donkey Punch was the most brutal, depressing, scary scene that I have ever done.\\" Although she initially agreed to be hit on the head during the scene, she claimed to have misunderstood exactly how physical the scene would be. JM producer Tony Malice has said it does not produce extreme content for extremity's sake, they produce it because there is a demand for this sort of content. Malice says consumer demand for extreme content has been driven by an excess of vanilla sex content, produced by more mainstream studios.

He was the second journalist to write the Cholly Knickerbocker column. Career Born as Count Igor Cassini Loiewski, younger son of Count Alexander Loiewski, a Russian diplomat. He worked as a publicist, ran the Celebrity Register, edited a short-lived magazine called Status, was a co-director of the fashion company House of Cassini, founded by his elder brother, Oleg Cassini, and was a television personality in the 1950s and 1960s, until he was convicted of being a paid agent of the dictator of the Dominican Republic without registering, as required by U.S. law. Cassini's first attention at a national level was achieved in the Summer of 1939 when, as a result of a column he wrote that upset members of Virginia high society, he was kidnapped, tarred and feathered by a trio of locals near Warrenton, Virginia. Cassini himself later reflected, \\"From an obscure junior society columnist always worried as to how I would ever find enough material to fill the space I was grudgingly given, I became national news overnight.\\" Cassini's height of influence was in the 1950s, when the Hearst chain claimed 20,000,000 readership for papers that carried his column. He coined the term \\"Jet set\\" to describe the global movements of what had been \\"caf√© society\\" -- those who entertained at restaurants and night clubs and hobnobbed with the stars of the entertainment industry. His pen name evoked the fictional quintessential New Yorker, \\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\", who was created by Washington Irving. The term \\"caf√© society\\" had been invented by Maury Paul, Cassini's predecessor as \\"Cholly Knickerbocker\\" at the New York Journal American. Later in his career, Igor, who was known as \\"Ghighi\\", hired a young assistant from Texas named Liz Smith. He also was the host of The Igor Cassini Show, an interview program that aired on the DuMont Television Network from October 25, 1953, to February 28, 1954, as well as another television program, Igor Cassini's Million Dollar Showcase. On October 8, 1963, Cassini pleaded \\"nolo contendere\\" to criminal charges that he had been a paid agent of Rafael Trujillo, the dictator of the Dominican Republic, and had failed to register as required by the Foreign Agent Registration Act. After Trujillo died in 1961, the new government of the Dominican Republic released evidence showing that Cassini had been hired on the basis that he could use his contacts and those of his brother, Oleg, one of the First Lady's favorite dress designers, to influence the Kennedy Administration. Cassini paid a fine of $10,000 and lost his job with Hearst.Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., \\"Robert Kennedy and His Times\\", Houghton Mifflin, 1978, pp. 416-418 His autobiography, co-written with Jeanne Molli, I'd Do It All Over Again: The Life and Times of Igor Cassini, appeared in 1977 (). Family and childhood He was born in Sevastopol, Russia, and his elder brother, Oleg Cassini, became a fashion designer best known for dressing First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. They were the sons of Countess Marguerite Cassini, an Italian-Russian aristocrat, and her husband, Count Alexander Loiewski, a Russian diplomat. His maternal grandfather, Arthur Paul Nicholas Cassini, Marquis de Capuzzuchi di Bologna, Count Cassini, was the Russian ambassador to the United States during the administrations of William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt (see ). Cassini's father later adopted his wife's surname, which they deemed more distinguished, and when the family lost its status and fortune in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the family moved to Italy, where Marguerite Cassini went to work as a fashion designer. Igor Cassini Loiewski was raised in Italy, and moved to the United States in 1936 with his parents and elder brother. Marriages His first marriage, in 1940, was to Austine Byrne McDonnell (1920-1991), a Hearst journalist known as \\"The Most Magnificent Doll Among American Newspaperwomen\\". She also screentested for the role of Melanie Wilkes in the motion picture Gone with the Wind. At the time of their marriage, Igor had already been naturalized as a U.S. citizen and they both worked for the Washington Times-Herald. They had no children. Known as Bootsie, she divorced him in 1947 and the next year became the third wife of William Randolph Hearst, Jr. During and after her marriage to Cassini, she wrote \\"These Charming People\\", the society column of Washington Times-Herald, under the bylines Austine Cassini and Austine. His second wife was Fashion Model Elizabeth Darrah Waters (b.1929), daughter of Frank Alexander Waters and Eleanor Van Buskirk of Bedford, NY, whom he married in 1948 and divorced in 1952. The couple had one daughter, Marina. His third wife, whom he married in 1952, was Charlene Stafford Wrightsman (1927-1963), the younger daughter of Charles B. Wrightsman, an oil millionaire whose collection of French and Austrian furniture ‚Äî much of which was acquired through the designers Denning & Fourcade ‚Äî and decorative arts fills several galleries at the Metropolitan Museum. She was previously married (1947-1950) to the actor Helmut Dantine, by whom she had a son, Dana Wrightsman Dantine. She and Cassini had one son, Alexander. On April 8, 1963, while in her bedroom, with her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Marina Cassini, by her side, as the teenager watched the 35th Academy Awards on television, Charlene Cassini swallowed 30 sleeping pills and died the next day. She reportedly was distraught after Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had indicted her husband for failing to register under the U.S. Registration Act, as an agent of a foreign government (a public relations agency he helped found, Martial & Company, had taken on the Dominican Republic as a client). She also suffered from headaches following a minor household accident, was depressed after the suicide of a ski instructor friend, and had become bitterly estranged from her father. After his wife's death, Cassini later wrote, \\"We discovered the apartment, particularly her closets, littered with all kinds of pills, hidden in vases, under linens, stuffed in her shoes and the pockets of her clothes.\\" Cassini's fourth wife was the actress Gianna Lou M√ºller, better known as Nadia Cassini, whom he married in 1969 and divorced in 1972. His fifth wife was Brenda Mitchell, a top fashion model, from whom he also was divorced. They had two sons, Nicholas, formerly a professional golfer on the Nationwide Tour and Dimitri, who is involved in international real estate. Death He died at his home in Manhattan, aged 86, from natural causes.

It is based on the United Kingdom series Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon which aired on ITV in 2005. It also aired in Canada on CTV. The show features contestants competing in some of television's most historically popular game shows, in a single-elimination format until an ultimate winner is found. Both the UK and US versions featured celebrity contestants. The US version was produced by FremantleMedia North America and Granada America and was hosted by Ricki Lake and announced by Rich Fields. In the US, the series only aired for a single season, while in the UK a second season aired in 2007, this time entitled Gameshow Marathon and hosted by Vernon Kay. This program was recorded at Stage 46, CBS Television City in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Premise The seven-part game show tournament featured celebrity contestants Lance Bass, Paige Davis, Tim Meadows, Kathy Najimy, Leslie Nielsen, and Brande Roderick. The six played The Price Is Right, Let's Make a Deal (the only show which had not previously aired on CBS at that time), Beat the Clock, Press Your Luck, Card Sharks, Match Game, and Family Feud to progress in the tournament. The series used replicas of each show's original set, or in the case of The Price Is Right, actual props from the series currently airing. Each installment began with a narration of the format of the particular show featured on that episode coupled with montages of clips from each program's history. Tournament format The format of each individual show was largely unchanged. All six celebrity contestants participated in the first game, The Price Is Right. The Showcase winner from this episode claimed the first of four seats in \\"Finalists' Row\\". The remaining contestants after each game was played then participated in the next game (five for Let's Make a Deal, four for Beat the Clock, three for Press Your Luck) to win one of the remaining seats. After the fourth game, the remaining two contestants were eliminated. The four contestants in \\"Finalists' Row\\" were then paired in a competition to play the fifth and sixth games (Card Sharks and Match Game). The winners of those two games then proceeded to the \\"championship game\\", Family Feud. For the finals, each celebrity assembled a five-person team of family and friends to play Family Feud, with the charity of the winning \\"family\\" receiving $100,000. Brande Roderick was the showcase winner on the episode featuring The Price Is Right. Lance Bass became the next semifinalist from Let's Make a Deal, and Paige Davis won the Beat the Clock installment. Kathy Najimy won the last semifinal slot on Press Your Luck, and Tim Meadows and Leslie Nielsen were eliminated at the end of that episode. Roderick defeated Davis in Card Sharks, and Najimy defeated Bass in Match Game. Najimy and her family then beat Roderick and her family on Family Feud to capture the top prize. The Match Game installment also featured Adam Carolla, Adrianne Curry, George Foreman, Kathy Griffin, Bruce Vilanch, and Betty White (in her traditional seat) as the panel. The six also appeared as audience members during the Price is Right episode (but did not play). The \\"Barker's Beauties\\" from The Price Is Right also played a role in some of the installments. Gilbert Gottfried appeared on the Let's Make a Deal episode in a Zonk and in the Big Deal prize. Rule changes For The Price Is Right, the top prize for Plinko was $100,000 and featured the same layout as seen in prime time episodes with a $20,000 slot in the center. Three games were played on the episode, and the two highest-scoring contestants in the Showcase Showdown advanced to the Showcase. The winning showcase (and any prizes won by that celebrity previously) went to a viewer watching at home. Let's Make a Deal was played exactly as it was during the Monty Hall era in which the celebrities and some actual audience members taking part in the deals and they were wearing costumes, and it ended with the Big Deal, worth over $87,000. The celebrity who won the most advanced to Finalists' Row and their prizes were awarded to a home viewer. Beat the Clock was played in a tournament format. Two of the celebrities played a stunt as a team with a time limit of 60 seconds. The other two celebrities played the same stunt, trying to beat the first team's time. The two celebrities on the winning team then faced off in another stunt. The winner of the second stunt played one final stunt alone and if it was completed successfully within the 60 second time limit, a home viewer wins a car in addition to the other prizes earned by the winning celebrity. The game board for Press Your Luck had top amounts of $3,000, $4,000 and $5,000 + One Spin in round one, and those values doubled in round two. The winning celebrity's cash and prizes went to a home viewer. Contestants playing Card Sharks received $1,000 for winning round one and $2,000 for round two. Instead of using the tiebreaker round featured on the NBC and CBS/1986 syndicated versions, a complete round with five cards and four questions was played as round three for $3,000. The contestant who won the most money won the game. The Money Cards offered a top prize of $144,000. $1,000 was given at the start of that round, and another $1,000 was given on the second level. Minimum bets were $50 on each card until the Big Bet, where a bet equal to at least half the current score must be wagered. Like the 1986 version of the show, the contestant could change one card per line by choosing one of three spare cards, doubles resulted in pushes. Like the 1986 version of the show, a car game was added, however, it did not resemble either version used during that period. In this car game, the contestant had to correctly determine whether the number of cheerleaders that answered \\"yes\\" to a question was higher or lower than five, and a card taken from the blue deck was used for the actual answer. In Match Game, two contestants each tried to match the celebrities as on the original series. The winner after Round 3 moved on to the Super Match for a chance to win up to $50,000 for a home viewer. Two audience matches were played with $500, $250, and $100 as the possible payouts, and the contestant had a chance to multiply the total won from the audience matches by 50 by matching one celebrity in the Head-to-Head match. The finale featured Family Feud, with teams competing to score 300 points first. The points doubled in round four and tripled in round five and beyond. In Fast Money, the first contestant had 20 seconds to answer the questions and the other received 25 seconds. A home viewer won $50,000 if the two contestants in Fast Money were able to reach or exceed 200 points. The home viewer contest allowed viewers to win the cash and prizes won by the celebrity. It consisted of the showing of a classic clip pertaining to that day's show, with a corresponding question that had three multiple choice answers. A winner was selected from those entries that had the correct answer, and the prizes were delivered to the winner in a special segment during the next day's episode hosted by Todd Newton.

The headwaters of the Chama are the Mifaf√≠ high lands, in the Andes Range, near the town of Apartaderos. Its outlet is at Lake Maracaibo. From the headwaters to an elevation of about above sea level, the Chama runs as a steep mountain torrent. As it progresses through the valley, it quickly becomes contaminated with sewage from the many towns that lie along its path. The river continues its journey passing at the foot of the plateau where the city of M√©rida sits. Near the town of Ejido, the Albarregas river joins the Chama, dumping all the pollutants from the city of M√©rida and thus reaching its peak of contamination. From there, the river continues in steep descent, through a very rocky river bed. This allows the water to become oxygenated and naturally purified from its organic contaminants. At the town of Las Gonzalez, the Chama, while still contaminated, is often used by white water rafters. Near the town of Estanques, the river enters an approximately long canyon, characterized by being steep and narrow. This canyon is mostly tropical, providing a natural scenery that contrasts with the Andean set up that mostly characterizes the river. Upon leaving the canyon, the river passes by the second largest city of the state, El Vig√≠a. In the final, short, section of the river, the Chama enters into the state of Zulia and reaches Maracaibo Lake.

It was created by Joseph L. Doob and others (circa 1945), presented by Dan Gillespie in 1976, and popularized in 1977 in a paper where he uses it to simulate chemical or biochemical systems of reactions efficiently and accurately using limited computational power (see stochastic simulation). As computers have become faster, the algorithm has been used to simulate increasingly complex systems. The algorithm is particularly useful for simulating reactions within cells, where the number of reagents is low and keeping track of the position and behaviour of individual molecules is computationally feasible. Mathematically, it is a variant of a dynamic Monte Carlo method and similar to the kinetic Monte Carlo methods. It is used heavily in computational systems biology. History The process that led to the algorithm recognizes several important steps. In 1931, Andrei Kolmogorov introduced the differential equations corresponding to the time-evolution of stochastic processes that proceed by jumps, today known as Kolmogorov equations (Markov jump process) (a simplified version is known as master equation in the natural sciences). It was William Feller, in 1940, who found the conditions under which the Kolmogorov equations admitted (proper) probabilities as solutions. In his Theorem I (1940 work) he establishes that the time-to-the-next-jump was exponentially distributed and the probability of the next event is proportional to the rate. As such, he established the relation of Kolmogorov's equations with stochastic processes. Later, Doob (1942, 1945) extended Feller's solutions beyond the case of pure-jump processes. The method was implemented in computers by David George Kendall (1950) using the Manchester Mark 1 computer and later used by Maurice S. Bartlett (1953) in his studies of epidemics outbreaks. Gillespie (1977) obtains the algorithm in a different manner by making use of a physical argument. Idea behind the algorithm Traditional continuous and deterministic biochemical rate equations do not accurately predict cellular reactions since they rely on bulk reactions that require the interactions of millions of molecules. They are typically modeled as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. In contrast, the Gillespie algorithm allows a discrete and stochastic simulation of a system with few reactants because every reaction is explicitly simulated. A trajectory corresponding to a single Gillespie simulation represents an exact sample from the probability mass function that is the solution of the master equation. The physical basis of the algorithm is the collision of molecules within a reaction vessel. It is assumed that collisions are frequent, but collisions with the proper orientation and energy are infrequent. Therefore, all reactions within the Gillespie framework must involve at most two molecules. Reactions involving three molecules are assumed to be extremely rare and are modeled as a sequence of binary reactions. It is also assumed that the reaction environment is well mixed. Algorithm Gillespie developed two different, but equivalent formulations; the direct method and the first reaction method. Below is a summary of the steps to run the algorithm (mathematics omitted): # Initialization: Initialize the number of molecules in the system, reaction constants, and random number generators. # Monte Carlo step: Generate random numbers to determine the next reaction to occur as well as the time interval. The probability of a given reaction to be chosen is proportional to the number of substrate molecules, the time interval is exponentially distributed with mean 1/R_\\\\mathrm{TOT}. # Update: Increase the time by the randomly generated time in Step 2. Update the molecule count based on the reaction that occurred. # Iterate: Go back to Step 2 unless the number of reactants is zero or the simulation time has been exceeded. The algorithm is computationally expensive and thus many modifications and adaptations exist, including the next reaction method (Gibson & Bruck), tau-leaping, as well as hybrid techniques where abundant reactants are modeled with deterministic behavior. Adapted techniques generally compromise the exactitude of the theory behind the algorithm as it connects to the Master equation, but offer reasonable realizations for greatly improved timescales. The computational cost of exact versions of the algorithm is determined by the coupling class of the reaction network. In weakly coupled networks, the number of reactions that is influenced by any other reaction is bounded by a small constant. In strongly coupled networks, a single reaction firing can in principle affect all other reactions. An exact version of the algorithm with constant-time scaling for weakly coupled networks has been developed, enabling efficient simulation of systems with very large numbers of reaction channels (Slepoy Thompson Plimpton 2008). The generalized Gillespie algorithm that accounts for the non-Markovian properties of random biochemical events with delay has been developed by Bratsun et al. 2005 and independently Barrio et al. 2006, as well as (Cai 2007). See the articles cited below for details. Partial-propensity formulations, as developed independently by both Ramaswamy et al. (2009, 2010) and Indurkhya and Beal (2010), are available to construct a family of exact versions of the algorithm whose computational cost is proportional to the number of chemical species in the network, rather than the (larger) number of reactions. These formulations can reduce the computational cost to constant-time scaling for weakly coupled networks and to scale at most linearly with the number of species for strongly coupled networks. A partial-propensity variant of the generalized Gillespie algorithm for reactions with delays has also been proposed (Ramaswamy Sbalzarini 2011). The use of partial-propensity methods is limited to elementary chemical reactions, i.e., reactions with at most two different reactants. Every non- elementary chemical reaction can be equivalently decomposed into a set of elementary ones, at the expense of a linear (in the order of the reaction) increase in network size.  Examples = Reversible binding of A and B to form AB dimers A simple example may help to explain how the Gillespie algorithm works. Consider a system of molecules of two types, and . In this system, and reversibly bind together to form dimers such that two reactions are possible: either A and B react reversibly to form an dimer, or an dimer dissociates into and . The reaction rate constant for a given single A molecule reacting with a given single molecule is k_\\\\mathrm{D}, and the reaction rate for an dimer breaking up is k_\\\\mathrm{B}. If at time t there is one molecule of each type then the rate of dimer formation is k_\\\\mathrm{D}, while if there are n_\\\\mathrm{A} molecules of type and n_\\\\mathrm{B} molecules of type , the rate of dimer formation is k_\\\\mathrm{D}n_\\\\mathrm{A}n_\\\\mathrm{B}. If there are n_\\\\mathrm{AB} dimers then the rate of dimer dissociation is k_\\\\mathrm{B}n_\\\\mathrm{AB}. The total reaction rate, R_\\\\mathrm{TOT}, at time t is then given by R_\\\\mathrm{TOT}=k_\\\\mathrm{D}n_\\\\mathrm{A}n_\\\\mathrm{B}+k_\\\\mathrm{B}n_\\\\mathrm{AB} So, we have now described a simple model with two reactions. This definition is independent of the Gillespie algorithm. We will now describe how to apply the Gillespie algorithm to this system. In the algorithm, we advance forward in time in two steps: calculating the time to the next reaction, and determining which of the possible reactions the next reaction is. Reactions are assumed to be completely random, so if the reaction rate at a time t is R_\\\\mathrm{TOT}, then the time, Œ¥t, until the next reaction occurs is a random number drawn from exponential distribution function with mean 1/R_\\\\mathrm{TOT}. Thus, we advance time from t to t + Œ¥t. Plot of the number molecules (black curve) and dimers as a function of time. As we started with 10 and molecules at time t=0, the number of molecules is always equal to the number of molecules and so it is not shown. The probability that this reaction is an molecule binding to a molecule is simply the fraction of total rate due to this type of reaction, i.e., the probability that reaction is P(\\\\ce{{A} + B -> AB}) = k_Dn_An_B/R_\\\\ce{TOT} The probability that the next reaction is an dimer dissociating is just 1 minus that. So with these two probabilities we either form a dimer by reducing n_\\\\mathrm{A} and n_\\\\mathrm{B} by one, and increase n_\\\\mathrm{AB} by one, or we dissociate a dimer and increase n_\\\\mathrm{A} and n_\\\\mathrm{B} by one and decrease n_\\\\mathrm{AB} by one. Now we have both advanced time to t + Œ¥t, and performed a single reaction. The Gillespie algorithm just repeats these two steps as many times as needed to simulate the system for however long we want (i.e., for as many reactions). The result of a Gillespie simulation that starts with n_\\\\mathrm{A}=n_\\\\mathrm{B}=10 and n_\\\\mathrm{AB}=0 at t=0, and where k_\\\\mathrm{D}=2 and k_\\\\mathrm{B}=1, is shown at the right. For these parameter values, on average there are 8 n_\\\\mathrm{AB} dimers and 2 of and but due to the small numbers of molecules fluctuations around these values are large. The Gillespie algorithm is often used to study systems where these fluctuations are important. That was just a simple example, with two reactions. More complex systems with more reactions are handled in the same way. All reaction rates must be calculated at each time step, and one chosen with probability equal to its fractional contribution to the rate. Time is then advanced as in this example.  The SIR epidemic without vital dynamics The SIR model is a classic biological description of how certain diseases permeate through a fixed-size population. In its simplest form there are N members of the population, whereby each member may be in one of three states -- susceptible, infected, or recovered -- at any instant in time, and each such member transitions irreversibly through these states according to the directed graph below. We can denote the number of susceptible members as n_{S}, the number of infected members as n_{I}, and the number of recovered members as n_{R}. Therefore we may also conclude that N = n_{S} + n_{I} + n_{R} for any point in time. center Further, a given susceptible member will transition to the infected state by coming into contact with any of the n_{I} infected members, and so infection occurs with rate \\\\alpha n_{I} (dimensions of inverse time). A given member of the infected state recovers without dependence on any of the three states, which is specified by rate (also with dimensions of inverse time). Given this basic scheme, it possible to construct the following non- linear system. A single realization of the SIR epidemic as produced with an implementation of the Gillespie algorithm and the numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system (dashed). : \\\\frac{dn_{S}}{dt} = - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha n_{S}}{V} n_{I}, : \\\\frac{d n_{I}}{dt} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha n_{S}}{V}- \\\\beta\\\\right)n_{I}, : \\\\frac{d n_{R}}{dt} = \\\\beta n_{I} . This system has no explicit analytical solution. One approach could be to use the Gillespie algorithm, simulate the system many times, and use a regression technique such as least-squares to fit a polynomial over all of the trajectories. As the number of trajectories increases, such polynomial regression will asymptotically behave like the numerical solution (dashed lines). In addition to estimating the solution of an intractable problem like the SIR epidemic, the stochastic nature of each trajectory allows one to compute statistics other than \\\\mathrm{E}[nt]. When running the script below, sometimes realizations of the SIR epidemic are obtained which differ drastically from the numerical solution. For example, when all persons are cured (by chance) at the beginning of the epidemic. The simulated trajectory presented in the above figure is obtained with the following Python implementation of the Gillespie algorithm. Additionally, an ODE solver from SciPy is invoked to obtain the numerical solution of the differential equation system. import math import random # Input parameters #################### # int; total population N = 350 # float; maximum elapsed time T = 100.0 # float; start time t = 0.0 # float; spatial parameter V = 100.0 # float; rate of infection after contact _alpha = 10.0 # float; rate of cure _beta = 10.0 # int; initial infected population n_I = 1 ######################################### # Compute susceptible population, set recovered to zero n_S = N - n_I n_R = 0 # Initialize results list SIR_data = [] SIR_data.append((t, n_S, n_I, n_R)) # Main loop while t < T: if n_I  0: break w1 = _alpha * n_S * n_I / V w2 = _beta * n_I W = w1 + w2 # generate exponentially distributed random variable dt # using inverse transform sampling dt = -math.log(1 - random.uniform(0.0, 1.0)) / W t = t + dt if random.uniform(0.0, 1.0) < w1 / W: n_S = n_S - 1 n_I = n_I + 1 else: n_I = n_I - 1 n_R = n_R + 1 SIR_data.append((t, n_S, n_I, n_R)) with open(\\"SIR_data.txt\\", \\"w+\\") as fp: fp.write(\\" \\".join(\\"%f %i %i %i\\" % x for x in SIR_data)) from scipy.integrate import odeint import numpy as np # Numerical solution using an ordinary differential equation solver ts = np.linspace(0, 2, num=200) initial_S_I_R = (N - 1, 1, 0) def differential_SIR(initial_S_I_R, t, _alpha, _beta, V): n_S, n_I, n_R = initial_S_I_R dS_dt = -_alpha * n_S / V * n_I dI_dt = (_alpha * n_S / V - _beta) * n_I dR_dt = _beta * n_I return dS_dt, dI_dt, dR_dt solution = odeint(differential_SIR, initial_S_I_R, ts, args=(_alpha, _beta, V)) Further reading     * * (Slepoy Thompson Plimpton 2008): * (Bratsun et al. 2005): * (Barrio et al. 2006): * (Cai 2007): * (Barnes Chu 2010): * (Ramaswamy Gonz√°lez-Segredo Sbalzarini 2009): * (Ramaswamy Sbalzarini 2010): * (Indurkhya Beal 2010): * (Ramaswamy Sbalzarini 2011): * (Yates Klingbeil 2013): Category:Chemical kinetics Category:Computational chemistry Category:Monte Carlo methods Category:Stochastic simulation ","title":"Gillespie algorithm"},{"id":"4438777","text":"Howard Edward Mudd (February 10, 1942 ‚Äì August 12, 2020) was an American football offensive lineman and coach.

While at Michigan State he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.The Rainbow, vol. 132, no. 4, p. 26 Mudd played football for Hillsdale College from 1960 to 1963, where he was a starting guard and a team captain. His play at the school led to his induction into the NAIA Hall of Fame. He then played seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears from 1964 to 1970. Mudd was a three-time Pro Bowler, in 1966, 1967, and 1968. He retired in 1971 due to a knee injury, and began his coaching career at the University of California the following year. From 1998‚Äì2009, he was the offensive line coach for the Indianapolis Colts, with whom he won Super Bowl XLI. For his work as an assistant coach, Mudd earned the Pro Football Writers of America Lifetime Achievement Award. Coaching career Mudd pursued a coaching career following his retirement as an NFL player. He spent two years as an assistant coach at the University of California, before moving to the NFL, and coaching for the San Diego Chargers, San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs between 1974-1997. He then joined the Indianapolis Colts as an offensive line coach, where he coached from 1998-2009. During his 12 years in Indianapolis, the Colts allowed the fewest sacks in the NFL, with just 218 sacks in 182 games. This is especially impressive when the high number of passing plays the Colts attempted during that time period was taken into account. Peyton Manning played for the Colts for 11 of those 12 years, and credits much of his success to the protection he received from Mudd's front line. On May 6, 2009, ESPN reported that Mudd had filed his retirement papers due to a change in the NFL's pension program. On May 20, 2009, Mudd returned to the team as the senior offensive line coach. Mudd planned to retire for good following the Colts' game against the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. In May 2010, Mudd and New Orleans Saints offensive line coach Aaron Kromer were together for a coaching clinic in Cincinnati, at which time Kromer approached Mudd about serving as a temporary consultant with the Saints. Mudd first advised the Saints during the 2010 offseason, then returned for the opening of training camp. In reference to his association with the Saints, Mudd said \\"He (Kromer) asked me to come down and spend a little time, and I said, 'OK'. I'll only be here a couple of days. That's it.\\" Mudd was named the offensive line coach for the Philadelphia Eagles after being talked out of retirement on February 2, 2011. In Mudd's first season with the Eagles, they allowed 17 fewer sacks than they had the previous season, and helped LeSean McCoy lead the NFL in total touchdowns. Mudd retired at the conclusion of the 2012 season. On February 7, 2019, the Colts hired Mudd as a senior offensive assistant, however Mudd stepped down from the position on September 6, 2019.  Death  Mudd died on August 12, 2020 at the age of 78, of injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident two weeks prior. Colts' owner Jim Irsay tweeted: \\"Rest in peace, Howard Mudd.

He earned his master's degree at Webster University in St. Louis. Issues=Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) The RFA argues that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) abused its waiver authority by setting RVOs lower than the statutory minimums. They say Congress clearly intended for the law to apply according to supply that could be available rather than demand. They contend that the EPA has conflated the two. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA), the statutory standard for 2017 is 24 billion gallons. The EPA only set an RVO of 18.8 billion gallons of biofuel for 2017. This was up from 18.4 billion gallons in 2016. Ethanol supporters and oil companies alike criticized this target. Green jobs The RFA considers employment in the ethanol industry to be a primary example of \\"green jobs.\\" The 2010 US Ethanol Industry Salary Survey determined that employees about 500,000 people with 75% of such workers making more than $50,000 per year and 99% receiving health benefits. The RFA points out that these jobs, heavily concentrated in rural areas, provide a much-needed economic boost to otherwise depressed places. E85 , almost half of new vehicles produced by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors are flex-fuel, meaning roughly one-quarter of all new vehicles sold by 2015 are capable of using up to E85. However, obstacles to widespread use of E85 fuel remain. A 2014 analysis by the Renewable Fuels Association found that oil companies prevent or discourage affiliated retailers from selling E85 through rigid franchise and branding agreements, restrictive supply contracts, and other tactics. The report showed independent retailers are five times more likely to offer E85 than retailers carrying an oil company brand. See page 22.  Committees  The RFA convenes four concern-specific committees. * Technical Committee : focuses heavily on fuel specifications and standards such as ASTM International, National Conference of Weights and Measures, ISO, Canadian General Standards Board, and other international fuel requirements.RFA TC Committee * Environmental Compliance Committee : examines and provides guidance on the myriad of environmental regulations pertaining to ethanol production facilities.RFA Committee ECC * Co-Products Committee : focuses on issues relevant to all ethanol co-products, from research and educational programs to regulatory issues and trade.RFA Committee CPC * Plant and Employee Safety Committee : works with federal, state and local governments as well as industry partners, to bring attention to hazardous materials regulations and other safety requirements.RFA Committee PESC  See also  *Renewable Fuel Standard *Canadian Renewable Fuels Association *Renewable energy commercialization in the United States *Solar Energy Industries Association *Renewable energy commercialization *American Council on Renewable Energy *National Renewable Energy Laboratory  References External links *Renewable Fuels Association *Iowa Renewable Fuels Association *Canadian Renewable Fuels Association *Fuels America *Al-Corn Clean Fuel: About Category:Biofuel in the United States Category:Renewable energy organizations based in the United States ","title":"Renewable Fuels Association"},{"id":"4438800","text":"Simon Peter Tracey (born 9 December 1967) is an English former professional footballer who made more than 300 appearances in the Football League playing as a goalkeeper for Wimbledon, Sheffield United, Manchester City, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest and Wimbledon. He is currently chief scout at Northampton Town. Playing career Tracey played most of his professional career at Sheffield United. He started out as a goalkeeper at Wimbledon in 1985. He made his debut in a 2‚Äì1 loss to Liverpool in the Charity Shield in 1988 after Dave Beasant, the hero of the FA Cup Final win that gave Wimbledon their place in the match, had been sold to Newcastle United. He kept his place for the first League game of the season but did not perform well in a 5‚Äì1 defeat and was dropped and replaced with Ron Green and, subsequently, Hans Segers. He was sold on to Sheffield United in 1988 for ¬£7,500 and was part of the team that was promoted from the old Third Division in the 1988-89 season finishing in second place. He was an ever-present during the following season when United were again promoted, this time to the old First Division and also won the club's player of the season award for the same season. Tracey remained first-choice in the top flight and was again player of the season, this time for the 1991-92 season. Tracey then suffered regular injuries and his games were limited by the arrival of Alan Kelly in the summer of 1992 for the first season of the new FA Premier League. During this time he had loan spells at several clubs, including Manchester City, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest and his old team Wimbledon. Whilst on loan at Manchester City in November 1994, Tracey appeared in a 5‚Äì0 loss to rivals Manchester Utd, the worst losing margin for City in a Manchester Derby. A loan spell at Norwich City during the 1994-95 season was a nightmare for Tracey. He made three appearances - in the first he ran out of his area allowing Coventry to score an easy goal, in the second he was stretchered off with an injury and in the third he let in five goals in an FA Cup tie at Everton. In 2000 when he played at Norwich for Sheffield United he made a similar charge from his area that allowed Norwich striker Craig Bellamy to score. In 1995, he had a short spell on loan at Nottingham Forest but did not play for the first team, then played one game back at Wimbledon in a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Forest. Tracey again featured regularly for Sheffield United in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and in total went on to make 382 appearances for United until 2003. His playing days came to an end when he suffered an injury during pre-season to the 2002‚Äì2003 season and once recovered, summer signing Paddy Kenny had cemented his place in the first team. This led to Tracey retiring from football. Tracey received a testimonial in 2003 for his long-standing career at Sheffield United.https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharrowblade/5662452954 Coaching career Tracey began his goalkeeper coaching career in 2004 at Rotherham United F.C., replacing previous coach Graham Brown. His position lasted until October 2009, when he joined Mark Robins, John Breckin and Nick Daws at Barnsley. He joined Northampton Town as chief scout in October 2019.https://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/sport/football/curle-appoints-former- sheffield-united-team-mate-simon-tracey-as-cobblers-chief-scout-1-8678522 ReferencesExternal links *Profile of Simon Tracey * *Career Information at Flown from the Nest Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Wimbledon F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Rotherham United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Barnsley F.C. non- playing staff Category:Carlisle United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Chesterfield F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Simon Tracey"},{"id":"4438808","text":"Great War Island () is a river island in Belgrade, capital of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of Sava and Danube rivers. Though uninhabited, the island is part of the Belgrade City proper, and belongs to the city municipality of Zemun.  Location  Great War Island is located at the mouth of the Sava river into the Danube, in the Danube's widening between the Kalemegdan fortress as the ending section of the Terazije ridge of northernmost part of ≈†umadija on the west and the low, easternmost section of the Syrmia plain, the modern U≈°ƒáe neighborhood of New Belgrade, on the south. The island is relatively close to the banks, at the closest it is just away from both New Belgrade and Kalemegdan. On the south, halfway between the Great War Island and U≈°ƒáe is the remnant of Little War Island. In 2005 an initiative was started to transfer the island administratively, from Zemun to the New Belgrade municipality. The initiative ultimately failed.  Name  The island gained its militant name due to its history as an important strategic point either for the conquest or the defence of Belgrade. It had especially good position for cannons and was usually used as the starting point for the attack on Belgrade's harbor. It was also used as the hiding place for hajduks, ≈†ajka≈°i but also for various river pirates. Numerous military facilities and fortifications were built and demolished on the island in time. During the wars, temporary, pontoon bridges were built connecting the three river sides (Belgrade, Zemnun and Panƒçevo) with each other via the island, allowing the armies to cross over the rivers. During history, almost a dozen different names for the island were recorded, some of them colloquial and unofficial. They include Dunavsko ostrvo (Danubian Island), Cigansko ostrvo (Gypsy Island), Veselo ostrvo (Merry Island), Vojno ostrvo (Military Island), Ratno ostrvo (War Island), Ratna ostrva (War Islands, when applied jointly to the Little War Island), Babalƒ±k ada (Babalƒ±k Island), Veliko vojno ostrvo (Great Military Island), Veliko ostrvo rata (Great Island of War) and Sirotinjsko ostrvo (Poor Man's Island). The present name, Great War Island, appeared in the mid-19th century and became permanent after World War I.  Geography  The Great War Island is generally triangular in shape and covers an area of . It is low, for the most part marshy and often flooded by the Danube. The main physical feature on the island is the canal of Veliki Galija≈°. In time, the canal was cut off from the Danube and effectively turned into a lake, with an area of and the major natural bird and fish spawning area on the island. However, during drought years the lake drains completely causing damage to the closed eco-system centered around it. Currently some two-thirds of the island are used as a nature reserve for 196 bird species, many of which are endangered. One of Belgrade's beaches, Lido, is located on the northern tip of the island. Because of the sedimentation, occasional drainage and removal of the silt from the northern tip of the island is necessary, as otherwise it would make a land connection to the bank of the Danube.  Wildlife = Plants  Plant life on the island includes the typical marshy flora, like reed, yellow flag or rush, but also trees like black poplar, ash tree, White Elm, elderberry, hawthorn and even some rare conifers. A rare orchid Orchis palustris Jacq. was spotted for the first time in Belgrade in 1896 on the Great War Island, but was never seen again there. It has been re-discovered in the Maki≈° area in 1955, but by 2001 it disappeared, too, and today can be found only around the lake of Veliko Blato, in the neighborhood of Krnjaƒça. The island is the only location in Serbia of the bird's little nest fungi, which is used for the antioxidant extraction. Forests cover and area of , or 57% of the island. Tree species include walnut tree and European nettle tree. In November 2011 some 2,500 seedlings of the pedunculate oak were planted. Higher forest coverage influences the micro climate and provides new habitats for the birds. Autochthonous tree species include willow and poplar. By November 2017, the island has been populated with 5,850 seedlings of pedunculate oak, 1,000 of narrow-leafed ash, 1,755 of European white elm and 800 of black poplar.  Birds  There are 66 bird species which actually nest on the island, 43 non-migratory and 23 migratory birds. In winter, during the nesting period, there are some 80 species present, while in the migration season, number rises to over 100. Some of the species are pygmy cormorant, black stork, mergansers, seven species of herons, over 40 species of ducks. Altogether, 163 different bird species inhabits the island. The island was the largest colony of the great egret on the entire course of the Danube, maybe the largest one in the Europe. During the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, the herons, for the most part, disappeared. Major attraction on the island is a pair of white-tailed eagles. A nesting couple, they settled on the island in 2010, migrating from the marshland of Panƒçevaƒçki Rit, across the Danube. They built a large nest, in diameter, at the height of . There are five other nesting couples in the wider Belgrade area, and some 90 in the entire Serbia, but having them reproducing at only from the downtown of a city of this size is an exceptional rarity. They reproduced for the first time three years later, in 2013. In April 2016, when their chicks were to be hatched, the city's communal services installed a camera in the nest. The project was unique, with the similar one in Estonia, but Belgrade is the only European capital to have it. Before the next generation of chicks hatched in 2017, live feed was posted online.Orao belorepan ‚Äì Veliko Ratno Ostrvo 2017 The largest European eagles, with the wingspan up to , are best observed from the neighboring U≈°ƒáe and Dorƒáol districts, but they are being spotted circling above the Kalemegdan and the Republic Square, practically the center of Belgrade.  Mammals  On the 9 October 2008 a species of the pygmy bat, soprano pipistrelle, was discovered on the island. It is a rare mammal, having a wingspan of and weight of only . Naturalists suspected that soprano pipistrelle lives in Serbia, in the Obedska bara region, but this was the first time that the bat was actually seen and caught. In October 2008, 21 species of mammals were recorded on the island. They included, in Belgrade rarely seen, otters, nutrias, weasels and European pine martens. There is a colony of wild boars on the Great War Island. The population originated from the marshy area of Panƒçevaƒçki Rit and they reached the island swimming to it during one of the previous floods. As of 2019, it was estimated to have over 35 individual animals. Rarely, they swim across the arm of the Danube which separates the island from the urban mainland, and can be seen in Zemun or Novi Beograd. Popular case was from 2014 when a wild boar was discovered in the garage of the Energoprojekt holding company. In June 2019 due to the rise of the water level which flooded the entire island, wild boars scattered all over Belgrade, making media sensation. Numerous videos and photos of boars swimming across the rivers were posted. A small herd of wild boars was seen in New Belgrade's Block 30. Animals, including disoriented solitary piglets which is highly unusual behavior, were seen in Block 8 and in the neighborhoods of U≈°ƒáe and Zemunski Kej. Wild boars have even been spotted in Belgrade's downtown: in Belgrade Fortress and Obiliƒáev Venac, where one animal fell to its death from the multistorey car park. Though hunting organizations stated that there is no danger as wild boars avoid people, Ministry of Agriculture issued a warning, stating that people should abstain from night walks in the forested area across the island. Fluctuating number of wild boars grew again by 2020 and they began to completely devastate gardens kept by the people from the mainland. However, as the area is protected and the gardens shouldn't be there at all, no official action was taken. Still, the authorities tried to relocate a number of boars to another location. Traps were placed, but the boars ate of corn placed as a decoy in two days, and only one piglet was trapped. Growing numbers of wild boars were reported in the wider Balkans area (rest of Serbia, Bulgaria) due to the favorable climate conditions in 2020 but more to the COVID-19 pandemic which restricted hunting.  History  Satellite view of Great War Island Great War Island is not an old geographical feature. Based on the historical data and descriptions of the river battles on the Danube, it is believed that it has been fully formed as an island in the second half of the 15th century. It had origins as a small 14th century sandbank which was divided and morphed by the Danube, as depicted on some engravings. Blueprints of the Belgrade Fortress from 1456 confirm the existence of the sandbank. The arm of the Danube which divided the sandbank was called Dunavski potok (Danube's stream or creek). It appeared on the proper maps for the first time in the 1514-1528 map Tabula Hungariae by the cartographer . Historian Kome chronicled the fall of Zemun to the Turks in 1521 and mentioned the island as the location where all of the imprisoned defenders of the city were interred, including their wives and children. In 1521, when Belgrade was under siege by Turkish forces, the majority of their attacks on Belgrade fortress were launched from the island. Ottoman traveler Evliya √áelebi visited the region in the 1660s and mentioned the island. He wrote about the mosque on the island, named after a certain Ahmet Babalƒ±k. One of the earlier names for the island, Babalƒ±k Island, came from the name of the mosque. First written record on the island from someone who visited it is from 1699, when an English travelling doctor described it as the \\"large, forested island\\". The name officially appeared after 1717, when Prince Eugene of Savoy used the island as an attack point in his re-conquest of Belgrade from the Turks. In 1741 a Constantinople convention was signed, which resulted in fixing the border between Austria and Turkey, concerning the islands in the Sava and Danube. By the convention, Turkey obtained the section of the island overlooking the Belgrade, while Austria got the other part, in the direction of Zemun and Banat. In liberating Belgrade in 1806 the rebel army headed by Karaƒëorƒëe also used the island for military purposes, as the Serbian artillery with 500 soldiers was bombing the Kalemegdan fortress from there. Turkish city plan from 1863 still used the name Babalƒ±k for the island. During the offensive in 1915 by Austria-Hungary against Belgrade, Austria-Hungary forces used the island to launch their attacks. After the World War I, island became part of the new Yugoslav state. After 1918, a small colony of 20 destitute inhabitants of Zemun built stilt houses on the island which was then colloquially called \\"Sirotinjska Ada\\" (Poor man's Island). In this period the entire area of the island was cultivated, mostly corn and watermelons. On the lower tip of the island, a beach was arranged and named Dorƒáol Beach or Lapat Beach. Also, a sandbank facing Zemun was adapted into the beach, being predecessor of the modern Lido beach, which was named this way at least before 1931. First urban plans for the island were drafted in 1923, when the island was envisioned as an elite park area. In 1928, building company \\"≈†umadija\\" proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called \\"air tram\\". The project was planned to connect Zemun to Kalemegdan on Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized. When construction of New Belgrade began in 1948, the city government made a decision to completely destroy the island by using its sand and earth to cover the marshes of Syrmia, where new city was to be built. However, the deposits of alluvial materials continually brought onto the island from the Danube completely prevented this from happening. Instead, the smaller Little War Island served this purpose and was nearly destroyed in the process. Another proposed project after World War II included construction of the bridge and the major sports-recreational center on the island. Center of the island was to be transformed into the large, circular lake. The project was dropped in 1972. As the island has numerous water springs below its surface, from 1976 to 1985 plans were developed for using the island as the water source for the city, but this idea was abandoned, too. Though officially uninhabited, almost a dozen people live in small shacks in the island's interior. They are mostly retirees who move to the island during the warm season and maintain their vegetable gardens, while in the winter they return to Belgrade. In 2005, the island was protected by the state as a landscape of outstanding features. The protected area of includes both the Great War and the Little War islands.  Bridge proposals  The official city idea of constructing a bridge to the island was abandoned in 1972. Since the early 2000s, a military pontoon bridge has been placed each summer during the swimming season on the Lido Beach. It connects the beach and the neighborhood of Zemunski Kej, across an arm of the Danube. As the beach was almost wiped out during the disastrous 2006 European floods, the bridge wasn't laid in 2006‚Äì08. In general, the bridge is laid from July to September. It is long and placed by the engineering units of the Serbian Armed Forces. Placing of the bridge regularly sparks protest from the boatmen, either those who work as a ferrymen when there is no bridge, or those who are simply blocked in the Danube's arm between the island and the bank across it. In time, there were several propositions of building a proper bridge to the island, though environmentalists are against it. A project for the bridge on two levels to the island was drafted. Designers envisioned that the top level (\\"upper bridge\\") would contain a scenic viewpoint and a restaurant. The idea was abandoned. It was partially done because the design for the bridge, made of concrete and wood, didn't take into the account high water levels of the Danube. The project also included construction of the touristic complex on the island. In March 2016, mayor of Belgrade Sini≈°a Mali announced the massive reconstruction of the Old Sava Bridge. However, in May 2017, after the project papers were publicized, it was obvious that the city actually wanted to demolish the bridge completely and build a new one. Citizens protested while the experts rejected the reasons named by the authorities, adding that it would be a waste of money on an unnecessary project. Mali said that the old bridge will not be demolished but moved, and that citizens will decide where, but he gave an idea to move it to Zemun, as the permanent pedestrian bridge to the Great War Island. In an article \\"Cloud over the Great War Island\\", Aleksandar Milenkoviƒá, member of the Academy of Architecture of Serbia, opposed the motion. He expressed fear that having in mind the \\"synchronous ad hoc decisions of the administration\\", the reaction should be prompt as the seemingly benign idea is actually a strategically disastrous enterprise (concerning the protected wildlife on the island). He also suspects that the administration in this case, just as in all previous ones, will neglect the numerous theoretical and empirical guidelines. The Old Sava Bridge relocation to the Great War Island was ultimately scrapped. In March 2019, city urbanist Marko Stojƒçiƒá said that the bridge will be placed across the Sava, as an extension of the Omladinskih Brigada Street, in the New Belgrade's Block 70-A, and that it will connect it with Ada Ciganlija. In June 2018, architect Bojan Kovaƒçeviƒá stated that Mali got the idea of connecting the island because of the meeting held several month before, where the Eagle Hills company, an investor of the highly controversial Belgrade Waterfront project, discussed with the city officials a possibility of construction on the island. The project should include the private villas, golf courses and a de lux hotel. During the summer season of 2020, group of Zemun's citizens organized petition for the construction of permanent bridge to the island. In September 2020, the municipal administration of Zemun forwarded the preliminary design of the possible bridge, higher than previously designed, to the city administration.  Recent developments  In the early 2000s, speculations concerning the island's future emerged among the public, including the ideas of turning it into a grand amusement park, possible relocation spot for the Belgrade Zoo or that sections of the island should be leased to the cultural representatives of the different countries which would turn each section into ethno-park of their native culture, in which case the island would be renamed to Dunavsko ostrvo (Danube Island), but all this was dropped in 2005 when it was finally decided that the island should remain intact. In 2002, the island was declared a natural fish spawning area and declared practically the only part of the City of Belgrade where building of facilities like hotels, motels or restaurants is not allowed. The major works on the island began in 2007. In February 2007, following the disastrous 2006 European floods which wiped out Lido from the northern tip of the island, the Great War Island was completely cleaned with all the bulky junk being removed, so as the remains of the old constructions and the 24-hour guarding service was set. Celebrating the June 29, the international Danube Day, an ecology camp made of pile dwellings for students of the Belgrade University was opened. The floods also heavily damaged the flora and the fauna, and it took several years for them to recuperate. In August 2007, digging of a canal which reconnected Veliki Galija≈° with the Danube also began to prevent the seasonal drying of the lake. A lookout is to be erected west of Veliki Galija≈° so as the entire network of visitor centers on the unsinkable points around the lake and throughout the island for the studying of the bird life. A bio-laboratory and the small boat landing are also scheduled for construction. Organization of the musical \\"Eho festival\\" (De Phazz, Morcheeba, Sonic Youth) on the island in early 2003, despite 80,000 visitors, ultimately ended disastrously because of the bad weather and the financial shenanigans of the organizers. In July 2018 a \\"Belgreat Festival 2018\\" was suddenly announced, with participation of Felix da Housecat, Goldie and Cristian Varela, among others. As the island is now protected, the Ministry for environmental protection announced it will block the organization of the festival, so the organizers, citing \\"technical difficulties\\", relocated to the \\"Barutana\\" club, in the Belgrade Fortress. In September 2019, city government announced that nothing will be built on the island. A new Detailed Regulatory Plan was adopted, by which the city plans to raise the percentage of green areas in Belgrade from 15% to 25%, including further forestation of the Great War Island, with reinsurance that everything will be done to \\"keep and preserve\\" the island.

For example, a Soviet-produced copy of the 6L6 was originally manufactured in the 1940s under its American designation (in Latin lettering), or sometimes a Cyrillic transcription of it, 6–õ6. Under the above convention the tube was redesignated 6P3S (Russian: 6–ü3–°). The 6V6 tube became 6P6S (Russian: 6–ü6–°). However, many specialised Russian tubes, such as special military or transmitter tubes, do not follow the above convention. Some of the better-known Russian equivalents of West European and American tubes are the 6P14P (Russian: 6–ü14–ü), an EL84; 6N8S (Russian: 6–ù8–°), a 6SN7; and 6P3S-E (Russian: 6–ü3–°-–ï), a version of the 6L6.

This unit is considered to be a group in Arizona. Part of the Colorado Plateau and Basin and Range, this red sandstone was laid down in the Lower TriassicFillmore 2011, p.144 and possibly part of the Middle Triassic, around 240 million years ago.Lucas 2017 History of investigation Moenkopi Wash in Coconino County, Arizona (1914). There is no designated type locality for this formation. It was named for a development at the mouth of Moencopie Wash in the Grand Canyon area by Ward in 1901.Ward 1901 In 1917 a 'substitute' type locality was located by Gregory in the wall of the Little Colorado Canyon, about 5 miles below Tanner Crossing in Coconino County, Arizona. While in the Great Basin, Bassler and Reeside characterized and named the Rock Canyon Conglomerate, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib Shale members in 1921.Bassler and Reeside 1921 Salt Creek (later replaced by Wupatki and Moqui Members) and the Holbrook Member were found and named in the Black Mesa basin by Hager in 1922. The Sinbad Limestone Member was named in the Paradox Basin by Gilluly and Reeside in 1928. Gregory named the Timpoweap Member in the Plateau sedimentary province in 1948. The Wupatki Member was first used in the Plateau sedimentary province and its age was modified to Early and Middle(?) Triassic by McKee in 1951.McKee 1951 Contacts were revised by Robeck in 1956 and Cooley in 1958. The Tenderfoot, Ali Baba, Sewemup, and Pariott Members were named in the Piceance and Uinta Basins by Shoemaker and Newman in 1959.Shoemaker and Newman 1959 The Hoskinnini Member was assigned in the Black Mesa and Paradox basins by Stewart in 1959.Stewart 1959 Contacts were revised again by Schell and Yochelson in 1966. Blakey named the Black Dragon, Torrey, and Moody Canyon members in the Paradox Basin and Plateau sedimentary province in 1974.Blakey 1974 Contacts were revised yet again by Welsh and others in 1979. Kietzke modified the age to Early and Middle Triassic using biostratigraphic dating in 1988. The Anton Chico Member was assigned in the Palo Duro Basin and areal limits set by Lucas and Hunt in 1989.Lucas and Hunt 1989 In 1991 areal limits were set again by Lucas and Hayden. An overview was completed by Lucas in 1991, Sprinkel in 1994, Hintze and Axen in 1995 and later, Huntoon and others.For the whole section, except where noted: GEOLEX database Bibliographic References Description Chimney Rock at Capitol Reef National Park The Moenkopi consists of thinly bedded sandstone, mudstone, and shale, with some limestone in the Capitol Reef area. It has a characteristic deep red color and tends to form slopes and benches. The depositional environment varies from fluvial channel and flooplain deposits in the eastern exposures to tidal mudflats in the Cedar Mesa area to deltaic sandstones and shallow marine limestones at Capitol Reef. In eastern Nevada and northwestern Utah, it thickens dramatically, then transitions to the Woodside, Thaynes, and Mahogony formations.Fillmore 2011, p.143 The general deposition setting was sluggish rivers traversing a flat, featureless coastal plane to the sea. The low relief meant that the shoreline moved great distances with changes of sea level or even with the tides. Thickness varies from a feather edge against the Uncompahgre highlands to the east to over in southwestern Utah. The thickness varies greatly in the Paradox Basin, where the Moenkopi is thin to nonexistent on the crests of salt anticlines and over thick in the corresponding synclines. The Moenkopi rests unconformably on Paleozoic beds and the Chinle Formation in turn rests unconformably on the Moenkopi. Both unconformities are locally angular unconformities.Lucas 2017, p.149 The lower unconformity corresponds to the regional Tr-1 unconformity and the upper to the regional Tr-3 unconformity. The Tr-1 unconformity represents a hiatus of at least 20 million years while Tr-2 represents a hiatus of about 10 million years.Lucas 2017, p.155 Members Members differ considerably from east to west, in part because sandstone beds corresponding to marine transgressions are used to define members to the west but cannot be traced to the east.Fillmore 2011, p.142 In different regions, by ascending stratigraphic order, the members are: Paradox Basin:Fillmore 2011, p.148-154Lucas 2017, p. 151 * Tenderfoot Member. This is everywhere in contact with the Cutler Formation on an angular unconformity. Up to thick, it consists of basal conglomerate, gypsum, massive cliff-forming mudstone and silty sandstone. * Ali Baba Member. This is red conglomeratic sandstone and red siltstone and was laid down by energetic rivers. A distinctive feature is load structures. Sediment sources were apparently the crests of anticlines, and paleocurrent directions are north to northwest, along the corresponding synclines. * Sewemup Member. This is thinly bedded siltstone, shale, and sandstone, with enough gypsum content to give it a light brown color that contrasts with the darker brown Ali Baba Member. * Parriott Member. This is distinguished from the light brown Sewemup Member by its multihued brown, red, orange and purple strata. Exposures are geographically limited, appearing only in Richardson Amphitheater, Castle Valley, Sinbad Valley, and Big Bend meander of the Colorado River. This member may be separated from the Sewemup Member by a regional unconformity. Canyonlands and Glen Canyon area: * Hoskinnini Member: Sandstone and siltstone. Found only in the southern part of the area. * Black Dragon Member. Consists of a basal conglomerate; thinly bedded red sandstone, siltstone, and shale deposited in a tidal flat environment; a sandstone sheet; and a second sequence of tidal flat deposits. * Sinbad Limestone Member. Named for the Sinbad region in the San Rafael Swell. Consists of yellowish limestone deposited by a brief marine transgression. * Torrey Member. Red beds signifying a return to subaerial deposition. * Moody Canyon Member. Thinly bedded slope forming siltstone and mudstone with minor evaporites. San Juan Basin and Tucumcari: * Anton Chico Member. Described previously as the red sandstone member of the Santa Rosa Formation, but placed in its own formation after it was recognized to be middle Triassic in age. Subsequently named as a member of the Moenkopi when its beds were traced west and demonstrated that it was deposited in a single basin with Moenkopi beds in Arizona.

A diverse fossil vertebrate fauna has been described from the Moenkopi Formation, mainly from the Wupatki Member and Holbrook Member of northern Arizona. Described basal vertebrates include freshwater hybodont sharks, coelacanths, and lungfish. Temnospondyl amphibians are a common component of the fauna. Temnospondyli include Eocyclotosaurus, Quasicyclotosaurus, Wellesaurus, Vigilius, and Cosgriffius. The rhynchosaur Ammorhynchus is known, but rare. Anisodontosaurus is an enigmatic reptile only known from a few tooth-bearing jaws. The poposauroid archosaur Arizonasaurus is known from one relatively complete skeleton and a significant amount of other isolated material. Footprints and several fragmentary body fossils are known from dicynodonts. The footprints of Cheirotherium and Rhynchosauroides are common in the Wupatki Member.

He was a son of a respected family in Upper Silesia. His life was marked by abortive studies, alcoholism, depression and suicide attempts, the last one of which was successful. His short career took place during the turbulent years of modern Poland when the younger generation began to realize that they were trapped in a mendacious political system. Other Polish poets and writers with comparable biographies include Edward Stachura, Marek H≈Çasko and Tadeusz Borowski.  Work  Wojaczek's work translates the political and practical circumstances of life in Poland into universal and existential terms. His lyrical subject is often preoccupied with the brutality of the physical body along with its suffering and pleasures. By placing the physicality and sexuality of the individual in the context of the practical and political he achieves a depth of erotic and existential expression. His work has been compared by some to that of Lautr√©amont and Rimbaud, but was strongly connected with international trends of his time, particularly confessional poetry and the Beats. His earlier work was chiefly what Robert Lowell would have referred to as \\"raw,\\" but his late style became well \\"cooked,\\" with increasing attention to structure and subtle rhyme schemes using for example assonance between related (but not identical) Polish vowels, with no loss of emotional intensity. Wojaczek debuted with seven poems in the very first issue of the poetry journal Poezja (December 1965).Poezja, vol. 1 issue 1, pp. 66-71 (Warsaw, December 1965) Individual volumes of poetry include: *Sezon (Season), 1969 *Inna bajka (Another Tale), 1970 *Nie sko≈Ñczona krucjata (Unfinished Crusade), 1972 *Kt√≥rego nie by≈Ço (Who Was Not), 1972 Wojaczek's collected works were published by PIW in 1999Wiersze (Poems), ed.

This genus is abbreviated as Crths in horticultural trade. They are native to South America, Central America, Mexico and Trinidad.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Bucket orchids are an excellent example of coevolution and mutualism, as the orchids have evolved along with orchid bees (the tribe Euglossini of the family Apidae) and both depend on each other for reproduction. One to three flowers are borne on a pendant stem that comes from the base of the pseudobulbs. The flower secretes a fluid (see Coryanthes alborosea picture) into the flower lip, which is shaped like a bucket. The male orchid bees (not the females) are attracted to the flower by a strong scent from aromatic oils, which they store in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent in their courtship dances in order to attract females. The bees, trying to get the waxy substance containing the scent, sometimes fall to the fluid-filled bucket. As they are trying to escape, they find that there are some small knobs on which they can climb on, while the rest of the lip is lined with smooth, downward- pointing hairs, upon which their claws cannot find a grip. The knobs lead to a spout (see the Coryanthes leucocorys picture), but as the bee is trying to escape, the spout constricts. At that same moment, the small packets containing the pollen of the orchid get pressed against the thorax of the bee. However, the glue on the pollen packets does not set immediately, so the orchid keeps the bee trapped until the glue has set. Once the glue has set, the bee is let free and he can now dry his wings and fly off. His ordeal may have taken as long as forty-five minutes. Hopefully, the bee will go to another flower, where, if the flower is to be successful at reproducing, the bee falls once again into the bucket of the same species. This time the pollen packets get stuck to the stigma as the bee is escaping, and after a while the orchid will produce a seed pod. The bee, having stored the aromatic oils in his back legs, can then fly off to mate with a female bee. History Some of the first investigations on Coryanthes were published by Cruger in 1865.H. Cruger (1865) A few notes on the fecundation of orchids and their morphology. J.

However, Darwin thought it was the female bees that were doing the fertilizing, and it was almost 100 years before the role of the male euglossine bees were revealed in 1961.Dodson, C. H. and G.P.

A mutant, Hope attended the Xavier Institute before its closing. She retained her powers after M-Day and is a member of the X-Men's training squad. Fictional character biography Hope was raised in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. When Hope's powers manifested, it appeared as if a ghost had come out of her body, giving her father a heart attack. She was then sent to the Xavier Institute by her parents believing that she would be \\"cured.\\"Comic Book Resources Wolverine: Killing Made Simple Preview While at the Institute, Hope was put in the Paragons Squad under the watch of Wolfsbane. Hope then took on the codename Trance. When it was outed that Wolfsbane and a student (Elixir) had been in a relationship, Wolfsbane decided to leave. Magma then took over as the squad's advisor. When the events of Decimation transpired, she was one of only 27 students to keep her powers. Greatly weakened by the losses, Emma Frost placed all of the remaining students into an all-out brawl to determine who would become the team of X-Men in-training. Hope did not make the team yet, like all of the other students who retained their powers, still resides at the Institute. In response to M-Day, the government began gathering all information they had on the remaining mutants. Additionally, the Sentinel Squad O*N*E, a team of human- piloted Sentinels, was sent to \\"watch over\\" the X-Men and the handful of refugees symbolically known as The 198. According to said files, Hope was willing to work with other mutants in training sessions but had not yet received any combat experience. Hope's interests include old films, House Music, classical music and Psytrance and it appears she is rather culturally sophisticated. Her classmates voted her 'best-dressed' in the yearbook. Quest for Magik Trance is among the students who were captured by Belasco and transported to Limbo. As per X-23's request, Trance uses her astral projection to warn the students who weren't captured of Belasco's return. Thanks to Trance, the students were successfully saved and brought back by the X-Men. Messiah Complex Trance was present at the Institute when Predator X attacked the school. Trance barely got out of the way in time. Unfortunately the school was shut down and all the students were sent home. Killing Made Simple Blindfold had a vision and informed the X-Men that Trance was going to be in trouble. While having dinner with her family, Trance's home was attacked by Orphan-Maker on Nanny's orders, but Trance wasn't his target, her parents were. Luckily Wolverine had been sent by the X-Men to watch over her. Springing to action, Wolverine tries to fight off Orphan Maker but is overpowered. With a change of plans, Trance and Wolverine are kidnapped. Trance is later seen tied to a chair with Wolverine chained to the ground. Trance, believing that Wolverine will save them, refuses to use her powers. After realizing that Wolverine cannot help her, she astral projects outside her body and begins blasting Nanny and Orphan-Maker. The two villains eventually eject in an escape pod, leaving the ship to crash. Using her energy blasts, Trance disables the self-destruct timer. The ship crashes in a lake, but Trance and Wolverine are safe. Utopia Trance later relocates to San Francisco along with all the other X-Men.X-Men: Manifest Destiny #2 Trance is seen with Dragoness and Toad, who are being pursued by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. After Dragoness is taken out, Trance goes into her astral form only to have her power disrupted when her body is shot with tasers. Gambit shows up and knocks out the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. Trance, in her astral form, lies on the ground asking for help when Ariel and Onyxx appear and take her body away to safety. Later, Mindee Cuckoo informs Rogue that Trance never made it back to base and that she is detecting Trance's thoughts somewhere downtown, prompting Rogue and her team to search for her.X-Men: Legacy #226 Trance's power disrupted Ariel's attempt to teleport her to safety. Rogue finds Trance and her powers are flaring out of control creating powerful uncontrollable bio-electric blasts. Rogue tries to help calm Trance and help her gain control when Ms Marvel appears. After taking out Gambit and Danger, Rogue and Ms Marvel fight, unfortunately Rogue is losing until Trance regains control and jumps in to help Rogue. Trance learns that her astral form is able to punch Ms Marvel when they are both intangible. After Gambit stuns Ms Marvel, they teleport back to base where Trance receives medical attention.X-Men: Legacy #227 Necrosha Trance is seen with Husk and the New X-Men battling the resurrected Synch and Skin. X-Force, vol. 3 #22 Trance is part of a team of X-Men that investigates Blindfold's vision about Muir Island.X-Men: Legacy #231 Trance, along with most other members of this team, is briefly possessed by Proteus when he attacks. This possession is interrupted by Rogue's use of Psylocke's psychic knife.X-Men: Legacy #232 The team eventually defeats Proteus before returning to Utopia. Second Coming During the events of Second Coming, Cannonball recruits Trance along with Northstar, Dazzler, Anole, Gambit, and Pixie on a mission to recover Magik from Limbo. Hope is initially reluctant to accept this mission, but agrees to go as long as she can leave her body on Earth.X-Men: Second Coming Revelations‚ÄîHellbound #1 Upon arriving in Limbo, the team becomes separated when they are overwhelmed by Limbo's demonic inhabitants. Trance fights alongside Pixie and tries to protect Pixie from the influence of Magik's demon, N'Astirh. The effort, however, causes Trance to disappear from Limbo and reawaken in her body in Utopia.X-Men: Second Coming Revelations‚ÄîHellbound #2 Wolverine and the X-Men Trance is currently a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. X-Men Regenesis Powers and abilities Trance using her powers Trance has the power of astral projection and as her code name suggests, she goes into some kind of altered state of consciousness or somehow otherwise nullifies her body in order to release her astral self. This observation was further affirmed when she asked Emma Frost if she could leave her body outside the danger room during an exercise. Her astral form is capable of flight and can pass through magic barriers. Her astral form was able to physically punch Moonstone's intangible form. Trance's astral form is additionally able to project destructive energy. When hit with tasers by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents during X-Men: Legacy #226 in the middle of entering her trance state, her powers flare out of control, disrupting Ariel's attempt to teleport her to safety. She also creates arcing energy surges that stun soldiers and even bend nearby metal and concrete. According to Danger and Rogue, this appears to be a new part of her power which she has not learned to control.X-Men: Legacy #226‚Äì227 She can also perceive auras and energy patterns that are invisible to the naked human eye such as the emotional state of others from their auras, heat signatures and energy patterns in the air. Doctor Nemesis further speculates that Trance's powers seem to react to spatial warps and energy fields; however, he doesn't know if this is a permanent or a temporary development.X-Men: Legacy #228 Television * She appears in the episode Greetings from Genosha from Wolverine and the X-Men.

Minority groups not falling within either large group mostly speak languages belonging to the Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman language families, and mostly live around Ladakh and Northeast India, Nepal, Bhutan and the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh. The Andamanese (Sentinel, Onge, Jarawa, Great Andamanese) live on some of the Andaman Islands and speak a language isolate, as do the Kusunda in central Nepal,D.E. Watters, Notes on Kusunda (a language isolate of Nepal), Kathmandu 2005 the Vedda in Sri Lanka, and the Nihali of central India, who number about 5,000 people. The people of the Hunza valley in Pakistan are another distinct population. They speak Burushaski, a language isolate. The traditions of different ethnic groups in South Asia have diverged, influenced by external cultures, especially in the northwestern parts of South Asia and also in the border regions and busy ports, where there are greater levels of contact with external cultures. There is also a lot of genetic diversity within the region. For example, most of the ethnic groups of the northeastern parts of South Asia are genetically related to peoples of East or Southeast Asia. There are also genetically isolated groups who have not been genetically influenced by other groups such as the Jarawa people of the Andaman Islands. The largest ethno-linguistic group in South Asia are the Indo-Aryans, numbering around 1 billion, and the largest sub-group are the native speakers of Hindi languages, numbering more than 470 million. These groups are based solely on a linguistic basis and not on a genetic basis.

Goel writes that he had strong Marxist leanings as a student. He read Karl Marx's The Communist Manifesto and almost joined the Communist Party of India. In these years, he \\"came to the conclusion that while Marx stood for a harmonised social system, Sri Aurobindo held the key to a harmonised human personality.\\" Conversion through Trauma During Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, Goel \\"would have been killed by a Muslim mob\\" were it not for his command of Urdu and the Western clothes he wore averting any \\"suspicion\\" he was actually Hindu. Goel writes that on the evening of the 17th, he, his wife and son \\"had to vacate that house and scale a wall at the back to escape murderous Muslim mobs advancing with firearms.\\" One of the biggest influences on Goel was the author Ram Swarup. Goel became more and more interested in Hinduism: \\"Sanatana Dharma called upon its votary to explore his own self in the first instance and see for himself the truths expounded in sacred scriptures. Prophets and churches and scriptures could be aids but never the substitutes for self exploration, self purification, and self transcendence.\\" He therefore finally became a Hindu: :I had come back at last, come back to my spiritual home from which I had wandered away in self forgetfulness. But this coming back was no atavistic act. On the contrary, it was a reawakening to my ancestral heritage which was waiting all along for me to lay my claim on its largesses. It was also the heritage of all mankind as proved by the seers, sages and mystics of many a time and clime. It spoke in different languages to different people. To me it spoke in the language of Hindu spirituality and Hindu culture at their highest. I could not resist its call. I became a Hindu.

The Seattle-based company was founded in 2004, and went public in Aug. 2017. Glenn Kelman is the CEO. Redfin's business model is based on sellers paying Redfin a small fee, either 1 or 1.5% to list the seller's home. This does not include an additional fee charged to the seller to compensate the brokerage representing the buyer. This latter fee usually is in the 2.5-3.0% range. Customers who buy with Redfin are only charged 1% to list their home (typically 3%). Buyers who buy with Redfin also get a portion of the brokerages commission back (called the Redfin Refund) that can be applied to their closing costs or in the form of a check after they close on their home. History Redfin was founded in 2004 by David Eraker, Michael Dougherty, and David Selinger. David Eraker, who had dropped out of the University of Washington's medical school for a career in software design, was inspired by his own real estate misadventures and founded Redfin with hopes of upending the traditional brokerage model. Unlike the other major real estate web portals (Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com), which get the majority of their earnings from advertising and lead generation, Redfin operates as a brokerage and makes money when users buy or sell homes with its real estate agents. Redfin began offering online, map-based real estate search when David Eraker, who was working out of his apartment in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, and his partner, Michael Dougherty, an electrical engineer with a degree from Yale, struck upon the idea of displaying homes for sale on an online map. This was before the introduction of Google Maps or Microsoft's Bing Maps. Redfin combined satellite maps with real estate information, and helped overcome the limitations of online real estate search systems at the time. David Selinger, who had previously led the research and development arm of Amazon's Data Mining and Personalization team, joined Redfin as the third founder and the CTO. Selinger helped build Redfin's mapping and real estate data analytics engine. Redfin headquarters are in the Hill7 Building, in South Lake Union, Seattle. After receiving $1 million in initial financing from Madrona Venture Group, Redfin raised $8 million in Series B funding from Vulcan Inc., the investment arm of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in May 2006. In April 2006, CNN reported that Redfin had received threats from competitors seeking to \\"break their kneecaps.\\" In July 2006, Redfin was the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award by Inman News, a leading online news source for the real estate industry. Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman accepted a third round of funding for $12 million from Greylock and Draper Fisher Jurvetson in July 2007. In May 2007, just a few days after appearing on 60 Minutes, Redfin was fined $50,000 by The Northwest Multiple Listing Service and was forced to shut down its \\"Sweet Digs\\" blog, which used to contain reviews of the homes on the market. Northwest MLS said that such reviews are not allowed under Multiple Listing Service (MLS) rules. Sweet Digs was relaunched in June 2007 with an analytical format, and covered all the markets Redfin served. Redfin stopped publishing Sweet Digs in 2008. In May 2010, Redfin won the Seattle 2.0 award for \\"Best Startup\\". Redfin began an automatic agent rating system in 2012, which drew criticism for using inaccurate data, and pulled its tool from the market. In October 2012, Redfin was named one of The DIGITAL 100: World's Most Valuable Private Tech Companies by Business Insider. In July 2013, Inman News again named Redfin as the recipient of the Innovator of the Year award. In June 2014, Seattle Business Magazine recognized Redfin as the best company to work for in 2014 in the Large Companies category and Redfin was placed number 1 out of 21 large Seattle- based companies. In 2017, Redfin was named the number 1 tech company to work for in Seattle by Hired.com and the #9 best company to work for in Seattle by USA Today. The firm has participated in several subsequent funding rounds, raising $50 million in a mezzanine round led by T. Rowe Price and Tiger Global, bringing its total venture funding to slightly over $96 million. In December 2014, Redfin raised another $70.9 million to help expand its software-powered real-estate business across the U.S. The round was led by Wellington Management Co. and Glynn Capital Management, among others, and includes Brothers Brook, Annox Capital Management and previous investors Tiger Global Management and T. Rowe Price. Redfin went public on July 28, 2017. The IPO raised $138 million. The offering priced at $15 a share, above the expected price range of $12 to $14. Redfin's stock closed at $21.72 on the first day of trading, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.73 billion. In 2019, Redfin partnered with Opendoor, an online real estate company, for a service similar to RedfinNow in order to reach more customers. Referral Partner Program Where Redfin cannot or refuses to directly serve consumers, the company relies on a referral network of over 3,100 agents at other brokerages. In 2017 out of 7,733 of Redfin's real estate transactions originated 2,041 were completed by its referral network. Referral agents pay Redfin when they close referred transactions, less the amount of any refund payments Redfin may make to customers. Once Redfin refers a customer to a partner agent, that agent, not Redfin, represents the customer from the initial meeting through closing, at which point the agent pays Redfin a portion of her commission as a referral fee. Redfin currently charges a 30% referral fee from agents that participate in this program. Referral fees lead to an inefficiency known as \\"reverse competition\\" where referring brokers end up competing not for the consumer attention but for the attention of middle- man who steers the consumer toward its network of brokers and away from competitors. Such steering may result in lower quality of service or higher commissions, fees, and price levels.Barlow Burke. \\"Law of Real Estate Brokers\\" Aspen Publishers Online, 2007 Some real estate agents advocate that referral fee brokers make consumers a commodity that the referral broker is selling to another agent. Exclusive Referral Partnership With Remax On March 18, 2019, Redfin and Remax announced an exclusive referral program. On May 13 of the same year, the companies announced that the partnership would end.

It creates a number of public order offences. They replace similar common law offences and parts of the Public Order Act 1936. It implements recommendationsThe Law Commission. Criminal Law: Offences relating to Public Order (Law Com 123). HMSO. 1983. of the Law Commission.  Background  Before the introduction of the Public Order Act 1986, policing public order was based on various relevant common law offences, and the Public Order Act 1936. Several factors influenced the introduction of the Public Order Act 1986. Significant public disorder, such as the Southall riot in 1979, the Brixton riot that extended to other cities in 1981, and the national miner's strike and associated disorder between 1984 and 1985 ‚Äì in particular the Battle of Orgreave in June 1984 ‚Äì and the Battle of the Beanfield in June 1985. Furthermore, the 1983 Law Commission report, Criminal Law: Offences Relating to Public Order recommended updating the law. The Law Commission stated its desire to further to extend the codification of the law in England and Wales. It advocated the abolition of the common law offences of affray, riot, rout, and unlawful assembly. It argued the changes it recommended to public order legislation made it more practical to use, and make the law more comprehensible to the courts and juries. The long title of the Act details the intention of the Public Order Act 1986: Offences=Part 1 ‚Äì New offences ;Section 1 ‚Äì Riot ;Section 2 ‚Äì Violent disorder ;Section 3 ‚Äì Affray ;Section 4 ‚Äì Fear or provocation of violence ;Section 4A ‚Äì Intentional harassment, alarm or distress: added by section 154 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 ;Section 5 ‚Äì Harassment, alarm or distress =Section 8 ‚Äì Interpretation= This section defines the words \\"dwelling\\" and \\"violence\\". =Section 9 ‚Äì Offences abolished= Section 9(1) abolished the common law offences of riot, rout, unlawful assembly and affray.

It was reported that under section 5 alone, 51,285 people were convicted between 2001 and 2003, 8,489 of whom were between 10 and 17 years of age. The campaign was supported by a range of groups and famous individuals. These included the National Secular Society, the Christian Institute, the Bow Group, Big Brother Watch, the Peter Tatchell Foundation and The Freedom Association. Actors Rowan Atkinson and Stephen Fry also voiced their support. In 2013, a House of Lords amendment to a forthcoming Crime and Court Bill meant the removal of \\"insulting\\" from the definition of section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986.

Continental collision is still going on, with the Apulian and European plates still converging. The central zones of the Alps are rising too, causing vertical slip along the fault.

In the Web3D Consortium members from governmental, nonprofit and research organizations worldwide, working alongside individual professional members, collaborate in a consensus process encouraging development and implementation of open standards for 3D content and services. The Web3D Consortium promotes deployment of X3D standards for the communication of 3D scenes in multiple applications, use cases, platforms, and verticals. Members collaboratively develop the X3D standards and tools making them widely adopted across diverse markets for academia, government, industry, and individuals. The Web3D Consortium offers robust ISO standardized 3D functionality and long-term stability for enterprise solutions and interoperability with other 3D standards. The Consortium defines and develops the X3D royalty-free open standards file format and runtime architecture to represent and communicate 3D scenes. The development of 3D web-based graphics has evolved from its beginnings as the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) to Extensible 3D (X3D). Over recent years, advances in real time graphics and networking technology, and most notably the emergence of the Extensible Markup Language XML, have heavily influenced the development of the ISO-approved, freely available, X3D open standard. X3D embodies best practices in commercial real time graphics within the widely adopted framework of the World Wide Web family of technologies and standards and has no intellectual property restrictions. It provides a system for the storage, retrieval and playback of real time graphics content embedded in applications, all within an open architecture to support a wide array of domains and user scenarios. Web3D applications have been active for some time. Previously known as the VRML Consortium, this community spearheaded the development of the VRML 1.0 and 2.0 specifications, which provide the basis for the development of associated applications. The organizations involved in this effort felt that the creation of an open consortium focused exclusively on Web3D would provide the structure necessary to stabilize, standardize, and nurture the technology for the entire community. Today, the Web3D Consortium is utilizing its broad-based industry support to develop the X3D specification as a successor to VRML for communicating 3D on the web, between applications and across distributed networks and web services. Related to its educational mission, the Consortium maintains an extensive website of documents and links related to VRML and X3D resources, including plugins and browsers from many long-term members and open source developers.

It includes the anteaters and sloths, including the extinct ground sloths, which became extinct about 10,000 years ago. The name comes from the Latin word for \\"hairy\\". Pilosans are good examples of ecological harmony. Anteaters, for example, feed lightly and for a short time at any one ant nest, allowing the colony to regrow easily. Also, sloths' fur is home to many insects, as well as a type of alga that helps camouflage the sloths.  Origins and taxonomy  The biogeographic origins of the Pilosa are still unclear,A proposed clade, Atlantogenata, would include Xenarthra and early African mammals. but they can be traced back in South America as far as the early Paleogene (about 60 million years ago, only a short time after the end of the Mesozoic Era). The presence of these animals in Central America and their former presence in North America is a result of the Great American Interchange. A number of sloths were also formerly present on the Antilles, which they reached from South America by some combination of rafting or floating with the prevailing currents. Together with the armadillos, which are in the order Cingulata, pilosans are part of the larger superorder Xenarthra, a defining characteristic of which is the presence of xenarthrals (extra formations between lumbar vertebrae). In the past, Pilosa was regarded as a suborder of the order Xenarthra, while some more recent classifications regard Pilosa as an order within the superorder Xenarthra. Earlier still, both armadillos and pilosans were classified together with pangolins and the aardvark as the order Edentata (meaning toothless, because the members do not have front incisor teeth or molars, or have poorly developed molars). Edentata was subsequently realized to be polyphyletic; it contained unrelated families and was thus invalid.

The Berkeley family of Berkeley Castle (which lost its titles of Baron Berkeley and Earl of Berkeley in 1882 and 1942 respectively) still owns the Berkeley hounds and the kennels. Country The \\"hill country\\" above Dursley and Wotton-under-Edge is hunted mainly in March and early April, and adjoins the Duke of Beaufort's estate. The \\"vale country\\" comprises the Vale of Berkeley, largely dairy and stock farms with much permanent pasture, although the use of this land for growing crops is increasing. Relationship with the Old Berkeley Hunt At one time the Berkeley Hunt's hounds were kennelled at Berkeley and at Cheltenham, Nettlebed, Gerrards Cross and Cranford, Middlesex. It should have been possible to hunt from Berkeley Castle to Wormwood Scrubs, 100 miles as the crow flies, although not on a regular basis without disturbing other hunts. This wide range of activity may have begun by the Berkeleys taking their hounds to London each year. In the late 18th century, the fifth Earl of Berkeley lost most of his land in and around Middlesex. The country around Cheltenham and Broadway became Cotswold, North Cotswold and Cotswold Vale Farmer's Hunt. Gerrards Cross and Cranford retained the old livery and became known as the Old Berkeley Hunt. They were later divided into East and West. After the Hunting Act Although \\"hunting wild mammals with a dog\\" was made unlawful in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, which came into effect in 2005,Hunting Act 2004 , text online at opsi.gov.uk a number of exemptions stated in Schedule 1 of the 2004 Act permit some previously unusual forms of hunting wild mammals with dogs to continue, such as \\"hunting... for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal\\".Stephen Moss, \\"The banned rode on: Eighteen months ago hunting was banned. Or was it?\\" from The Guardian dated 7 November 2006, at guardian.co.uk, accessed 29 April 2013 The Berkeley stresses that its present-day hunting is within the exemptions permitted by law and the death of any fox is absolutely accidental and coincidental to its legal activities and definitely not the purpose of said activities. Lending a name : The Old Berkeley Hunt developed a large following among the prosperous London middle classes: * The slang term \\"berk\\" is a contraction of \\"Berkeley Hunt\\", which in turn refers to the English vulgarity \\"cunt\\" (the usage is dated to the 1930s).Jonathon Green, Cassell's Dictionary of Slang (Cassel & Co.) . It is an example of Cockney rhyming slang. The \\"berk\\" in Berkeley is pronounced , but in Cockney it is pronounced , as in American English. * The Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessel HMS Berkeley was named after the hunt. * Berkeley Square in London is named after the family.

He was a U.S. Representative from 1959 to 1973 and alderman from the 41st Ward of Chicago from 1973 to 1991. He was considered a longtime leader of Chicago Polonia and was seen to represent its interests in Washington along with Congressman Dan Rostenkowski. Early and family life He was born in Buffalo, New York, but moved to Chicago with his family as a child. In 1941, he graduated from Northwestern University. During World War II, he served in the Air Force. After the war, he attended John Marshall Law School in Chicago and graduated in 1949. Career Pucinski worked in journalism for many years, notably at the Chicago Sun- Times. In 1952, he was chief investigator for the Congressional Special Committee which investigated the Katyn Massacre. This was of special interest to him as a Polish-American. In 1958, Pucinski was elected U.S Representative from the heavily Polish-American 11th District on the Northwest Side of Chicago. He was re-elected to six additional terms, serving from 1959 to 1973. As a representative, Pucinski pushed for the installation of \\"black box\\" flight recorders on all passenger airliners and supported federal assistance to community colleges. When congressional districts were redrawn after the 1970 Census, Pucinski's district was dismantled and he did not seek re- election in 1972. Instead, he was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate against incumbent Senator Charles H. Percy; he lost in a landslide. In 1973, he was first elected alderman from the 41st Ward of Chicago, which had been part of his old congressional district and was heavily Polish-American. Pucinski also served as Democratic Ward Committeeman from the 41st Ward for many years. After Mayor Richard J. Daley died in 1976, Pucinski ran in the Democratic primary of the special election to succeed him in 1977, even though the Democratic Party had endorsed Michael Bilandic. Bilandic won, Pucinski was the second-place finisher, and Harold Washington came in third with 11%. During the Council Wars of Harold Washington's first term as mayor, Pucinski was part of the Vrdolyak 29 opposition bloc. In 1987, he proposed requiring employee voting on any Employee Stock Ownership Plan established by a corporation based in Chicago. In 1984, he supported a redistribution of Community Development Block Grant funds that would have allocated $1.3 million to repave streets in the 41st Ward. The 41st Ward usually voted for Republicans and the aging Pucinski was defeated in his campaign for re- election as alderman by Republican Brian Doherty in 1991. Death and legacy His daughter Aurelia followed him into law and politics. Pucinski died in Chicago in 2002, and his son Christopher in 2006.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-2006-02-10-0602100250-story.html ReferencesExternal links *Biographical Data * Category:1919 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Politicians from Buffalo, New York Category:Polish-American culture in Chicago Category:Illinois Democrats Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American Roman Catholics Category:Military personnel from Buffalo, New York Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois Category:Chicago City Council members Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:John Marshall Law School (Chicago) alumni Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Catholics from New York (state) ","title":"Roman Pucinski"},{"id":"4439204","text":"onEscapee (Pronounced One Escapee, to reflect the nature of the protagonist) is an action-adventure video game, released for the Amiga in 1997.  History  onEscapee was developed by Invictus Games, Ltd. and published by the UK- Based (and now defunct) Sadeness Software. It was distributed in a CD format, which was unusual for the period since the Amiga 1200 was not fitted with a CD drive. Therefore, the users were required to purchase an additional external CD-ROM drive (or re-house the computer to fit an internal drive) in order to run software from discs. Since Invictus is a Hungarian team, to make the game as international as possible, text and speech was kept to a minimum. As a result, the game has support for over 17 languages. The only language featured in the game is in the music used in the titles and in one scene of the game, the menus, help text and the opening FMV sequence. Invictus re-released the software in 2004 as freeware for the PC to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the company's founding.Oneescapee on invictus.hu (archived 2010) Gameplay onEscapee's gameplay is very similar to Another World and Flashback: The Quest for Identity in gameplay and features similar rotoscoped, hand-drawn graphics.  Differences between PC and Amiga releases  The Amiga release and the PC re-release differ slightly. The player's health bar, for instance, is square in the Amiga version and rounded in the PC version. The pause menu was also re-designed for the PC version, with the ability to name save slots. The Amiga version, perhaps to cater both to those with expanded memory and those running more streamlined systems, features a \\"normal\\" and \\"fast\\" mode, with the game running noticeably smoother under \\"fast\\" mode. This feature was omitted from the PC re-release, which appears to run in \\"normal\\" mode. There also exists an option for \\"Waving\\" (on/off) in the Amiga version which affects wave effects on underwater levels, omitted in favour of a set \\"on\\" status in the PC mode. The Amiga's fading effects when switching screens are gone in the PC version, as well as some of the clarity of graphics; the Amiga version, being written in assemblyhttp://www.classicamiga.com/images/stories/jreviews/games/O/manuals/OnEscapee%5Bmanual%5D%5Bhtml%5D/homepage/onescapee.html to \\"achieve maximum performance\\" contains vector graphics designed for the Amiga hardware in the game and the FMV sequences; the PC version, to save on disc space and ensure reliable speeds, instead relies on pre-rendered video in places.  Plot  Daniel White is reminiscing in a monologue humanity's first encounter with \\"the first aliens\\", talking of how they ushered in \\"new civilisations\\". He goes on to mention how \\"healthy, strong men\\" suddenly began to disappear around the same time. There is a cut to a new video sequence featuring the metropolis where humanity presumably presides. Despite the cities being adequately lit and having the appearance of life, very few other humans feature in the game, with the vast majority of life being either animal or robotic. onEscapee screenshot from the Amiga version. The player, is depicted in battle stance. The character's health meter is located at the top- left. It is unclear where the game is set. Furthermore, there does not appear to be any human influence on the land, with the majority of animal and even plant life taking alien forms. Either this is demonstrating the intrusiveness of the alien culture, or White has landed on the aliens' planet, and it is his destiny to become an \\"escapee\\" and return to earth. If this is the case, a similar plot can be found in Flashback: The Quest for Identity. The player sees an unlabelled automotive flying from the city into a more aerial location, with mountains visible in the background. It appears that the two drivers in the front have captured a male (White) who is in the back. As they drive, however, White wakes up and begins to struggle, causing the driver to lose control and crash. The player's sight is then diverted to a console view of a garbage disposal droid, which lists all three occupants of the automotive as dead and sends a unit to clear the wreckage. After navigating his way through a series of caves and procuring a firearm, a gun similar to that of Another World which allows the player both to fire and activate a temporary shield, White moves into a forest area populated with what appears to be alien wildlife. From there, he makes his way through to an alien base. White fights his way through the base, coming into first contact with the aliens' arsenal of robotic guards. Using his gun and the smattering of health regenerators, White eventually fights a boss who takes the form of himself. After defeating him, however, the shape-shifter assumes a much more threatening Grim Reaper- style form with wings and a cane. This character, who goes unnamed throughout the game, will chase White at intervals, and will vaporise him upon contact. After taking an elevator, White finds himself in the metropolis itself. He must find a variety of strategically placed levers to unlock a door leading to what appears to be a landing strip. Along the way he fights robots and avoids guard-dogs and people piloting what appear to be flying motorcycles, as well as mobile gun turrets and aliens with grenades. Upon unlocking the exit, the boss from the previous level begins chase and, blinded by his panic, White dives off the end of the landing strip onto the rocks, where he loses consciousness. The following morning White regains consciousness and must dive into a stream, falling down a waterfall before he can progress any further. After locating an upgrade to his gun in a water maze, he finds a passage leading to a warehouse. Inside he remarks upon the boss, cane in-hand, watching from a distance as other humans co-operate on construction of some form of aircraft. White scales the vast warehouse, destroying a machine that lies in his way and littering the floor in components. After finding the other humans occupying the warehouse, he surrenders the equipment and the humans accept him as an ally. After implanting him with a thermometer to measure his vital signs, they board the craft. Upon the course of distracting the boss, White dives underwater, which causes the thermometer to display a reading akin to death. The crew, thus, release a rocket aimed at their origin intended to kill the boss. His job done, White emerges from the water, his thermometer returning to normal levels. At this point the crew realise their terrible mistake, and White is killed in the blast that also destroys the boss, guaranteeing the safety of the other three human escapees, although sealing his own fate on the planet he had tried to vacate.

It is often abbreviated as PoFV in English speaking circles. Phantasmagoria of Flower View, like the third Touhou game Phantasmagoria of Dim. Dream, differs from other games in the series in that two equally matched characters fight competitively instead of one player clearing stage bosses. In this regard, the gameplay most resembles Twinkle Star Sprites by ADK.  Gameplay  A match between Sakuya (left) and Medicine (right). Medicine has just launched a spell card attack which shows up on Sakuya's screen Phantasmagoria of Flower View is a competitive vertical danmaku shoot 'em up, in which two characters engage in moderate-to-heavy danmaku gameplay within individual and separate play areas (aka. split-screen). Upon meeting certain conditions, players are able to unleash a variety of character-specific Spell Attacks upon their opponents in an attempt to whittle down their remaining lives, in a manner like versus puzzle games such as Puyo Puyo. In the Story Mode, the player will face 9 increasingly intelligent AI opponents, each more capable than the last. The Extra Mode is basically the same except the player is only given one life at the beginning and the enemies are invincible for a period of time. Phantasmagoria of Flower View also features a Match Play Mode in which the player may face off against individual AI opponents or compete against other human players, as well as observe AI vs. AI matches. With the netplay patch, multiplayer is also possible through LAN or over the Internet.  Plot  Spring has arrived in the oriental enclave of Gensokyo, but this year's spring is just too strong to believe. Every plant is in full bloom, even out-of-season flowers and bamboo trees, and consequently the fairies and creatures are becoming hyperactive. This completely unnatural spring prompted the heroines to set out, either to try to find out the reason behind the hyperactive spring, or just to wander around for lack of better things to do. The incident, as it turns out, is a natural occurrence that happens once every sixty years, or one sexagenary cycle. Once every sixty years, something major happens in the outside world and fills Gensokyo with ghosts, who then infest flowers and make them bloom all over. Right from the beginning, it is not a cause of concern at all.

A total of 16 characters are available to play, among them: all are playable in the Match Mode, 12 are playable in the Story Mode, and 2 are playable in the Extra Mode. *: The miko of the Hakurei Shrine. She goes out to investigate the massive blooming of flowers, thinking that if she doesn't do something about it others will think she's slacking, since it's her duty to solve these problems. *: An ordinary magician. She sets out to find out about the flowers simply because she is bored. *: The maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion who's become playable in all games up to this one after her introduction in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. She didn't sense any danger with the flowers, so she collects tea along with her investigation. *: A half-ghost from the Netherworld from the game Perfect Cherry Blossom. The ghost princess of the Netherworld, Yuyuko, wasn't interested in investigating the flower outbreak, so Youmu goes off on her own. *: A rabbit from the moon who now resides in Eientei from the game Imperishable Night. The rabbits of Eientei became restless because of the blooming flowers so Reisen decides to investigate, and on the way tries to look for Tei, who went missing. *: An ice fairy of the lake who was introduced in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Since the flowers are making the fairies excited, she sets out to enjoy herself amid the excitement. In the manual of the game, the creator ZUN labelled her as \\"‚ë® Idiot\\" (‚ë®„Éê„Ç´, baka) in a screenshot. Since then, the symbol ‚ë® (pronounced \\"maruky≈´\\" in Japanese or \\"nineball\\" in English) gained notoriety as a shorthand for Cirno and \\"idiot\\" in Touhou fandom. *: The keyboardist of the Prismriver Sisters from Perfect Cherry Blossom.

The massive blooming strengthened the poison in the lily-of-the-valleys, prompting Medicine to test the poisonous power she wields on whomever she comes across. *: A y≈çkai with the power to manipulate flowers, returning with a new design and a new surname since her appearance in Lotus Land Story. Although the flowering incident isn't her doing, she became the prime suspect when she's only enjoying herself. *: A shinigami who was supposed to ferry dead spirits across the Sanzu River, but her slacking off made the already abundant spirits reside in the flowers of Gensokyo, hence causing the massive blooming incident. Playable in the Extra Mode and the Match Play Mode. *: The Yama responsible for judging the dead of Gensokyo, reflected in her title Yamaxanadu, or \\"Yama of Xanadu\\". Dead spirits aren't coming across the Sanzu River so she goes to check on her subordinate Komachi. She also takes this opportunity to lecture whoever that heads her way on their various faults. Playable in the Extra Mode and the Match Play Mode. Development ZUN, the sole member of the developer Team Shanghai Alice, originally did not plan to make a game for Summer 2005; however, he changed his mind when he realized 2005 marks the tenth anniversary of the Touhou Project, and decided to make a fanservice-type game to mark the occasion. He believed that, in a game, the best kind of fanservice is to pit players against each other so they can have a chance to meet, and so tournaments can happen and so on. In this spirit, ZUN adapted the system used by Twinkle Star Sprites to create a versus shooter, with the focus on dodging bullets (like other Touhou games) instead of shooting each other down.„ÄåÊù±Êñπ„ÄçÂà∂‰ΩúËÄÖ„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éì„É•„Éº„Äå„Ç∑„É•„Éº„ÉÜ„Ç£„É≥„Ç∞„ÅÆÊñπÊ≥ïË´ñ„ÄçÁ¨¨1Âõû. 4Gamer.net.

It was first released in the 69th Comiket on December 30, 2005. In English-speaking circles, the game's title is often shortened to just Shoot the Bullet, and abbreviated to StB.  Gameplay  In Shoot the Bullet, unlike other shoot 'em ups, the player cannot shoot projectiles at enemies; instead, Aya, the main character, must shoot photographs to clear the screen of bullets and take down bosses (hence \\"Shoot\\" the Bullet). Scores are determined by the aesthetics of each photograph taken, such as colours and bullet density, and the risk taken to take these photos. For each \\"scene\\", Aya is only given one life to complete the objective ‚Äî to take a certain number of pictures of the boss without being hit in a limited amount of time. To take pictures, the film must be fully loaded into the camera (100%). The player can move at three speeds, the normal speed, the focused speed, and a super-focused speed which also allows for high-speed film loading. When taking pictures, the player can hold the shoot button to control the viewfinder while the picture frame shrinks ‚Äî this can be used to zoom in on the boss. During this time, all bullets on screen are slowed down and Aya cannot move. If the shoot button is held for too long, the film will get overexposed and Aya would have to reload the film. The player can also press the shoot button once without holding to take a snapshot around Aya. For every picture taken, Aya will need to reload the film from 0% again before she can take another picture. Only photos that contain an image of the boss (\\"Success\\" pictures) will be taken into account when tallying up the score. Characters *Aya Shameimaru: The main character of Shoot the Bullet.

The idea of a danmaku photography game first came to ZUN when he was taking snapshots of bullet patterns during the production of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil so that he could name them into \\"spell cards\\" to distinguish one pattern from another. He realized that taking snapshots was quite fun, and the idea should make a good game. After Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, ZUN tried to incorporate this idea into a new weapon type for Reimu Hakurei (the main character of the Touhou Project) where she would take pictures and seal away bullets. However, ZUN felt that he was forcing a totally new idea into the game unnaturally, since none of the characters in the games had a reason to shoot photos; so he filed the idea away for two years until after Imperishable Night was released.ZUN, \\"Shanghai Alice Correspondence Vol.7\\". Shoot the Bullet Afterword. 2005-12-30. ZUN decided that in order to introduce the idea naturally, he needed a character who actually had a reason to shoot photographs. Thus, he created the reporter girl Aya Shameimaru and planned to introduce her in the upcoming game Phantasmagoria of Flower View so that she can become the main character of a future photography game without being too abrupt. During this process, the manga publisher Ichijinsha was planning a manga anthology of Touhou Project d≈çjinshi, but ZUN decided that he can use this opportunity to introduce Aya, and negotiated with Ichijinsha to turn the anthology into a fanbook that contains samplings of Aya's newspaper. The result was Touhou Bunkachou ~ Bohemian Archive in Japanese Red., which was released three days before Phantasmagoria of Flower View. ZUN had originally planned to include the photography game along with the fanbook, but ZUN did not have enough time to make that happen. Even so, ZUN continued to use the name \\"Touhou Bunkachou\\" for his photography game without Ichijinsha's authorization (although Ichijinsha later agreed to let ZUN use the name). Development took a month and a half to finish, and the game Touhou Bunkachou ~ Shoot the Bullet. was finally released on December 30, 2005. Post- release On January 9, 2006, ZUN added an empty level called after Level Ex with the version 1.01a patch, with the promise that he would add playable stages in it at a later time.Shoot the Bullet ver1.01a.

Built in 1924, the Pavilion seats 4,000 people and is owned and operated by the City of San Francisco. The San Francisco Rumble, of the American Basketball Association, and the Academy of Art Urban Knights, an NCAA Division II school, call Kezar Pavilion their home court. Sports The University of San Francisco basketball team used Kezar Pavilion before War Memorial Gymnasium was constructed. The Santa Clara Broncos also used the pavilion for home games from 1927 until World War II, due to alumni and fans being centrally located in San Francisco. The most regular tenant of Kezar Pavilion was the co-ed roller derby team, the San Francisco Bay Bombers. The Bombers skated home games at the venue from 1961 to the end of the original Roller Derby league in 1973. Games played by the Bombers were videotaped and shown to a TV network of more than 100 stations. In 2007 the San Francisco Bay Bombers and roller derby returned to the pavilion. Kezar was not only used by the Bombers for home season games, but the team also held tryouts in the building. In 2011 the Bay Area Derby Girls hosted their first double-header at the pavilion. In 2006 Kezar Pavilion became the home of ChickFight female professional wrestling tournaments, and San Francisco Pro Wrestling company Fog City Wrestling secured the Kezar pavilion as their new home in 2008 due to an increase in demand. As of 2013, Kezar is also a venue for San Francisco high school basketball games. The arena has accommodated numerous different sports, ranging from middle school volleyball to professional boxing. The versatility of the arena means that the differing requirements of various sports can be met, from professional basketball game to recreational indoor soccer. Kezar was discussed as a possible badminton or table tennis venue, for the purpose of training or qualifying, for San Francisco's 2012 Summer Olympics bid.  San Francisco Summer League Pro-AM  Kezar Pavilion is home to the San Francisco Summer League Pro-Am. The San Francisco Pro-Am Summer League Pro-Am is for former and current male and female professional and/or college basketball players. High school players are also welcome to participate in the league. Men and women don‚Äôt play against each other and are in separate leagues. The San Francisco Summer League Pro-Am originally started in 1979 and has continued each summer since then. The league is supported by the San Francisco Recreation & Parks Department summer programming. The idea behind the summer Pro-Am league is that it adds to the quality of life around the Bay Area and provide locals with an opportunity to see high level competition at no cost. At no cost, the league has become a place for those who can‚Äôt afford to attend local college or professional basketball games. There are no league tryouts for the San Francisco Pro-Am. There is an open- roster policy all season long if the head coach wants to add players. Coaches for each team hand select players for their teams. The season begins in June and ends in August. Games are played Monday-Thursday and are all played at 8:00PM at night. NBA players in the Pro-Am have included Steph Curry, Aaron Gordon, Jason Kidd, and Jason Richardson. WNBA players to play in the women‚Äôs league have included Devanei Hampton, Christy Hedgpeth, and Jennifer Azzi. Azzi was the head coach of the women‚Äôs basketball team at the University of San Francisco from 2010-2016. The Pro-Am is an opportunity for professional players to interact with fans and also to improve their game. Many professional players come to the Pro-Am to train and play in a different environment than they are used to. The San Francisco Summer League Pro-Am awards MVP‚Äôs (Most Valuable Player) and has a playoff format at the end of the season. The championship series is a best of 3 series, with the league champion is the first to win two games. The games operate under most professional basketball guidelines, with a 24 second shot clock. The quarter length is 10 minutes, as opposed to 12 in the NBA or WNBA. Each team has 5 timeouts per game, with one allowed if the game goes into overtime. The team with the best record in their respective league wins the regular season. The playoffs are made up of 5 teams. The winner of the regular season has a first round bye. Many local college and high school players have participated in the San Francisco Pro-Am. Players include former Saint Ignatius players Kenny Hatch and Stephen Domingo, Archbishop Mitty High School‚Äôs Aaron Gordon, and Serra High School's Henry Caruso. The San Francisco Pro-Am is highly popular among players trying to develop into better players and gain attention from NBA or international organization scouts. The 2017 summer season champions was team Bay Pride, lead by head coaches Al Gordan and Frank Williams. Bay Pride beat Dream Team in the best of 3 series. Dream Team featured the 2017 San Francisco Pro-Am MVP, Juan Anderson. The 2017 men's regular season standings were as followed: * Bay Pride: 6-1 * South Bay: 5-2 * Oakland Believers: 5-2 * Dream Team: 4-3 * East Bay: 3-4 * SF City: 2-5 * Bay City: 2-6 * Bay Raiders: 1-6 Entertainment Concerts for artists such as Throbbing Gristle, The String Cheese Incident, The Clash, Dead Kennedys and Smashing Pumpkins have been held at Kezar Pavilion. Kezar is popular as a music venue due to the intimate \\"high-school gymnasium\\" atmosphere that exists, in addition to its location in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood.

These military interventions were most often carried out by the United States Marine Corps, which developed a manual, The Strategy and Tactics of Small Wars (1921) based on its experiences. On occasion, the Navy provided gunfire support and Army troops were also used. With the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. Thereafter, the United States conducted military interventions in Cuba, Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. The series of conflicts ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti in 1934 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The term \\"banana wars\\" was popularized in 1983 by writer Lester D. Langley. Langley wrote several books on Latin American history and American interactions including The United States and the Caribbean, 1900‚Äì1970 and The Banana Wars: An Inner History of American Empire, 1900‚Äì1934. His book on the Banana Wars encompasses the United States tropical empire that overtook the western hemisphere spanning both of the Roosevelt presidencies. The term was popularized through this writing which portrayed the United States as a police force that was sent to reconcile warring tropical countries, lawless societies and corrupt politicians, establishing a reign over tropical trade. Origins United States Marines with the captured flag of Augusto C√©sar Sandino of Nicaragua in 1926 U.S. motivations for these conflicts were largely economic and military. The term \\"Banana Wars\\" was coined much later to cast the motivations for these interventions as almost exclusively the preservation of U.S. commercial interests in the region. Most prominently, the US was advancing its economic, political, and military interests to maintain its sphere of influence and securing the Panama Canal (opened in 1914) which it had recently built to promote global trade and to project its own naval power. US companies such as the United Fruit Company also had financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other commodities throughout the Caribbean, Central America and northern South America. Interventions William Allen Rogers cartoon depicting Theodore Roosevelt's Big Stick ideology off Veracruz in 1914 *Panama: U.S. interventions in the isthmus go back to the 1846 Mallarino‚ÄìBidlack Treaty and intensified after the so-called Watermelon War of 1856. In 1885 US military intervention gained a mandate with the construction of the Panama Canal. The building process collapsed in bankruptcy, mismanagement, and disease in 1889, but resumed in the 20th century. In 1903, Panama seceded from the Republic of Colombia, backed by the U.S. government, during the Thousand Days' War. The Hay‚ÄìPauncefote Treaty allowed the US to construct and control the Panama Canal. In 1903 the United States established sovereignty over a Panama Canal Zone. *Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War: U.S. forces seized Cuba and Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898. The end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War led to the start of Banana Wars. *Cuba: In December 1899 US president William McKinley deemed Leonard Wood to have supreme power in Cuba. The U.S. conquered Cuba from the Spanish Empire. It was occupied by the U.S. from 1898 to 1902 under military governor Leonard Wood, and again from 1906 to 1909, 1912, and 1917 to 1922 and subject to the terms of the Cuban‚ÄìAmerican Treaty of Relations (1903) until 1934. In 1903 the US took a permanent lease on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. *Dominican Republic: Action in 1903, 1904 (the Santo Domingo Affair), and 1914 (Naval forces engaged in battles in the city of Santo Domingo); occupied by the U.S. from 1916 to 1924. *Nicaragua: Occupied by the U.S. almost continuously from 1912 to 1933, after intermittent landings and naval bombardments in the prior decades. The U.S. had troops in Nicaragua to prevent its leaders from creating conflicts with U.S. interests in the country. The bluejackets and marines were there for about 15 years. The U.S. claimed it wanted Nicaragua to elect \\"good men\\", who ostensibly would not threaten to disrupt U.S. interests. *Mexico: U.S. military involvements with Mexico in this period had the same general commercial and political causes, but stand as a special case. The Americans conducted the Border War with Mexico from 1910‚Äì1919 for additional reasons: to control the flow of immigrants and refugees from revolutionary Mexico (pacificos), and to counter rebel raids into U.S. territory. The 1914 U.S. occupation of Veracruz, however, was an exercise of armed influence, not an issue of border integrity; it was aimed at cutting off the supplies of German munitions to the government of Mexican leader Victoriano Huerta, which U.S. President Woodrow Wilson refused to recognize. In the years prior to World War I, the U.S. was also alert to the regional balance of power against Germany. The Germans were actively arming and advising the Mexicans, as shown by the 1914 arms-shipping incident, German saboteur Lothar Witzke's base in Mexico City, the 1917 Zimmermann Telegram and the German advisors present during the 1918 Battle of Ambos Nogales. Only twice during the Mexican Revolution did the U.S. military occupy Mexico: during the temporary occupation of Veracruz in 1914 and between 1916 and 1917, when U.S. General John Pershing led U.S. Army forces on a nationwide search for Pancho Villa. *Haiti, occupied by the U.S. from 1915‚Äì1934, which led to the creation of a new Haitian constitution in 1917 that instituted changes that included an end to the prior ban on land ownership by non-Haitians. This period included the First and Second Caco Wars. *Honduras, where the United Fruit Company and Standard Fruit Company dominated the country's key banana export sector and associated land holdings and railways, saw insertion of American troops in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925. The writer O. Henry coined the term \\"Banana republic\\" in 1904 to describe Honduras. Other Latin American nations were influenced or dominated by American economic policies and/or commercial interests to the point of coercion. Theodore Roosevelt declared the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine in 1904, asserting the right of the United States to intervene to stabilize the economic affairs of states in the Caribbean and Central America if they were unable to pay their international debts. From 1909‚Äì1913, President William Howard Taft and his Secretary of State Philander C. Knox asserted a more \\"peaceful and economic\\" Dollar Diplomacy foreign policy, although that too was backed by force, as in Nicaragua.

This instability was due in part to the American involvement in the country. The first company that concluded an agreement with the Honduras government was the Vaccaro Brothers Company (Standard Fruit Company). The Cuyamel Fruit Company then followed their lead. United Fruit Company also contracted with the government through its subsidiaries, Tela Railroad Company and Truxillo Rail Road Company. Contract between the Honduran government and the American companies most often involved exclusive rights to a piece of land in exchange for building railroads in Honduras. However, banana producers in Central America (including Honduras) \\"were scourged by Panama disease, a soil-borne fungus (‚Ä¶) that decimated production over large regions\\".Mark Moberg, \\"Crown Colony as Banana Republic: The United Fruit Company in British Honduras, 1900‚Äì1920,\\" Journal of Latin American Studies, Vol. 28, No. 2 (May 1996), pp. 357‚Äì381. Typically, companies would abandon the decimated plantations and destroy the railroads and other utilities that they had used along with the plantation, so the exchange of services between the government and the companies was not always respected. The ultimate goal of the contracts for the companies was control of the banana trade from production to distribution. The companies would finance guerrilla fighters, presidential campaigns and governments. According to Rivera and Carranza, the indirect participation of American companies in the country's armed conflicts worsened the situation. The presence of more dangerous and modern weapons allowed more dangerous warfare among the factions. In British Honduras (modern-day Belize) the situation was significantly different. Despite the fact that the United Fruit Company was the sole exporter of bananas there and the company was also attempting to manipulate the local government, the country did not suffer the instability and armed conflicts its neighbors experienced. Notable veteran Perhaps the single most active military officer in the Banana Wars was U.S. Marine Corps Major General, Smedley Butler, nicknamed \\"Maverick Marine\\", who saw action in Honduras in 1903, served in Nicaragua enforcing American policy from 1909 to 1912, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his role in Veracruz in 1914, and a second Medal of Honor for bravery in Haiti in 1915. Butler gave a speech in 1933 across the US titled War is a Racket, where he denounced the role he had played, describing himself as \\"a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers...a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism\\". In 1935, he adapted that speech into a published book.

It is the only species in the genus Paradisornis, but was previously included in the genus Paradisaea. It is often regarded as one of the most fabulous and extravagant of all birds of the world, with its glorified and fancy flank feathers present only in males and also their two long wires also only found in the males.  Etymology  The former generic name, Paradisaea, simply means \\"paradise\\", referring to the birds' exoticness and altogether, their appearance and their habitat. The new and current generic name is Paradisornis, which means \\"paradise bird\\". The specific name, rudolphi, commemorates Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. The subspecies' names include margaritae, which honors Margaret Fitzell Gilliard, the wife of Ernest Thomas Gilliard, an ornithologist and museum curator, and ampla, which means \\"splendid\\" or \\"large\\". Description Nominate male specimen at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. More of its sexual ornamentation can be seen ventrally. Arguably one of the most fabulous of its family, the blue bird-of-paradise is among the larger birds-of-paradise, being around 30 cm, or a little over a foot in length (excluding the long tail wires), rivaling some of the Paradisaea and Manucodia species. Unlike the Paradisaea birds, the male is mostly glossy black overall with silver-white crescents surrounding the eyes (in both sexes). They have a very crow-like bill that is whiteish to light greyish in color. The back of the head has a reddish gloss that stretches down to the mantle, or back. A defining feature found in both sexes are the shiny, blue wings that are more commonly light blue but can range from light blue, aqua or even a skyish-baby blue; the tail is also like this. Stretching from the tail are two blackish and elongated wires with small, whitish spatulate tips similar Paradisaea males' wires. The most brilliant and distinctive feature present on the male are the fine, silky elongated flank plumes that are mainly a dull amber color on the surface; below, they are a light blue, based by two dark crimson lines on each side of the lower belly. These elegant features help the male create an illusion for his potential audience. The female, however, is more or less similar to the male; of course, she lacks the opulent flank plumes and tail wires present on the male, but she does sport bright blue wings and tail feathers like the male. Instead of having an all-black underside, she is chestnut-brown below with blackish barring. Her head and neck are more duller also, with only a faint reddish gloss present. They have purplish-grey legs and feet and greyer claws. the wires on the blue bird-of-paradise are 25 inches long.  Behavior and ecology = Diet  The blue bird-of-paradise is mainly a frugivorous species, feeding on a good variety of fruits like figs, drupes, berries, but animal prey is also present in the diet; it includes insects, but also likely takes some vertebrates like reptiles. They typically feed alone, though females and juveniles are more likely to feed in trees in association with other birds or other species. They are shown to search high in the canopy when seeking fruits, and apparently forage at lower altitudes when in search of their animal prey.  Courtship and breeding  display posture. The bird arranges itself upside down and spreads out its glorious \\"fountain\\" of blue flank plumes, with a black and red-edged oval in or near the center of the figure, and two elongated, bulbous-tipped tail wires flailing around its body. The male is polygamous and performs a breathtaking courtship display. But unlike most other birds of paradise species, he performs solitary on a preferably thin branch, while an attending female observes nearby. In the display, the male hangs from a branch upside down. The black oval with red margin at the center of his chest is rhythmically enlarged and contracted. His violet blue plumes spread out in a fan, looking like an apron, swaying its body back and forth while the black wires form two impressive arches down to either side. During this display, he continuously makes a soft, insect-like buzzing noise, mixed with a chittering or chattering noise to rope the female back in if she moves away. The nesting and parental duties are covered only by the females; she builds her nest with stems, twigs, palm leaves, vines and other materials all by herself, usually in a flat cup-like shape. They mostly lay one egg, but two are less occasional, and the mother is very defensive of her brood. The eggs are described to be a salmon-type color, with the ends being ringed with flecks of cinnamon-rufous to tawny.  Hybridization  The blue bird-of-paradise is known to have hybridized with Lawes's parotia (Parotia lawesii), which is called \\"Schodde's Bird-of-paradise\\", and also with the Raggiana bird-of-paradise (Paradisaea raggiana). Subspecies and taxonomy The blue bird-of-paradise was formerly assigned to the Paradisaea genus, though it was initially described as Paradisornis rudolphi. According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, the species was put back in its monospecific genus on account of its distinct plumage, vocal abilities, and displaying behavior. Its genus is a sister genus to Paradisaea. It is also more closely related to the Cicinnurus species than the Paradisaea members are. It has two valid subspecies: * Paradisornis rudolphi rudoolphi, which is found in southeastern New Guinean highlands * Paradisornis rudolphi margaritae, found in eastern-central New Guinean mountains. Note: a third subspecies, ampla, is currently synonymized with the nominate race.  Status and Conservation  Due to ongoing habitat loss, limited range, small population size and, in some areas, by hunting for its highly prized plumes, the rare blue bird-of-paradise is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES. Its population is thought to have a decreasing trend, estimated to be anywhere from 2,500 to 9,999 individuals.

DJ and production career Carter began his musical career playing in bands when he was at Southampton University. Dropping out of his studies, he moved back to London and started to learn studio engineering, ending up working in the No U-Turn studios which at the time was involved in the nascent jungle scene of the early 1990s. During his spare time, Carter began making his own tracks, which caught the ear of Mark Jones, the founder of the Wall of Sound record label. Carter was eventually signed to Wall of Sound and released his first record \\"The Dollar\\" under the name Artery. At around the same time, Carter was beginning to develop a reputation as one of the regular DJs at The Heavenly Social, a Sunday evening club in the Albany pub on Great Portland Street in central London. Alongside the other regular DJs The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Richard Fearless of Death in Vegas, the night was instrumental in developing the form of electronic dance music that became known as big beat, with its mix of rock, hip hop and breakbeat, as well as dance.Jon Carter's MySpace website.

The project developed into a full band playing live shows, and an album, Shoot the Boss, appeared in 1998. By now he was also in demand to produce mix albums and remix songs by bands as diverse as U2, Manic Street Preachers and The Beach Boys. By the end of the 1990s he had secured DJ residencies at several nightclubs in the UK and was regularly playing sets abroad. In 1999 Carter moved back to Wall of Sound and its new subsidiary Nu Camp to release \\"Women Beat Their Men\\", a house record under the new pseudonym of Junior Cartier. In 2003 he and fellow DJ Tim Sheridan formed a short-lived record company, Saville Row, and released a few singles on the label. A severe bout of tinnitus curtailed his DJing activity and brought a halt to his record productions for a couple of years, but by 2008 Carter had returned, first with another one-off collaboration with Tim Sheridan, and then \\"The Rabbit\\" with Stretch Silvester of Stretch & Vern, the first single in a planned series of collaborations with other DJs under the name Gentleman's Agreement.

Golden arrived in the then-Kansas Territory in 1858 around the beginning of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. He later partnered with George A. Jackson, a native of Glasgow, Missouri who discovered gold at the confluence of Chicago Creek and Clear Creek on January 7, 1859. The city of Golden, Colorado is named after him.  History  Golden arrived at today's Jefferson County late in 1858, joining prospectors mining placer gold at a sandbar on Clear Creek just east of North Table Mountain. There on November 29, 1858, Golden became the founding Treasurer of Arapahoe City, the first town in what would become Jefferson County.Marshall B. Cook, On the Early History of Colorado, unpublished manuscript (1880s), Colorado Historical Society collection, p. 170. He met Jackson when the latter arrived at Arapahoe City in late December 1858, and they became prospecting partners seeking the mother lode from which the placer gold deposits washed down. The two made their base camp in the valley west of the Table Mountains from which to prospect in the mountains. On January 7, 1859, Jackson made a major strike on Chicago Creek, near today's Idaho Springs. He told no one but Golden about the location, writing in his diary, \\"Tom Golden is the only man who knows I found gold up the creek, and as his mouth is as tight as a No. 4 Beaver trap, I am not uneasy.\\"Frank Hall, History of the State of Colorado, p. 523. After Jackson and others followed up on his discovery later that year, it helped set the gold rush into full boom. In mid-June, 1859, while returning from the mountains, the partners stopped on Clear Creek and Jackson fished for their lunch. He was caught in a flash flood, and Golden stayed with him, though he was certain for three to four minutes that Jackson would perish. They returned to their camp in the valley to discover a new town was being laid out there. At Jackson's suggestion it was named for Tom Golden.Colorado Transcript, May 19, 1904. Golden helped lay out the townsite, but did not remain there. He teamed with others in July to establish Golden Gate City nearby at the mouth of Golden Gate Canyon. Golden opened a storage and commission businessWestern Mountaineer, 1860 advertisements. and is said to be the first in the area to advertise his prices. Around 1860, Golden was elected to the legislature of the provisional government of Jefferson Territory,Western Mountaineer, April 18, 1860. organized by area citizens in hopes of federal recognition. Golden's correspondence may be read in the Missouri RepublicanMissouri Republican, May 8, 1859. and Western Mountaineer,Western Mountaineer, April 11 and 25, 1860. two newspapers from this time. On September 24, 1860, Golden was married to Miss Fletcher at Nevada City.Rocky Mountain News, September 29, 1860. He was referred to by the title of Captain, though the presumable military origin of this rank remains unknown. Golden left the area around 1861, shortly after the American Civil War began. Many Colorado Southerners were harassed by their Northern neighbors, and Golden was rumored to have returned home. George A. Jackson, also from the south, joined the Confederate Army, but returned after the war and spent the rest of his life around Colorado.Colorado Transcript, March 17, 1897. Finding that Golden was not a landholder in the town, some historians later speculated it might not have been named for Golden, but instead after gold. However, a 1904 account written by George West, who helped lead the town's organization, proves the town was indeed named for the Colorado pioneer.

Effigy mounds were primarily built during the Late Woodland Period (350-1300 CE). Effigy mounds were constructed in many Native American cultures. Scholars believe they were primarily for religious purposes, although some also fulfilled a burial mound function. The builders of the effigy mounds are usually referred to as the Mound Builders. Native American societies in Wisconsin built more effigy mounds than did those in any other region of North America‚Äîbetween 15,000 and 20,000 mounds, at least 4,000 of which remain today. Native North American effigy mounds have been compared to the large-scale geoglyphs such as the Nazca Lines of Peru. History=Early European observations Effigy mounds are limited to the Northern and Eastern United States, and most likely the French were the first Europeans to see them in their expeditions southward from Canada after 1673. Early surveyors and settlers noticed and mapped many effigy mounds, but farming and other development erased numerous sites despite efforts to preserve them. Mythology After the \\"discovery\\" of effigy mounds, and other mounds all over the country, wild theories began to be developed as to how and by whom they were built. The first theories were the most accurate; people in the late 17th century assumed that the mounds had been built by the Native American people who still lived in the vicinity. These logical assumptions lost popularity as more fantastic theories were developed. The most popular of these theories in the 19th century was that an extinct race of Mound Builder people had built the mounds and then vanished. This theory was laid to rest by archaeologists at the Smithsonian Institution in the 1880s. Origin theories One of many eagle-shaped mounds in Wisconsin, an effigy with a wingspan of 624 feet The Ho-Chunk suggest that effigy mounds were used as places of refuge as well as burial. Some archaeologists today believe that the mounds were built by particular clans or groups to honor their representative animal. Some believe that the animal shape is the clan or extended family of the person or person's buried in the mound. Others believe that the mounds were burial sites for everyday people, while still others believe that the depicted animal might be somehow responsible for transitioning the deceased into the next world. The mounds may also indicate hunting and gathering territories of different groups. Other evidence suggests that effigy mounds were used for all manner of rites and ceremonies, from birth ceremonies to funeral rites. Appearance=Common shapes Alligator Effigy Mound, Ohio Common shapes for effigy mounds include birds, bear, deer, bison, lynx, panther, turtles, and water spirits. These are somewhat arbitrary names given to the mound shapes by archaeologists who were simply looking for words that would help them classify the mounds. These shapes were most likely chosen for their particular religious or spiritual significance. The earliest mounds are 'conical'; they are essentially bumps of earth - the simplest and arguably the most intuitive kind of burial. Successive conicals likely evolved into linear mounds. Bird mounds likely came next as modifying a linear mound to make a bird mound required only the addition of a head and a tail. From there many different animal forms emerged. These often expressed a kind of abstract elongation. Aesthetics In addition to the obvious elongation of tails and the abstracted nature of many of the shapes, colored silts and sand were often used to decorate the mounds. The land was often scraped or raked to move earth from surface soils towards a new mound and in doing so, artful colored sand and silt patterning was sometimes employed as adornment. In terms of positioning, some mounds may have had celestial alignments although with certainty bird mounds were placed in such a way as to suggest that they were flying up or down a hillside, and animal mounds were often placed so as to suggest animals walking along natural landform as well such as a ridge or hillside. It is possible that predominant wind patterns may have been taken into consideration when choosing locations and orientations for bird mounds. In addition bird mounds sometimes appear in different conformations where the wings of the bird may be folded or unfolded to different degrees, suggesting various postures in flying. There are some instances where these different poses may suggest a freeze frame view of a bird flying - wings outstretched, wings partially folded, and wings outstretched again. Hochunk ancestors naturally buried their dead next to lakes and rivers, and on hillsides. These locations would later become valued as some of the best places to live by settlers. This is one factor that contributed to high rates of mound destruction. Many mounds were destroyed by people grading earth surrounding their houses or what would become the foundations of houses. In some cases linear mounds were used as foundational fill for new house construction. Looting of mounds by settlers was common and this also contributed to the destruction and defacement of many.\\"Brown, Charles E. \\"Undescribed Groups of Lake Mendota Mounds\\", Wisconsin Archaeologist, Vol 11 No. 1.

Accessed October 22, 2009. Contents The Effigy Mound Builders buried one, two, or three people in a single mound. These burials were most often done singly one atop the other in successive years. The effigy mound builders did not include with their dead the wealth of material the Ohio Hopewellians did. This almost complete lack of artifacts accompanying the dead clearly indicates a culture distinct from the Hopewellian, even though mounds with Hopewell-type grave goods have been excavated in the same area, and apparently were constructed at roughly the same time as the effigy mounds. Some have speculated that due to the lack of burial goods, that the effigy mound builders were egalitarian peoples. Current condition=Preservation Hundreds of effigy mounds have been lost due to plowing, farming, and other development. Many of the remaining effigy mound sites are parts of national, state, county, or municipal parks. All effigy mounds are currently protected under state laws that prohibit disturbance to burial sites or, if on federal or tribal land, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, the Antiquities Act, and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

It is the first novel (the other being Showboat World) sharing the same setting, an immense, but metal-poor and backward world called Big Planet. Big Planet was first published in Startling Stories (vol. 27 no. 2, September 1952), then cut and reissued in 1957 by Avalon Books. It was later issued as part of Ace double novel D-295, paired with Vance's Slaves of the Klau. It was further cut in 1958. The text was restored in 1978. Plot summary Restored text edition, Ace Books, 1978 Big Planet had been colonized hundreds of years prior to the start of the novel by misfits, faddists, cultists and anti-government advocates from Earth. The environment is Earth-like, including the surface gravity: even though the planet is much larger than Earth (hence the name), it is much less dense, resulting from a scarcity of metal. As a result, a large number of technologically backward societies have developed, many of them ruled by petty tyrants and prey to lawlessness, murder and mayhem. Commissions from Earth have visited Big Planet at irregular intervals for 500 years to little effect: the majority of them are never heard from again. The latest, headed by Claude Glystra, arrives to try to stop the illegal importation of arms from Earth and halt Big Planet's slave trade, especially targeting Charley Lysidder, the ruthless, expansion-minded Bajarnum of Beaujolais. However their starship is sabotaged by Lysidder's agents and crashes near a quaint village called Jubilith, near Beaujolais. The survivors attempt to reach Earth Enclave, 40,000 miles away, armed with little more than their wits and a few modern hand weapons. A Jubilith resident, Natilien-Thilssa, whom they call \\"Nancy\\", insists on tagging along, despite Glystra's opposition. The team begins to dwindle as Lysidder's efforts and the dangers of Big Planet take their toll. Nevertheless, by sheer tenacity, resourcefulness and some luck, Glystra manages to triumph over Lysidder, despite the presence of Lysidder's agents within his own small group. Among the many societies, benign or bizarre, that Glystra and his companions encounter along the wind-driven monoline (their version of the yellow brick road), is the quasi-utopian society of Kirstendale. At first, it appears to be based on snobbish principles, but an odd twist reveals it to be surprisingly egalitarian. Literary significance and criticism According to science fiction scholar Nick Gevers, Big Planet > was instrumental in the development of the planetary romance form...perhaps > the first attempt at a convincingly complete imaginary world in genre > s-f....[T]he conviction persists that it is not the characters who serve as > the book's protagonists, but rather Big Planet itself.

The game combined both large scale army unit level and small scale character level. All the action happened simultaneously in game world and places could be seen from the map or at the ground level. Individual characters could also be seen in larger battles (in which they either survived or died -- Gandalf alone could easily defeat a hundred orcs). If the battle is quite small (less than 100 units approximately) it can be watched on ground level. Otherwise it will be only displayed numerically. On ground level characters could acquire objects and talk with computer- controlled friendly characters (such as Radagast or Tom Bombadil). Reception The game was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #147 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. Computer Gaming World gave the game a mixed review, noting that, although it faithfully recreates the events of the books, genuine strategy is lacking and the game plays very similarly on subsequent playthroughs.

In doing so, his expedition charted previously unexplored areas along the northern Canadian coastline, including Baffin Bay, Smith Sound and Lancaster Sound. He was also the inventor of the marine hydraulic steering gear and the anchor design that bears his name. bears his name, as do the Inglefield Land region and the Inglefield Gulf of Greenland.  Career = First voyage to the Arctic  Inglefield set out from Britain on his search in July 1852, commanding Lady Franklin's private steamer , seven years after Franklin had left on his ill-fated search for the fabled Northwest Passage. Once Inglefield had reached the Arctic, a search and survey of Greenland's west coast was made; Ellesmere Island was resighted and named in honour of the president of the Royal Geographical Society. Smith Sound was penetrated further than any known records; Jones Sound was also searched; and a landing was made at Beechey Island in Lancaster Sound. No sign, however, of Franklin's expedition was found. Finally, before the onset of winter forced Inglefield to turn homewards, the expedition searched and charted much of Baffin Island's eastern coast. Despite finding no traces of the Franklin expedition, Inglefield was f√™ted on his return for the surveying his expedition had achieved. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him its 1853 Patron's Medal \\"for his enterprising survey of the coasts of Baffin Bay, Smith Sound and Lancaster Sound.\\"  Subsequent Arctic voyages  Isabel searching for the Franklin expedition Inglefield made two further voyages to the Arctic in , to supply the search for the Franklin expedition overseen by Sir Edward Belcher. He returned from the first of these in 1853, bringing with him the first officer to have traversed the Northwest Passage, Samuel Gurney Cresswell of . The Investigator had also been sent to join the search for the Franklin expedition, but starting from the western side of northern Canada. Arriving back in the Arctic the following year, 1854, Inglefield found Belcher's ships abandoned, save one to which the crews had retreated. Most of these men returned with Inglefield to Britain.  Later life  Soon after his return from the Arctic, Inglefield was sent to join the Crimean War in the Black Sea as captain of HMS Firebrand, where he took part in the siege of Sevastopol. After the Crimean War, he captained a number of ships and continued to rise through the ranks. In 1869, he was made a rear admiral and three years later was appointed Admiral Superintendent of Malta Dockyard. Promotions to vice admiral and then admiral followed, between which he was knighted. In 1878, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief, North America and West Indies Station.William Loney RN Inglefield retired in 1885. Thereafter he devoted much of his time to painting and his watercolours of Arctic landscapes were exhibited at several art galleries in London.  Personal life  On 30 April 1857, Inglefield married Eliza Fanny Johnston (1836‚Äì1890), the daughter of Edward Johnston, Esq. of Allerton Hall, Liverpool. Together, they were the parents of four sons and one daughter: # Henry Beaufort Willmot Inglefield (1859‚Äì1926), who married Mary Lucia MacHugh, Lady Holker in 1894. She was the widow of Sir John Holker (1828‚Äì1882).

Biography=Childhood and education Aleksandrov was born in Saint Petersburg in a worker's family of Russian ethnicity, but became homeless during the Russian Civil War. In 1924-1930, he studied Communist philosophy in Borisoglebsk and Tambov and then transferred to the Moscow Institute of History and Philosophy. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1928. After graduating in 1932, Aleksandrov remained with the Institute for graduate studies, eventually becoming a professor, a deputy director and the Institute's Scientific Secretary. Communist official In 1938, at the height of the Great Purge, Aleksandrov was made deputy head of the Publishing Department of the Executive Committee of the Comintern. In 1939 he was appointed deputy head of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee's Propaganda and Agitation Department and at the same time put in charge of the Central Committee's Moscow-based Higher Party School, which he headed until 1946. In September 1940 Aleksandrov was made head of the Central Committee's Propaganda and Agitation Department, replacing Andrei ZhdanovSee Pravda, September 7, 1940, quoted in Sanford R. Lieberman. \\"The Party under Stress: The Experience of World War II\\" in Soviet Society and the Communist Party, ed. Karl W. Ryavec, University of Massachusetts Press, 1978, , p. 196 who, as a Secretary of the Central Committee, retained overall supervision over Communist propaganda in the USSR. In 1941 Aleksandrov was also made a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee and, on 19 March 1946, a member of its Orgburo. In 1946 he was also elected a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. 1947 demotion Throughout his career, Aleksandrov was closely associated with Georgy Malenkov, who was one of Joseph Stalin's closest advisors. Once Malenkov began to lose influence to Zhdanov in 1946, Aleksandrov's position became shaky as well. In June 1947, Aleksandrov's textbook History of Western European Philosophy (1945) was denounced on Stalin's orders for overvaluing Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's contributions and underestimating the contributions made by Russian philosophers. Aleksandrov lost his Propaganda and Agitation Department position to Mikhail Suslov and his supporters were purged. Nonetheless, Aleksandrov retained his Orgburo post and was made Director of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Institute of Philosophy. He remained there even after Zhdanov's demotion and subsequent death in 1948 and Malenkov's return to power. After Stalin When Georgy Malenkov became the next Soviet Premier after Joseph Stalin's death in March 1953, he made Aleksandrov his Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union on 9 March 1954. After Malenkov lost his position in a power struggle with the Soviet Communist Party leader Nikita Khrushchev in February 1955, Aleksandrov was fired on 10 March 1955. He was sent to Minsk, where he was put in charge of the section of dialectical and historical materialism of the Belarus Academy of Sciences Institute of Philosophy and Law. He spent the rest of his life working on sociology and its history and died in Moscow in 1961 at age 53. NotesReferences * K.A. Zalessky.

The game was developed by Luxoflux for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube platforms, while a version for PC was developed by KnowWonder. The game received mixed to positive reception by critics. Plot Shrek 2s storyline follows a similar plot compared to that of the film Shrek and Fiona are on a journey to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to visit Fiona's parents. Shrek's in-laws are not happy that a crude ogre is married to their daughter Fiona and the battle for acceptance ensues. The game covers things not shown in the film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level. Gameplay For the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox version of the game, the player is able to play as Shrek or his friends and travel through 11 levels. In each level, the player controls a team of four characters, and can switch between them at any point. Each character has a unique ability that aids them in fighting enemies or moving through the environment (for example, Donkey can destroy obstacles and Fiona can slow down time). The game is broken into different chapters, each with its own set of goals. One chapter requires the player to make sure three blind mice safely make their way to the witch's house. Other chapters have the player acting as a deputy in Far, Far Away Land‚Äîcollecting bits of Humpty Dumpty, stealing treasure from a troll, helping the police clear out rioting hooligans from the streets, escorting Cinderella while she window-shops for a glass slipper, ridding the town of the Pied Piper's rat infestation, collecting chickens for a stew, or battling Puss in Boots via timed button presses. Players play mini- games when they are not traveling on hazardous paths from point A to point B. Challenges that require the player's entire party include having to punch chickens into cook pots or a pen, escorting characters through a stage (Billy Goat Gruff and the three blind mice), and collecting fairies, jewels, etc. The second type of mini-game, dubbed \\"Hero Time,\\" gives one character a challenge to complete, usually emphasizing that character's particular skills displayed in the movie. Donkey at one point has to chase a fleeing onion wagon while riding on the back of Dragon. Fiona holds a private concert for a flock of black birds she is collecting for a pie (via exploding them by rhythm based button presses). Shrek has to throw a bunch of thugs into a paddy wagon. The Game Boy Advance version is a side-scroller with graphics resembling the Donkey Kong Country series, developed by Vicarious Visions. The game is separated into five chapters with a bonus level if the player collects all of the coins in each level. The story of the game is a compressed version of the movie it is based on. The playable characters are Shrek, Donkey, Puss in Boots, Human Shrek and Gingerbread Man, each with their own unique set of skills. Development Shrek 2 was created by Luxoflux and KnowWonder and published by Activision in 2004. The game is based on the film Shrek 2 by DreamWorks. TDK Mediactive announced the game at E3 in May 2003. Later that same year, TDK was acquired by Take-Two Interactive, resulting in losing the license to make Shrek games. Shortly after Activision announced in December that they would be working with DreamWorks to develop and publish video games based on the upcoming Shrek 2 movie, before they released the first trailer for the game in Spring of 2004. Two versions of the game were released for the PC; one developed by KnowWonder for younger audiences using Unreal Engine 2, and the other a port of the original console release under the title Shrek 2: Team Action which was developed by Beenox. The score for the game was composed by Kevin Manthei and Kevin Riepl. The soundtrack album consists of 58 tracks with over 65 minutes of score. It was released on May 6, 2004, by KMM Productions. Reception Every version of Shrek 2 received mixed to positive reviews from critics, except for the PC port. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 72.56% and 72 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version; 72.27% and 70 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 71.92% and 71 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 71.29% and 72 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 62.90% and 55 out of 100 for the PC version; and 49% for the Mobile version. IGN reviewer Mary Jane Irwin called the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 versions of Shrek 2 \\"an amusing jaunt into the world of the movie,\\" and Craig Harris, another reviewer of IGN, called the GBA version \\"an absolute treat, especially for those who dig the artstyle of the film,\\" though he stated it to be \\"nothing new.\\" The game, along with fellow movie sequel based game published by Activision, Spider-Man 2, shipped more than 5 million units combined and were the best-selling titles of May and June, respectively. In the United States, Shrek 2s Game Boy Advance version sold 700,000 copies and earned $18 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 35th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of Shrek 2 had sold 850,000 copies and earned $26 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 70th highest- selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined console sales of the Shrek series reached 2.5 million units in the United States by July 2006.

The series, written by Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes and illustrated by Jim Mooney, ran for 10 issues before cancellation for low sales. Despite its short run, it has remained as a cult classic due to its intriguing characters and unusual storytelling. A 10-issue series revamping the character was published from 2007 to 2008, written by novelist Jonathan Lethem and illustrated by Farel Dalrymple. Creation and concept Unlike many other superhero titles, the main focus of Omega the Unknown is not on the superpowered person in an iconic costume and cape. Instead the story largely deals with an unusually mature 12-year-old boy named James-Michael Starling. Through the 10-issue run of the original comic book series it is made clear that there is a connection between the laconic superhero Omega and the strangely analytical child James-Michael, with most issues adding to the mysterious nature of their relationship. Interviewed in 2005 after the sequel to the original series was announced, co- creator Steve Gerber stated that he \\"wanted to do a series about a real kid who was nobody's sidekick, facing real problems in what today would be called a 'grim 'n gritty' setting.\\" The series was cancelled in 1977, but Steve Gerber promised to wrap up its unfinished plotlines in The Defenders. Gerber was fired by Marvel Comics in 1978 and never completed the storyline. In late 1978, Al Milgrom, the editor of The Defenders, assigned writer Steven Grant to complete the story, the conclusion of which was still being sought after in fan correspondence. Grant did this in two issues of The Defenders in 1979, at the end of which most of the original series' characters were killed. While Gerber seemed unhappy with Grant's conclusion, it nevertheless tied up the loose ends of the comic series, and is considered \\"canon\\" by Marvel.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 190: \\"Writer Steven Grant devised this wrap-up of the Omega story line, killing off the other protagonist, James-Michael Starling. The mysterious connection between Omega and Starling was never elaborated upon.\\" Grant later wrote that the character held no interest for him, but he had tried to approach writing the story in the way that he felt that Gerber would have, had he been allowed to complete it himself. Plot synopsis In the premiere issue, the character of Omega is shown as the last surviving member of an unnamed alien race. He escapes the mechanical beings who have devastated his planet in a ship headed to Earth. The story then cuts to James-Michael waking up in bed having dreamed the events that just occurred with Omega. In his waking world, James-Michael and his parents are moving to New York City from the mountains so he can improve his socialization skills after years of home-schooling. En route to New York the Starlings' car is driven off the road and both of James-Michael's parents are killed, but not before the boy discovers that both of them were robots. James-Michael collapses into a coma and awakens a month later in a private hospital exhibiting an eerie lack of emotional response to his parents' deaths. The hospital is later attacked by one of the mechanical beings that destroyed Omega's home world, and Omega himself appears to defend James-Michael. The superhero and the android fight but the conflict ends when James-Michael himself destroys the alien mechanism with energy bursts from his hands (an effect used by Omega in James-Michael's dreams). After this beginning, the story follows James-Michael's life as he is fostered to two young women in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. The series explores the problems he encounters in a strange new place, and his trials and friendships in a New York City public school. Issues of racism and bullying are addressed, although the stories' focus is on how the reserved and detached James-Michael relates to the world around him. Meanwhile, Omega the Unknown becomes a superhero figure in New York City, tending to fight only second-string supervillains (though he did once confront the Hulk) with a variety of outcomes. Otherwise, Omega tends to appear when James-Michael is in danger and then takes a more proactive role. As the series progresses Omega and James-Michael eventually meet and interact, although the nature of their relationship remains unclear. Omega himself is killed in the 10th and final issue, leaving the mysteries of the story unresolved. Fictional character biography Omega the Unknown is a humanoid being of superhuman power bio-engineered by an extraterrestrial mechanoid race named the Protar, from the planet Protaris in the Regreb System in the Milky Way Galaxy. The Protar, foreseeing its own extinction, decided to create an ideal race of true humanoids as their legacy to the cosmos. Their penultimate model, later called Omega, was placed on the planet Srenesk (an anagram of series co-writer [Mary] \\"Skrenes\\") to learn. He commandeered a Protar starship and fled to Earth after inadvertently destroying the world on which he was placed. The Earth was the home of the final \\"model\\" in his series, the artificially created boy James-Michael Starling, whom Omega sought to protect from the Protar. While on Earth, Omega was employed for odd jobs by a New York City pawn-broker, and had a number of battles with local beings. He battled the Hulk, Electro,the Blockbuster, and Nitro. While later embroiled in a rematch with Blockbuster, the second Foolkiller saved Omega's life by murdering Blockbuster. Omega was finally shot dead in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Police while battling Ruby Thursday; the police thought Omega was assaulting Ruby. James-Michael Starling, who had inherited Omega's power, learned the true origin of himself and Omega but refused to accept the truth. He threatened to use the power of Earth's biosphere against the Defenders. Seeing the error of his decision, he ended his own life when he turned the power inward and self-destructed. Powers and abilities Omega was created through Protarian technology, and has superhuman strength. He has limited psychokinetic abilities, and has a psionic rapport with other Protarian organic creations. Omega was educated as a warrior on the planet Srenesk, trained in the fighting skills of a Srenesk warrior. The extraterrestrial Sreneskian endowed him with the ability to draw upon the psionic energy of the biosphere to project energy bolts from his hands and fly. Using biospheric energy beyond a certain level could result in global destruction. Reception In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Gerber and Mooney's run on Omega the Unknown tenth on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". Comic Book Resources placed Omega the Unknown as one of \\"15 Superheroes Marvel Wants You To Forget\\", stating \\"his complicated history makes it exceedingly unlikely that he'll return to the Marvel universe.\\" 2007 series Cover of the first issue of the revamped Omega the Unknown, illustrated by Farel Dalrymple. Novelist Jonathan Lethem and artist Farel Dalrymple revived Omega the Unknown in a 10-issue limited series published in 2007. Lethem was a childhood fan of the first Omega series, and referenced the character in his 2003 novel The Fortress of Solitude. When asked about Omega's appeal, Lethem stated, After hearing of Lethem's plans to revive Omega, the character's co-creator Steve Gerber expressed personal outrage over the use of the character without his participation, though he and Mary Skrenes later discussed the project with Lethem and Gerber admitted that he had \\"misjudged\\" him. The first issue of the revamped Omega the Unknown was published in October 2007, and Marvel released another issue each month until the 10th was published in July 2008. All 10 issues have been collected and reprinted in a single volume. The series was nominated in the \\"Best Limited Series\\" and \\"Best Lettering\\" categories in the 2009 Eisner Awards.

Programs can differ according to setting; although practitioner-teacher model programs are typically found in colleges of medicine, health professions, or allied health, classroom-based programs can be found in colleges of business or public health. Structure The degree program is designed to give graduates of health disciplines (in particular) greater understanding of management issues and prepare them for senior management roles, and is awarded by many American, European, Australian, Indian and Sri Lankan (Post Graduate Institute of Medicine ‚Äì University of Colombo)http://pgim.cmb.ac.lk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/medAdminMsc.pdf http://pgim.cmb.ac.lk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/medAdminMD.pdf universities. The degree traditionally focuses on health administration at the local, state, and federal level as well as in the nonprofit sector. This contrasts with the general Master of Business Administration or the Master of Public Administration degrees. Accredited programs of study typically require students to complete applied experiences as well as course work in areas such as population health, healthcare economics, health policy, organizational behavior, management of healthcare organizations, healthcare marketing and communications, human resource management, information systems management and assessment, operations assessment and improvement, governance, leadership, statistical analysis and application, financial analysis and management, and strategy formulation and implementation. MHA programs are thus intended to provide students with the essential knowledge required for senior managerial and planning work in the health services and systems sectors. The objectives of the program are to develop graduates who are: competent general and financial managers, competent planners, knowledgeable about public health and the structure, organization and financing of health care systems, knowledgeable about society, law and ethics, and competent in quantitative skills. \\"Health care is a labor intensive industry, no doubt about it and it‚Äôs not likely to change in the near future. Leadership of this human capital is uniquely challenging because of the diversity of both the workforce and the customer base and because of the life and death nature of our work.\\" - Dr. RuthAnn Althaus In most countries, applicants are required to hold, at minimum, a four year undergraduate degree and have a minimum period of professional experience in the health system. The curriculum, however, varies between universities. United States Although many colleges of business, public health, and/or health sciences in the United States have degrees with health administration content, only a minority have been accredited through the Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME), which is the only accreditor recognized by the United States Department of Education for these programs. In the same way the AACSB evaluates accreditation for MBA programs; CAHME accreditation requires programs to meet a set of standards related to areas such as program resources, faculty preparation, curriculum content, and post-graduation career success, and also helps to ensure that the programs are well integrated with the practice communities their graduates will work within. Applicants to accredited programs are required to hold a four-year undergraduate degree prior to enrolling. Some universities offer dual MBA/MHA degrees with AACSB accreditation, or MBA/HOM degree programs, which may be completed concurrently or sequentially. Some MHA programs do not require professional experience prior to enrollment; however, most programs require work experience, such as internships or fellowships, as part of their graduation requirements. Some MHA programs use a blended lecture and online format, allowing people to continue working while they pursue the MHA degree. There are also a few universities, including many for-profit universities, that offer Master of Healthcare Administration programs completely online; however, these programs are not currently eligible for CAHME accreditation because of concerns about the effectiveness of online programs as an analog for developing interpersonal and team-based skills which are more typically face-to-face in their use in post- graduation professional roles. Most Master of Healthcare Administration- equivalent graduate programs in the United States are offered by schools of public health, business, allied health, or, less frequently, by schools of medicine. Programs in schools of public health or business tend to have a more 'traditional' structure; courses are typically taught by academicians and have a focus on theory as well as analysis. In the United States, the official academic honor society for Master of Healthcare Administration graduates is Upsilon Phi Delta. Australia In Australia the Master of Health Administration may be divided in two parts; the first part awards a graduate diploma of Health Service Management, and, depending on the outcome, diplomates may be permitted to continue to the second part which culminates in the Master of Healthcare Administration degree. Course structures, and be either research or coursework based. The Master of Health Administration is considered the benchmark qualification by the Australasian College of Health Services Management and the Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators. Unlike elsewhere, the Master of Healthcare Administration is not intended primarily for medical practitioners (who have courses provided by their professional organisations) but is open to graduates of any discipline wishing to pursue a career in health administration. Owing to the wide variety of course nomenclature in Australia, some universities offer the course as a Master of Business(Health Administration), abbreviated to MBus(Hlth).

SVP also owns and maintains a dark fiber network named SVP Fiber Enterprise, and provides citywide free outdoor Wi-Fi access as part of its installed wireless network communications system that supports SVP MeterConnect, SVP‚Äôs Advanced Metering Infrastructure program. __TOC__  History  The City of Santa Clara electric department was founded in 1896 when it installed 46 streetlights powered by a direct current generator. From January 1904 to 1965, the electric department began purchasing energy for resale to Santa Clara‚Äôs customers from the United Gas and Electric Company of San Jose, which later became part of Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;). PG&E; supplied Santa Clara‚Äôs electric needs until 1965, when the electric department began to purchase its power from the Central Valley Project (CVP) supervised by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. In 1968, Santa Clara became a founding member of the Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) in order to work with other municipal electric utilities to jointly develop cost-effective energy sources. In 1980, the Santa Clara electric department became an energy producing utility for the first time since 1903 when it launched its own 6-megawatt (MW) cogeneration project, the first of three natural gas-fueled electricity generation plants in the City of Santa Clara. In 1983, Santa Clara and its NCPA partners became the first cities in the U.S. to invest in and operate a publicly owned geothermal plant, the 110 MW NCPA Geothermal Project, one of 22 geothermal power plants at The Geysers,‚ÄúCalifornia and Western Electricity Supply Outlook Report, Appendices A-E‚Äù California Energy Commission (2005), p B-23 with Santa Clara having a 55% ownership interest. In 1998, the Santa Clara electric department was renamed Silicon Valley Power (SVP). Subsequent efforts to expand and diversify its electricity supply led to construction of the Donald Von Raesfeld combined cycle natural gas plant (2005), various partnerships in wind and hydroelectric generation sources,‚ÄúCity of Santa Clara Electric Resources‚Äù Siliconvalleypower.com (2013) and 25 percent ownership of the Lodi Energy Center combined cycle natural gas plant (2012).‚ÄúState, Local Agencies Come Together to Dedicate State of the Art Lodi Energy Center‚Äù Northern California Power Association news release August 10, 2012 In 2007, SVP launched Santa Clara Green Power to provide residents and businesses the option to use only renewable energy.

Power Portfolio  In 2017 the SVP power mix consisted of 38% from eligible renewable resources as defined by the California Energy Commission, 34% large hydroelectric, 16% natural gas, 9% coal, and 3% from unspecified sources. Total kilowatt-hour (kWh) retail sales in 2018 were 3,566,293,836 kWh.  Facilities and Generation Sources  Generating facilities owned by the City of Santa Clara and located in the city provided 32.5% of the electricity consumed in Santa Clara. Natural gas-fueled facilities are the Donald Von Raesfeld natural gas power plant (147.8 MW), Gianera Generating Station (49.5 MW) and Cogeneration Plant #1 (7 MW).City of Santa Clara Electric Resources In addition, power is also generated by the Jenny Strand Solar Research and Development Park (100 kW),‚ÄúSilicon Valley Power Adds 100-Kilowatt Solar Array to Santa Clara Grid,‚Äù City of Santa Clara, the Tasman Parking Structure Solar PV (400 kW) and by the capture and burning of methane gas from a closed City of Santa Clara landfill (750 kW).‚ÄúSilicon Valley Power Adds 110 Million KWH Of Wind Power,‚Äù The Power of Green, SVP also owns a 230-kilovolt (kV) transmission line that brings electricity into the city from non-local sources. Generating sources owned by SVP and located outside the city include the Stony Creek Hydroelectric System and Grizzly Hydroelectric Project. Joint Power Agencies (JPA) of which SVP is a member include the NCPA (hydroelectric, natural gas, geothermal projects) and M-S-R (coal and wind). SVP also contracts to receive electricity through power purchase agreements with such entities as Iberdrola and Seawest LLC (wind); Western Area Power Association, Tri-Dam Project, Friant Power Authority (hydroelectric); Recurrent Energy (solar); and G2 Energy and Ameresco (landfill gas). SVP receives generation produced outside Santa Clara via transmission facilities owned and operated by PG&E; under the direction of the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). SVP also participates in the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) which is interconnected to PG&E;‚Äôs transmission facilities.  Electricity Rates  As of January 1, 2015, SVP and the City of Santa Clara have the lowest average system rates for electricity in California for any electric utility serving over 10,000 customers.Presentation to City of Santa Clara City Council, October 29, 2013, agenda item 5A For residential customers, the monthly fixed meter charge is $3.20, and electricity rates are $0.09787/kWh for the first 300 kWh used in one month, and $0.11251/kWh for usage exceeding 300 kWh within the same month.‚ÄúRate Schedule D-1 Domestic Service,‚Äù City of Santa Clara, Silicon Valley Power, With basic service, commercial customers pay a monthly $3.47 meter charge, $0.16688/kWh for the first 800 kWh, and $0.15150/kWh thereafter.‚ÄúRate Schedule C-1 General Service,‚Äù City of Santa Clara, Silicon Valley Power, Neighboring communities pay 19% to 44% more for their electricity from the region‚Äôs dominant utility.

In 2013, the State of California required utilities to provide at least 20% of their power from eligible renewable resources, which included hydropower plants that generate up to 30 MW of power. SVP‚Äôs eligible renewable portfolio in 2012 was 24.2%. When SVP‚Äôs hydropower plants that generate over 30 MW are factored in, SVP‚Äôs total ‚Äúgreen‚Äù resource profile rises to 41.9%. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, SVP was ranked among the top 10 municipal utilities in the U.S. by the Solar Electric Power Association for new solar power capacity. In late 2013, SVP was recognized by the independent survey company RKS Research for scoring the highest business customer satisfaction ratings of any California utility included in its surveys since RKS began polling utility customers in 1995. SVP also earned the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs 2014 Public Power Wind Award for the pursuit and creative utilization of wind power resources.

The majority of those killed were supporters of the People's Mujahedin of Iran, although supporters of other leftist factions, including the Fedaian and the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party), were executed as well.Iranian party demands end to repression Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, 1999, 209-228 According to Amnesty International, \\"thousands of political dissidents were systematically subjected to enforced disappearance in Iranian detention facilities across the country and extrajudicially executed pursuant to an order issued by the Supreme Leader of Iran and implemented across prisons in the country. Many of those killed during this time were subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment in the process.\\" The killings have been described as a political purge without precedent in modern Iranian history, both in terms of scope and coverup. However, the exact number of prisoners executed remains a point of contention. Amnesty International, after interviewing dozens of relatives, puts the number in thousands; and then-Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini's deputy, Hussein-Ali Montazeri put the number between 2,800 and 3,800 in his memoirs, but an alternative estimation suggests that the number exceeded 30,000. Because of the large number, prisoners were loaded into forklift trucks in groups of six and hanged from cranes in half-hour intervals.The World's Most Notorious Dictators. Athlon Special Issue. 2017. p. 80 Ayatollah Montazeri wrote to Ayatollah Khomeini saying \\"at least order to spare women who have children ... the execution of several thousand prisoners in a few days will not reflect positively and will not be mistake-free ... A large number of prisoners have been killed under torture by interrogators ... in some prisons of the Islamic Republic young girls are being raped ... As a result of unruly torture, many prisoners have become deaf or paralysed or afflicted with chronic decease.\\" Great care was taken to keep the killings undercover, and the government of Iran currently denies their having taken place. Justifications offered for the alleged executions vary, but one of the most common theories advanced is that they were in retaliation for the 1988 attack on the western borders of Iran by the People's Mujahedin of Iran. However, this does not fully account for the targeting of other leftist groups who opposed the Mujahedin invasion.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), 218 The killings operated outside legislation and trials were not concerned with establishing the guilt or innocence of defendants. Survivors of the massacre have made various calls for justice and prosecution for the event. Canada has called the event a crime against humanity, and Italy has made similar declarations for justice to be served.  The Massacre = Khomeini's order  Khomeini's order letter Shortly before the executions commenced, Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini issued \\"a secret but extraordinary order ‚Äì some suspect a formal fatwa.\\" This set up \\"Special Commissions with instructions to execute members of People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran as moharebs (those who war against Allah) and leftists as mortads (apostates from Islam).\\"Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, University of California Press, 1999, p. 210. In part the letter reads: Translation : > [In the Name of God, The Compassionate, the Merciful,] > As the treacherous Monafeqin [Mojahedin] do not believe in Islam and what > they say is out of deception and hypocrisy, and > As their leaders have confessed that they have become renegades, and > As they are waging war on God, and > As they are engaging in classical warfare in the western, the northern and > the southern fronts, and > As they are collaborating with the Baathist Party of Iraq and spying for > Saddam against our Muslim nation, and > As they are tied to the World Arrogance, and in light of their cowardly > blows to the Islamic Republic since its inception, > It is decreed that those who are in prison throughout the country and > remain steadfast in their support for the Monafeqin [Mojahedin] are waging > war on God and are condemned to execution.  Administering of the executions  In Tehran the special commission for the executions had 16 members representing the various authorities of the Islamic government ‚Äì Imam Khomeini himself, the president, the chief prosecutor, the Revolutionary Tribunals, the Ministries of Justice and Intelligence, and the administration of Evin and Gohar Dasht, the two prisons in the Tehran area from which the prisoner were eliminated. The chair of the commission was Ayatollah Morteza Eshraqi. His two special assistants were Hojatt al-Islam Hossein-Ali Nayyeri and Hojjat al-Islam Ali Mobasheri. The commission shuttled back and forth between Evin and Gohar Dasht prisons by helicopter. In the provinces similar commissions were established, but less is known about them. Another description of the administration of the executions has it implemented by a \\"four-man commission, later known as the 'death committee'.\\" Members were Hossein-Ali Nayyeri (who was then a judge), Morteza Eshraqi (then Tehran Prosecutor), Ebrahim Raisi (then Deputy Prosecutor General) and Mostafa Pourmohammadi (then the representative of the Intelligence Ministry in Evin Prison). Ebrahim Raisi went on to campaign for president of Iran in 2017 as a hard-line conservative where he was criticized for his role in the executions. Amnesty International identified and analysed evidence that linked several Iranian officials to participating in the massacre. These included Alireza Avayi (tasked to participate in the so-called \\"death commission\\" of Dezful), Ebrahim Raisi (member of the \\"death commission\\" in Tehran), Mostafa Pour Mohammadi, and others. The prisoners were not executed without any proceedings, but were \\"tried\\" on charges totally unrelated to the charges that had landed them in prison. They were interviewed by commissions with a set list of questions to see if they qualified as moharebs or mortads to the satisfaction of that commission. Many, if not most, of the prisoners were unaware of the true purpose of the questions, although later some were warned by the prison grapevine. Some of the victims were killed because of their beliefs about religion ‚Äì because they were atheists or because they were Muslims who followed different versions of Islam.  Isolation of the prisoners  Some scholarly examinations of the massacre argue that the planning stages of the 1988 Massacre began months before the actual executions started. According to one report: \\"prison officials took the unusual step in late 1987 and early 1988 of re-questioning and separating all political prisoners according to party affiliation and length of sentence.\\"Kaveh Sharooz, \\"With Revolutionary Rage and Rancor: A Preliminary Report on the 1988 Massacre of Iran's Political Prisoners\\", Harvard Human Rights Journal, Volume 20, p. 233. The actual execution process began in the early hours of 19 July 1988 with the isolation of the political prisoners from the outside world. Prison gates were closed, scheduled visits and telephone calls were canceled, letters, care packages, and even vital medicines from the outside were turned away, the main law courts went on an unscheduled vacation. Even relatives of prisoners were forbidden to congregate outside the prison gates. Inside the prison, cell blocks were isolated from each other and cleared of radios and televisions. Places where prisoners gathered communally, such as lecture halls, workshops, infirmaries, were all closed down and inmates were confined to their cells. Prison guards and workers were ordered not to speak to prisoners. One prisoner constructed a homemade wireless set to listen to the radio news from the outside but found news broadcasters were saying nothing at all about the lockdown.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), pp. 209-10.  People's Mujahedin of Iran  The first prisoners to be interviewed or \\"tried\\" were the male members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran, including those who had repented of their association with the group. The commission prefaced the proceedings with the false assurance that this was not a trial but a process for initiating a general amnesty and separating the Muslims from the non-Muslims. It first asked their organisational affiliation; if they replied \\"Mojahedin\\", the questioning ended there. If they replied monafeqin (hypocrites), the commission continued with such questions as: *'Are you willing to denounce former colleagues?' *'Are you willing to denounce them in front of the cameras?' *'Are you willing to help us hunt them down?' *'Will you name secret sympathizers?' *'Will you identify phony repenters?' *'Will you go to the war front and walk through enemy minefields?' Almost all the prisoners fail to answer in the affirmative to all the questions. These were then taken to another room and ordered to write their last will and testament and to discard any personal belongings such as rings, watches, and spectacles. They were then blindfolded and taken to the gallows where they were hanged in batches of six. Since \\"hanging\\" did not mean death by breaking of the neck by drop through a trap door, but stringing up the victim by the neck to suffocate, some took fifteen minutes to die. After the first few days, the overworked executioners requested firing squads. These requests were rejected on the claim that the Shari'a mandated hanging for apostates and enemies of Allah, though it is thought that the real reason may have been that hanging was quieter than gunfire and would thus better preserve the secrecy of the operations. At first this secrecy was effective. \\"One survivor admits that he thought he was being processed to be released in time for the forthcoming peace celebrations.\\"'Interview with Two Survivors of the Mass Killings,' Ettehad-e Kar 41 (August 1997), quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 212.  Dealing with leftists  After 27 August, the commission turned its attention to the leftist prisoners, such as members of the Tudeh, Majority Fedayi, Minority Fedayi, other Fedayi, Kumaleh, Rah-e Kargar, Peykar. These were also assured they were in no danger and asked: *'Are you a Muslim?' *'Do you believe in Allah?' *'Is the Holy Qur'an the Word of Allah?' *'Do you believe in Heaven and Hell?' *'Do you accept the Holy Muhammad to be the Seal of the Prophets?' *'Will you publicly recant historical materialism?' *'Will you denounce your former beliefs before the cameras?' *'Do you fast during Ramadan?' *'Do you pray and read the Holy Qur'an?' *'Would you rather share a cell with a Muslim or a non-Muslim?' *'Will you sign an affidavit that you believe in Allah, the Prophet, the Holy Qur'an, and the Resurrection?' *'When you were growing up, did your father pray, fast, and read the Holy Qur'an?' Prisoners were told that authorities were asking them these questions because they planned to separate practicing Muslims from non-practicing ones. However, the real reason was to determine whether the prisoners qualified as apostates from Islam, in which case they would join the moharebs in the gallows. Some prisoners saved from execution by answering the questions properly returned to their cells and passed along what the commission was asking. A leftist prisoner \\"who had at one time attended a seminary quickly grasped the theological significance of the questions\\" and \\"spent the night of August 30 sending morse code messages to other cells\\" by knocking on the prison walls. He pointed \\"out the hidden dangers.\\" The questioners wanted to know if prisoners' fathers prayed, fasted, and read the Qur'an because the sons of devout men could be called apostates. If they had not been raised in proper Muslim homes first and \\"exposed to true Islam,\\" they could not be apostates. Another wrong answer was refusing to reply \\"on the grounds of 'privacy',\\" which \\"could itself be taken as an admission of 'apostasy'.\\"Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 212. All this was a surprise to the prisoners, with one commenting: \\"In previous years, they wanted us to confess to spying. In 1988, they wanted us to convert to Islam.\\"Editorial, 'The Islamic Law of Repentance,' Aksariyat 18 May 1989 quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), pp. 212-3. It also meant there was no correlation between the length of sentence being served and the likelihood of death. \\"The first leftist to go before the Evin commission were those with light, and even completed, sentences.\\" These had no warning of what was in store and many died.  Dealing with women  Mojahedin women were given equal treatment with Mojahedin men, almost all hanged as 'armed enemies of Allah'. However, for apostasy the punishment for women was different and lighter than that for men. Since according to the commission's interpretation of Islamic law, women were not fully responsible for their actions, \\"disobedient women ‚Äì including apostates ‚Äì could be given discretionary punishments to mend their ways and obey male superiors.\\" Leftist women‚Äîeven those raised as practicing Muslims‚Äîwere given another 'opportunity' to recant their 'apostasy.' \\"After the investigation, leftist women were all given five lashes for every one of the five daily prayers missed, half the punishment meted out to the men. After a while, many agreed to pray, but some went on hunger strike, refusing even water. One died after 22 days and 550 lashes, and the authorities certified her death as suicide because it was 'she who had made the decision not to pray.'\\"E. Mahbaz (pseudonym, 'The Islamic Republic of Iran ‚Äì The Hell for women: Seven Years in Prison\\" (unpublished paper, 1996), quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 215.  Families  According to Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, executed prisoner's families were told: 'For one year you shall refrain from holding a funeral, or mourning his death in any public way. If after one year your conduct is deemed acceptable, we will reveal to you his place of burial.' The justification given to these families for the execution of their loved ones was that the prisoner's name had appeared on notes pinned to PMOI members killed in the Mersad attack whose bodies had been recovered by Iranian Islamic officials. The notes listing the PMOI's supporters' in prison so the prisoners had been guilty of aiding the attack. Ebadi complained that aside from being improbable, this did not explain why the prisoners had not received a trial for the charge of giving support to the enemy.Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, pp. 87, 88. In 2009, the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center commissioned Geoffrey Robertson QC to write a legal opinion based on evidence and witness testimonies gathered by the Center. Robertson's final report accused Tehran of continuing to deny relatives of the victims their right to know where their loved ones are buried.  Estimates of fatalities  One anonymous ex-prisoner places the death toll in the 'thousands.' Another eyewitness puts in between 5000 and 6000 ‚Äì 1000 from the left and the rest from the Mojahedin.Anonymous, 'I Was Witness to the Slaughter of Political Prisoners in Gohar Dasht,' Cheshmandaz, n.14 (Winter 1995): 68, quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 212. Yet another estimates it in the 'thousands', with as many as 1500 killed at Gohar Dasht prison alone.K. Homayun, 'The Slaughter at Gohar Dasht', Kar 62, (April 1992), quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 212. A recent study using scattered information from the provinces places the figure at 12,000.N. Mohajer, 'The Mass Killings in Iran' Aresh 57 (August 1996): 7, quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 212. Amnesty International estimates that the national total is more than 2500 and describes the vast majority of the victims as 'prisoners of conscience' as they had not been charged with actual deeds or plans of deeds against the state.Amnesty International. Iran: Violations of Human Rights, 1987‚Äì1990 (London, 1991) 12. It is extremely difficult to get an accurate number since many killings were carried out in remote Kurdish and Baluchi cities. It could be as high as 30,000 according to figures provided by Iranian defectors. In the aftermath of the 2009 uprisings in Iran, a defector of the Iranian regime Mohammad Nurizad stated over 33,000 people were massacred within 2‚Äì3 months in the summer of 1988. It is estimated that most of the executed were either high school or college students or fresh graduates, and over 10% were women.Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening, by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House New York, 2006, pp. 90-1. According to Christina Lamb, writing in The Telegraph: \\"Secret documents smuggled out of Iran reveal that, because of the large numbers of necks to be broken, prisoners were loaded onto forklift trucks in groups of six and hanged from cranes in half-hourly intervals.\\"  International reaction and criticism  On 30 August 2017, the United Nations Human Rights Council highlighted the 1988 massacre and distributed a written statement by three non-governmental organizations titled, \\"The 1988 Massacre of Political Prisoners in Iran: Time for the Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence\\" The statement points to the following: In 1988, the government of Iran massacred 30,000 political prisoners. The executions took place based on a fatwa by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Three-member commissions known as a 'Death Commission' were formed across Iran sending political prisoners who refused to abandon their beliefs to execution. The victims were buried in secret mass graves. The perpetrators continue to enjoy impunity. Another joint written statement by five NGOs with consultative status with the United Nations was circulated during the UN Human Rights Council in February 2018 urged \\"UN to launch fact-finding mission to investigate Iran's 1988 massacre in order to end impunity and prevent the same fate for detained protesters.\\" On 4 December 2018 Amnesty International asked the government of Iran to bring to light what has happened to the political detainees in the country. Amnesty asked United nations to set up an investigation group to find the facts of crimes against humanity in Iran. In November 2019, Sweden arrested Hamid Nouri, accused of being an assistant prosecutor during the massacres and playing a key role during the mass executions. UN Special Rapporteur Agn√®s Callamard stated that Nouri's arrest was the first time that someone was held responsible for the mass killings.  Response = Montazeri  Deputy Supreme Leader Hussein Ali-Montazeri condemned the executions. He was dismissed by Khomeini and later placed under house arrest One of the consequences of the killings was the resignation of Hussein-Ali Montazeri as the heir-designate to Ayatollah Khomeini as Supreme Leader of Iran. Prior to the killings, Montazeri \\"had taken issue with the diehard cleric on a number of subjects ‚Äì the trial of Mehdi Hashemi, the anti- hoarding campaign ...\\" When he heard of the killings Montazeri rushed off three public letters ‚Äì two to Khomeini, one to the Special Commission ‚Äì denouncing the executions \\"in no uncertain terms.\\" He also took the Special Commission \\"to task for violating Islam by executing repenters and minor offenders who in a proper court of law would have received a mere reprimand.\\"editor, 'Montazeri's Letters,' Cheshmandaz, n.6 (Summer 1989), 35-37, quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p.220 Montazeri warned Khomeini: \\"The execution of several thousand prisoners in a few days will not have positive repercussions and will not be mistake-free.\\" Montazeri was asked to resign, with Khomeini maintaining he had always been doubtful of Montazeri's competence and that 'I expressed reservations when the Assembly of Experts first appointed you.'\\" But the Assembly of Experts had insisted on naming Montazeri the future Supreme Leader.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 220. The regime published letters between the two Ayatollahs but \\"the selection dealt only with the Hashemi affair and scrupulously avoided the mass executions ‚Äì thus observing the official line that these executions never took place.\\"Ranjnameh-e Hazrat Hojjat al-Islam va al-Muslman Aqa-ye Hajj Sayyed Ahmad Khomeini beh Hazrat Ayatollah Montazeri (Tehran, 1990), quoted in Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 220. On 9 August 2016, a website run by followers of Montazeri published an audio recording from a meeting he held on August 15, 1988 with the special judicial tribunal (Tehran Prosecutor Morteza Eshraghi, Judge Hossein-Ali Nayeri, Deputy Prosecutor General Ebrahim Raeesi and MOIS representative in Evin Mostafa Pourmohammadi). One can hear Montazeri condemning the mass executions. The Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) had the recording taken down the day after its release.  Authorities position  Ebrahim Raisi (right) and Mostafa Pourmohammadi (left), two members of \\"Judges of Death\\" committee. Both become high-rank officials in next years Mostafa Pourmohammadi, who was speaking in the administrative council meeting in the city of Khorram-Abad in Lorestan province, on 28 August 2016 said: \\"We are proud we have implemented God's order about Mojahedin (PMOI or MEK).\\" The Iran government accused those investigating the killings of \\"disclosing state secrets\\" and \\"threatening national security\\". According to Amnesty International, there has been an ongoing campaign by the Islamic Republic to demonize victims, distort facts, and repress family survivors and human rights defenders.  Other criticism  One complaint made against the mass killings was that almost all the prisoners executed had been arrested for relatively minor offenses, since those with serious charges had already been executed. The 1988 killings resembled the 'disappearances' of prisoners in 20th-century Latin America.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 217. According to Kaveh Shahrooz, writing in Gozaar, a publication sponsored by Freedom House, \\"it is baffling that two of the world's most powerful human rights organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have simply never written full reports on a crime as widespread as the 1988 extermination campaign.\\"Twenty Years of Silence: The 1988 Massacre and the Quest for Accountability , Gozaar While Amnesty International's report \\"Iran: Violations of Human Rights 1987-1990\\" published in 1990 devotes a few pages to the massacre, the human rights organization has never written a full report on the killings. The Amnesty International report states: > The political executions took place in many prisons in all parts of Iran, > often far from where the armed incursion took place. Most of the executions > were of political prisoners, including an unknown number of prisoners of > conscience, who had already served a number of years in prison. They could > have played no part in the armed incursion, and they were in no position to > take part in spying or terrorist activities.

Similarly, Human Rights Watch devotes a mere handful of pages to the massacre in a background report concerning President Ahmadinejad's cabinet picks. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has described the executions as \\"deliberate and systematic ... extrajudicial killings,\\" and has condemned them as crimes against humanity. HRW has also accused Mustafa Pour-Mohammadi, Iran's Interior Minister from 2005‚Äì2008, of direct involvement in the killings. UN Judge and leading human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC has urged the UN Security Council to set up a special court, along the lines of the International Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to try the men involved \\"for one of the worst single human rights atrocities since the Second World War.\\" On 4 December 2018 Amnesty International asked the government of Iran to bring to light what has happened to the political detainees in the country. Amnesty asked the UN to set up an investigation group to find the facts of crimes against humanity in Iran.  Motivation  Campaigners for justice for the executed, London, 2018. A 2018 research by Amnesty International found that Ruhollah Khomeini had ordered the torture and execution of thousands of political prisoners through a secret fatwa. In 2016, an audio recording was posted online of a high-level official meeting that took place in August 1988 between Hossein Ali Montazeri and the officials responsible for the mass killings in Tehran. In the recording, Hossein Ali Montazeri is heard saying that the ministry of intelligence used the MEK's armed incursion as a pretext to carry out the mass killings, which \\"had been under consideration for several years.\\" Scholars disagree over why the prisoners were killed. Ali Akbar Mahdi believes the intense overcrowding of Iranian prisons and the July 1988 Mojahedin Operation Mersad offensive \\"had much to do\\" with the massacre.Review by Ali Akbar Mahdi of Tortured Confessions: Prison and Public Recantations in Modern Iran, in International Journal of Middle East Studies 2000, p. 417. Ervand Abrahamian believes the \\"regime's internal dynamics\\" were responsible ‚Äì the need for \\"a glue\\" to hold \\"together his disparate followers\\" and a \\"bloodbath\\" to \\"purge\\" moderates like Montazeri and prevent any future \\"d√©tente with the West\\" from destroying his legacy.Abrahamian, Tortured Confessions, (1999), p. 219. In particular the killings destroyed any ties, or possibility of ties, between populists in the Khomeini movement on the one hand, and non-Khomeiniist Islamist and secular leftists on the other. Khomeini had been concerned that \\"some of his followers had toyed with the dangerous notion of working with the Tudeh Party to incorporate more radical clauses into the Labor Law as well as into the Land Reform Law\\" earlier.Abrahamian, Ervand, History of Modern Iran, Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 182.  Iran Tribunal  In 2012, the families of the victims, along with the survivors of the mass executions initiated an international Commission, the Iran Tribunal, in order to investigate the mass killing of Iran's political prisoners. \\"Iran Tribunal\\" is aiming to hold Iran's government accountable on charges of crimes against humanity.

The Squadron's nickname was \\"Snowy Owl\\". Their motto was Pugnamus Finitum, Latin for We Fight To The Finish. No. 420 Squadron is no longer active. History No. 420 Squadron was formed at Waddington, Lincolnshire, England on 19 December 1941 by Jordan Tyler and Dan Riggden. During the Second World War, the unit ultimately flew Manchester, Hampden, Wellington, Halifax, and Lancaster aircraft on strategic and tactical bombing operations. From June to October 1943 it flew tropicalized Wellington aircraft from North Africa in support of the invasions of Sicily and Italy. In April 1945 they converted to Lancasters, and when hostilities in Europe concluded, it was selected as part of Tiger Force slated for duty in the Pacific, and returned to Canada for reorganisation and training. The sudden end of the war in the Far East resulted in the Squadron being disbanded at Debert, Nova Scotia on 5 September 1945. No. 420 Squadron reformed at London, Ontario on 15 September 1948, and flew Mustang aircraft in a fighter role until the squadron disbanded on 1 September 1956. Re-formed during the unification period, No. 420 was an air reserve squadron based initially at CFB Shearwater, Nova scotia flying the Tracker air craft that had once been the backbone of the Canadian Naval Air's anti-submarine program. As an Air Reserve Squadron it participated with regular fisheries patrols. It was one of the few active Air Reserve Squadrons in Canada and was paired with the Regular Force's 880 Squadron. The Squadron was rebased to CFB Summerside when that base was downsized. No. 420 Squadron is no longer active.

It is a departure from U2's classic sound, as it is a quiet, almost instrumental piece. It was included as a hidden track on The Best of 1980‚Äì1990 compilation. It is the only track from October included in the compilation. Lyrics and music \\"October\\" reflects the spiritual turmoil of the band at the time it was written, during which three of the band's members were wrestling with whether being members of a rock band was consistent with their Christian beliefs. Lead singer Bono has said of \\"October\\": :\\"'October'...it's an image. We've been through the 60s, a time when things were in full bloom. We had fridges and cars, we sent people to the moon and everyone thought how great mankind was. And now, as we go through the 70s and 80s, it's a colder time of the year. It's after the harvest. Trees are stripped bare. You can see things and we finally realize that maybe we aren't so smart after all, now that there's millions of unemployed people, now that we used the technology we've been blessed with to build bombs for war machines, to build rockets, whatever. So 'October' is an ominous word, but it's also quite lyrical.\\" U2 guitarist the Edge plays piano on the track despite having stopped playing piano as a teenager. Author John D. Luerssen describes the piano part as \\"one of U2's most enduring and meditative keyboard-steered melodies\\" and considers its somber mood as a reflection of the Edge's recent experience on tour playing in Europe under grey skies. Live performances \\"October\\" made its live debut on 16 August 1981 and this performance featured extended, rambling lyrics from Bono that were never used again live. It was a set list staple for much of the October Tour and followed \\"I Fall Down\\", another song from the October album that the Edge played on piano. However, it was omitted from the set list at all 1982 dates where U2 supported the J. Geils Band. At the first show of the War Tour's \\"Pre-Tour\\", \\"October\\" preceded \\"New Year's Day\\", a pairing that would later become a famous segue at U2 concerts in the 1980s. The pairing was utilised for all \\"Pre-Tour\\" concerts with known set lists, but for the first proper leg and the first two weeks of the second leg, U2 reverted to a pairing initially tried at two October Tour dates, where \\"October\\" segued into \\"Tomorrow\\". In May 1983, \\"New Year's Day\\" returned to its position after \\"October\\" and the pairing was filmed for the Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky concert film. This pairing was played at almost every show on the Unforgettable Fire Tour and Joshua Tree Tour, typically as part of a greater combination that closed most main sets: \\"Bad\\", then \\"October\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", and finally \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\". At a few early Joshua Tree Tour shows, \\"With or Without You\\" was played between \\"October\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\". It is one of only three songs from October to be played live after the Unforgettable Fire Tour; the others are \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Scarlet\\". The demise of \\"October\\" as a live song came on the Lovetown Tour. It was played at most of the tour's early shows in the position it had held on the Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree Tours, but on 9 October 1989 in Melbourne, its replacement, \\"Van Diemen's Land\\", debuted. The 9 October show was the only one where both were played; subsequently, the band played one or the other, and they demonstrated a strong preference for \\"Van Diemen's Land\\", as it was from the band's most recent album, Rattle and Hum. \\"October\\" was played just three more times. On 18 July 2015, U2 played \\"October\\" at its first New York show on the Innocence + Experience Tour, having not played the song since 11 November 1989 in Auckland. After one other performance on the first leg, it then became a mainstay on the second leg in Europe, segueing directly into \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". Versions Two alternate versions of \\"October\\" were released on the 1982 soundtrack to They Call it an Accident. The first is a remix, clocking in at 2:31, which is quite similar to the album version, save for an instrumental outro tacked on at the end. The second mix is an instrumental one clocking in at 1:25. This is really just a shortened version of the album mix.

The Roman Province of Britannia was known for exporting dogs. The references by Roman writers to these dogs suggest that British dogs were both fast and strong, useful in hunting and even in war. Some modern dog book authors are of the opinion that these dogs were a distinct breed of dog, and that this breed was the progenitor to the English MastiffFleig, D. (1996). Fighting Dog Breeds. (Pg. 26 - 27). Neptune, NJ: TFH Publications. and possibly the Bulldog. Historical references The ancient Roman poet Grattius (or Grattius Faliscus) wrote of British dogs, describing them as superior to the ancient Greek Molossus, saying: > \\"What if you choose to penetrate even among the Britons? How great your > reward, how great your gain beyond any outlays! If you are not bent on looks > and deceptive graces (this is the one defect of the British whelps), at any > rate when serious work has come, when bravery must be shown, and the > impetuous War-god calls in the utmost hazard, then you could not admire the > renowned Molossians so much.\\" The ancient Greek historian Strabo reported that dogs were exported from Britain for the purpose of game hunting, and that these dogs were also used by the Celts as war dogs. The Roman writer Tacitus, in the first century AD, mentions in his accounts of Britain that its principal exports were grain, hides, cattle, iron, silver, slaves, and clever hunting-dogs. The late Roman poet Nemesianus referred to British dogs, describing them as swift and suited to hunting. The even later Roman poet Claudian describes British dogs \\"that can break the backs of mighty bulls.\\" Agassian > \\"There is a strong breed of hunting dog, small in size but no less worthy of > great praise.

The clan does not currently have a chief therefore it is considered an Armigerous clan. History=Origins of the clan The name is territorial in origin, derived from an old barony of the name in Lanarkshire. Hugh de Padinan, who is believed to have lived in the twelfth century, was granted the lands of Kilpeter. By about the middle of the fourteenth century, these lands had become known as Huston, or Houston, Renfrewshire. Sir Finlay de Hustone appears on the Ragman Roll swearing fealty to King Edward I of England in 1296. The castle of the de Hustones was built on the site of an ancient Cistercian abbey. The family also acquired a substantial barony near Whitburn, West Lothian, where Huston House, which was rebuilt in the eighteenth century, still stands today. Sir Patrick Hustone of that Ilk, who was probably the eleventh chief, married Agnes Campbell of Ardkinglas. Sixteenth and seventeenth centuries During the Anglo- Scottish Wars, Sir Peter Huston fought with the Earl of Lennox on the right wing at Battle of Flodden in 1513, where he was killed. His son, Sir Patrick Huston of Huston, was a companion of James V of Scotland and Keeper of the Quarter Seal. He intrigued with Lord Lennox against the king, and was slain at the Battle of Linlithgow. The next Sir Patrick, his grandson, was knighted by Mary, Queen of Scots, and accompanied her when she visited Lord Darnley in Glasgow. The nineteenth chief was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles II in 1668. His son, Sir John, was falconer to Queen Mary and her husband, King William of Orange. Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries The fifth Baronet was a prosperous merchant who had substantial interests in United States. His son, who was educated in Glasgow, made his home in the southern state of Georgia in the US, and he and his brother greatly increased the family‚Äôs colonial estates. They are reputed to have owned over eight thousand slaves when the thirteen American colonies broke from Great Britain and declared their independence. The Hustons renounced their Scottish titles in favour of their American wealth. General Sam Houston, born in Rockbridge, VA, 1793, was a schoolteacher in Maryville Tennessee, US Senator from the State of Tennessee, ran for President of the United States, fought for the independence of Texas from Mexico, defeating Santa Ana and started the Texas Rangers. He was the first president of the Republic of Texas. Sir Robert Houston, descended from a Renfrew branch of the family, was a prominent Victorian ship owner who was created a baronet of the United Kingdom. He is credited with developing the theory of convoys first used during the Boer War. Twentieth century A living member of the clan, Josh Houston, has taken up the case with the Court of the Lord Lyon to be instated as the Chief of the Houston Clan. The Court has yet to reach a decision. Motto Motto: In Tempus (\\"In Time\\").

Dual citizenship was severely restricted under Maltese law from independence in 1964 until 10 February 2000, when all restrictions were removed. Dual citizenship had been allowed in limited circumstances from 1989, but only for persons born in Malta who met specific residence criteria. Prior to 21 September 1964, Malta was a British Crown colony and Maltese persons held British nationality. Maltese citizenship at independence (1964)  Maltese citizenship was conferred at Maltese Independence on 21 September 1964 upon persons born in Malta who had a Maltese-born parent. Persons acquiring Maltese citizenship at independence generally lost their British nationality (Citizenship of the UK and Colonies) unless they had ties by way of birth or descent (father or paternal grandfather) to the United Kingdom itself or a place which remained a colony. Any Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) connected with Malta who did not acquire Maltese citizenship at independence retained their CUKC status. Based on their ties with the United Kingdom, they became either British citizens or British Overseas citizens on 1 January 1983. See History of British nationality law Birth in Malta The Malta Independence Order 1964 provided that any person born in Malta between 21 September 1964 and 31 July 2001 automatically acquired Maltese citizenship at birth. From 1 August 2001, a person born in Malta only acquires Maltese citizenship at birth if a parent of that person is * a Maltese citizen; or * born in Malta. Maltese citizenship by descent Persons born outside Malta between 21 September 1964 and 31 July 1989 only acquired Maltese citizenship by descent if the father was: * a Maltese citizen born in Malta; or * a Maltese citizen by registration or naturalisation Women could not pass on their Maltese citizenship unless they were unmarried. From 1 August 1989, children born outside Malta to Maltese born or naturalised mothers acquired Maltese citizenship by descent automatically. From 10 February 2000, a person born outside Malta between 21 September 1964 and 31 July 1989 to a Maltese born or naturalised mother may apply for Maltese citizenship by registration. Changes to the Maltese Citizenship Act in 2007 Amendments to the Maltese Citizenship Act, which came into force on 1 August 2007, make it possible for all persons of Maltese descent to obtain Maltese citizenship by registration. A person has to provide only documentary evidence such as birth, marriage or death certificates to be registered as a citizen. This documentation must show direct descent from an ancestor born in Malta of a parent who was also born in Malta. If a person has parents, grandparents, etc. who are alive and are direct descendants themselves, they will also have to make applications (direct line cannot be broken). The registration procedure may take place at any Maltese Embassy, High Commission, Consulate or at the Department for Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs in Malta. Residence in Malta is not required. Naturalisation as a Maltese citizen Prior to 1 August 1989, the residence period for naturalisation was 6 years (5 years for citizens of Commonwealth countries). This period is now 5 years.http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lom&itemid;=8702&l;=1 Art. 10(1) of the Maltese Citizenship Act Since the reforms of 2000, persons acquiring Maltese citizenship by naturalisation or registration are no longer obliged to prove they had lost or renounced any other citizenship they held. The same reforms also allowed all former citizens of Malta (who were not automatically given Maltese citizenship back) to re-acquire Maltese citizenship by registration. Changes to the Maltese Citizenship Act in 2013 in view of Malta Individual Investor Programme Act XV of 2013 introduced amendments to the main act and made it possible for the Minister responsible for citizenship to assign citizenship by naturalisation to a person and his or her dependants who are contributors to the Malta Individual Investor Programme (MIIP), a citizenship-by-investment program designed and implemented by Henley & Partners, a global citizenship advisory firm, together with the Government of Malta. The amendments also provided for the establishment of the post of a Regulator and a Monitoring Committee (composed of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and Minister responsible for citizenship) of the MIIP. The amendment also made it an offence to advertise, publish or disseminate the programme without authorisation.http://www.parlament.mt/file.aspx?f=44746 The Government said that it would be accepting applications for a contribution of ‚Ç¨650,000 (‚Ç¨25,000 for spouses and dependants) to the National Development and Social Fund. Other investment criteria include an investment into government authorised stocks or bonds for a minimum of ‚Ç¨150,000 and a minimum term of five years. Applicants must also commit to either purchasing a residential property valued at more than ‚Ç¨350,000 or the leasing of a property, with a minimum annual rent of ‚Ç¨16,000 for a minimum period of five years. The scheme was roundly criticised, both in Malta and abroadhttp://www.euractiv.com/justice/maltese-eu-citizenship-sale-ange- news-532846 , as a sale of citizenship, made attractive due to Malta's being an EU member state. In view of the criticism, Government said it would remove one of the most controversial changes brought by the new law, of ending publication of names of new citizens by naturalisation. The provision will be re-enacted and no applications would be accepted before the change is made. Maltese citizenship by marriage The foreign spouse of a Maltese citizen may acquire Maltese citizenship by marriage after 5 years of marriage and living together. Residence in Malta is not required. * Widows and widowers of a Maltese citizen (where the spouse died within the first 5 years of marriage) may apply for Maltese citizenship by marriage 5 years after the date of the marriage to their deceased spouse. * Persons separated from a Maltese spouse may still apply for Maltese citizenship by marriage provided they lived together for 5 years after the celebration of the marriage. * Prior to 10 February 2000, the 5-year period of marriage did not apply, while before 1 August 1989 only the foreign wife of a Maltese man was eligible for citizenship by marriage Maltese citizenship by adoption Prior to 1 January 1977 a person adopted by Maltese citizens normally acquired Maltese citizenship automatically. The facility to acquire Maltese citizenship by adoption was removed on that date. From 1 August 1989, a child adopted by Maltese citizens acquires Maltese citizenship automatically provided the child is under the age of 10 at the date of the adoption. Loss of Maltese citizenship=1964 to 1989 At independence in 1964, Malta adopted strict rules to prevent dual citizenship in adulthood. * an adult citizen of Malta acquiring a foreign citizenship automatically lost Maltese citizenship * a Maltese citizen who had acquired another citizenship at birth or during childhood was obliged to renounce that other citizenship before age 19. Otherwise, Maltese citizenship was lost. Reforms of 1989 From 1 August 1989 Maltese law was amended to allow certain emigrants from Malta to retain Maltese citizenship. It was necessary to have been born in Malta and meet certain residential criteria in order to benefit from this provision. Those covered by this limited exception were deemed never to have lost Maltese citizenship. In other words, the change in the law was retrospective to 21 September 1964. The reform did not assist Maltese citizens by descent who had been born in other countries (such as Australia or Canada) who were still obliged to renounce their other citizenship by age 19 or face automatic loss of Maltese citizenship. For example, between 1964 and 2000 (when the law changed), approximately 2000 Australian born young persons (aged 18) renounced their Australian citizenship in order to retain Maltese citizenship. They were generally unable to recover their Australian citizenship later on, or migrate back to Australia. Reforms of 2000 From 10 February 2000, it was no longer possible to involuntarily lose Maltese citizenship based on possession or acquisition of a foreign citizenship. A former Maltese citizen by birth or descent who had resided outside Malta for 6 years was automatically conferred with Maltese citizenship retrospective to the date on which they lost it. In other words, they are deemed never to have lost Maltese citizenship. Other former Maltese citizens who do not meet the requirements for automatic re- acquisition of Maltese citizenship are entitled to obtain Maltese citizenship by registration. This includes former Maltese citizens who acquired that status by naturalisation or registration, and those who resided outside Malta for less than 6 years. Dual citizenship With effect from 10 February 2000, there are no restrictions under Maltese law on its citizens holding other citizenships. Dual citizens are entitled to hold a Maltese passport. Citizenship of the European Union Because Malta forms part of the European Union, Maltese citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Maltese embassy, Maltese citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.Article 20(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Rights abroad: Right to consular protection: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). Antigua and Barbuda (UK), Barbados (UK), Belize (UK), Central African Republic (France), Comoros (France), Gambia (UK), Guyana (UK), Liberia (Germany), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (UK), San Marino (Italy), S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (Portugal), Solomon Islands (UK), Timor-Leste (Portugal), Vanuatu (France) Maltese citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty. Commonwealth citizenship As a Commonwealth member, citizens of Malta are Commonwealth citizens and hence have certain rights in the United Kingdom: * access to the UK Ancestry Entry Clearance (no longer relevant since Malta joined the European Union) * access to the UK Working Holiday Visa scheme (no longer relevant to Maltese citizens) * entitlement to UK Right of abode for Maltese citizens born before 1983 with British born mothers. This offers effectively full citizenship rights in the UK (with a simpler route to naturalisation) compared to the standard arrangements for citizens of other EU/EEA member states in the UK. * full rights to vote and stand for public office in the United Kingdom. * the option of joining Her Majesty's Armed Forces. Travel freedom of Maltese citizens As of May 2018, Maltese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 182 countries and territories, ranking the Maltese passport 7th in the world (tied with the passports of the Czech Republic and New Zealand) according to the Visa Restrictions Index. Visa requirements for Maltese citizens Visa requirements for Maltese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Malta. In 2017, the Maltese nationality is ranked twenty-third in the Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

In 1980, the Church assigned Armstrong, then a member of the Church's elite Sea Org, to organize some personal papers of L. Ron Hubbard that were to serve as the basis of a new biography of Hubbard. A non-Scientologist, Omar Garrison, had been hired to write the book. As part of his assignment, Armstrong also requested Hubbard's war records from the Navy and his transcripts from George Washington University.  Lawsuit  Armstrong's transfer of the Hubbard- related documents to his attorney prompted a lawsuit, Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong. The decision in the case, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, found that Armstrong's fears of persecution by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in turning over the documents in his possession to his attorney was also reasonable: :\\"... the court is satisfied the invasion was slight, and the reasons and justification for the defendant's conduct manifest. Defendant was told by Scientology to get an attorney. He was declared an enemy by the Church. He believed, reasonably, that he was subject to \\"fair game.\\" The only way he could defend himself, his integrity, and his wife was to take that which was available to him and place it in a safe harbor, to wit, his lawyer's custody.\\" (Judge Paul Breckenridge, Los Angeles Superior Court, June 20, 1984) This 1984 judgment that Armstrong's transfer of documents of the Church of Scientology International (CSI) to his attorney was justified was affirmed seven years later in Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong. In December 1986, the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which CSI paid Armstrong $800,000 in exchange for his dismissal of claims against CSI. Armstrong agreed to not publish orally or in writing any information about his experience with CSI, and that he would be liable for $50,000 for each breach of confidentiality. On October 17, 1995, a California court concluded that Armstrong had breached the agreement and awarded CSI $321,932 in damages and $334,671.75 in court costs. The court also enjoined Armstrong from assisting others with lawsuits against CSI.Church of Scientology v. Superior Court,¬∂2 s:Church of Scientology International v. Superior Court Armstrong apparently continued to assist people with lawsuits against CSI and posting information about CSI on the Internet because on three occasions - June 1997; February 1998; and December 2000 - courts found Armstrong in contempt of its previous order and in violation of his settlement agreement. These violations resulted in $3,600 in fines and an order that he be confined in jail for 26 days. However, Armstrong claimed to be living in British Columbia, Canada, never showed up for court, and was never confined.Id., ¬∂¬∂3-4 s:Church of Scientology International v. Superior Court On April 2, 2002, CSI sued Armstrong for $10,050,000 for breaches of his settlement agreement. Armstrong admitted that he had breached the agreement more than 200 times, but claimed that parts of the agreement were illegal, unconstitutional and unenforceable. At trial on April 9, 2004, the court found that 131 breaches of the agreement did occur, but found that it would be unconscionable to \\"punish\\" Armstrong with liquidated damages in excess of the $800,000 he received as a benefit under the settlement agreement. Noting that Armstrong had previously been \\"sanctioned\\" in the sum of $300,000, the court entered judgment for CSI in the amount of $500,000.Id., ¬∂¬∂5-7 s:Church of Scientology International v.

Its originator L. Ron Hubbard claimed that his ideas of Dianetics originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account, he spent a great deal of time in the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's library, where he would have encountered the work of Freud and other psychoanalysts. In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication. Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. Originally published by Stephen A. Kent in December, 1999. Hubbard wrote Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.\\"L.R.H. Biography,\\" Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, 31 October 1977 The success of selling Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision. Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation. Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the American Communist Party. In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world's governments.Hubbard, \\"Ron's Journal 67,\\" taped message of 20 September 1969 By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed, and by November 1950, the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt.Dianetics and the Professions, A.E. van Vogt, 1953 Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members became strained, with several leaving, even to support causes critical of Dianetics. One example was Harvey Jackins, founder of Re- evaluation Counselling, originally a sort of discrete reworking of Dianetics, which L Ron Hubbard later declared suppressive to Scientology. In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, Elizabeth, NJ. January 1951 The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from Wichita, Kansas, offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Foundation's finances failed again in 1952. Because of a sale of assets resulting from the bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name \\"Dianetics\\", but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for Scientology to grow. Scientologists refer to the book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health as \\"Book One.\\" In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as \\"Scientology, a religious philosophy.\\" Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas. Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his reactive mind engrams, the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential. In 1978, Hubbard released New Era Dianetics (NED), a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 rundowns and requires a specifically trained auditor. It is run (processed) exactly like Standard Dianetics (once very widely practiced before the advent of NED) except the pre-clear (parishioner) is encouraged to find the \\"postulate\\" he made as a result of the incident.L. Ron Hubbard New Era Dianetics Series 7RA, HCOB 28 June 1978RA revised 15 September 1978, Hubbard Communications Office (HCO). (\\"Postulate\\" in Dianetics and Scientology has the meaning of \\"a conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past\\" in contrast to its conventional meanings.) Origins The ideas of Dianetics originated in unpublished research L. Ron Hubbard supposedly performed in the 1920s and 1930s. He recorded the results and his conclusions in an unpublished 1938 manuscript, Excalibur, the contents of which formed the basis for some of his later publications.Hubbard, \\"The Anatomy Of Thought\\". Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 26 April 1970R, revised 15 March 1975. After Hubbard's service in the United States Navy during World War II, he was admitted to the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. While there, he claimed to have carried out research into endocrinology \\"to determine whether or not structure monitors function or function monitors structure ... using nothing but Freudian Psychoanalysis and using a park bench as a consulting room\\", spending a great deal of time in the hospital's library, where he would have encountered the work of Sigmund Freud and other psychoanalysts. The emergence of Dianetics In January 1949, Hubbard informed his literary agent, Forrest J. Ackerman, that he was writing a book on the \\"cause and cure of nervous tension\\", which he was going to call either The Dark Sword or Excalibur or Science of the Mind, and assured Ackerman that the book had \\"more selling and publicity angles than any book of which I have ever heard.\\" In the same month, he told Writers' Markets and Methods magazine that he was working on a \\"book of psychology\\". In April 1949, Hubbard told the Gerontological Society at Baltimore City Hospital that he was preparing a paper with the somewhat unwieldy title of Certain Discoveries and Researches Leading to the Removal of Early Traumatic Experiences Including Attempted Abortion, Birth Shock and Infant Illnesses and Accidents with an Examination of their Effects Physiological and Psychological and their Potential Influence on Longevity on the Adult Individual with an Account of the Techniques Evolved and Employed.\\"Letters from the Birth of Dianetics - L. Ron Hubbard - The Dianetics Letters\\", Church of Scientology International. Hubbard's letter was \\"politely received\\", but the Society apparently declined involvement. He also wrote to the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association.\\"Ron the Philosopher: The Birth of Dianetics\\", Church of Scientology International These letters, and their responses, have not been published, though Hubbard later said that they had been negative. In 1949, Hubbard told his friend John W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding Science Fiction magazine and publisher of many of Hubbard's short stories, about his work. Campbell had been one of Hubbard's early test subjects and believed that Hubbard's techniques had cured his persistent sinusitis, so he was an enthusiastic supporter. In a letter to one of Astounding's contributors, Jack Williamson, he wrote: \\"I know dianetics is one of, if not the greatest, discovery of all Man's written and unwritten history. It produces the sort of stability and sanity men have dreamed about for centuries.\\"Jack Williamson, Wonder's Child: my life in science fiction. Bluejay Books, New York (1984) In July 1949, Campbell wrote to another contributor, Joseph A. Winter, a physician from Michigan. Winter was intrigued by Campbell's claims about Hubbard's work, but initially skeptical; Hubbard sent him what he called \\"an operator's manual for your use\\" which convinced Winter that Dianetics had some promise. Winter later wrote: :With cooperation from some institutions, some psychiatrists, he has worked on all types of cases. Institutionalized schizophrenics, apathies, manics, depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses - in all, nearly 1000 cases. But just a brief sampling of each type; he doesn't have proper statistics in the usual sense. But he has one statistic. He has cured every patient he worked with. He has cured ulcers, arthritis, asthma.Winter, Dianetics: A Doctor's Report, p. 5 In October 1949, Winter, Hubbard, and Campbell met at Hubbard's home in Bay Head, New Jersey to continue work. Winter attempted to interest some medical colleagues and psychiatrists in Dianetics, with little success, and suggested to Hubbard that he publish an article to stimulate interest in his work. Perhaps mindful of the rejection of his earlier efforts, Hubbard told Winter that \\"the articles you suggest would be more acceptable coming from another pen than mine.\\"Winter, Dianetics: A Doctor's Report, p. 8 Accordingly, in late 1949, Winter wrote a paper \\"giving a brief resum√© of the principles and methodology of dianetic therapy\\" which he submitted informally to an editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association. However, the editor told Winter that \\"the paper as written did not contain sufficient evidence of efficacy to be acceptable and was, moreover, better suited to one of the journals which dealt with psychotherapy.\\" He revised the paper, added case histories provided by Hubbard, and submitted it to the American Journal of Psychiatry, which rejected it on the same grounds.Winter, Dianetics: A Doctor's Report, p. 18 According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard issued his early research in the form of a manuscript entitled Dianetics: The Original Thesis in 1948; Hubbard gives the year as 1949.Hubbard, \\"Dianetics: its background\\". HCO Bulletin of May 22, 1969Hubbard, \\"Auditor attitude and the bank\\", lecture of October 10, 1969 It received a wider public release in 1951 and is now published as the book The Dynamics of Life. The original text is not available for comparison with the 1951 publication, but it may have comprised the \\"operator's manual\\" written by Hubbard for Winter, which is the first independently attested codification of Dianetics. Dianetics in print Hubbard conducting Dianetics seminar in Los Angeles in 1950 At the end of 1949, Hubbard and Campbell agreed to announce Dianetics in the upcoming May issue of Astounding, to be followed by a full-length book. Campbell arranged for Hermitage House, a small New York City medical and psychiatric textbook publisher, to publish the book. Hubbard also published an article in The Explorers Journal called \\"Terra Incognita: The Mind.\\"Hubbard, \\"Terra Incognita: The Mind\\" Dianetics was not quite finished at this stage; engrams were called comanomes, a neologism proposed by Winter that was later abandoned. In April 1950, Hubbard, Campbell, Winter and several others established a Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth, New Jersey to coordinate work related to the forthcoming publication. Hubbard wrote Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.\\"L.R.H. Biography\\", Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, October 31, 1977 This work was published on 9 May 1950 and quickly sold out its first run of 8,000 copies. Only two months after the book's publication, Newsweek reported that over 55,000 copies had been sold and enthusiasts had established 500 Dianetics clubs across the United States.\\"BOOKS Industry: Best Seller\\", Newsweek, No. 36, August 1950 In July, TIME reported that it was climbing the U.S. bestseller lists. Campbell reported in the August 1950 Astounding that the magazine was receiving up to a thousand letters a week about Dianetics. Sales reached 150,000 copies by the end of the year. Campbell's endorsement had proven invaluable; Astounding Science Fiction had over 150,000 readers, many of whom were familiar with Hubbard's science fiction and had a strong interest in new scientific discoveries. Among the wider population, Dianetics gained popularity as a cheaper, simpler and apparently more effective means of self-improvement than conventional psychotherapies. Hubbard's optimistic view that Dianetics could alleviate the Cold War climate of tension and fear also struck a chord. One of his supporters, Frederick L. Schuman, wrote in a letter to the New York Times that \\"History has become a race between Dianetics and catastrophe\\". The success of Dianetics brought in a flood of money. Hubbard offered teaching courses for Dianetic \\"auditors\\" through the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, costing $500 per person for four to six weeks of instruction and thirty-six hours of Dianetic therapy. Hubbard recruited his friend and fellow science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt to act as the Foundation's treasurer, and five other Foundations were soon established in Washington, DC, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles and Honolulu.\\"Dianetics: Science or Hoax?\\", Look, December 5, 1950 The Foundation's Los Angeles property alone was valued at $4.5 million. Opposition to Dianetics The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision. Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicist I.I. Rabi, reviewing Dianetics for Scientific American, declared that \\"this volume probably contains more promises and less evidence per page than has any publication since the invention of printing.\\" He noted that the publication of Dianetics had coincided with that of Worlds in Collision, a notorious work of pseudoscience by Immanuel Velikovsky, with which Dianetics shared the top of the best-seller lists. This, Rabi said, illustrated \\"the most frightening proof of the confusion of the contemporary mind and its tendency to fall prey to pseudo-scientific concepts.\\"Isaac Isidor Rabi, Review of Dianetics, Scientific American, January 1951 The Nation pointed out the lack of documentation in Dianetics: \\"No case histories are offered to substantiate his claims, nor is there documentation of any kind to indicate that any previous thinker, medical or otherwise, ever made a significant contribution to the subject of human behavior.\\" The Individual Psychology Bulletin also criticized Hubbard for \\"not offer any other evidence than a vague reference to hundreds of cured patients, without furnishing case histories or other specific data. The book is crammed with bragging and swaggering, pseudoscientific bombast, platitudes and vulgarities, and a great deal of sheer nonsense.\\"Leonhard Deutsch, Individual Psychology Bulletin, 9:1 (1951) p.38-9 British health minister Kenneth Robinson, among others, expressed concern at the possible dangers of unskilled amateurs practicing therapy on patients, and skepticism about Hubbard's claims that Dianetics could be effective in dealing with illnesses. In September 1950, the American Psychological Association issued a resolution calling on psychologists not to use Hubbard's methods for treatment purposes unless and until they had been shown effective through scientific testing.\\"M. Scientific Affairs - IV. DIANETICS\\", APA Council Policy Manual, 1950 Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation. Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. He claimed that \\"just about the time hit the stands\\" (i.e. April‚ÄìMay 1950), a \\"very high-ranking officer\\" of the US Navy had approached him to sound him out about \\"using what you know about the mind to make people more suggestible.\\" Hubbard apparently avoided this by resigning from the Navy.Hubbard, \\"The National Academy of American Psychology\\", lecture of 31 December 1957 He also told the FBI in a 1952 interview that \\"the Soviets apparently realized the value of Dianetics because as early as 1938 an official of Amtorg , while at The Explorers Club in New York, contacted him to suggest that he go to Russia and develop Dianetics there.\\" The FBI agent conducting the interview was not convinced, describing Hubbard as \\"a mental case\\". Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the American Communist Party, working through the Authors League of America. According to Hubbard, :These people in the early days of Dianetics said, \\"We can use Dianetics.\\" They were all my friends. Everywhere I looked, every writer I knew who had ever been a member of the Communist Party was right there alongside of me pumping my hand, saying, \\"Good going, Ron. We knew you had it in you.\\" ... And when they finally got it through their thick skulls in October 1950 that I didn't care to have Dianetics and Scientology covertly used by any other organization on Earth for their own special purposes, Dianetics and Scientology in the public presses had it.Hubbard, \\"Final Lecture\\", lecture of November 8, 1959 In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world's governments.Hubbard, \\"Ron's Journal 67\\", taped message of September 20, 1967 Current church head David Miscavige has also propagated this theory: :At stake were all of vested interest dollars. How could they get research grants? Millions, or even billions - if the problems of the mind were already solved? And how could they hide the fact of LRH's discoveries if the whole country was talking about them? Their initial attacks have been mentioned over the years by us. First they got \\"technical reviews\\" by psychiatrists hatcheting Dianetics. They published these critical reviews in their psychiatric trade magazines ... Then they took these published reviews and handed them out to the press where they were promptly requoted as authority in magazines like \\"Slime\\" and \\"Tripe\\" .David Miscavige, speech to the International Association of Scientologists, October 8, 1993 Fragmentation and transformation By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed. Book sales, lectures and auditor training still generated revenue, but financial controls were lax; Hubbard described the situation as \\"something on the accounting system of dumping it all in a barrel outside the door and hauling the barrel down to a bank every once in a while...\\"Hubbard, \\"Review of progress of Dianetics and dianetic business\\", lecture of 25 February 1952 Hubbard's treasurer, A. E. van Vogt, said that Hubbard personally withdrew large sums from Foundation accounts, apparently without any prior notice or explanation of his purpose;A.E. van Vogt interview with Russell Miller, quoted in Miller, Bare Faced Messiah p. 166 van Vogt calculated that, by November 1950 the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt. Matters were not improved by Hubbard's experiments with a cocktail of benzedrine, vitamins and glutamic acid, called GUK after the rifle cleaning fluid used by the US Marine Corps, which he believed would provide a chemical alternative to auditing.Forrest Ackerman interview with Russell Miller, quoted in Miller, Bare Faced Messiah p. 173 The Foundation purchased a 110-room building in Los Angeles for the project, but Winter writes that it proved a \\"dismal, expensive failure.\\"Winter, Dianetics: A Doctor's Report p. 190 Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members became strained. Hubbard's interest in past lives was a particular cause of tension, as he noted in his 1951 book Science of Survival: :The subject of past deaths and past lives is so full of tension that as early as last July (1950-Ed) the board of trustees of the Foundation sought to pass a resolution banning the entire subject. And I have been many times requested to omit any reference to these in the present work or in public for fear that a general impression would get out that Dianetics had something to do with spiritualism.Hubbard, Science of Survival, footnote p. 61. Hubbard College of Scientology, East Grinstead (1967 ed.) Winter recorded his dissatisfaction with the state of affairs, believing that \\"Foundation dianetics was becoming crystallized, ritualistic and sterile\\", characterized by a \\"none-too-subtle antagonism towards the medical profession in general and the psychiatric field in particular.\\" He commented that \\"any attempts to force the medical profession to accept it solely on the basis of the affirmation, \\"It works!\\" and deriding those who request more conclusive proof, is more than likely to jeopardize whatever possible benefits there might be.\\" Having failed to steer the Foundation onto \\"a more reasoned and conservative basis\\", he resigned in October 1950.Winter, Dianetics: A Doctor's Report pp. 190-191 Art Ceppos, the publisher of Dianetics, also resigned at this time, cutting off the Foundation's supply of books; he went on to publish Winter's critical book on Dianetics. John W. Campbell became dissatisfied as well, accusing Hubbard of \\"dogmatism and authoritarianism\\" after the latter insisted that only the Hubbard-approved \\"Standard Procedure\\" of Dianetics be used and condemned all other methods as dangerous \\"Black Dianetics\\".Campbell, letter in The Arc Light, 25 (May 1952), pp. 6-8. This was a departure from Hubbard's previously liberal outlook, when he had rejected any attempt to monopolise Dianetics. Campbell resigned from the board in March 1951; although he remained interested in Dianetics for several years afterwards, he eventually moved on to other causes. The most serious breach occurred with Hubbard's wife Sara, the Foundation's librarian and formerly his personal auditor and research subject. According to Barbara Klowdan, his public relations assistant, both had had affairs‚ÄîSara with Miles Hollister, a Dianetics instructor in Los Angeles, and Hubbard with Klowdan herself. Sara was suspended from the Foundation's board of directors and her official post. She filed divorce papers in March 1951, and her claims of \\"systematic torture\\" allegedly suffered at Hubbard's hands attracted widespread media attention.\\"Dianetics Inventor Sued for Divorce, Wife's Complaint Charges He Subjected Her To 'Scientific Torture Experiments'\\", Los Angeles Times, April 24, 1951 A few weeks later, Hubbard told the FBI that Sara had tried to kill him: \\"I was knocked out, had a needle thrust into my heart to give it a jet of air to produce \\"coronary thrombosis\\" and was given an electric shock with a 110 volt current.\\"Hubbard, letter to FBI of May 14 1951 Hubbard later characterized the suit as \\"a gal I wasn't even married to was suing me for divorce.\\"Hubbard, \\"SOP 5 long form step III - spacation\\", lecture of January 19, 1953 Hubbard appears to have believed that his organization was under sustained attack from Communist interests. From March 2, 1951, all employees of the Dianetic Foundations were \\"requested to sign a strong oath of loyalty to the U.S. government, a denial of Communism and that their fingerprints be taken and forwarded to the F.B.I.\\" Those who had left the organization, he claimed, were Communist agents; he called Winter a \\"psycho-neurotic discharged officer of the US Army Medical Corps... Winter seemed to have Communist connections.\\" In one letter to the FBI, he claimed that Ceppos was \\"connected with Communists\\"Memo from F. J. Baumgardner to M.H. Holm March 7, 1951 and had tried to obtain the Foundation's mailing list of sixteen thousand names for purposes of distributing Communist literature:Letter to Director FBI from SAC Newark, March 21, 1951 in another, he denounced Sara Hubbard and Miles Hollister as \\"Communist Party members or suspects\\", describing Hollister as having a \\"broad forehead, rather Slavic.\\"Hubbard, letter to FBI of March 3 1951 He complained that \\"the Communist Party or members of the Communist Party have in the past year wiped out a half a million operation for me, have cost me my health and have considerably retarded material of interest to the United States Government.\\" In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, Elizabeth, New Jersey. January 1951 The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Dianetics in Kansas A temporary respite from financial difficulties was provided in April 1951 by Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from Wichita, Kansas. Purcell bankrolled a new Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Wichita and paid to print a new edition of Dianetics, along with several new Dianetics books -- Self Analysis, Science of Survival, Notes on the Lectures, Advanced Procedure and Axioms and Child Dianetics‚Äîand a range of other Dianetics pamphlets and publications. The new Foundation soon found itself pursued by creditors, however, as the other Foundations collapsed under the weight of unpaid debts. The income of the Wichita Foundation was far more modest than the earlier Foundations had enjoyed, as public interest in Dianetics had waned. Only 112 people attended the first major conference held at Wichita, and only 51 students attended a subsequent lecture series in October 1951.O'Brien, Helen. Dianetics in Limbo. Whitmore, Philadelphia (1966) Science writer Martin Gardner observed that \\"the dianetics craze seems to have burned itself out as quickly as it caught fire\\".Gardner, Martin. Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. 1952 In 1952, creditors forced the Wichita Foundation into bankruptcy. Hubbard sold his holdings to Purcell for a nominal sum and established a \\"Hubbard College\\" on the other side of Wichita, leaving Purcell to sort out the bankruptcy proceedings. The remaining assets of the Foundation, comprising the copyright of all the tapes, books, techniques, processes and paraphernalia of Dianetics, including the name, went to the auction block; Purcell bought them outright, but Hubbard's financial straits were not improved. One of his staff, James Elliot, sent out an appeal on his behalf: \\"Somehow Mr. Hubbard must get funds to keep Dianetics from being closed down everywhere. ... He is penniless\\", and wrote of Hubbard's wish to establish a \\"free school in Phoenix for the rehabilitation of auditors.\\"Elliot, James. Circular letter of April 21, 1952 This school was launched around April 1952 as the Hubbard Association of Scientologists; he could not use the name \\"Dianetics\\", as he no longer owned it. In May 1952, Purcell's Foundation sent its members a set of accounts showing that it had earned $141,821 but was overspent by $63,222.Purcell circular letter of May 21, 1952 Hubbard responded angrily, alleging that the American Medical Association had paid Purcell $500,000 to wreck Dianetics.Hubbard, \\"Anatomy of the Theta Body\\", lecture of March 1952 He later claimed that the Communist Party had paid Purcell \\"to do in a Central Organization\\".Hubbard, \\"E-meter\\", lecture of May 19, 1961 On December 16, 1952, Hubbard was arrested in the middle of a lecture for failing to return $9,000 withdrawn from the Wichita Foundation. He eventually settled the debt by paying $1,000 and returning a car that he had borrowed from Purcell. Purcell finally tired of pursuing Hubbard over the bankruptcy and handed back the Dianetics copyrights in 1954.\\"Dianetics and Scientology Organizations United Again\\", The Journal of Scientology, issue 36-G, 1954 From Dianetics to Scientology Dianetics provided the seed from which the philosophical framework of Scientology grew. Scientologists refer to the book Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health as \\"Book One\\". Hubbard created his own calendar based on the publication date of Dianetics; a date of \\"A.D. 13\\" signifies \\"Year 13 After Dianetics\\", or 1963. In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as \\"Scientology, a religious philosophy\\". Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas, augmenting the Dianetic axioms with new, additional, Scientology axioms. Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his reactive mind engrams, the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential. In 1975, \\"Dianetics Today\\" was published, an all-inclusive volume of over 1000 pages. The book introduced the use of the E-Meter, the Original Assessment or standardized interview and a rote routine (Referred to as \\"R3R\\") for the application of Dianetics. This was known as Standard Dianetics. In 1978, Hubbard released \\"New Era Dianetics\\", a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time; \\"Preclears who might have needed over 2,000 hours of auditing to achieve the highest results obtainable from 1950 technology might now achieve comparable gains in a tenth of that time with modern Dianetics and Scientology auditing.\\"\\"About New Era Dianetics Auditing\\" The Church of Scientology practices and disseminates both the original Dianetics and New Era Dianetics, and views Dianetics as an introduction to Scientology. As of 2001, the Church of Scientology continued to run television advertisements promoting Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. In spite of this, an analysis of the approximate annual sales of Dianetics that was based on the Church's published data indicated that 2002 sales of Dianetics were similar to sales levels of the book in the early 1970s, and sales of the book reached its peak in the late 1980s.\\"Dianetic Sales Drop to 1971 Levels\\" Perhaps indicative of the reason for that peak, Time Magazine, in 1991, alleged that the Church asked its members to purchase large quantities of the book with their own money, or with money supplied by the Church, for the sole purpose of keeping the book on the New York Times Best Seller list.Behar, Richard. \\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\\", Time, May 6, 1991  See also  *A Doctor's Report on Dianetics *Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health *Timeline of Scientology  References External links * Ronthephilosopher.org: A Note on Excalibur * The History of Dianetics and Scientology in Washington, DC D ","title":"History of Dianetics"},{"id":"4439687","text":"Stanton Fisher is a financial claims firm in United Kingdom.

Glidewell LJ said: In Southard v DPP [2006] EWHC 3449 (Admin), [2006] All ER (D) 101, Fulford J. said \\"I see no basis for the original written argument that this criminal provision is not available when police officers alone are the likely audience or target.\\", although the court acknowledged the tide is slowly turning on such incidents: \\"Finally, although the court considered that the facts of this case came near to the borderline as to whether the ingredients of the offence were made out, it is clear that they concluded\\" Holloway v DPP (Admn 21 Oct 2004) Ref: [2004] EWHC 2621 (Admin)) also states that a charge relying on the fact that someone \\"might have, or could have seen\\" the conduct is insufficient, compared to whether or not anyone actually did. DPP v Harvey (17 Nov 2011) [2011] EWHC 3992 (Admin), [2011] EWHC B1 (Admin) upheld an appeal quashing a conviction for a section 5 conviction. The appellant had been searched by two Police Officers and swore at them. Neither officer said they were harassed, alarmed or distressed by the words and could not show how any member of the public was affected. Appeal held.  Limits: Freedom of speech  Clause (c) allows for a defence on the grounds of reasonable behaviour. This interpretation will depend upon case law. In Dehal v Crown Prosecution Service, Mr Justice Moses ruled that in cases involving freedom of expression prosecution unlawful unless it is necessary to prevent public disorder: \\"a criminal prosecution was unlawful as a result of section 3 of the Human Rights Act and Article 10 unless and until it could be established that such a prosecution was necessary in order to prevent public disorder\\". This case involved an individual placing a sign critical of religious leaders. Case law may go further and revolve around the prevention of violence. In considering another section 5 case, Lord Justice Auld, quoted Redmond-Bate v DPP (id est, a case involving breach of the peace), \\"Free speech includes not only the inoffensive, but the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome and the provocative provided it does not tend to provoke violence\\". However, in Abdul v DPP, Lord Justice Gross, ruled that to some degree such rules were a matter of fact to be handled by lower courts and not a matter for appeal, stating \\"If the lower courts themselves approached the matter having duly considered all the relevant principles, the appellate courts will ‚Äì also on established principles, applicable to appellate courts ‚Äì be disinclined to interfere.\\" noting that in Dehal v CPS the lower court had not considered Article 10 in any way. In a similar case, a defendant who displayed a poster saying \\"Islam out of Britain\\" found guilty and denied appeal. Mode of trial and sentence The offence created by section 5 is a summary offence. It is punishable with a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scaleThe Public Order Act 1986, section 5(6) (¬£1,000 as of 2015). Arrest Sections 5(4) and (5) of the 1986 Act formerly provided a statutory power of arrest (which required a warning to be given beforehand). They were repealed by section 174 of, and Part 2 of Schedule 17 to, the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Arrest for this offence is now governed by section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (as substituted by the 2005 Act). Statistics There were four to five thousand prosecutions for harassment, alarm or distress brought each year in England and Wales during the 2001-2003 period, with approximately three thousand cases resulting in conviction. Intentional, harassment alarm or distress Section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986 creates the distinct, aggravated offence of intentional harassment, alarm or distress. Racially or religiously aggravated offence Section 31(1)(c) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (c.37) creates the distinct offence of racially or religiously aggravated harassment, alarm or distress.

It consists of the three books: Omnivore (1968), Orn (1970), and ''''' (1975). Omnivore has as its frame the investigation of the deaths of eighteen travelers from Earth to the distant planet Nacre. Nacre is seen through the eyes of three surviving scientist-explorers: Cal, Veg, and Aquilon. The planet Nacre's dominant species are fungi, including the intelligent mantas. The mantas are soft-bodied creatures capable of high speeds and flight, superficially resembling manta rays. They are carnivores who farm the one extant herbivore species by protecting them from the voracious omnivore species. The planet is notable for its thick atmosphere, which allows flight to be performed with less energy, and permits the existence of air-borne phytoplankton. The herbivores eat the plankton, and the omnivores eat anything they can. The human characters' diets play an important role in their interaction with the native species. Aquilon eats a normal human diet‚Äîshe is an omnivore. Veg is a vegetarian. Cal is forced to drink blood to survive, due to a medical condition. Orn involves travel by the scientists and mantas into a parallel dimension they dub Paleo, resembling the distant past of Earth, where they encounter dinosaur species and an intelligent flightless bird called Orn. Orn has the ability of genetic memory, able to remember anything that happened to an ancestor prior to the time of their reproduction. Much of the plot conflict stems from the love triangle between the protagonists and the mysterious motives of a cybernetically-augmented government agent sent along to monitor their progress. ' involves the three scientists attempting to return to Earth from another dimension inhabited by hostile machines. Interlopers from other realities (using technology similar to that of the scientists' government) guide and hamper the explorers. A secondary story tells of a multidimensional cellular automaton energy being named and its attempts to share living space with an infant human male, a fledgling creature of Orn's species, and one of the manta-carnivores; their developing relationship leads to attempts to learn the reasons for their strange isolation from others of their kind, which eventually ties into the story of Cal, Veg, and Aquilon.

The traditional method of making kaymak is to boil the milk slowly, then simmer it for two hours over a very low heat. After the heat source is shut off, the cream is skimmed and left to chill (and mildly ferment) for several hours or days. Kaymak has a high percentage of milk fat, typically about 60%. It has a thick, creamy consistency (not entirely compact, because of milk protein fibers) and a rich taste. Etymology The word kaymak has Central Asian Turkic origins, possibly formed from the verb kaymak, which means melt and molding of metal in Turkic. The first written records of the word kaymak is in the well-known book of Mahmud al-Kashgari, Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk. The word remains as kaylgmak in Mongolian, and with small variations in Turkic languages as qaymaq in Azerbaijani, qaymoq in Uzbek, “õ–∞–π–º–∞“õ in Kazakh and Shor, –∫–∞–π–º–∞–∫ in Kyrgyz, kaymak in Turkish, ga√Ωmak in Turkmen, ·Éô·Éê·Éò·Éõ·Éê·É¶·Éò (kaimaghi) in Georgian, and Œ∫Œ±œäŒºŒ¨Œ∫Œπ (ka√Øm√°ki) in Greek. Turkey Bread Pudding topped with kaymak Shops in Turkey have been devoted to kaymak production and consumption for centuries. Kaymak is mainly consumed today for breakfast along with the traditional Turkish breakfast. One type of kaymak is found in the Afyonkarahisar region where the water buffalo are fed from the residue of poppy seeds pressed for oil. Kaymak is traditionally eaten with baklava and other Turkish desserts, fruit preserve and honey or as a filling in pancakes. Balkans Palenta, cornmeal mush with kajmak and ƒçvarci Traditional wooden bowls for making and storing kaymak (Ethnographic Museum, Belgrade) Known as kajmak, it is almost always made at home, though there is beginning to be commercial production. Kajmak is most expensive when freshest --only a day or two old. It can keep for weeks in the fridge but becomes harder and loses quality. Kajmak can also be matured in dried animal skin sacks; one variation is called skorup. Kajmak also describes the creamy foam in the Turkish coffee. It is usually enjoyed as an appetizer or for Saturday morning breakfast, as Saturdays are market days with the best kajmak, but also as a condiment. The simplest recipe is lepinja sa kajmakom pita bread filled with kaymak in Serbia) consumed for breakfast or as fast food. Bosnians, Montenegrins, Serbs, and Macedonians consider it a national meal. Other traditional dishes with kajmak (sold in restaurants) include pljeskavica sa kajmakom (the Balkan version of a hamburger patty topped with melted kajmak), as well as ribiƒá u kajmaku (beef shank, simmered with kajmak). Iraq In Iraq, it is called qeymer or qeimer and is very popular. Iraqi qeymer is usually made from the rich fatty milk of cows or buffaloes, which are prevalent in the marshes of southern Iraq. It is available both factory- produced and from local vendors or farmers as qeymer Arab. Iraqis like to serve qeymer for breakfast with fresh bread, honey or jam. However, the most popular way is to spread it on a type of Iraqi pastry bread called \\"Kahi\\", smother it with date honey and then wash it down with hot tea. Qeymer on kahi with date syrup or honey is a long-standing traditional breakfast in Baghdad and throughout southern and northern Iraq. Iran In Iran, sarsheer (ÿ≥ÿ±ÿ¥€åÿ±) is used to describe a different method which does not involve heating the milk, thus keeping enzymes and other cultures of the milk alive. The word kaymak (qaymaq) is also used for the boiled method. Qaymaq is a Turkish word used to describe this product among the Azari people of Iran. Afghanistan In Afghanistan, Qaimak or qaymaq has a thinner quality and is eaten for breakfast meals usually with bread. People typically top qaimak with honey, sugar, or mix it with jam. It can be spread on pastries or even added to milk tea. Qaimak can be purchased at grocery stores in Afghanistan or made at home. It is quite a long process to make at home, involving hours stirring the milk pot. Qaimak can be found at Afghan/Iranian grocery stores in the west, but is not as rich as homemade. While a lot qaimak variations are made from buffaloes' milk, Afghan qaimak can be made from cows' milk. Georgia A bucket containing kaimaghi in a home in Keda, Georgia In the Adjara region of Georgia, bordering Turkey, ·Éô·Éê·Éò·Éõ·Éê·É¶·Éò or kaimaghi is made from cow's milk in homes in the mountainous municipalities of Keda, Shuakhevi, and Khulo. It is typically eaten with Georgian cheese and/or bread, and is only rarely served in restaurants.

He showed that a sufficient condition for a dynamical system to relax to equilibrium is for it to be mixing.  Biography  Krylov was born in Ustyuzhna, Vologda Governorate, of the Russian Empire. He graduated in physics from the Leningrad University. He then was a doctoral student in the Leningrad University's theoretical physics group supervised by Vladimir Fock, and wrote thesis on the foundations of statistical mechanics entitled Mixing processes in phase space awarded by for the degree of Candidate of Science in 1941.

The name British Blockade was given to distinguish it from French Blockade which, however, is not a blockade game. The name Parallels is simply derived from the fact that the cards are lined up in rows parallel to each other.  Rules  First, one King and one Ace of each suit is removed and the Aces and Kings are each lined into columns to form the foundations. The Aces are built up while the Kings are built down all by suit. Between the two foundation columns, the player deals a row of ten cards, forming the tableau. All of these cards are available for play on the foundations and the spaces they leave behind are immediately filled from the stock. When play comes to a stand still, a second row of ten cards is dealt below the first row. All cards are still available for play and the spaces left behind are immediately filled from the stock. When play comes to a stand still a second time, a third row of ten cards is dealt. At this point onwards, the following rules apply: *A card is available to be built to the foundations if at least one of its narrower edges is free. Therefore, the cards at the top and bottom rows are available for play and cards in the middle rows become available after a card immediately above or below it is played. *There is no compulsion in filling spaces in the tableau. As long as there are moves available for the player to make, spaces can be filled later. *All spaces in the tableau must be filled when play goes on a standstill. The order is from left to right, top to bottom. There is no building at this point. *When the existing spaces in the tableau are filled, another row of ten cards is dealt at the bottom of the existing rows. *Peeking on the next card in the stock is not allowed; doing so will force that card to be dealt to the tableau. Reversals are allowed, i.e. when the two foundations of the same suit meet at one point, the player can move the cards from one foundation to the other except the base cards (ace and king) of the foundations. The game ends when play stops after the stock has run out. The game is won when all cards are built into the foundations.

Greater Bulgaria is a term to identify the territory associated with a historical national state and a modern Bulgarian irredentist nationalist movement which would include most of Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia.  History  The larger proposed Bulgarian state was suggested under the Treaty of San Stefano. The issue of irredentism and nationalism gained greater prominence after the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano. It established the Principality of Bulgaria, with territory including the plain between the Danube and the Balkan mountain range (Stara Planina), the region of Sofia, Pirot and Vranje in the Morava valley, Northern Thrace, parts of Eastern Thrace and nearly all of Macedonia. This treaty laid grounds for much of the later claims for a Greater Bulgaria. However, the Treaty of San Stefano was a preliminary one and the borders of the newly created Bulgaria were established in the Treaty of Berlin. It saw the previous territory divided in three ‚Äì the Principality of Bulgaria, the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia, and Macedonia, which remained under Ottoman control. In the early 20th century control over Macedonia was a key point of contention between Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Greece, and Serbia who fought both the First Balkan War of 1912‚Äì1913 and the Second Balkan War of 1913. The area was further fought over during the Macedonian Campaign of World War I (1915‚Äì1918). Just before entering World War II, Bulgaria had peacefully secured the return of Southern Dobruja from Romania in the Treaty of Craiova. During World War II some of the territories in question were briefly added to Bulgaria by Nazi Germany, as a reward to Bulgaria, which had fought with Germany as one of the Axis powers. It was granted territory in Greece, namely Eastern Macedonia and parts of Western Thrace, as well as Yugoslav Macedonia (Vardar Macedonia).Bulgaria During the Second World War, Marshall Lee Miller, Stanford University Press, 1975, , p. 128.

On 16 July 1997, the Constitutional Court of Korea ruled the article unconstitutional.Same-Surname- Same-Origin Marriage Ban case (95Hun-Ka6 on Article 809 (1) of the Civil Act); ^ . The National Assembly of South Korea passed an amendment to the Article in March 2002, which came into force on 31 March 2005, and prohibited marriage only between men and women who are closely related.  Rules restricting marriage In Korea, a child inherits his or her father‚Äôs surname.Article 781 Korean Civil Code [Entry into Family Register of Surname and Origin of Surname of Child] (1) A child shall assume its father‚Äôs surname and the origin of surname and shall have its name entered in its father‚Äôs family register. Traditionally, men and women who have the same surnames and \\"ancestral homes\\", called dongseong dongbon (Hangul: ÎèôÏÑ±ÎèôÎ≥∏, Hanja: ÂêåÂßìÂêåÊú¨), are not permitted to marry. The rule, called honinbeop (Hangul: ÌòºÏù∏Î≤ï, Hanja: Â©öÂßªÊ≥ï), originated in China,See article 182, \\"Marriage by Those of the Same Surname\\" in Wallace Johnson (trans.) The T'ang code (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1979) at 49-82. and can be traced back at least to the late Joseon Dynasty in Korea. In the context of Confucianism, the rule was a mechanism to maintain family identities and ensure the integrity of the family as a sociopolitical institution.\\"Family versus the individual: the politics of marriage laws in Korea\\" in Daniel A. Bell and Hahm Chaibong (ed.) Confucianism for the modern world (Cambridge University Press, 2003) at 336. The marriage rule was codified as Article 809 in 1957. It read as follows: > Article 809 [Prohibition of marriage between parties whose surname and > ancestral home are common] (1): A marriage may not be allowed between blood > relatives, if both surname and its origin are common to the parties. Distribution of ancestral lines of the surname Kim. Those surnamed Kim (Hangul: ÍπÄ, Hanja: Èáë), for example, can be divided between 282 different blood ancestors, each of whom are identified with a different ancestral home.National Bureau of Statistics, Economic Planning Board, Report on the Korean surname and Its Origin (1988) Vol. 1 at 12-228. The two most populous branches of the Kim clans are Gimhae (with 4 million members) and Gyeongju (1.5 million members).Note 5 at 12-228. As these two Kim clans descend from different patrilineages, a Gimhae Kim and a Gyeongju Kim can marry. Before the 1997 Constitutional Court decision, however, two members of the 4 million Gimhae Kim could not marry, regardless of the distance of their relationship. Because of population growth, greater mobility and increasing urbanisation in South Korea, the chance of meeting and falling in love with someone from one's own patrilineage was much greater. It was especially a problem for the three largest Korean clans, the Gimhae Kims, the Milyang Parks, and the Jeonju Lees. Despite Article 809, many men and women sharing the same patrilineage chose to live together as husband and wife. The common surname marriage ban was temporarily lifted by special acts three times, each for a period of one year, in 1977,Act No. 3052, 31 December 1977. 1987,Act No. 3971, 28 November 1987. and 1995.Act No. 5013, 6 December 1995. At the time of the first special act in 1977, 4577 same name/common ancestor couples became legally married. In 1988 the number increased to 12,443, and by 1996, it had reached 27,807.Mi- Kyung Cho, \\"Violation of the Constitution in Korean Family Law\\" (2002) International Survey of Family Law 243 at 245. Some estimate that the actual number is as high as 200,000 couples, nearly 2 percent of all married couples in South Korea. The children born of such marriages were, legally, out-of- wedlock. They were not eligible for national health insurance and were discriminated against in matters of inheritance and property rights. The Korean Legal Aid Center for Family Relations established a special report and counselling facility for couples subject to Article 809. Article 809 has been much criticised by family lawyers and the Korean Law Association on the ground that it infringes on the freedom of choice in marriage, and that it reinforces traditional paternalism.See Mi-Kyung Cho, \\"The Family Law Reform and the Improvement of the Status of Women\\" 33 University of Louisville Journal of Family Law (Annual Survey of Family Law) 437.  Constitutional case  On 20 May 1995 the Family Court of Seoul referred to the Constitutional Court the case brought forth by eight couples who asked the court to evaluate the constitutionality of Article 809. They argued that the code violated the \\"right to the pursuit of happiness\\" and the \\"right to family life\\" guaranteed by articles 10 and 36, respectively, in the \\"Chapter 2. Right and Duties of Citizens\\" of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Two years later, the Constitutional Court ruled 7 to 2 against Article 809. The court held that Article 809(1) was incompatible with the Constitution and that if the National Assembly did not amend it by 31 December 1998, it would become null and void, commencing on 1 January 1999. The court declared that until the National Assembly amended the article, other courts and government agencies, including local governments, should not apply it. In accordance with this declaration, the Supreme Court of Korea announced new family registration procedures for the applications filed by couples sharing surname and ancestral home before the revision. In addition, parts of the Rules of the Supreme Court on Family Register that prohibited the registration of marriage between these couples (Rule No. 172) and that concerned mistaken registration (Rule No. 176) were abolished. The majority opinion stated that: > the law against marriages between members of the same agnatic lineage > descendants violates the dignity of human beings and the right to the > pursuit of happiness as guaranteed by the Constitution as well as the right > to free marriages and equality. The majority emphasized the individual's freedom of marriage and asserted that: > majority of the public's concept of marriage has changed from one of \\"a > union between families\\" to one of \\"a union between persons\\", reflecting the > respect for a person's free will.\\" Two justices dissented. The first dissenting opinion emphasized that marriage should be publicly recognised through social norms such as customs, morals, and religion, and dismissed individual freedom as relatively unimportant. It stressed the succession of traditional culture prescribed in Article 9 of the Constitution.  Legislative response  The Ministry of Justice presented a Reform Bill to the National Assembly on 13 November 1998, including the repeal of Article 809.Ministry of Justice, Reform Bill of the Korean Civil Code, proposed on 13 November 1998. In the face of fierce opposition from Confucian groups, Article 809 was excluded from the bill by the Sub-committee on Law of the National Assembly, despite the 31 December 1998 deadline imposed by the Constitutional Court.Legislation and Judiciary Committee records No. 208/16, 17 December 1999, 15. On 17 December 1999, the Sub-committee stated that: > In view of the national sentiment which places a great deal of importance on > bloodline the abolition of the law prohibiting marriages between people with > the same surnames and same ancestral seats is premature.Chosun Ilbo, 19 > December 1999. As the term of the 15th National Assembly ended in May 2000, the Reform Bill automatically died. Following the April 2004 elections, the Ministry of Justice reintroduced its Reform Bill. On 2 March 2005, the National Assembly passed the Korean Family Law Reform Bill, which came into effect on 31 March of the same year.Act No.7427, March 31, 2005. Among the amendments to Korean family law included a reformed version of Article 809: > Marriage may not be allowed between parties whose relationship of blood > relative exists within the eighth degree (including the blood relatives for > the real-adopted child kept before real-adoption). Marriage may not be > allowed between parties if either of them is or was the spouse of blood > relative within the sixth degree of relationship, or if either of them is or > was the blood relatives within sixth degree of relationship of the spouse, > or if either of them is or was the spouse of blood relatives by affinity > within fourth degree of relationship of the spouse. Marriage may not be > allowed between parties whose relationship of blood relative existed within > the sixth degree of adoptive parents lineage and within the fourth degree of > adoptive parents affinity. In the context of the above law, the term degree, called chon (Hangul: Ï¥å, Hanja: ÂØ∏) in Korean, refers to the distance of kinship between two persons. Siblings are considered to be separated by two chons, while children and parents are separated by one chon. Accordingly, a relationship between first cousins would be separated by four chons, and second cousins by six.

Slim then recorded for Excello Records for twelve years, starting in the mid-1950s, often collaborating with his brother- in-law Slim Harpo and with the harmonica player Lazy Lester. Slim stopped performing the blues for a time and eventually worked in a foundry in Pontiac, Michigan, as a result of which his hands were constantly exposed to high temperatures. He was rediscovered by Fred Reif in 1970, in Pontiac, where he was living in a rented room at Slim Harpo's sister's house. Reif soon got him back performing again and a new recording contract with Excello, this time through Bud Howell, then the president of the company. His first engagement was a reunion concert in 1971 at the University of Chicago Folk Festival with Lazy Lester, whom Reif had brought from Baton Rouge in January of that year. In the 1970s, Slim performed on tours in Europe, in the United Kingdom and at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, for which he was often accompanied by Moses \\"Whispering\\" Smith on harmonica. He last toured the UK in 1973, with the American Blues Legends package organised by Big Bear Records. In July 1974, Slim died of stomach cancer in Detroit, Michigan, aged 61.

The character is usually depicted as a member of the student body of the Xavier Institute in X-Men- related comic books. She first appeared in Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #7 and was created by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday. Fictional character biography Blindfold is a student at the Xavier Institute and ever since she was a child, Ruth had worn a blindfold to cover up her obvious mutation and it was this that inspired her new codename \\"Blindfold.\\" She was first mentioned by Hisako Ichiki and Wing before their confrontation with Ord. Hisako and Wing both said she had a big mouth because she had read Wing's mind and informed Hisako of his dreams of one day becoming an X-Man. Wing was upset, but Hisako told him not to worry, as she wanted to be an X-Man too, and that Blindfold was just lonely. Whether it was her fractured psyche or the fact that her powers were not suited for battle, Ruth tended to stay out of limelight. Decimation Ruth was one of the few mutants to retain their powers and she remained at the school after the Decimation on M-Day, although Ms. Frost excused her from combat training.New X-Men (2nd series) #23 Danger When she foresaw her friend Wing die and the robotic entity Danger being created because of it, Ruth alerted the X-Men, nevertheless her premonition eventually came to pass when a depressed Wing is shown near the edge of a cliff, lamenting over the loss of his powers when suddenly Hisako appears behind him, first to give him comfort, but then chides him to jump off, which he does falling to his death. However, the setting around him and Hisako suddenly dissipate to reveal that it was all a holographic scenario created by the now sentient and hostile Danger Room, and Wing being the robotic's first fatal victim.Astonishing X-Men (3rd series) #7 Torn When Emma Frost was suffering from a bad case of survivor's guilt, Blindfold was found by Hisako \\"crying\\" in a restroom. While Hisako comforts her, Blindfold tries to convince Hisako that they are going to lose another X-Man. Wolverine, believing he is a defenseless child due to the manipulations of Cassandra Nova, barged into the restroom asking for help as a feral Beast followed him in. Hisako leaves Blindfold and hides with Wolverine, unfortunately Beast targets Blindfold and goes to attack her. Hisako powers up and scares the feral X-Man away but passes out from exhaustion. Blindfold then takes her to the infirmary because she believes someone was awake only to find the unconscious bodies of Colossus and Cyclops. Eventually Shadowcat makes her way back to the Institute and asks the girls to tell her everything they know. When Kitty leaves to find out who exactly is attacking, Cyclops manages to contact Blindfold and instruct her to give Beast a special box containing a ball of string. He also asks her to keep his mind safe from any sort of psychic attacks as he helps Emma. During the middle of the battle, Ord and the Danger Room entity interrupt and a battle begins between the X-Men, Hisako, Ord and Danger. Suddenly S.W.O.R.D. beamed the team, Danger, Ord, and Hisako into a spaceship headed for the Breakworld. Blindfold was last seen watching them along with a few other students and again commented that not all of them will come back, referring to ShadowcatAstonishing X-Men (3rd series) #18 who would be lost in space for a long time.Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1 Quest for Magik Blindfold, during an evening of storytelling, relayed the history of the deceased New Mutant Illyana Rasputin to her classmates. Her story emotionally bothered some of them as Blindfold began including aspects that both recently happened and were about to happen. She explained that the demon lord Belasco reclaimed the realm of Limbo by defeating its previous mistress, Amanda Sefton. Belasco cast her out of Limbo and began searching for a way to bring back Illyana Rasputin from the dead. After saying this Blindfold and the other students were themselves attacked by demons from Limbo sent by Belasco. She continued to assist the students with advice throughout their time in Limbo, telling certain students when and how to react to their situations, especially concerning Pixie, who she declared \\"must not fall\\". She survived the final battle and was returned to the mansion with the rest of the students.New X-Men (2nd series) #41 Blinded by the Light Cannonball is given knowledge of the plans of the Marauders and implies that Blindfold is second on a targets list for elimination by them and the Acolytes, orchestrated by Mr. Sinister. Blindfold speaks to the New X-Men saying that whatever is supposed to happen to her can be prevented by Elixir. She grabs his hands, touching the black part of his skin that represents death and the gold part that represents life at the same time.X-Men, vol. 2 #201 A large energy transfer of black and gold follows, and she is incapacitated, though the New X-Men are both confused as to what she meant and unsure of whether she is dead or merely unconscious. Right as Pixie goes to get help from Shadowcat, the Institute is attacked by Exodus and his Acolytes. After examining her, Exodus states that Blindfold is dead and she is no longer a priority to them and they continue on to look for Destiny's Diaries in the mansion, but in spite of this she does not 'smell dead' to X-23, and Prodigy theorizes that Blindfold's precognitive abilities forewarned her of Exodus' coming and so she used Elixir's powers to put herself in a deathlike sleep. Shadowcat subsequently operates on Blindfold, who finally awakens to speak further cryptic predictions about the X-Men's handicapped situation, saying that soon Hellion, Pixie, Nightcrawler and someone else she cannot recall will be hurt.X-Men, vol. 2 #203 Messiah Complex Her predictions were soon proven correct when Lady Deathstrike maims Hellion, Scalphunter seriously injures Nightcrawler and Pixie injures herself by blindly teleporting the team from the Reavers. The other person Blindfold mentions was apparently Forge, who was injured by Bishop;Cable (2nd series) #2 or perhaps Professor X.X-Men (2nd series) #207 Young X-Men Blindfold has a nightmare in which one of her future teammates, the Young X-Men, is killed by Donald Pierce. She meets up with Rockslide and tells him of her premonition of the soon-to-be-formed team and mentions the death of one of their future teammates, though Santo appears to take little heed of it, being more interested in the team uniforms she saw. As predicted, Cyclops arrives at the cafe and offers Santo a place on the team, but also revealing that he did not wish to recruit Ruth. However, Santo refuses to join the team unless she is allowed to as well, noting that Ruth's vision included her on the squad as well. Cyclops concedes, and Ruth takes her place on the squad.Young X-Men #1 Cyclops orders Ruth and Ink to bring in Dani Moonstar, who is apparently a member of a new Brotherhood of Mutants. However Ink betrays Ruth and delivers both girls to Donald Pierce, who is revealed to be impersonating Cyclops. Eventually they are freed and Ruths prediction comes to pass and Wolf Cub is killed. She then relocates to San Francisco with the rest of the Young X-Men, but leaves the team. Cyclops states that Ruth will only be called in as needed.Young X-Men #6 When Cipher reveals her presence to the Young X-Men, Cyclops explains that she had been there in secret under his orders helping the Young X-Men and much earlier, including during Beast's attack on Blindfold during Astonishing X-Men. Blindfold's seemingly one-sided conversation during that time (and others) is revealed to have actually been a conversation between herself and Cipher, who was able to mask her part of the conversation using her stealth powers. Blindfold is the only other besides Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Graymalkin who were aware of Cipher's existence prior to the events of Young X-Men. The two developed a friendship during this time.Young X-Men #8 Necrosha Blindfold is shown battling the resurrected Tower without the aid of any other X-Men.X-Force #22 Blindfold is contacted by the newly resurrected Destiny by accident when she was trying to reach her foster daughter Rogue. Destiny saves her life from being crushed by falling rubble and gives her some information to help combat Selene's forces. After Destiny breaks contact with her, she believes she made a grave mistake.X-Necrosha #1 This mistake is revealed to be that Ruth is possessed by Proteus.X-Men: Legacy #231 Blindfold is eventually freed thanks to Magneto who uses his powers to disrupt Proteus' energy matrix. During a conversation with Destiny, it is revealed that she and Destiny are distant relatives and that Ruth's mother had sacrificed herself to save Ruth from her brother, for what reason has yet to be revealed.X-Men: Legacy #233 Age of X Blindfold later confides in Rogue that she had visions of an entity, a mysterious force that wanted to change everything, and once it started it would not stop until everything had been destroyed. However, she cannot identify what it is because it keeps hiding around the periphery of her visions. Rogue, along with Madison Jeffries, eventually find a squid-like spider-monster that had escaped from Emplate's dimension, which they think to be the entity Blindfold sensed. However, after Rogue defeats the creature, Blindfold reveals that the threat is still out there. Before anyone could say anything else, darkness descended over Utopia and the real threat emerged.X-Men: Legacy #244 The world around Blindfold changed dramatically and Blindfold is next seen in the jail of Fortress X during the \\"Age of X\\" storyline. She is one of the mutants considered too dangerous to roam free and is under Danger's supervision. She seems to be the Earth-616 version of the character and the only person seen so far with any memory of the mainstream reality.New Mutants #22 Schism When Cyclops and Wolverine had a difference of opinion as to how to lead the X-Men, Wolverine left Utopia and set up the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning back in Westchester. Many of the students, including Blindfold, chose to leave Cyclops‚Äô militaristic style leadership and go back to being just school students with Wolverine. Before she left, though, Ruth had one final task asked of her. Recently a group of X-Men had come back from space and it seemed they had brought an unseen stowaway with them. When the other X-Men couldn‚Äôt figure the situation out, it was suggested Blindfold might be able to help, given that she viewed the world differently. As it turns out, they were right and she correctly identified that the Shi'ar named Korvus‚Äô sword was actually a gateway and someone was trapped on the other side. The X-Men made a successful rescue mission and Blindfold travelled to Westchester to be with the other students.X-Men Regenesis #1X-Men Legacy (1st series) #259-260 Regenesis Much like Utopia, the Jean Grey School seemed to be a beacon for trouble and Blindfold foresaw many of the threats coming. She had visions of a man bringing great destruction to the X-Men and so when Exodus showed up on the doorstep everybody assumed that it was him. With Exodus dealt with, things calmed down for a bit but Blindfold realized that it wasn‚Äôt him that her premonitions were warning her about.X-Men Legacy (1st series) #261-263 Avengers vs. X-Men The real threat came when Cyclops was possessed by the Phoenix Force. When Professor X tried to help him, the possessed Cyclops ended up killing his former teacher. Blindfold's history unfolds The psychic backlash was more than Blindfold could stand and she doubled over in pain as all her premonitions were now in flux. Ruth wasn‚Äôt the only one to be affected by Xavier's death as his son David, aka Legion, also had a monumental breakdown. Ruth didn‚Äôt know what had caused the changing futures but she could see that a mountain retreat in Tibet would hold some of the answers. A team of X-Men travelled to Tibet and found the retreat, but they discovered dozens of bodies littering the landscape. They quickly realized that David had caused it and Blindfold could now feel him and how scared he was. They set off after him but, as they continued along his trail, they kept on finding more bodies of the people who got in his way. None of them realized David was not only battling the forces of his multiple personalities but also that of a mysterious force that existed as a pair of disembodied eyeballs.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #1 The team of X-Men eventually caught up with Legion in Japan and, mistakenly believing he was about to harm some children, attacked. Ruth stayed back from the fight but her mind was clearing up now and she could see David for what he was. When he overwhelmed the X-Men, Ruth realized that she was the answer to calming him down, so she entered his mind to talk. Inside David's mind, Ruth found she could speak perfectly without her usual speech mannerisms. She also wielded immense power over most of the personalities in Legion's mind, calming them all down so she and David could talk undisturbed. Ruth introduced herself, kissed David on the lips and then told him she was supposed to be his nemesis. She tried to explain that everything was going to be alright and he should trust her, but she was caught off guard by one of David's personalities. This one remained unaffected by her influence and it angrily slashed her throat and forced her out of David's mind. In the real world, Blindfold collapsed and had to be rushed back to the school.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #4 David was transfixed by this girl who had sauntered into his mind and kissed him without any trouble. David travelled to the Jean Grey School and used astral projection to check up on her, finding Blindfold in the medical bay in a coma. Deciding to find out more about her, David delved into her mind and discovered her tragic history for himself. When Ruth Aldine was born, it became immediately obvious she wasn‚Äôt like other children. She was clearly a mutant and the X-gene had caused her to be born without eyes. Having a child with an obvious mutation put a strain on her parents‚Äô marriage and, after a few weeks, Ruth's father walked and never came back. Her mother had to work long hours to be able to feed the family and so she would often leave Ruth in the care of her older brother, Luca. Seeing his father walk out because of Ruth caused Luca to build up a deep resentment of his sister. As she grew up, Ruth started to display other powers, which caused even more stress on the family. Luca's resentment towards Ruth caused him to begin physically lashing out at her. When he was in his teens, Luca became self-destructive and was soon sent to rehab for his drug addiction. While there, he latched onto sermons by a bigoted priest and started hating mutants even more. Though Luca was released as drug-free, his problems weren‚Äôt solved and he continued his abuse of his sister and his mother. Luca finally snapped and attempted to kill his sister with a chainsaw, but their mother intervened and died protecting Ruth from her brother. The years of abuse and violence had caused Ruth to see herself as the problem, so when Luca blamed her for making him kill their mother, she believed him. Luca was caught by the authorities and not only convicted of his crime but was sentenced to death. Ruth went to live with her aunt and the few years that followed were the happiest of her life. There, she could use her various gifts without feeling persecuted by anyone. By the time she was in her early teens, it was time for Luca's execution. Regardless of all the things he had put her through, Ruth felt she needed to be there as he died. She used her telepathy and gained access to the execution. However, as Luca was given the lethal injection, his own gifts emerged and his \\"spirit\\" left his body and attacked Ruth, stealing half her powers. After that day, Ruth was unable to talk in a clear and definitive way. She would always add words like \\"please, thank you, yes, no and sorry\\" into regular sentences, as if she had a form of Tourette's. In fact, it wasn‚Äôt just her speech patterns that had changed; her entire psyche had fractured and Ruth found it hard to piece back together again. Thanks to her gifts, Ruth also had trouble separating the past, present, and future into their proper order, since she perceived all three at once. Ruth's aunt eventually received a call from the Xavier Institute and so Ruth was sent to a school where she could harness her gifts. David could feel Ruth's psyche hiding somewhere within her memories but he couldn‚Äôt reach her before the personality that had originally harmed Ruth stopped him.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #5 As Ruth lay in the coma, one of the young children David had saved in Japan entered the room and attacked the doctor looking after her. As it turned out, the young boy was possessed by Luca, Ruth's not-so-dead brother, and he had been orchestrating events so he could get closer to her to kill her. He had been the strange disembodied eyeballs that had followed David around, helping him escape the X-Men. Apparently, when he stole some of Ruth's powers, he also gained some precognition of his own and he was hoping to use it to rid the world of mutants, as he blamed them for all his problems. Firstly though, he wanted to kill the mutant who started everything off and so, sitting on top of Blindfold, he prepared to stab her with a kitchen knife. Before he could kill her though, he was stopped by David. The two fought and the X-Men were soon alerted to the brawl as it spilled out onto the back lawn. Luca, pretending to be the young boy, manipulated the X-Men into believing David was harming him. Unfortunately for him, Blindfold had woken up from her coma with all her memories intact and she raced outside and stabbed the young boy with the kitchen knife. Luca's energy exploded out of him and vanished, leaving the husk of the young boy, who had apparently died a long time before. Ruth vouched for David's innocence and, as he left, she warned him that something dark was coming.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #6 Tragic Love Story Even after everything that had happened, Blindfold still couldn‚Äôt get David out of her mind. Using astral projection, she decided to spy on him and found him at a strange religious cult called the Church of the Happy Host. When the church leaders gave David a pill to see whether or not he was a mutant, Blindfold managed to dispose of the pill without anyone knowing. Blindfold soon realized that the cult was actually the one that had corrupted her brother years ago and was furious with David for being there. When he soon let on that he knew she was watching, she told him off for meddling in things he shouldn‚Äôt. As he was explaining his intentions, though, he let slip that he considered the meeting a date and Blindfold started blushing. When he was called away by the church leader, she gave him a peck on the cheek and continued to watch over him. David managed to work events so that the church goers were arrested by SWORD for supposed crimes that David committed. As they were taken away, Ruth thanked David for dishing out some justice on the hateful group. Ruth left too but not before she made it clear to David she would be interested in seeing him again. Without Ruth realizing, though, David managed to get his hands on a diary full of prophesies that Luca had written and left at the church.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #7 On their second date, Ruth and David met on the psychosphere, the dreamworld version of the astral plane. From there the two young lovers watched as David used his influence to help a young boy with his powers. Whilst at first they had slightly differing opinions on how he should help the boy, David ultimately came around to Blindfold's way of thinking. Before they could get too cozy, though, Blindfold was forcibly removed from the psychosphere by the same entity that had pushed her out of David's mind a few weeks earlier.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #8 On their next date, the two actually met in person but the venue ended up being just as strange, as David teleported them both to the Moon. David began telling Ruth the story of Aarkus, an ancient cosmic being of which he had seen visions and which was destined to wipe out all mutants. Blindfold was alarmed and told David they should alert the X-Men, but became unsure after he showed her images of Aarkus destroying any team that challenged him. When David promised Ruth that he would take care of Aarkus, Ruth realized he essentially wanted permission to attack the being and was adamant that the being shouldn‚Äôt be punished for a crime it had yet to commit. To her surprise, David replied he wanted approval because he had already done it five hours earlier. He showed her Aarkus's base on the Moon and revealed he had tampered with the being's mind whilst he was asleep. Ruth was furious but David remained unapologetic. Instead, he sent her back to the school with Aarkus in the hopes the X-Men would educate him.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #9 Despite David's actions, Ruth couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him and so she used Cerebra to spy on him without his knowledge. As well as accidentally catching him sleeping in the nude, she also discovered Luca's diary, which David had taken a few weeks earlier. When David woke up, he immediately teleported himself away and it took a while for Blindfold to locate him. When she did, she discovered he was at a medical testing center in San Francisco and was signing on to take a cure for his mutation. Blindfold hurriedly put together her own ad-hoc X-Men team and went to rescue David from himself. When she got there, though, she discovered that she was simply a pawn in David's game and he had counted on them coming for him.X-men Legacy (2nd series) #10 As events unfolded, it was revealed the Red Skull was the one creating the cure for mutants and David was there to stop him. After a tense fight, in which David had to give himself over to the dangerous personality in his mind, the Red Skull fled. Afterwards, Ruth and David talked about their relationship and what the future held for them. Both Ruth and David were now well aware of the future that was headed their way. David was somehow going to end up absorbing all the mutants into himself and killing the entire race. The only outcomes either of them could see was that either David would die by Blindfold's hand or every mutant, including Blindfold, would die. Despite all that, David told her that he would continue to fight for a future where they could be together.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #12 David travelled to the UK next and enlisted a group of British mutants into helping him sort out a problem he foresaw arising. Blindfold stayed behind in America but used astral projection to keep tabs on him and was disappointed to see he was using his powers to force the various mutants into working for him. However, she had misunderstood Legion's plan and that the mutants were all working together to wipe mutophobia off the map in the UK.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #13X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #14 When David's mother was murdered, he initially lost control again but soon found his focus and decided it was time he met with Cyclops. Blindfold was becoming his emotional support more and more and she spent a great deal of time inside his mind. However, she was also being worried at some of his actions and how he achieved them. When David confronted Cyclops, he immediately started a fight and laid waste to most of the X-Men. Emma Frost and the Stepford Cuckoos proved to be trickier but Ruth surprised Emma, knocking her out with a punch. Ruth likewise pulled an unlikely victory against the Cuckoos after David slyly gave her a power boost. In the end, it was left to David to fight Cyclops alone. However, during the brawl, the two combatants accidentally knocked into a mutant girl whose powers had just manifested. Unable to control them, she started absorbing every living thing around her into one homogenous mass. When Blindfold saw it, she immediately thought that this was going to be the incident that would end either David or her. David was immediately absorbed into the growing mass and he begged Ruth to kill him with Magik's soulsword.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) \\"15 Knowing what would happen if she didn‚Äôt, Ruth reluctantly picked up the blade and prepared to stab him, only to be stopped when a hand grabbed hers. When she turned around, Ruth saw Luca, now in possession of a body constructed out of metal. Luca had foreseen what was about to happen and was there to make sure it would go exactly the way he wanted it to. Once again, though, David had played everyone for fools and everything had been part of one big plan. He broke free of the mass, stopped Luca from killing Ruth and then destroyed his body once again. Blindfold was confused but David explained he needed to draw Luca out so he decided to make it seem his prophecy was coming true. Everyone was disgusted by his actions but, as the dust was settling, David had another psychic episode and the errant personality that had been plaguing him for so long broke free. It took control of Luca's body and then disappeared, leaving David and his shattered psyche behind.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #18 David was taken away and it was weeks before Blindfold had any idea where he was. She eventually found him on board the SWORD space station where he was undergoing an unconventional form of therapy. By the time he left, he had a new outlook on his situation and a newfound control over his powers.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #19X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #20 When David came back to Earth, Blindfold entered his mind but found a much different landscape than before and an even more different David. He was now absorbing all his personalities into the David Haller one and changing with each new one. Ruth was shocked at how much he had changed and worried that she could see he was continuing down the path that would lead to one of their deaths. She begged him to stop but, despite his confession of love, he told her he couldn‚Äôt. He gently put her to sleep so she couldn‚Äôt get in the way and then went to confront his out of control personality.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #21 With the help of the X-Men, David managed to destroy the personality's body that it stole off Luca. With her brother dead once and for all, the powers that were stolen from Ruth returned to her. She woke up from her sleep and, whilst her body raced towards David's location, she managed to astrally project her psyche there first. Taking the name Destiny, she told the X-Men that it was now too late to save David. Her boyfriend tried absorbing the wayward personality into his new form but, as he did so, it triggered a massive change within him and he started to become the thing Blindfold had feared. Unable to stop himself, he started to absorb the consciousness of every mutant around the world into him, all except Ruth.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #22 Her body finally made it to David and, when she arrived, he saw she had become a powerful being in her own right. Manifesting her own sword, she hacked and slashed at David's form to no avail. Eventually, she forced David to allow her to enter his mind one last time so she could see him again. Inside David's mind, the two made love for the first time. However, as soon as it was over, David could no longer hold back the inevitable. The two lovers bid goodbye and Ruth was forced back into her own body again.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #23 Despite her best efforts, Ruth too was on the verge of being consumed by David's power until the young man found the self-confidence he needed to stop it all. With his full array of powers at his disposal, David altered reality itself and removed himself from existence. For a brief moment, everything went blank but then Ruth found herself back in her old body again at Westchester. It was now the day Xavier had died and none of the events of the past few months had happened. No one knew who David was but, when a lone voice called from inside her head, she discovered he had somehow left a fragment of himself inside her mind.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #24 The Last X-Men After the X-Men disappeared during the confrontation with X-Man, Blindfold is revealed to be one of the few mutants that remains in the country following the advancement of a mutant vaccine, the rise of popular anti-mutant politicians and the growing anti-mutant sentiment. She tracks Cyclops and Wolverine separately and warned them each that great tragedy lies in their futures. Both Wolverine and Cyclops tell Blindfold they believe the X-Men, who are currently presumed dead while trapped in the \\"Age of X-Man\\", are still alive, but Blindfold warns them both about their future actions, and says the X-Men will die before disappearing. Due to Blindfold's cryptic words Cyclops asks Jamie Madrox to find Blindfold, and he does. Though she is in hiding, Blindfold allows Madrox to tell Cyclops where she is, but by the time he arrives, it is too late, Blindfold has committed suicide, after she foresaw that she had no future. It's her death that motivate Cyclops to attend an anti-mutant rally where he is recognized, causing a potential incident that is quelled by Captain America.Uncanny X-Men (2019) #11 Dawn of X Ruth's predictions about her own future once again proves correct as she apparently foresaw that there would be a world that was a utopia for most mutants, but because of who she is, she would not be able to take part in it as by Moira's demand, precog mutants are not allowed on Krakoa. Powers and abilities Blindfold was born without eyes, a condition known as anophthalmia, but in exchange, she is psionic, though the full extent of her abilities is unknown. She has been shown in Astonishing X-Men using telepathy and New X-Men to sometimes psychically sense events when other telepaths apparently did not, such as Belasco pulling everyone inside the mansion into Limbo. During her appearances in Astonishing X-Men she used telepathy, and in her most recent appearances in New X-Men and X-Men, she has been said to be a clairvoyant, retrocognitive and precognitive mutant, meaning that she is able to see distant, past, and future places or events; her power is so great that she was immune- albeit to a limited degree- to the reality warp caused by Legion's 'Moira' personality that created the 'Age of X', allowing her to be aware that something was wrong with the world. This goes into full reality anchoring when Legion undid his own birth erasing himself from existence, Ruth was the only individual to remember David even lived after time & space had reset itself when her missing abilities were restored.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #24 Her blindness is part of her mutation in the sense that she has no eyes, but rather has skin where eyes would normally be. Blindfold's precognitive abilities are neutralized while in the presence of Destiny, another precognitive (and vice versa). Destiny explains that this is because two precogs in close presence to one another \\"are like two magnets pressed together positive pole to positive pole\\" and will negatively affect one another's precognitive abilities and powers.X-Men: Legacy #233 Ruth also had a slew of other psychic abilities tied to her mutant powers which she had been developing since her early childhood. Possibly boasting an advanced intellect since she had developed a cognitive capacity for vocalization abilities at an early newborn age. Displaying Telekinesis and the ability to read and analyze all possible futures and probabilistic outcomes,X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #5 but those powers were taken from her by her abusive brother's own ghostly projection which resulted in her crippled mind state. Over time however she has shown remarkable leaps in bounds with her initial ability, similar to Nate Grey Blindfold can materialize Astral Plane Energy to give her own astral projection a tangible form.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #7 with some coaxing from David Haller would showcase herself an adequate match for other powerful telepaths such as the Stepford Cuckoos, and once at the fullest manifest of her powers were returned to her Ruth not only regained her mental stability but also the lions share of her missing power. Being able to materialize energy from the Astral Plane as a form of psionic armor enabling her to battle the psionic entity that sprang forth from Legions damaged psyche.X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #23 Mannerisms Blindfold has a unique speech pattern. It includes the odd insertion into her sentences of words of politeness, including \\"please\\", \\"thank you\\", \\"you're welcome\\", and \\"pardon\\". She's also been known to oddly insert the words \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" into her sentences. The reason she has this pattern is explained in X-Men Legacy when Legion tries to wake her up from her coma: her brother Luca was a mutant hater and tried to kill her when she was little, but in a fit of rage he killed their mother. Years later, Blindfold attended his execution and, just after he died, his astral projection attacked her and stole half of her powers, leaving her \\"broken\\". When telepathically projecting herself into Legion's mind in the same issue, Blindfold did not demonstrate this speech pattern, instead speaking in a normal manner and acting with more confidence than is usually the case. Given that she is both a telepath and a precognitive, she often answers questions before they are asked and responds to comments before they are spoken aloud. As a result, she tends to turn what would ordinarily be a two-way conversation into a monologue. While she does not always do this, it may be assumed that she is allowing the other person or persons to say what she already knows they will say out of politeness' sake. Some of her \\"one- sided\\" conversations in Astonishing X-Men and Young X-Men were explained as having been with her friend Cipher, who remained concealed from all others around them by using her complete stealth mutant powers. After the end of Simon Spurrrier's run on X-Men Legacy Ruth had regained her center of focus now showcasing complete sentences and no more added adjectives between words. Now showcasing her whole and healed persona Ruth Aldine states to a befuddled Pixie that she's fine and proudly stating \\"I Rule Me\\".X-Men Legacy (2nd series) #24 References=Bibliography *Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #4, 7‚Äì8, 15‚Äì18 *New X-Men, vol. 2 #23 *New X-Men, vol. 2 #37‚Äì40 Category:Astral projection in popular culture Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005 Category:Characters created by Joss Whedon Category:Female characters in comics Category:Fictional blind characters Category:Fictional characters from North Carolina Category:Fictional characters with precognition Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers Category:Marvel Comics telepaths Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes ","title":"Blindfold (comics)"},{"id":"4439812","text":"Nature Bears a Vacuum is a 7\\" EP released by indie rock band The Shins.

The instrumentation consists of brass, woodwinds and percussion instruments.  History  On May 30, 1884, the band played its first parade on what is now known as Memorial Day. The band was organized some time before its first performance. However, the first documented records that are known to exist are news accounts of this first performance. A \\"cornet band\\" was a common designation for wind bands organized during the Gilded Age. No defined instrumental make up (i.e. only brass instruments) exists at its inception; however, twelve people were listed as the original founding members.50th Anniversary Booklet, The Bloomingdale Cornet Band, 1934. The first director was Alfred Bedson. A series of directors followed until 1889, when Samuel R.

Other directors have followed and at the present time, the band is directed by Mike Kallimanis. About 4 months after its first performance, for reasons not documented, the band was split and a band based in the adjacent town of Butler, New Jersey was organized Article, The Boonton Bulletin, September 11, 1884 under the auspices of the largest employer, the Butler Hard Rubber Company. The company was led by Richard Butler, Secretary for the American Pedestal Association, which handled the fund-raising for the building of the pedestal for the Statue of Liberty.Article, The Iron Era, April 18, 1885 This rival band, the Butler Silver Cornet Band, was considered a company band of the rubber company. A noted Massachusetts musician named Jeremiah J. O'Sullivan was hired by the company, shortly after the band was organized, to be the leader of the Butler band.Article, The Boonton Builletin, April 23, 1885 This rivalry led to some members of the Bloomingdale Cornet Band, who worked for the rubber company, to be fired at the request of members of the Silver Cornet Band.Article, The Boonton Builletin, September 24, 1885 The rivalry diminished over time. By 1889, both bands united in some performances and hosting fundraising events.

Royal Workshop, Palermo, Sicily, 1133‚Äì34. Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna. Kermes is a red dye derived from the dried bodies of the females of a scale insect in the genus Kermes, primarily Kermes vermilio. The Kermes insects are native in the Mediterranean region and live on the sap of the Kermes oak. They were used as a red dye by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The kermes dye is a rich red, a crimson. It has good colour fastness in silk and wool. It was much esteemed in the medieval era for dyeing silk and wool, particularly scarlet cloth. Post-medievally it was replaced by other red dyes, starting with cochineal. History Kermes dye is of ancient origin; jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave- burial at Adaouste, northeast of Aix-en-Provence.Barber (1991), pp. 230‚Äì231 In the Middle Ages, rich crimson and scarlet silks dyed with kermes in the new silk-weaving centers of Italy and Sicily exceeded the legendary Tyrian purple \\"in status and desirability\\".Schoeser (2007), p. 118 The dyestuff was called \\"grain\\" in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resembled fine grains of wheat or sand, and textiles dyed with kermes were described as dyed in the grain.Munro, John H. \\"Medieval Woollens: Textiles, Technology, and Organisation\\". In Jenkins (2003), pp. 214‚Äì215. Woollens were frequently dyed blue with woad before spinning and weaving, and then piece- dyed in kermes, producing a wide range colours from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines. By the 14th and early 15th century, brilliant full grain pure kermes scarlet was \\"by far the most esteemed, most regal\\" colour for luxury woollen textiles in the Low Countries, England, France, Spain and Italy.Munro, John H. \\"The Anti-Red Shift ‚Äì To the Dark Side: Colour Changes in Flemish Luxury Woollens, 1300‚Äì1500\\". In Netherton & Owens- Crocker (2007), pp. 56‚Äì57. Following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Mexican cochineal, which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities, replaced kermes dyes in general use in Europe.Schoeser (2007), pp. 121, 248Barber (1982), p. 55.

His Olympic career includes: * Production Director for the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games. * Executive Producer for the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Games. * Executive Producer and Director of Ceremonies for the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. * Producer for the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the Torino 2006 Winter Olympic Games and Torino 2006 Winter Paralympics. This was his first time producing ceremonies for a Winter Olympic Games, which he worked with Filmmaster Events. * International Artistic Advisor for Creative Director Zhang Yimou for the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. He was hired as Executive Producer for the Opening and Closing ceremonies for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, but in 2016 it was found that he had left the project due to budget cuts.  Other events  In 1990, Birch worked as Director on the 25th Anniversary Singapore National Day Parade. Birch was also director and producer of Sydney New Year's Eve between 1996-1999. His last event was NYE 1999, where in the finale light effect on the Sydney Harbour Bridge revealed the word 'Eternity' in Copperplate writing, in honour of Arthur Stace. This scene was then replicated with fireworks in the Sydney 2000 Olympics opening ceremony. In 2009, he worked as an Advisor on the 2009 Hong Kong East Asian Games Opening and Closing ceremonies. In 2010 he participated in the planning of celebrations to commemorate 200th anniversary of the 'Grito de Dolores' - Hidalgo's call for independence - and the beginning of the Mexican war for independence from Spain. The ceremony took place on 15 September 2010. In the same year, he helped stage the Delhi Commonwealth Games Opening and Closing ceremonies, but the working relationship broke down between Birch (and other contractors), and the game organizers by the end of those games. He was not paid in full.

September 1861) Fort Scott was a detached lunette constructed in May 1861 to guard the south flank of the defenses of Washington during the American Civil War. It was named for General Winfield Scott, who was then General-in-Chief of the Union Army. An historic marker and a small remnant of the fort are the only evidence of the site of the fort on the grounds of what is now Fort Scott Park in Arlington County, Virginia. The fort was one of the ring of Union Army fortifications that the Union Army constructed as part of the Civil War defenses of Washington (see Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War). It was one of 33 forts on the Virginia side of the Potomac River that made up a defense line (the Arlington Line) for the national capital city. The fort was built with a perimeter of 313 yards enclosing emplacements for eight guns, two magazines, a guard house and bombproof. Armament at one time included five 24 pounders, one 8\\" howitzer, one 30 pounder Parrott rifle, one 6 pounder and two 10\\" mortars. A May 17, 1864, report from the Union Army's Inspector of Artillery noted the following: > Fort Scott, Major Trumbull commanding.‚ÄìGarrison, one company First > Connecticut Heavy Artillery‚Äì4 commissioned officers, 1 ordnance-sergeant, > 137 men.

Drill in artillery, fair. Drill in > infantry, fair. Discipline, fair. Garrison sufficient for the work.\\" Construction of the defense of Alexandria to the west subsequently reduced the importance of the fort. The fort was abandoned in 1865 at the end of the war. The fort is located in the Arlington Ridge community. References Category:Civil War defenses of Washington, D.C.

They play at the Winthrop-King Centre at Shorter College. 2004 The Gladiators floundered in their first season, finishing a dismal 6‚Äì14. The team went through three different owners, and was at one point owned by the league itself. In May 2004, the Gladiators were bought by current owner, NBA player Theo Ratliff. Ratliff retained coach Harold Ellis, and kept the team in Rome. 2005 2005 Champions Once again coached by Harold Ellis, the Gladiators won their first nine games before being stopped by the WBA's other powerhouse, the Mississippi HardHats, in a 120‚Äì115 loss. The Gladiators then went on another nine-game winning streak, before being brought down by both the Magic City Court Kings and the Gulf Coast Bandits. The team finished 21‚Äì3 in the regular season, and defeated the HardHats in the championship game. The Glads were led in scoring by Darryl \\"MaJic\\" Dorsey, who won the WBA's player of the year award as well, scoring 23 points per game, was first team all-WBA along with Edmund Saunders.

She was a member of the bin Laden family, having entered the family by marriage to Yeslam bin Ladin, a son of the patriarch Muhammad bin Ladin; they have since divorced. Biography=Early life Carmen Dufour was born in 1954 in Lausanne, Switzerland. Her father was Swiss (Dufour) and her mother was Persian (Mirdoht-Sheybani). She was raised in Lausanne by her mother along with three other sisters (Salom√©, B√©atrice, and Magnolia). Adult life From 1974 to 1988, she was married Yeslam bin Ladin, an older half-brother of Osama bin Laden'. They were married in 1974 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. They had three daughters, Wafah Dufour, Najia and Noor. In 2004, she published Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia, a personal account of her life as a Saudi Arabian wife and mother. The book contains insights into life in the bin Laden family and her relationship with them and her former husband. She claims that no matter how westernized her ex-husband or other bin Laden family members may be, they still feel strong familial and religious ties and would have financially supported and sheltered Osama bin Laden if necessary, prior to his May 2011 death. She admits that while she found it difficult to adjust to the restrictive Saudi Arabian society, her lifestyle was one of privilege. She later moved to Geneva with her then husband and three children, and finally left her husband in 1988, asking for a divorce in 1994. She alleges that her ex-husband engaged in emotional blackmail including threatening to kidnap her children, adultery, and forced her to undergo an abortion. She finally obtained a divorce 12 years later in January 2006. Yeslam bin Ladin is reportedly uninvolved and uninterested in the lives of his former wife and daughters. He is quoted in Carmen Dufour's book as saying that he wished he had sons and not daughters. Yeslam has obtained a Swiss passport supposedly for the purpose of pursuing a relationship with his children. In her book, she writes that she had only seen Osama bin Laden on two occasions and that they did not really speak. She emphasizes that the bin Laden family is a large one, and not all family members are directly associated with Osama bin Laden. See also * Bin Laden family References * Bin Laden, Carmen.

About 12 extant species are recognized.Spinks, P. Q., et al. (2012). Species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships in the critically endangered Asian box turtle genus Cuora. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 63(3), 656-67. The keeled box turtle (Pyxidea mouhotii syn. Cuora mouhotii) is often included in this genus, or separated in the monotypic genus Pyxidea. Genus Cuora is distributed from China to Indonesia and the Philippines, throughout mainland Southeast Asia, and into northern India and Bhutan.  Description  Cuora species are characterized by a low- (e.g. Cuora pani) to high- (e.g. Cuora picturata) domed shell, which usually has three keels on the carapace. They are reddish, yellowish, brown, grey, and/or black in color. Some species have bright yellow, black, orange, or white stripes down the length of their keels. Their body color is highly variable, but usually very intense. Most species show stripes of variable color down either side of their heads, which usually meet at the nose.  Background  The Asian box turtles are the most heavily trafficked turtles in the world. They are captured and sold as food to China, and to the United States as pets. Nancy Karraker, a University of Rhode Island associate professor, has said ‚ÄúTrafficking in turtles is a major issue in Southeast Asia, and it‚Äôs important that we understand the key ecological roles that species like this box turtle play before it‚Äôs too late,‚Äù Different conservation organizations are taking action to prevent or slow down the extinction of these species. However, in the past most of the efforts are failed due to lack of biological research regarding the history or genetic diversity of these species.  Behavior  Asian box turtles are terrestrial, semiaquatic, or mainly aquatic, most spending much of their time on the edge of shallow swamps, streams, or pond that are dense with vegetation. Most are omnivorous, but carnivores do occur. Head portrait of the different Cuora species, subspecies and varieties (from left to right/top to bottom): Cuora amboinensis amboinensis (Sulawesi), Cuora amboinensis kamaroma (Thailand), Cuora amboinensis ssp.

A single specimen of C. serrata has been found in the wild, lending credence to the possibility that other specimens arose through natural hybridization or even from wild populations. No Chinese turtle farm is known to produce C. serrata-like specimens.Zhou et al. (2008) The occurrence of wild hybrids is often regarded as \\"evolution in progress\\", a terminology and point of view that is not always accepted. It has yet to be confirmed, whether all C. serrata from the wild have originated by direct hybridization of C. mouhotii and C. galbinifrons, or also by \\"hybridisation\\" of C. serrata √ó C. serrata. Unnamed hybrids of several other Cuora taxa are also known, as are intergeneric hybrids such as Mauremys iversoni, a hybrid between Cuora trifasciata and Mauremys mutica which is intentionally produced in Chinese turtle farms.  In captivity  Wild-caught C. amboinensis specimens were frequently available in the exotic animal trade, but are getting rarer now; other species are rare to commercially extinct.

The Reliquary organizes and presents artistic and historical exhibitions relating to baseball each year. Throughout its two-decade history, the Reliquary has held exhibitions on varied topics relating to the cultural impact of baseball, including: \\"Legacies: Baseball from Flatbush to the City of Angels,\\" a variety of artistic interpretations of the 1958 move of the Brooklyn Dodgers to Los Angeles (2004); the photographic exhibition ‚ÄúAnother Trip in Baseball‚Äôs Time Machine: Photography at the Field of Dreams,‚Äù highlighting the relationship between photography and baseball (2013); and ‚ÄúA Swinging Centennial: Jackie Robinson at 100,‚Äù a musical event that featured a performance of ‚ÄúStealin‚Äô Home,‚Äù Bobby Bradford‚Äôs tribute to Jackie Robinson, commissioned by the Reliquary (2019).

Beginning in 1999, the Reliquary created a hall-of-fame style historical commemoration of baseball notables called the Shrine of the Eternals. Rather than focusing on statistical accomplishments as does the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, the Shrine ‚Äúseek[s] out aspects of this history that have been overlooked or have not been explored in depth as well as players and others in baseball who have had unconventional careers.‚Äù The Reliquary and its Shrine have been described as ‚Äúa haven for legends like Marvin Miller and Spaceman Lee, umpires like Emmett Ashford and Pam Postema ‚Ä¶ mostly renegades who did not meet the precise standards of the [National] Baseball Hall of Fame.‚Äù Some view the Shrine of the Eternals as a more welcome recognition of their contributions to baseball than even the Hall of Fame. The Reliquary has recognized three inductees each year since the Shrine's inception. Members of the Reliquary receive a ballot of 50 candidates for the Shrine each year, and the top three vote-getters by percentage are installed. As of the 2019 Shrine election, there were more than 300 voting members. In 2001, the Reliquary began recognizing ‚Äúdistinguished service by a baseball fan‚Äù with the Hilda Award, named for famed Brooklyn Dodgers fan Hilda Chester. In 2002, the Tony Salin Memorial Award was established ‚Äúto honor individuals for their work in preserving baseball history.‚Äù Each of these honors is awarded annually. In 2013, documentary filmmaker Jon Leonoudakis released a 69 minute film about the Reliquary titled, ‚ÄúNot Exactly Cooperstown.‚Äù The film premiered at the 8th Annual Baseball Film Festival at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown on 29 September 2013. The film was also featured at the St. Louis International Film Festival in November 2014. In January 2015, the Reliquary found a permanent home for its collections and events with the opening of the Institute for Baseball Studies at Whittier College in Whittier, California. Housed on the third floor of the College‚Äôs Mendenhall building, the Institute is open to students and the public for research and viewing of the Reliquary‚Äôs growing collection. Shrine of the Eternals Since 1999, members of the Baseball Reliquary have elected three individuals annually to their \\"Shrine of the Eternals.\\" The Shrine is similar in concept to the annual elections held at the Baseball Hall of Fame, but differs philosophically in that statistical accomplishment is not a criterion for election. Rather, the Shrine‚Äôs annual ballot is composed of individuals ‚Äì from the obscure to the well known ‚Äì who have altered the baseball world in ways that supersede statistics. The definition of \\"individuals\\" is not restricted to humans; the 2017 induction class included the Peanuts character Charlie Brown. The Baseball Reliquary lists the criteria for election to the Shrine of the Eternals as: * the distinctiveness of play (good or bad) * the uniqueness of character and personality * the imprint that the individual has made upon the baseball landscape Inductees (as of 2020) *Jim Abbott (2003) *Dick Allen (2004) *Roger Angell (2010) *Emmett Ashford (2008) *Billy Beane (2019) *Moe Berg (2000) *Sy Berger (2015) *Yogi Berra (2007) *Steve Bilko (2015) *Ila Borders (2003) *Jim Bouton (2001) *Jim Brosnan (2007) *Charlie Brown (2017) *Bill Buckner (2008) *Glenn Burke (2015) *Roberto Clemente (2004) *Bob Costas (2020) *Steve Dalkowski (2009) *Dizzy Dean (2014) *Rod Dedeaux (2005) *Jim Eisenreich (2009) *Dock Ellis (1999) *Nancy Faust (2018) *Eddie Feigner (2013) *Lisa Fernandez (2019) *Mark Fidrych (2002) *Curt Flood (1999) *Rube Foster (2020) *Ted Giannoulas (2011) *Josh Gibson (2006) *Jim \\"Mudcat\\" Grant (2012) *Pete Gray (2011) *Arnold Hano (2016) *William \\"Dummy\\" Hoy (2004) *Bo Jackson (2016) *Shoeless Joe Jackson (2002) *Bill James (2007) *Dr. Frank Jobe (2012) * Tommy John (2018) *Bill \\"Spaceman\\" Lee (2000) *Roger Maris (2009) *Marvin Miller (2003) *Minnie Mi√±oso (2002) *Manny Mota (2013) *Don Newcombe (2016) *Lefty O‚ÄôDoul (2013) *Buck O‚ÄôNeil (2008) *Satchel Paige (2001) *Max Patkin (2020) *Jimmy Piersall (2001) *Pam Postema (2000) *J.

Played by Zach Braff, he acts as narrator and main character of the series from the first season to the eighth, providing voice-overs that reveal his internal thoughts and an overall narration in the show, often linking the story arcs in each episode thematically. J.D. appears in every episode during the first eight seasons except two season 8 episodes: \\"My Absence,\\" in which he is only heard through a mobile phone, and \\"My Full Moon\\"; he later partially returns as a major character in six episodes of the ninth and final season to help transition the series into its new format. Braff also briefly portrayed the character in the webisode spin-off series Scrubs: Interns and the Muppets film It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie. Both the character and Braff's performance were positively received. Braff was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2005 and received three consecutive Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Television Series Musical or Comedy nominations from 2005 to 2007. Character background J.D.'s name is based on that of Dr. Jonathan Doris, a college friend of series creator Bill Lawrence. Doris served as a medical advisor on the show. According to Zach Braff, he feels that after seven years, there is not much of J.D.'s personality left to be explored, except for his relationship with best friend Christopher Turk, while Lawrence has stated that the seventh season was to show J.D. finally growing up, in order to satisfy many fans who did not want to see him stay the same.Biller, Jennifer, et al. \\"Tube Talk - Scrubs‚Äô Zach Braff and Bill Lawrence interview \\". Edited transcript of a conference call interview. October 23, 2007. Accessed August 28, 2011. However, Braff also says that J.D. has gradually evolved over the series, but at the same time cannot evolve too much, as they need to \\"[give] the fans what they want, which is to see the characters be themselves.\\"\\"More On \\"Scrubs\\" From The Zach Braff - Bill Lawrence Interview \\". In a 2008 interview, Braff stated that while he feels \\"most at home when I‚Äôm playing a Jewish character\\", the writers for Scrubs chose to imply that Dorian was Christian because the show needed \\"to appeal to the most massive audience possible\\" out of concern that some people might not watch a show featuring a Jewish main character. Fictional character biography=Personality J.D.'s most prominently featured quirk is his habit of daydreaming.Keveney, Bill. \\"'Scrubs' sews things up as the end draws near ... or not \\" USA TODAY. 5 Jan 2009. Accessed 6 August 2011 When this happens, he tilts his head back and to his left, blankly looking upwards. The sequences played out in his daydreams are of surreal scenarios and situations that have just been mentioned or wondered about, often in an exaggerated manner. Many of these are followed by a comment from him which, although in keeping with his daydream, sounds strange and is often highly unrelated to the initial topic, very often earning him odd looks from nearby characters in the scene. Despite his numerous mistakes, quirks and personal neurosis, J.D. is shown throughout the series to be a very skilled doctor. He is described as having compassion for his patients, and a lot of determination and enthusiasm for his job. Family life He grew up in Trotwood, Ohio. In a season 1 episode (2001), JD states that 20 years ago he \\"had a little trouble with his \\"esses\\"\\" because he was five. In season five JD turns 30. His father, Sam (John Ritter), a failed office supply salesman, was absent for most of J.D.'s childhood, and often mooched off his son when he was around; after Sam dies, however, J.D. realizes that his father loved him and was proud of him. His mother is Barbara Turner Dorian. He has an older brother, Dan (Tom Cavanagh), with whom he has a love/hate relationship. Work J.D. begins the show as an intern at Sacred Heart Hospital. After a year, he becomes a resident, then an attending physician in internal medicine, and eventually residency director of another hospital. J.D. begins work at Sacred Heart under Attending Physician Dr. Perry Cox (John C. McGinley), who generally refers to J.D. as \\"Newbie\\" or by a variety of girls' names. J.D. thinks of Cox as his mentor, which Cox adamantly denies. As much as he hates to admit it, however, Cox respects J.D. as a doctor and even cares about him as a person, even offering him personal advice on a few occasions. J.D.'s faith in Cox is shaken when the latter has a breakdown following the death of three patients. After a deeply depressed Cox shows up to work drunk, J.D. refuses to see him, claiming that he does not approve of Cox's behavior. However, he later confesses to Cox that he still looks upon him as a hero, and admires him for caring so much about his patients that he takes it hard when things go badly for them. At the end of the episode, Cox thanks J.D. -- and, atypically, calls him by his real name -- for helping him forgive himself and get on with his life. After Cox is promoted to Chief of Medicine in season 8, he and J.D. are often at odds over hospital matters, mirroring Cox's relationship with the former chief, Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins), in earlier seasons. Kelso advises J.D. that he is the one who will have to press for hospital matters if they're important enough, even if it means fighting Cox to do it. On J.D.'s last day Sacred Heart, Cox finally admits that J.D. is an exceptional physician, an exceptional person, and a friend -- albeit only when he thinks J.D. isn't around to hear it. J.D. is also engaged in a constant battle with the Janitor (Neil Flynn) from the very first episode. The Janitor is trying to open a jammed door when J.D. suggests there may be a penny stuck in it. When it turns out that there is a penny stuck in the door, the Janitor vows revenge. Throughout the series, the Janitor frequently plays tricks and pranks on J.D. In the eighth-season finale, it is revealed that J.D. did accidentally put the penny in the door. The Janitor saw him drop the penny, but because he never admitted it, decided that J.D. had failed a \\"test of character,\\" thus igniting their feud. J.D. leaves Sacred Heart for a job at another hospital in order to be closer to his son, Sam. In season 9, J.D. becomes a visiting professor at Winston University, a medical school built on the old site of Sacred Heart, which has been torn down. He forms a bond with the series' new main character, Lucy Bennett (Kerry Bish√©), whom he counsels through the rigors of life as a doctor. After a few months, however, he tells her that he eventually plans to move on, and that she must find a new mentor before he leaves. Finally, he leaves his teaching position and steps back from mentoring Lucy, determined that she must learn to function on her own. Friends He often spends time with Chris Turk (Donald Faison), his best friend and surrogate brother, whom he first met when they were roommates at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. The pair continue to be roommates even as they progress to become interns and residents. J.D. is often shown to have a codependent relationship with Turk, regularly going through some stages of depression whenever he can't be with him. By their own admission, their relationship is a \\"bromance.\\" In the first episode, when Turk suggests the two of them seek separate apartments to \\"branch out,\\" J.D.'s inner monologue tells himself to \\"Tell him you think that's stupid. Tell him you need him,\\" but they end up roommates again by the episode's end. Their friendship is often depicted as being closer and more loving than a marriage; they sum up their feelings in the song \\"Guy Love\\": \\"It's guy love / That's all it is / It's guy love / He's mine, I'm his / There's nothing gay about it in our eyes.\\" On his first day, he also meets Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes), a nurse who looks out for him and affectionately nicknames him \\"Bambi.\\" On his last day at Sacred Heart, she reveals that she calls him this because he needed to learn how to walk (meaning to become a doctor). Romantic history He meets and forms a connection with Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) in the pilot episode and finds himself attracted to her. In seasons 1 to 3, a running joke in the series was that J.D. would sleep with Elliot at least once in each season, although the show's producers have indicated that this ended to prevent the characters' development being constrained by clich√©s. The two form a romantic relationship in the first season, but their romance quickly falls apart when they realize that they do not work as a couple. He has had romantic and sexual liaisons with various women besides Elliot, including Dr. Cox's ex-wife Jordan Sullivan (Christa Miller), and Jordan's younger sister Danni Sullivan (Tara Reid). In season five, he meets Dr. Kim Briggs (Elizabeth Banks), the hospital's urologist, and they are immediately attracted to each other. They go on a date that ends with J.D. getting her pregnant via premature ejaculation. In season 6, they decide to keep the child and try to make a relationship work, but they break up when Kim announces that she had a miscarriage. Soon afterward, however, J.D. discovers that she is still pregnant, having lied about losing the baby to get out of the relationship. He decides to stay with her for the sake of their child. J.D. realizes that he doesn't love her, however, and they break up for good while she is giving birth to their son, Sam Perry Gilligan Dorian. While J.D. and Elliot had an on-and-off romance throughout the series, it is not until the conclusion of Season 6 that they appear ready to get back together. The episode \\"My Point of No Return\\" ends with J.D. and Elliot lying on a bed in the on-call room, leaning in for a kiss. The action remains unresolved until Season 7, when Elliot backs out. They both then say that the almost-kiss had nothing to do with their feelings for each other. In Season 8, they become a couple again after they talk about their history together, and Dr. Kelso advises them to do whatever makes them happy. During the filming for Season 8, Sarah Chalke said in an interview that she couldn't imagine J.D. and Elliot not being together romantically.\\"Sarah Chalke on Britney, the Bahamas, and Braff in a Speedo \\". Buzzsugar.com. July 23, 2008. Accessed August 28, 2011. In the Season 8 finale, it is suggested through a flash forward in the style of a home movie that J.D and Elliot will marry and have a child. In Season 9, it is revealed that J.D. and Elliot are in fact married and expecting a child. This is punctuated by an extremely awkward morning ritual in front of Elliot's class where J.D. kisses her stomach for every month she is pregnant and says \\"and thank you for making mommy's boobs bigger\\"; Elliot then puts her breasts on his head. In their final appearance together, they go on a \\"babymoon\\", a romantic getaway for expecting parents.  Cameos in other media  Like Elliot, Carla, Cox and the Janitor, the J.D. character makes a cameo appearance in It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, trying to reanimate Miss Piggy. However, Piggy and the Scrubs cast finally break the fourth wall, with the actors portraying themselves. In 2012, The final scene of the Cougar Town season 3 episode \\"A One Story Town\\" features an uncredited cameo by Braff as a pizza delivery boy, whom returning Scrubs character Ted Buckland recognizes as being physically identical to J.D. (alongside recognizing several other Cougar Town characters as resembling their actors' other Scrubs characters). In 2014, in the fifth season premiere of the NBC television comedy series Community, a narration by J.D. (Braff) from a ninth- season episode of Scrubs is used to provide a voice-over summary. Earlier in the episode, \\"Repilot\\", Braff is mentioned in reference to the unpopular ninth season of Scrubs, to which the characters involved mock for the appearance of Braff in a mere six episodes of the semi-reboot (which itself also served as a meta-commentary on the fact that Donald Glover would also only be appearing in five episodes of the similarly semi-rebooted Community).

It starred Herschel Bernardi, Sue Ane Langdon, and Roger Bowen. Bernardi played the title character, Arnie Nuvo, a longtime blue collar employee at the fictitious Continental Flange Company, who overnight was promoted to an executive position. The story lines mainly focused on this fish-out-of-water situation, and on Arnie's sometimes-problematic relationship with his well- meaning but wealthy and eccentric boss, Hamilton Majors Jr. (Bowen). Because he still held his union card, Arnie could negotiate tricky management/labor situations that no one else could. Arnie's surname was presumably a pun on nouveau riche (which his promotion effectively made him), and possibly also on Art Nouveau. In addition to Bernardi, Bowen, and Langdon (as Arnie's wife Lilian), cast members included Del Russel and Stephanie Steele as Arnie's son and daughter, Richard and Andrea; Elaine Shore as Arnie's secretary, Felicia; Herb Voland as sour-tempered vice-president Neil Ogilvie, and Tom Pedi as Arnie's loading dock friend, Julius. Olan Soule appeared occasionally as Fred Springer, another vice-president. In its first season, despite being the lead- in to The Mary Tyler Moore Show on Saturday nights and winning an Emmy nomination as best comedy series, Arnie received only fair Nielsen ratings. For its second season, in order to increase its viewership, CBS made a major cast change in the show's format. Dick Van Patten was dropped as the Nuvos' next door neighbor, and Charles Nelson Reilly joined the cast as Randy Robinson, a TV chef who called himself \\"The Giddyap Gourmet\\", apparently a reference to The Galloping Gourmet.http://www.tvacres.com/nick_g.htm, Retrieved 2009-03-28. Also, the network decided to move the show to Monday nights at 10:00 P.M. followed at 10:30 P.M. by a new sitcom that had debuted in January, 1971 on Tuesday nights to mediocre ratings, All In The Family. At the last minute, a switch was made and My Three Sons left its comfortable Saturday night time slot and took over the 10:00 P.M. slot on Mondays with Arnie slotted at 10:30 P.M. Both shows sank in the ratings. All In The Family was moved to Saturday nights at 8:00 P.M. where it became the number one show for five consecutive years. At mid-season, My Three Sons was moved to Thursday nights and Arnie returned to the Saturday night prime-time schedule. The changes did not help. Both shows were canceled at the end of the 1971‚Äì1972 season.

Dangard Ace is Matsumoto's only contribution to Japan's ubiquitous giant robot genre. Synopsis Danguard Ace takes place on a future Earth in which natural resources have been depleted. People have begun looking toward other planets to survive, in particular to the fictional tenth planet, Promete. Although people had hoped to peacefully settle there, disaster strikes as the first explorers are destroyed by betrayal. After this event, an individual named Mr. Doppler leaves toward Promete on his own ship and declares himself Chancellor of the planet. Using Promete's resources, Chancellor Doppler constructs a vast military force greater than that of Earth's. He forbids anyone from approaching the planet, under the insane belief that only he is entitled to it. To gain control of Promete, the governments of Earth begin constructing massive combat robots. Doppler is able to attack and destroy all of them before they are completed, except for Danguard Ace. The forces sent to attack Danguard's base were destroyed because of the efforts of Captain Dan. Nothing is known of this mysterious man, except that he previously served Doppler while under mind control. Takuma Ichimonji, son of the man who betrayed the initial Promete exploration team, becomes a cadet at Danguard's base. Ichimonji hopes that he might restore his father's honor by fighting against Doppler's forces. Production Some of the main character designs were similar to characters appearing in Space Battleship Yamato, which was known in the U.S. market as Star Blazers. The Takuma Ichimonji character resembles the Space Battleship Yamato character Susumu Kodai. The doctor on the show resembles Dr. Sakezo Sado from Space Battleship Yamato. International Release It was released in English three times, first by M&M; Productions under the title \\"The Planet Robot Danguard Ace\\" that saw limited release in Hawaii and The Philippines. The only remaining recording of this dub was a Story Record LP released in Japan. https://www.discogs.com/Isao-Sasaki-The-Planet-Robot-Danguard- Ace/release/7116769 It was then licensed and redubbed by Jim Terry Productions, as part of the Force Five promotion and was rereleased later by combined episodes into a feature-length presentation. This film edit gained a cult following on Showtime during the 1980s. The titular robot also had a leading role in Marvel Comics' Shogun Warriors series, as well as in the eponymous toy line. In 2009, William Winckler Productions produced three all- new English dubbed movie versions edited from the original series. Winckler, known for Tekkaman the Space Knight, wrote, produced and directed these films, which have been seen on broadband in Japan and a three volume DVD release in the United States. In the early 1980s, a French-dubbed version was released through Jacques Canestrier Productions entitled Danguard - La Conquete des Planetes. However, only the first volume of three episodes were released on VHS.. It was released in Hong Kong and Italy in 1978 and was the first anime ever broadcast on a private channel in Italy. http://www.antoniogenna.net/doppiaggio/anim/danguardace.htm It also saw a 1986 release in both South Korea and Taiwan.

This genre gained mainstream popularity during the 1990s, though the influences and roots of pop rap can trace back to late 1980s hip-hop artists such as Run DMC, LL Cool J, and Beastie Boys. The lyrics are often lighthearted, with choruses similar to those heard in pop music. Characteristics Allmusic describes pop-rap as \\"a marriage of hip-hop beats and raps with strong melodic hooks, which are usually featured as part of the chorus section in a standard pop-song structure\\". Pop rap also tends to have less aggressive lyrics than street- level rap music. However, some artists from the 1990s fused pop-rap with a more aggressive attitude to defuse backlash on their own accessibility. Music journalist Wilson McBee has strongly criticized pop-rap, \\"A pop rapper is assumed to be a sellout ‚Äì someone who has compromised artistic principles in order to fit commercial expectations. Or worse, it‚Äôs someone who never had any artistic principles to begin with, who‚Äôs guilty of bastardizing rap‚Äôs social and political traditions just to make money.\\" McBee also then went on saying \\"In labeling the likes of Flo Rida and others pop rappers, we blur the distinction between a 'pop rapper' and a rapper who is just really popular. Not every rapper who has a hit is automatically a sellout or deserving of the pop rap tag.\\" While some rappers from the 1990s with catchy hooks have been compared to pop music, McBee also said Pop-rap songs often have lyrical content similar to that in pop with themes such as love and relationships. History MC Hammer performing with Vanilla Ice in July 2009, who were both described as early pop-rap artists for blending rap music with catchy hooks. In the 1980s, rap artists including Run DMC, and LL Cool J set up the blueprints and origins of pop-rap as they suddenly broke into the mainstream. LL Cool J has been described as the very first \\"pop-rapper\\" in history, when he rose to prominence on his 1985 debut album Radio. MTV has described LL Cool J's 1987 single \\"I Need Love,\\" as \\"one of the first pop-rap crossover hits\\". Later, rap artists such as Tone Loc, Young MC, and Fresh Prince then made party tunes and used their storytelling abilities as they became popular. During the 1990s, pop rap began to expand even more as hip hop music also began to connect strongly with dance music and R&B.; In the early 1990s, MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice broke into the mainstream with songs like \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"Ice Ice Baby\\", respectively. They caused pop-rap to be \\"derided (and, occasionally, taken to court) for its willingness to borrow\\" from well-known hit singles. By the end of the 1990s and early 2000s rappers such as Ja Rule fused gangsta rap themes with 1980s pop and soul elements; pop-rap was dominated by many artists. It then went back into the mainstream with the success of The Black Eyed Peas who had smash singles such as \\"Where Is the Love?\\" which came off their Elephunk album. During the late 2000s and early 2010s, pop-rap had many artists such as Drake, will.i.am, Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa emerge.

Life Ehrenfried Pfeiffer began work with Rudolf Steiner in 1920 to develop and install special diffuse stage lighting for eurythmy performances on the stage of the first Goetheanum.Under Steiner's direction, Pfeiffer designed and constructed special diffuse stage lights, not concentrated by lenses, that would be suitable for eurythmy performances. He also designed and built a special lighting keyboard to allow the lights to be changed quickly and fluidly, a kind of \\"color piano\\". Pfeiffer, E., Autobiographical memoirs, cited in Barnes, H., Into the Heart's Land: A century of Rudolf Steiner's work in North America, 2005, pp. 232-233. After Steiner's death in 1925, Pfeiffer worked in the private research laboratory at the Goetheanum in Dornach, (Switzerland). He became manager and director of the experimental biodynamic Loverendale farm in Domburg in the Netherlands. This farm was set up to carry out some of the agricultural studies of the Goetheanum laboratory. The work of testing and developing Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course of 1924 was an international enterprise coordinated by Pfeiffer at the Natural Science Section of the Goetheanum.Paull, John (2011) \\"The secrets of Koberwitz: The diffusion of Rudolf Steiner‚Äôs Agriculture Course and the founding of Biodynamic Agriculture\\", Journal of Social Research & Policy, 2(1):19-29. Pfeiffer‚Äôs most influential book 'Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening' was published in 1938 simultaneously in at least five languages, English, German, Dutch, French, and Italian.Paull, John (2011) \\" Biodynamic Agriculture: The Journey from Koberwitz to the World, 1924-1938\\", Journal of Organic Systems, 6(1): 27-41. The following year, and just months before the outbreak of World War II, Pfeiffer ran Britain's first biodynamics conference, the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference, at the estate of Lord Northbourne in Kent.Paull, John (2011) \\"The Betteshanger Summer School: Missing link between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming\\", Journal of Organic Systems, 2011, 6(2):13-26. Pfeiffer's Betteshanger Conference is regarded as the 'missing link' between biodynamic agriculture and organic farming because the following year (1940) its host, Lord Northbourne, published his manifesto of organic farming 'Look to the Land' in which he coined the term 'organic farming'. Pfeiffer first visited the U.S. in 1933 to lecture to a group of anthroposophists at the Threefold Farm in Spring Valley, New York on biodynamic farming.Kevin Dann, Across the Great Border Fault: The naturalist myth in America, Rutgers University Press, 2000, His consulting was essential to the development of biodynamic agriculture in the U.S. Pfeiffer developed an analytical method using copper chloride crystallization and used this technique as a blood test for detecting cancer.\\"Cancer Progress\\", Time Magazine, September 25, 1939. Reprint copy As a result, Pfeiffer was invited to the U.S. in 1937 to work at the Hahnemann Medical College in PhiladelphiaNaomi Rogers, An Alternative Path: The Making and Remaking of Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital of Philadelphia, Rutgers University Press, 1998, , p. 200. While in the U.S., he continued to consult with those interested in biodynamic farming and helped to form the Biodynamic Farming & Gardening Association in 1938. in 1940 he immigrated to the U.S. from Switzerland with his wife Adelheid, escaping the advance of German troops into France. They brought with them their son Christoph and daughter Wiltraud. With the advent of World War II in Europe, Pfeiffer took his family to Kimberton, Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia), where Alaric Myrin offered Pfeiffer the opportunity to create a model biodynamic farm and training program. Starting in the late 1930s he taught biodynamic farming and gardening at the Kimberton Farm School. One of his students, Paul Keene, who worked and studied with Pfeiffer there for two years and shortly thereafter co-founded Walnut Acres, recalls: \\"... he helped bring all of life together for us in a definite coherent pattern\\" DeLoach, Ethyl. 1961. \\"The story of Walnut Acres. Natural Food and Farming (Atlanta, Texas) 8(5):12-13, 34-36. Oct. While at Kimberton, Pfeiffer led the initiative to found the Biodynamic Farming and Gardening Association, and to start its journal. While at Kimberton, Pfeiffer also met J. I. Rodale, founder of Organic Gardening and Farming magazine, and of the organic movement in the USA. This relationship gave biodynamics a little-known place in the history of the American organic movement. Interpersonal difficulties - a motif of Pfeiffer's life - brought to a close the Kimberton Farms chapter.http://www.pfeiffercenter.org Aiming to continue his work training biodynamic farmers, Pfeiffer bought a farm in Chester, New York, where a small colony arose focused on farming, education, and the administration of the Biodynamic Association. His copper chloride sensitive crystallization theory brought him an honorary degree of Doctor of Medicine from Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital in Philadelphia in 1939. He studied chemistry and became a professor of nutrition in 1956.Andrew Lorand, Biodynamic Agriculture ‚Äî A paradigmatic analysis, Ph.D. thesis, Pennsylvania State University, 1996. Pfeiffer wrote on the dangers of pesticides and DDT and Rachel Carson consulted with him when she was writing Silent Spring.Paull, John (2013) The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring, SAGE Open, 3 (July):1-12. In 1961, at his home in Spring Valley, N.Y., he suffered from a series of heart attacks, lingering for several days, but ultimately was not given the proper medical care and died. His wife subsequently took over the operation of their farm in Chester, New York. Work Pfeiffer was a pioneer of biodynamic agriculture in Europe, Britain, and America. He is most widely known for his innovative work in composting. He conducted extensive research on the preparation and use of biodynamic compost and was the inventor of BD Compost Starter, a compost inoculant.Steve Diver, Biodynamic Farming & Compost Preparation, Alternative Farming Systems Guide: ATTRA, February 1999. Document text For many years Pfeiffer served as a compost consultant to municipal compost facilities, most notably Oakland, California,A. W. Martinez, \\"The City With Golden Garbage\\", Collier's Weekly Magazine, May 31, 1952. Reprint copy as well as countries in the Caribbean, Europe, and the Far East. A technical difficulty with the resulting compost, that it would not spread readily with the commonly used fertilizer spreader, could not be overcome and the project ultimately failed. Pfeiffer invented two anthroposophic Image forming methods, a method using a round filter chromatography (circular chromatography or chroma test) and the copper chloride crystallization method, developed together with Erika Sabarth. In the latter method, a solution of copper chloride and the test solution is allowed to evaporate. The pattern of the copper chloride crystals can be \\"read\\" based on the patterns of known samples. Similarly, the patterns of the circular chromatographs can be \\"read\\" based on known samples. Both methods require much practice to \\"read\\" and interpret the images. Honorary degree Pfeiffer's work at Hahnemann earned him an honorary Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital of Philadelphia on June 8, 1939 at the 91st Commencement ceremony.Personal communication from Irvin Miller, archivist of Hahnemann papers at Drexel. According to the minutes of the Board of Trustees on January 27, 1939, he was approved to receive an honorary M.D. at the June commencement.

Two polymeric forms are known, as well as a monomeric derivative that exists in the gas phase. Because the polymers convert to the gaseous form at mild temperatures, uranium borohydride once attracted much attention. It is solid green. Structure It is a homoleptic coordination complex with borohydride (also called tetrahydroborate). These anions can serve as bidentate (Œ∫2-BH4‚àí) bridges between two uranium atoms or as tridentate ligands (Œ∫3-BH4‚àí) on single uranium atoms. In the solid state, a polymeric form exists that has a 14-coordinate structure with two tridentate terminal groups and four bidentate bridging groups. Gaseous features a monomeric 12-coordinate uranium, with four Œ∫3-BH4‚àí ligands, which envelop the metal, conferring volatility. Ball-and-stick model of one of two forms of polymeric U(BH4)4. Preparation This compound was first prepared by treating uranium tetrafluoride with aluminium borohydride: : UF4 \\\\+ 2 Al(BH4)3 ‚Üí U(BH4)4 \\\\+ 2 Al(BH4)F2 It may also be prepared by the solid-state reaction of uranium tetrachloride with lithium borohydride: :UCl4 \\\\+ 4 LiBH4 ‚Üí U(BH4)4 \\\\+ 4 LiCl Although solid U(BH4)4 is a polymer, it undergoes cracking, converting to the monomer. The related methylborohydride complex U(BH3CH3)4 is monomeric as a solid and hence more volatile. History During the Manhattan Project, the need arose to find volatile compounds of uranium suitable for use in the diffusion separation of uranium isotopes. Uranium borohydride is, after uranium hexafluoride, the most volatile compound of uranium known with a vapor pressure of at 60 ¬∞C. Uranium borohydride was discovered by Hermann Irving Schlesinger and Herbert C. Brown, who also discovered sodium borohydride. Uranium hexafluoride is corrosive, which led to serious consideration of the borohydride. However, by the time the synthesis method was finalized, the problems related to uranium hexafluoride were solved. Borohydrides are nonideal ligands for isotope separations, since there are isotopes of boron that occur naturally in high abundance: 10B (20%) and 11B (80%), while fluorine-19 is the only isotope of fluorine that occurs in nature in more than trace quantities.

It can be made or obtained in the laboratory by the actions of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) on antimony sulfide. The compound is reddish brown in color and described as a velvety powder which is insoluble in water. It was used extensively in the medical field until the general use of antimony compounds declined due to toxic effects. History and Uses The name is derived from the word kermes as denoting the compound‚Äôs red color. The origins of the term is from the French kerm√®s, which is short for alkerm√®s, from the Arabic al-qirmiz a reference to crimson dye made from the bodies of insects (see Kermes (dye)). It was also known as poudre des Chartreux from a story of how it saved the life of a Carthusian monk in 1714. Because of its reputation as a medication and heal-all (or panacea), the formula and production process for Kermes mineral was purchased by the French government in 1720. Used for centuries in medicine as a health treatment, diaphoretic (causing sweat), anti-inflammatory and emetic it was used through the 19th century and its use extended to epilepsy treatment in addition to hectic fever.

Year is centred on six first-year students of magic, in relation to the administration and teachers, their families and studies, and each other. A review in Publishers Weekly called it a \\"boisterous spoof of the campus novel\\"; another in Booklist said that it continues \\"Jones' spoof of traditional fantasy conventions\\".Front endpapers of the first U.S. paperback edition (Harper Trophy, 2001). Plot background The Year is set in a fantasy world several years after the end of its domination by commercial tourism from our world. The University formerly produced large numbers of competent wizards who served as tour guides; current staff aims to produce competent wizards who gradually repair the damage caused by tours. It suffers financially because tuition demand is down, which greatly concerns the faculty, and educationally from its long practical focus, which barely concerns the few who have noticed. The head, wizard Corkoran, is obsessed with becoming the first man to visit the moon and devotes much time to that, but there is little research or innovation generally. The senior wizards have all retired; the middle-age and young know of no other way. Wizard Corkoran has selected children from wealthy families to fill his own first-year tutorial, hoping that a current appeal for donations will be fruitful. His class turns out to be unusual in other respects too. All six are talented, some in ways they do not yet understand, some encumbered by jinxes. Not one of the families is likely to donate because they have status rather than money, or their fortunes have recently slumped, or their children are here with grudging permission or none. Prince Lukin's father has not permitted him to be at the University, and his kingdom is also very poor; Ruskin is an escaped artisan dwarf, which is the third lowest and here to receive an education so the unjust ranking system can be overthrown; Felim ben Felim is a member of the royal family of Ampersand, whose Emir has vowed to send assassins if he is to attend; and Claudia, the half-sister of Emperor Titus, is here partially hiding from the Senate, who despise her for being half Marsh. Evidently, only one is personally wealthy, the beautiful Olga who does not divulge her name or even her region. Elda is the youngest daughter of Derk, the final Dark Lord before the revolution and head of a most important family now. But she is a griffin, appearing at first glance to be frightening and inscrutable, and her father does not approve of university education. The classmates quickly become fast friends, and two soon fall in love. They form common opinions of their teachers and courses, and undertake together some undirected extracurricular study. They all run afoul of Wizard Wermacht, a domineering man who teaches multiple subjects in a routine fashion. When Derk visits Elda, he has half a mind to take her home, but actually gives them a reading list strong in magical theory, especially the work of university founder Policant. Educationally that is a success although it does not help their grades. Every other visit from home is a crisis for the classmates and often for the entire university. From the east a royal family sends seven assassins. Two Imperial Senators and a cluster of ruling class dwarves bring political and economic pressures. Olga's father proves to be the pirate of the Inland Sea. Two royalties arrive leading armies. Prince Lukin trades Ruskin to be his \\"servant\\" for the Book of Truth, which Olga had stolen from her father when she fled from an arranged marriage, and from which lies disappear. The Senators are arrested by Emperor Titus. Eventually, the three more powerful and mature of Elda's six siblings get involved, human brother Blade and griffins Kit and Callette. Chancellor Querida also returns, the former University head who plotted successfully against the tourist industry. Jointly with a few others they secure the University and set it on the right track. Characters ;Classmates Six new students take Corkoran's tutorial and other first-year courses together. No other students are important. * Elda is a griffin and the youngest daughter of human wizard Derk. She is much bigger than other university residents although not yet grown up. * Felim is a brother of the Emir who rules far to the east. By purpose he is a scholar or inventor, not a member of the ruling family. His is the longest running family crisis of the year and to protect him magically from professional assassins the classmates undertake their most important program of self-study. *Ruskin is an adult male dwarf from a fastness in the Central Peaks. He is a runaway slave from the ruling perspective but the chosen representative of his own low caste and others, for magical training at the University, eventually to help overthrow the system. *Olga is a human woman, exceptionally beautiful, intelligent, and rich but keeps her background secret. After years working on board her father's ship, she happily arises at five and she is a find for the school rowing team. She can talk to elementals. *Lukin is the Crown Prince of Luteria, a poor kingdom whose father King Luther forbade him to go study. As a magic-user he suffers from a jinx. *Claudia is a teenage girl, the younger sister Titus, a young Emperor of the South. She suffers from another jinx and is half-Marsh. Staff at the University ‚Äì *Wizard Corkoran ‚Äì The friends tutor at the University, and Head of it. He likes to wear colourful ties, and his aim is to be the first man on the moon. He spends most of his time working on his moon studies, to the point of neglecting the actual University. He is also very bad with money. *Wizard Wermacht ‚Äì The teacher at the University who takes most of the first-year classes, and also the youngest. He is nasty, strict, and dislikes Elda, Lukin and the others. He particularly dislikes Lukin, after he made the bad mistake on the first day of opening a seemingly bottomless pit in the floor of Wermacht's classroom. The word Wehrmacht, whence apparently derives his name, is the German title for Nazi Germany's unified armed forces. This derivation fits the character of a man who adheres to an inflexible and narrow-minded program of teaching and treats with overbearing nastiness those who seem weak or stand out for their differences. Before learning the divinely-selected but unassuming Wizard Derk's identity, Wermacht insults him and then ejects him from the courtyard. Those suffering from imperfections in the form of jinxes like Claudia and Lukin, meet his ire. Ruskin's identity as a dwarf draws Wermacht's wrath from the first day of class and he refers to Elda as \\"a monster.\\" Outside the University ‚Äì *Wizard Derk: A wizard specialising in genetics, especially the creation of new animals. Shona, Kit, Blade, Callette, Lydda, Elda, Angelo, and Florence's father. *Querida ‚Äì One of the most powerful wizards in the world, High Chancellor of the University. However, she leaves the day-to-day running of things to Corkoran, a mistake which she later regrets. *King Luther ‚Äì King of Luteria. He is not a particularly pleasant person, and treats his sons and daughters as if they were little children, even though they are practically adults already. He forbade Lukin to go to the University. *Emperor Titus ‚Äì Emperor of the South, and Claudia's half-brother. He is the only person who really liked Claudia when she was small and was kind to her. He has been at war with King Luther for a very long time. *Flurian Atreck ‚Äì A griffin from the other continent known as Flury. He is one of the four most powerful wizards in the world, and takes over teaching most of Wermacht's classes when Wermacht, for many long and complicated reasons, gets turned into a bar stool.

It is at mile 185 on Amtrak's Illinois and Missouri Route. As of 2007, it is served by five daily round trips each way: the daily Texas Eagle, and four daily Lincoln Service frequencies. History The station building in 2005 The station was originally constructed by the Chicago and Alton Railroad in 1895 and is one of three historic railroad stations still existing in the city, along with the Lincoln Depot built by the Great Western Railroad in 1852 and Springfield Union Station built by the Illinois Central Railroad in 1898. Prior to the start up of Amtrak on May 1, 1971 it was operated by a successor company, the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad, and was served by a variety of named trains, including the Alton Limited, the Abraham Lincoln, and the Midnight Special. Springfield was intended to be the southwestern terminus of the State House, predecessor of today's Lincoln Service. However, Amtrak extended this train to St. Louis at its own expense because the Chicago and Alton/GM&O; station was not designed to turn trainsets around. Louis Grell mural in railroad station. The passenger station is decorated with a small mural. Painted on the wall atop the ticket office, the mural features a route map of the post-1947 Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad and the state seals of Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. The mural is the work of Louis Grell of Chicago. Springfield is applying for federal grant money to construct a new transportation hub building that could bring together Amtrak and local bus service. Estimates of the cost of this project, published in February 2007, ranged from $13 to $18 million,Tim Landis, \\"Planning Mode: Transportation hub could be built for $14m-$18m\\", \\"State Journal Register\\", February 3, 2007 but this was a decrease from an earlier estimate of $50.0 million.All aboard? by Kurt Erickson - Illinois Issues One reason for the discrepancies is uncertainty over whether to try to accomplish a major relocation of railroad tracks that pass through downtown Springfield; the tracks have served the downtown area since the time of Abraham Lincoln. In a 2010-2011 project, authorities supervised the railroad station's comprehensive refurbishment. Overhauled elements included the GM&O; mural, trackside landscaping, passenger seating, handicapped accessibility, parking lot repaving and a new station roof. The $714,500 project was financed by the city and Amtrak. Springfield used $571,500 obtained through the Central Area Tax Increment Financing (TIF) district that covers much of the downtown. Other stakeholders involved in the renovation included Union Pacific Railroad, which owns the track and platform, and the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, which reviewed project plans to ensure that the station's historic elements were preserved.Great American Stations.

SLAP is an acronym for \\"superior labral tear from anterior to posterior\\". Symptoms Several symptoms are common but not specific: *Dull, throbbing, ache in the joint which can be brought on by very strenuous exertion or simple household chores. *Difficulty sleeping due to shoulder discomfort. The SLAP lesion decreases the stability of the joint which, when combined with lying in bed, causes the shoulder to drop. *For an athlete involved in a throwing sport such as baseball, pain and a catching feeling are prevalent. Throwing athletes may also complain of a loss of strength or significant decreased velocity in throwing. *Any applied force overhead or pushing directly into the shoulder can result in impingement and catching sensations. Anatomical mechanism The shoulder joint is a \\"ball-and-socket\\" joint. However, the 'socket' (the glenoid fossa of the scapula) is small, covering at most only a third of the 'ball' (the head of the humerus). It is deepened by a circumferential rim of fibrocartilage, the glenoidal labrum. Previously there was debate as to whether the labrum was fibrocartilaginous as opposed to hyaline cartilage found in the remainder of the glenoid fossa. Previously, it was considered a redundant, evolutionary remnant, but is now considered integral to shoulder stability. Most agree that the proximal tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle becomes fibrocartilaginous prior to attaching to the superior aspect of the glenoid. The long head of the triceps brachii inserts inferiorly, similarly. Together, all of those cartilaginous extensions are termed the 'glenoid labrum'. A SLAP tear or lesion occurs when there is damage to the superior (uppermost) area of the labrum. These lesions have come into public awareness because of their frequency in athletes involved in overhead and throwing activities in turn relating to relatively recent description of labral injuries in throwing athletes, and initial definitions of the 4 (major) SLAP sub-types, all happening since the 1990s. The identification and treatment of these injuries continues to evolve. Diagnosis=Sub-types Twelve varieties of SLAP lesion have been described, with initial diagnosis by MRI or arthrography and confirmation by direct arthroscopy. * Type I - 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock. Fraying of the superior labrum, though it remains firmly attached to the glenoid rim. * Type II - 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock. Tear of biceps labral complex **Type IIa - 11 o'clock to 3 o'clock. Primarily anterior. **Type IIb - 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock. Primarily posterior. **Type IIc - 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock. Combined anterior and posterior. * Type III - 11 o'clock to 3 o'clock. Bucket-handle tears of the superior portion of the labrum without involvement of the biceps brachii (long head) attachment. * Type IV - 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock. Bucket-handle tears of the superior portion of the labrum extending into the biceps tendon. * Type V - 11 o'clock to 5 o'clock. Anteroinferior Bankart lesion that extends upward to include a separation of the biceps tendon. * Type VI - 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock. Unstable radial flap tears associated with separation of the biceps anchor. * Type VII - 11 o'clock to 3 o'clock. Anterior extension of the SLAP lesion beneath the middle glenohumeral ligament. * Type VIII - 7 o'clock to 1 o'clock. Extension into posterior labrum, more extension than type IIb. * Type IX - 7 o'clock to 5 o'clock. Circumferentially abnormal labrum. * Type X - 11 o'clock to at least 1 o'clock. Extension into rotator cuff interval. * Type XI - Extends into superior glenohumeral ligament * Type XII - Superior labrum anterior cuff lesion Treatment There is evidence in literature to support both surgical and non-surgical forms of treatment. In some, physical therapy can strengthen the supporting muscles in the shoulder joint to the point of reestablishing stability. Surgical treatment of SLAP tears has become more common in recent years. The success rate for repairing isolated SLAP tears is reported between 74-94%. While surgery can be performed as a traditional open procedure, an arthroscopic technique is currently favored being less intrusive with low chance of iatrogenic infection. SLAP Tear Repair of SLAP Tear Repair of SLAP tear Associated findings within the shoulder joint are varied, may not be predictable and include: * SLAP lesion ‚Äì labrum/glenoid separation at the tendon of the biceps muscle * Bankart lesion ‚Äì labrum/glenoid separation at the inferior glenohumeral ligament * Biceps Tendon - exclusion of pulley injury * Bone ‚Äì glenoid, humerus ‚Äî injury or degenerative change involving joint surface * Anatomical variants ‚Äî sublabral foramen, Buford Complex (these are important to differentiate, as operating on them can lead to iatrogenic stiffness) Although good outcomes with SLAP repair over the age of 40 are reported, both age greater than 40 and Workmen's Compensation status have been noted as independent predictors of surgical complications. This is particularly so if there is an associated rotator cuff injury. In such circumstances, it is suggested that labral debridement and biceps tenotomy is preferred. SLAP (Superior Labral Tear, Anterior to Posterior) * Type 1 * Fraying of Superior Labrum * Biceps Anchor Intact * Type 2 * Superior Labrum detached * Detachment of the Biceps Anchor * Type 3 * Bucket Handle type tear of Superior Labrum * Biceps Anchor INTACT * Type 4 * Bucket Handle tear of Superior Labrum * Extension of tear in Biceps Tendon * Part of Biceps Anchor still INTACT  Procedure  Arthroscopic SLAP Lesion (type 2) repair Following inspection and determination of the extent of injury, the basic labrum repair is as follows. * The glenoid and labrum are roughened to increase contact surface area and promote re-growth. * Locations for the bone anchors are selected based on number and severity of tear. A severe tear involving both SLAP and Bankart lesions may require seven anchors. Simple tears may only require one. * The glenoid is drilled for the anchor implantation. * Anchors are inserted in the glenoid. * The suture component of the implant is tied through the labrum and knotted such that the labrum is in tight contact with the glenoid surface. Surgical rehabilitation Surgical rehabilitation is vital, progressive and supervised. The first phase focuses on early motion and usually occupies post-surgical weeks one through three. Passive range of motion is restored in the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist joints. However, while manual resistance exercises for scapular protraction, elbow extension, and pronation and supination are encouraged, elbow flexion resistance is avoided because of the biceps contraction that it generates and the need to protect the labral repair for at least six weeks. A sling may be worn, as needed, for comfort. Phase 2, occupying weeks 4 through 6, involves progression of strength and range of motion, attempting to achieve progressive abduction and external rotation in the shoulder joint. Phase 3, usually weeks 6 through 10, permits elbow flexion resistive exercises, now allowing the biceps to come into play on the assumption that the labrum will have healed sufficiently to avoid injury. Thereafter, isokinetic exercises may be commenced from weeks 10 through 12 to 16, for advanced strengthening leading to return to full activity based on post surgical evaluation, strength, and functional range of motion. The periods of isokinetics through final clearance are sometimes referred to as phases four and five.

Vigilantism The town first experienced this problem in early 2015. After a stray of robberies within the small community the police seemed powerless to stop these crimes from being carried out. A group known as \\"Blood Brothers\\" were seen taking matters into their own hands. The group soon started going through the streets at night in an effort to stop the robberies. After a month or so they apprehended the robbers, who were later discovered to be members of the Gang 77. The after effects of this also led to the capture of their leader, which was confirmed by the police in 2017.http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2017/07/06/igp-confirms-arrest- gang-77-leader References Category:Towns in Selangor ","title":"Taman Melawati"},{"id":"4440109","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1952 in Australia.

Solar was laid down on 22 February 1943, by the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 29 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Regina Solar; and commissioned at Philadelphia on 15 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander Hadlai A. Hull, United States Naval Reserve, in command. The ship was destroyed by an accidental explosion on 30 April 1946. Naming The ship was named after Adolfo Solar, who was born on 8 May 1900 in San Antonio, Tex. On 1 June 1922, he enlisted in the Navy as a seaman second class at Houston, Texas, and he served four consecutive enlistments on the battleship before signing up for a fifth time and serving aboard the battleship . Boatswain's Mate First Class Solar was on board the Nevada on the morning of December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He was credited with \\"... the early opening of fire by antiaircraft battery of the USS Nevada prior to the arrival of the battery officers at their stations, and thereafter controlling his gun in an outstanding manner until killed by shell fragments.\\" He was posthumously commended by the Secretary of the Navy. Service history=World War II Solar completed post-commissioning trials in the Delaware River and shakedown training in the Bermuda area; then returned to Philadelphia at the beginning of April 1944. After post-shakedown availability, she headed for Casco Bay, Maine, for more training. On 25 April, Solar put to sea from New York City with Task Group 27.1 in the screen of a Casablanca-bound convoy. The convoy made Casablanca on 4 May; and, three days later Solar headed back toward the United States. She arrived in New York on 16 May. Solar was next assigned to Task Force 64, and spent the next six months escorting three convoys from the United States to the Mediterranean and back. On 16 December 1944, the destroyer escort was assigned to the Commander, Operational Training Command, Atlantic Fleet (COTCLANT), to help train destroyer and destroyer-escort crews. On 2 February 1945, she resumed Atlantic convoy escort duty as an element of TG 60.9. On her first voyage of this new assignment, Solar encountered her first combat, though she herself was unable to engage the enemy submarines. Her convoy, UGS-72, lost two tankers at the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. Solar fueled and provisioned at Oran, Algeria; then escorted convoy GUS-74 to the United States. After yard work at New York, she got underway in the screen of another Gibraltar-bound convoy. During the return voyage from Oran with convoy GUS-86, the ship received the news of Allied victory in Europe. Upon her return to the United States, Solar was scheduled for her usual yard period in New York. However, after several sets of confusing and sometimes contradictory orders, the work was carried out in Boston. Post- war In the spring of 1945, Solar was slated to be converted to a radar picket ship by the Philadelphia Navy Yard, but the yard was unable to work on her. Instead, she was assigned to training duty with submarines out of New London, Connecticut. By 18 July, she was in the Boston Navy Yard preparing for duty in the Pacific. Her conversion to radar picket ship had been canceled and, with the declaration of V-J day in mid-August, her orders were changed again. She departed Boston on 7 September, for two weeks of refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. At the completion of refresher training, she headed for Casco Bay; but, en route there, she was diverted to Miami, Florida, where she became the training group flagship. In late October, she visited Baltimore for the Navy Day celebration. On 19 December, Solar was assigned to the Commander, Operational Development Force, for anti-aircraft and fighter director practice. The beginning of 1946 brought an assignment as a sonar test ship. Destruction by accidental explosion On 30 April 1946, Solar was berthed at Leonardo Pier I of the Naval Ammunition Depot Earle, New Jersey, to discharge ammunition. The operation went smoothly until, shortly after 11:30, one of the crewmen dropped a hedgehog charge. (\\"The United Press quoted witnesses as saying a shell being passed by Seaman Joseph Stuckinski of Baltimore from the ship to a truck on the pier exploded in his arms and set off the blasts. Stuckinski was not injured.\\")Associated Press, \\"Five Lost, 150 Hurt in Blasts‚ÄîDestroyer Escort Shattered at Pier\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 1 May 1946, Volume 52, page 1. He was able to escape with relatively minor injuries, but three ensuing explosions blasted the ship near her number 2 upper handling rooms. Her number 2 gun was demolished and the bridge, main battery director, and mast were all blown aft and to starboard. Both sides of the ship were torn open, and her deck was a mass of flames. The order to abandon ship came after the second explosion and was carried out expeditiously. Nevertheless, the tragedy claimed the lives of seven sailors and injured 125 others.http://www.desausa.org/de_photo_library/uss_solar_de_221_5.htm Salvage work on Solar was begun by 15:00, and her wrecked superstructure was cut off to prevent her from capsizing. She was moved to New York, where she decommissioned on 21 May 1946. Solar was then stripped of all usable equipment, towed to sea, and sunk on 9 June 1946, in of water. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 5 June 1946.

Filming began in December 2005, and the film was released in July 2008. It was Jakubisko's first English- language film and an international co-production between the cinemas of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and the United Kingdom. Plot The film is based on the story of Erzs√©bet Bathory, a Hungarian countess in the 16th and 17th centuries. Her story takes place in a part of the Kingdom of Hungary that is now Slovakia. In this retelling, the Countess is a healer who conducts medical experiments and rudimentary autopsies in a \\"hospital\\" beneath her castle. She forms a relationship with a reputed witch, Darvulia, who saves her from poisoning. The witch promises Erzsebet a son and eternal beauty. In return, Erzsebet must sacrifice both love and her reputation. Darvulia becomes Erzsebet's companion. Meanwhile, maidens in the area have been dying of seemingly unrelated causes, and Erzsebet is seen bathing in a large tub of red liquid as the girls' now-mutilated corpses are buried nearby. Two monks later conclude that the water is not blood but is simply colored red by herbs. After her husband Ferenc N√°dasdy's death, Erzs√©bet quarrels with his scheming friend Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥, who tries to proposition her at her husband's funeral. Thurzo's lover, who is gifted with herbs, offers to help him get revenge for the rejection. Soon afterward, Erzsebet begins to have surreal visions and episodes. In one of these, she stabs a woman to death with scissors. Afterwards, she confesses to Darvulia that she can no longer tell dream from reality. Darvulia discovers that someone has been placing hallucinogenic mushrooms in Erzs√©bet's drinks; Erzs√©bet cannot remember clearly and believes Darvulia responsible. She has the woman thrown out. Thurz√≥ and his wife then capture Darvulia and torture her, cutting out her tongue. Before she dies, she writes Thurz√≥'s name in blood on her cell wall. Erzs√©bet swears vengeance on him. Thurz√≥ enlists Erzs√©bet's sons-in-law and other allies to prosecute her for witchcraft. When their plans repeatedly fail, they nonetheless capture the Countess and torture members of her household to try to obtain incriminating information. The servants are then executed for their alleged crimes, and Erzs√©bet is imprisoned. Despairing over her separation from her son, she lies on her bed and begins to sing a hymn; the flames from her candles rise and engulf her in flames. Upon hearing of her death, Thurzo concedes that she has once again made the move he least expected, as when they once played chess together, and admits that he has always loved her. CastProduction Juraj Jakubisko declared in an interview: Casting In late January 2006, Famke Janssen was announced to play B√°thory, and her photos with Jakubisko showed up in the media.

He was one of the youngest people ever to join the Writers Guild of America, writing for television at the age of fifteen. He is a \\"script doctor\\" for feature films. Early years Spencer, at the age of fourteen, snuck into Twentieth Century Fox Studios and onto the set of Young Frankenstein to watch his hero Mel Brooks direct. Marty Feldman, who had a fondness for mischief, recognized that the young interloper did not belong and took Spencer under his wing as his \\"guest.\\"It's Good To Be The King: The Seriously Funny Life Of Mel Brooks by James Robert Parrish Spencer was a huge fan of Feldman's and knew the comedian's writing credits for British television, a rarity, as most Americans were not well versed in Feldman's versatility, and the normally private Feldman recognized Spencer as a kindred spirit. Feldman had also begun writing at the young age of fifteen and gave Spencer early guidance. Marty Feldman later died of a heart attack while making the film Yellowbeard and on May 16, 1984 Alan Spencer lost another friend: the legendary and offbeat comedian Andy Kaufman. Kaufman once invited Spencer over to his home and subjected him to a marathon of forty eight hours of The People's Court, a series that Kaufman religiously recorded.Bill Zehme, Lost in the Funhouse: The Life and Mind of Andy Kaufman The one-two punch of losing both his friends devastated Spencer. He vowed to honor their influences and do unconventional work. In 1988, Mel Brooks tapped Spencer to co-create the short-lived NBC sitcom The Nutt House with him after the success of Spencer's Sledge Hammer! Brooks had no idea that Alan Spencer was the same young kid who had been buzzing around the set of Young Frankenstein. After his series Sledge Hammer! found international success in syndication, Spencer was tapped to write and direct his own film for Columbia Pictures called Hexed. Spencer wasn't accorded the same level of creative control he had on his signature series and, thanks to a subsequent regime change at the studio, the film was recut after a handful of successful previews. The DVD release of Hexed is not the original director's cut which Spencer claims \\"probably only exists in a dumpster outside Denny's.\\" Despite being called one of \\"the nation's nobler madcaps\\" by Washington Post critic Tom Shales, Spencer has a serious side as well. He wrote a two-hour science fiction made-for-TV movie entitled The Tomorrow Man starring Julian Sands that had an ecological theme. Present day According to the magazine Creative Screenwriting, Spencer has anonymously rewritten a few films that have grossed over one hundred million and his prowess has actually gotten more than one film greenlit. He was profiled in an article entitled \\"The Craft of Rewriting\\" alongside such notables as Scott Frank, Kenneth Lonergan and Ed Solomon as being one of the best \\"script doctors\\" in the business. Spencer has stated that being included in that company was a career highlight. Spencer created and is producing the controversial comedic action thriller television series Bullet in the Face for IFC/Just for Laughs.

F. Schumacher's Small Is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered (1973). Proponents argue for \\"persons-first\\" economic theories as opposed to mainstream economic theories which are understood as often emphasizing financial gain over human well-being. In particular, the overly abstract human image implicit in mainstream economics is critically analyzed and instead it attempts a rethinking of economic principles, policies and institutions based on a richer and more balanced view of human nature. Overview Humanistic economics can be described as a perspective that imbues elements of humanistic psychology, moral philosophy, political science, sociology and common sense into traditional economic thought. Or, to define it more formally, contemporary humanistic economics seeks to: # describe, analyze and critically assess prevailing socio-economic institutions and policies # provide normative (value) guidelines on how to improve them in terms of human (not merely \\"economic\\") well-being In the process, basic human needs, human rights, human dignity, community, cooperation, economic democracy and economic sustainability provide the framework. At its foundation, humanistic economics seeks to replace atomistic economic man with a more holistic human image. One approach is broadly based on Abraham Maslow‚Äôs humanistic psychology.http://www.humanisticeconomics.net/general.htm Characteristic elements According to Mark A. Lutz, five characteristic elements of humanistic economics can be summarized as follows:M. Lutz, Economics for the Common Good, New York: Routledge, 1999 * A history that goes back two centuries and starts with the new political economy of J.C.L. Simonde de Sismondi and extends to E.F. Schumacher and beyond. * A critique of contemporary micro- and macroeconomic theories, particularly those relating to efficiency, equality, agency, motivation, work, unemployment, comparative advantage, globalization, ecology, social accounting and macroeconomic stability. * A critical analysis of socio-economic institutions, including property, corporate power, the workplace, and the global institutions governing international trade and finance. * A normative analysis based on human dignity and basic rights that addresses issues of poverty amidst plenty, economic democracy, ecological sustainability and socio-economic development. * A realist philosophical discourse opposed to all kinds of nominalism, relativism, scientific positivism, and post-modernism.

It stars Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery, Clancy Brown, and Roxanne Hart. The film chronicles the climax of an ages-old war between immortal warriors, depicted through interwoven past and present-day storylines. Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert) is born in the Scottish Highlands in the 16th century. After reviving from a fatal wound, MacLeod is found by swordsman Ram√≠rez (Sean Connery) who explains they and others were born immortal, invincible unless beheaded. Immortals wage a secret war, fighting each other until the last few remaining will meet at the Gathering to fight for the Prize. In 1985, the Gathering is finally happening in New York City and MacLeod must make sure the Prize is not won by his oldest enemy, the murderous Kurgan (Clancy Brown). Highlander enjoyed little success on its initial theatrical release, grossing over $12 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million, and received mixed reviews. Nevertheless, it became a cult film and inspired film sequels and television spin-offs. The tagline, \\"There can be only one\\", has carried on into pop culture. Plot In 1985, Connor MacLeod is confronted by an old enemy, Iman Fasil, in the parking garage of Madison Square Garden. After a sword duel, MacLeod beheads Fasil and experiences the Quickening‚Äîthe result of a one immortal killing another‚Äî a powerful energy release that affects the immediate surroundings, destroying many cars. After Connor hides his sword in the garage's ceiling, NYPD officers detain him for murder, later releasing him due to lack of evidence. Connor's history is revealed through a series of flashbacks. In the Scottish Highlands in 1536, Connor is about to enter his first battle as the Fraser Clan is at war with the MacLeod Clan. The Frasers are aided by the Kurgan (the last of the Kurgan tribes) in exchange for his right to slay Connor. In battle, the Kurgan stabs Connor fatally, but is driven off before he can decapitate him. Connor makes a complete recovery and is accused of witchcraft. The clan wishes to kill him, but chieftain Angus mercifully exiles him. Banished, he wanders the highlands, becoming a blacksmith and marrying a woman named Heather. Don Juan S√°nchez-Villalobos Ram√≠rez, recently of Spain but originally Egyptian, finds Connor after tracking his old foe the Kurgan to Scotland. He explains that he, Connor, the Kurgan and others were born immortals and are destined to battle each other, save on \\"holy ground.\\" When only a few are left, they will be drawn to \\"a faraway land\\" for the Gathering and battle for the Prize, the power of all the immortals through time. MacLeod only wants a quiet life, having a family with Heather. Ram√≠rez reveals that immortals cannot have children and believes they must ensure evil people like the Kurgan do not win the Prize, or else humanity will suffer an eternity of darkness. Ramirez then explains the overriding belief of all immortals: \\"In the end, there can be only one\\". Ram√≠rez trains MacLeod and the two become friends. One night, while Connor is away hunting, the Kurgan finds and duels Ram√≠rez, who warns him MacLeod is now ready for him. The Kurgan kills Ramirez and leaves the area. Years later, Heather dies of old age, prompting Connor to wander Earth. He adopts Ram√≠rez's katana sword as his own, a unique weapon made by a Japanese \\"genius\\" in 593 BC. In 1985, it is the time of the Gathering, and the Kurgan is compelled to come to New York, where Connor now lives as an antique dealer under the alias \\"Russell Nash,\\" working with his confidant Rachel Ellenstein. The director's cut reveals Rachel is MacLeod's adopted daughter, a child he rescued from Nazis during World War II. Brenda Wyatt, a metallurgy expert working for the police as a forensic scientist, finds shards of Connor's sword at Fasil's murder scene and is puzzled they come from a Japanese sword dated around 600 B.C. but made with medieval-era methods. Brenda witnesses the Kurgan attack \\"Nash\\" and the two fight briefly before police arrive, forcing them to flee. She meets with \\"Nash\\" twice afterward, hoping to learn about the paradoxical sword. Connor likes her, but tells her to leave him alone. Connor reunites with Immortal Sunda Kastagir, a friend who doesn't wish to fight. After they part ways, the Kurgan duels Kastagir, killing him. Brenda investigates \\"Nash\\" and finds evidence he has lived for centuries. On Heather's birthday, Connor lights a candle for her in a Roman Catholic Church, as he has done every year. The Kurgan arrives and confirms he and the Highlander are now the last remaining Immortals. He also reveals he raped Heather after killing Ram√≠rez. Disgusted, but prohibited from fighting on holy ground, Connor leaves. Brenda confronts Connor, who explains his true identity. After spending the night together, they part company (due to Connor's immortality making him sterile), but the Kurgan finds Brenda and kidnaps her to draw out Connor. Connor decides it is time to leave behind the \\"Russell Nash\\" identity, regardless of his survival. He says goodbye to Rachel and confronts the Kurgan at Silvercup Studios in Queens. After a long duel, Connor kills the Kurgan and earns the Prize. Connor returns to Scotland with Brenda and reveals he's now a mortal man who can age and have children. He is also now \\"at one with all living things,\\" able to read the thoughts and feelings of people all around the world. He hopes to encourage cooperation, understanding, and peace among humanity. Cast *Christopher Lambert as Connor MacLeod, a 16th-century immortal born in Glenfinnan, Scotland near the shores of Loch Shiel. Under the alias Russell Nash, the Scottish Highlander lives and works as an antique dealer in New York in 1985. *Sean Connery as Juan S√°nchez-Villalobos Ram√≠rez, an Egyptian immortal who later lives for a time in Japan and then later still in Spain. Learning the Kurgan has targeted Connor MacLeod, Ram√≠rez tracks down the Highlander and becomes his mentor in the ways of immortals. *Clancy Brown as The Kurgan, Connor's nemesis, said to be a member of the Kurgan tribe. In 1985, he travels to New York under the name \\"Victor Kruger\\" intending to kill the few remaining immortals and claim \\"The Prize.\\" *Roxanne Hart as Brenda Wyatt, a forensic scientist and published metallurgy expert helping to investigate the string of beheadings in New York City. *Beatie Edney as Heather MacLeod, Connor's first wife. After Connor is banished from his village, he starts a new life with her. She lives with the eternally youthful Connor for many years until she dies of old age. *Alan North as Lt.

Walter Bedsoe, an NYPD detective working alongside Moran. *Sheila Gish as Rachel Ellenstein, Connor's middle-aged secretary and adopted daughter. Saved from the Nazis by Connor when she was a Jewish child during The Holocaust, Rachel is one of the few mortal people who knows his true identity. *Hugh Quarshie as Sunda Kastagir, Connor's fellow immortal and friend. He is beheaded by the Kurgan during a battle in New York. *Christopher Malcolm as Kirk Matunas, an emotionally unstable Vietnam War veteran who witnesses the duel between the Kurgan and Kastigir, machine guns the Kurgan, and is then impaled on the villain's sword. *Peter Diamond as Iman Fasil, a French immortal. He attacks Connor before the Highlander can have a chance to draw his own sword. Despite this, Connor defeats and beheads him. *Celia Imrie as Kate MacLeod, Connor's lover in 1536, before he met Heather. Convinced Connor's immortality means he is \\"in league with Lucifer\\", Kate leads an unsuccessful effort to have him burned at the stake. *Billy Hartman and James Cosmo as Dougal and Angus Macleod, Connor's cousins and leaders of the MacLeod Clan. *Corinne Russell as Candy, a prostitute hired by the Kurgan. Professional wrestlers Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell, Sam Fatu, Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy, and Buddy Roberts appear as themselves in the film's opening sequence at a tag-team match. The event in the film is supposedly held at Madison Square Garden, but was actually shot at Brendan Byrne Arena in New Jersey. Production and development=Conception Gregory Widen wrote the script for Highlander, as a class assignment while he was an undergraduate in the screenwriting program at UCLA. Widen also used Ridley Scott's 1977 film The Duellists as inspiration for his story. After reading the script, Widen's instructor advised him to send it to an agent. Widen sold the script for US $200,000. It became the first draft of what would eventually be the screenplay for the 1986 film Highlander.The Telegraph - \\"There can be only one: Why Highlander will live forever\\" (2016). According to Widen, \\"The idea of the story was basically a combination of a riff on The Duellists ‚Äì guy wants to finish a duel over years‚Äì and a visit I made both to Scotland and the Tower of London armour display, where I thought, 'What if you owned all this? What if you‚Äôd worn it all through history and were giving someone a tour of your life through it?' That scene is basically in the movie.\\" According to William Panzer, producer of Highlander: The Series, \\"And that's where everything fell into place ‚Äî the idea that there are Immortals and they were in conflict with each other, leading secret lives that the rest of us are unaware of.\\"Bill Panzer, at Thedigitalbits.com , last accessed September 4, 2007 In a 2006 interview with The Action Elite, Gregory Widen remarked, \\"I‚Äôve always been amazed that a project I wrote as a UCLA student has had this kind of life. I think it‚Äôs appeal is the uniqueness of how the story was told and the fact it had a heart and a point of view about immortality.\\"The Action Elite - Interview with Gregory Widen (2016). Widen's original draft of the script differed significantly from the film. The initial story was darker and more violent. Connor is born in 1408 rather than 1518. He lives with his mother and father. Heather does not exist; Connor is promised to a girl named Mara, who rejects him when she learns that he is immortal. Connor willingly leaves his village, instead of being banished. His alias is Richard Tupin and his weapon is a custom broadsword. Ram√≠rez is a Spaniard born in 1100, instead of an ancient Egyptian born more than two thousand years earlier. The Kurgan is known as the Knight, using the alias Carl William Smith. He is not a savage, but a cold-blooded killer. Brenda is Brenna Cartwright. Other elements were changed during the rewrite. Initially, immortals could have children; in the draft Connor is said to have had 37. In a flashback in the first draft, Connor attends the funeral of one of his sons. His wife (in her 70s) and his two sons, who are in their mid 50s, see him revealed as an immortal. In the early draft, there is no release of energy when an immortal kills another nor is there any mention of the Prize. Immortals can still sense each other and when Connor finally kills the Knight, he feels a sharp burning pain. As he sense another immortal nearby, the ending implies this is simply one of many battles the Game continues. Director Russell Mulcahy was flipping through a magazine and saw a photograph of Christopher Lambert from his recent role as the title hero of Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. At the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival in 2015, Mulcahy said he showed the photo to his production staff and \\"I said, 'who's this?' They had no idea. He couldn't speak English. But he had the perfect look. And he learned English very fast.\\"The Telegraph - \\"There can be only one: Why Highlander will live forever\\" (2016). Gregory Widen had originally envisioned Connor as a very serious, grim character following centuries of violence and loss. The film however portrayed MacLeod as a person who has suffers loss and fears new attachment but doesn't deny the possibility of love, maintains a sense of humor about life, and tells his adopted daughter to have hope and remain optimistic. In a 2016 interview with HeyUGuys, Lambert said part of what he found appealing about Connor MacLeod was the man still having humor and hope despite his long life and many losses. \\"It‚Äôs the only role that I have played that is touching on the subject of immortality, through a character carrying five hundred years of violence, pain, love, and suffering on his shoulders, who is still walking around and being positive. That is what amazed me about him the most... It‚Äôs difficult living through one life but to see all the people around you dying over and over. How do you cope with that pain? How do you have the strength to keep on walking, to keep being positive and optimistic? To be capable of falling in love again when you know the pain it creates when you lose them.\\"HeyUGuys - \\"Exclusive: Christopher Lambert on 30 Years of Highlander\\" (2016). Widen also had a different vision of the Kurgan originally. \\"Kurgan was the thing that was most different about my screenplay. He was much more tortured. The Kurgan in Highlander as it is pretty much like Freddy [Krueger] ‚Äì he's just a cackling psychopath. I envisaged him as a guy who loses everything over time. The only thing he could hold onto, to give him a reason to get up in the morning, was to finish this thing ‚Äì finish it with our guy [MacLeod]. It was more about that‚Ä¶ it was just a reason to get up in the morning. Otherwise, what is the point? Everything is impermanent, everything is lost. That made him much more serious ‚Äì in a weird way, a sympathetic bad guy.\\" Widen commented that actor Clancy Brown had similar thoughts about the Kurgan, wishing to make him more complex and interesting by dressing the villain in a bowler hat and suit, disguising his villainy rather than wearing the biker outfit he had instead. Filming Scotland's Eilean Donan Castle and its bridge featured prominently in the film The budget was put up by Thorn EMI. When brought to Russell Mulcahy, the title was The Dark Knight. Filming began in April 1985 with on location shooting in Scotland in May and returning to London in June and ended July after a two-week shoot in New York City. It took place in Scotland, England, and New York City. Director Russell Mulcahy filmed Highlander using music video techniques including fast cutting and pacy music. In preparation, actor Christopher Lambert spent months working with a dialect coach (four hours in the morning) and sword-training with Bob Anderson (four hours in the afternoon) who had been a Darth Vader stunt double in the Star Wars franchise.Guardian - \\"How we made Highlander: Connery opened his homemade whiskey on the plane\\" (2016). On filming a scene underwater in a Scottish loch, Lambert said, \\"The first time it's a surprise. I thought the water would be cold, but not that cold. The second time you know it is going to be freezing. The third time you turn away and you say, 'That's the last take you're doing.'\\" Director of photography Arthur Smith actually filmed the scene in which fish fall out of MacLeod's kilt, but Lambert's kilt proved to be too short. Smith said, \\"I stuck part of a drain pipe above Chris's kilt out of camera range, and fed live trout down the tube.\\" Smith also had difficulties shooting MacLeod meeting the Kurgan. It was raining that day and the crew had to use umbrellas and hair dryers to prevent water from hitting the camera lenses and appearing on the film. Smith also remembered that Lambert, who was near-sighted, \\"kept forgetting to take off his glasses as he came over the hill on his horse.\\" Bow Bridge in Central Park The filming of the parking garage scene took place in two different places. According to New York location manager Brett Botula, \\"the garage exterior is Manhattan, across from Madison Square Garden, and the interior is 'somewhere in London.'\\" The pro-wrestling match in the opening scene featured The Fabulous Freebirds vs. Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell and The Tonga Kid. The scene where the MacLeod clan sets off to battle is supposed to take place \\"in the village of Glenfinnan, on the shore of Loch Shiel\\" in the Lochaber area, but was actually filmed at Eilean Donan Castle, which is in the same general area but is really on the shore of Loch Duich, a sea loch near Kyle of Lochalsh and the Isle of Skye. According to the DVD commentary, the film's climax was originally intended to take place on top of the Statue of Liberty. Then it was changed to an amusement park and finally changed to the rooftop of the Silvercup Studios building. The opening sequence was originally intended to take place during a National Hockey League game, but the NHL refused because the film crew intended to emphasize the violence of the match.Feature-length DVD commentary by director Russell Mulcahy and producers William N. Panzer and Peter S. Davis. Located on the 10th Anniversary Highlander Director's Cut Region 1 DVD by Republic Pictures. The scene in the alley where the Kurgan beheads Kastagir and stabs the former marine, followed by an explosion, was filmed in an alley in England even though it was set in New York. The director was reluctant to set off the explosion in the alley because the windows were full of Victorian glass, but he was given permission to do so because that particular site was going to be destroyed in a few months anyway. The opening voice-over by Connery has an echo effect because it was recorded in the bathroom of his Spanish villa, where he had been working on his Spanish accent for the film with a voice coach. It was played for the producers over the phone, and they approved of it because they could not discern the quality of the recording. In a Reddit \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session in 2014, Clancy Brown said \\"It was a strange set. We were all trying to make a good movie, and the producers were trying to make money any way they could, so there were a lot of things we had to work around, do on the cheap because of those producers.\\" Soundtrack The Highlander original orchestral score was composed by Michael Kamen. The British rock band Marillion turned down the chance to record the soundtrack because they were on a world tour, a missed opportunity which guitarist Steve Rothery later said he regretted. The band's Scottish lead singer, Fish, had also accepted a part in the film but pulled out because of the scheduling conflict. David Bowie, Sting, and Duran Duran were considered to do the soundtrack for the film. The eventual soundtrack includes several songs by Queen, such as \\"A Kind of Magic\\" and \\"Princes of the Universe\\" (the latter also being used for the Highlander television series title sequence).Sounds of the Future: Essays on Music in Science Fiction Film p.19. Retrieved January 22, 2011 Brian May was inspired to write \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" after watching the love scenes between Connor and his wife Heather, which the song ultimately accompanied on the film. Despite a mention in the end credits, to date a complete soundtrack album for Highlander has not been released. Queen's 1986 album A Kind of Magic features several songs from the film (although sometimes in different arrangements): \\"Princes of the Universe\\", \\"Gimme the Prize (Kurgan's Theme)\\" (the album version includes snippets of dialogue from the film), \\"One Year of Love\\", \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\", \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\", and \\"A Kind of Magic\\". The album and single edits of \\"A Kind of Magic\\" feature a different mix from the one in the film; a 2011 re-release of the album includes the long-unreleased Highlander version of the song. The album does not include Queen's recording of \\"Theme from New York, New York\\", which features briefly in Highlander. \\"Hammer to Fall\\", a Queen song heard playing from a car radio in one scene, was from an earlier album, The Works. The 1995 CD Highlander: The Original Scores includes five cues from Kamen's Highlander score (along with six cues from Stewart Copeland's Highlander II score, and four cues from J. Peter Robinson's Highlander III score). Furthermore, a rearrangement of an excerpt from Kamen's score (specifically, the beginning of the track \\"The Quickening\\") was used as the theme music for New Line Cinema's logo ident in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Release and reception Highlander opened in Los Angeles on March 7, 1986. The film had an 116 minute running time in the United Kingdom and a 111 minute running time in the United States. Roughly eight minutes of footage was cut from the film for its U.S. theatrical release. Most of the cuts were sequences involving a specifically European brand of humor which the distributors thought American audiences would not find funny, such as Connor being repeatedly head-butted by one of his clansmen, the duelist shooting his assistant, and the Kurgan licking the priest's hand. The cut Mulcahy found most objectionable was the deletion of the scene showing how Connor met Rachel, because he could see no reason for its removal and believed that the relationship between Connor and Rachel was incomprehensible without it. Alex Stewart reviewed Highlander for White Dwarf #79, and stated that \\"What the film does have going for it is stylish direction, a breathless pace and some exquisite camerawork. The performances aren't bad either, especially Brown and Connery, who are so far over the top they're practically in the next trench.\\" Alex Stewart reviewed the British release print of Highlander for White Dwarf #81, and stated that \\"Highlander is visually stunning, from the timeless grandeur of the Scottish landscape to the surrealist urban jungles of New York. And the swordfights are terrific.\\" Upon initial U.S. release, Highlander was not well-received, but it gained wide and persistent popularity in Europe and other markets, as well as on home video. It has since become a cult film in both domestic and non-domestic markets, leading to four sequels, a television series, and various other spin-offs. The film grossed $2.4 million on its opening weekend and ended with $5.9 million in the US. Internationally, the film grossed $12.9 million. Highlander holds an approval rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"People hate Highlander because it's cheesy, bombastic, and absurd. And people love it for the same reasons.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 24 out of 100 based on 7 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Dan√©l Griffin of Film as Art awarded the film four stars (out of four), saying: \\"The key to Highlander's success is in its approach to its subject matter. What could have been a premise that breathes clich√© is given a fresh approach due to Mulcahy's unique directing style and a written script. ... Highlander is certainly a classic film that will continue to be cherished and watched as the world of movie making continues to grow and change. It is a triumphant example of the art of cinema, and watching it reminds us all of why we like going to the movies in the first place.\\" Christopher Null of FilmCritic.com gave the film four and a half stars out of five, writing: \\"Highlander has no equal among sword-and-sorcery flicks.\\" Null later called Highlander \\"the greatest action film ever made,\\" saying that it features \\"awesome swordfights, an awesome score, and a time-bending plotline that only a philistine could dislike\\". Matt Ford of the BBC gave the film three stars out of five, writing: \\"From the moody, rain-soaked, noir-ish streets of late 20th century America to the wild open spaces of medieval Scotland, Mulcahy plunders movie history to set off his visceral fight scenes with suitably rugged locations. ... What the film loses through ham acting, weak narrative, and pompous macho posturing it more than compensates with in sheer fiery bravado, pace, and larger than life action.\\" Dean Winkelspecht of DVD Town also gave Highlander three stars out of five, writing: \\"The film's slow pace and dated look will turn away many a new viewer ... However, there is a certain appeal to the film that brings back many for a second or third helping. I have learned to appreciate the film over the years, [and] the film's story is unique and entertaining.\\" Also giving the film three stars out of five, Adam Tyner of DVD Talk wrote, \\"The screenplay spots a number of intelligent, creative ideas, and I find the very concept of displacing the sword-and-sorcery genre to then-modern-day New York City to be fairly inventive. The dialogue and performances don't quite match many of the film's concepts, though. The tone seems somewhat uneven as if Highlander is unsure if it wants to be seen as a straight adventure epic or if it's a campy action flick.\\" IGN, awarding Highlander a score of 8 out of 10, wrote: \\"This 80s classic has a lot going for it. The hardcore MTV manner in which it was filmed is common these days, but was groundbreaking then. This movie features some of the best scene transitions committed to celluloid. ... To this is added some fun performances by Connery and especially Clancy Brown.\\" Leonard Maltin gave the film one and a half stars: \\"Interesting premise made silly and boring ... Former rock video director Mulcahy's relentlessly showy camera moves may cause you to reach for the Dramamine.\\" Home video release The video was a hit in the United States. The theatrical release of Highlander II: The Quickening in 1991 significantly increased the rental activity on Highlander even though the sequel was not a box-office success. Highlander was first released to DVD in the United States in 1997, in a \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" Director's Cut that contained the international uncut version of the film. A \\"15th Anniversary\\" edition was released in Australia in 2001, which also contained the International cut of the film. Highlander was again released in 2002 in two editions: a special \\"Immortal Edition\\" with several extra features (including several Queen music videos and a bonus CD containing three Queen songs from the film) and a standard edition, both of which contain the International uncut version with remastered video and DTS ES sound. On the June 17, 2009 French distributor StudioCanal issued the film on Blu-ray with identical releases following in Germany, UK, Holland, Australia and Japan. The U.S. director's cut is currently available on DVD and Blu-ray in North America from Lionsgate under license from the film's current owner, StudioCanal, while television rights currently stand with The Walt Disney Company, parent company of theatrical distributor 20th Century Fox. Legacy=Novelization A novelization of the film was written by Garry Kilworth under the pen name \\"Garry Douglas.\\" It expanded the events of the movie by revealing details such as Heather finding out about Connor's immortality from Ram√≠rez, the Kurgan's First Death, and the villain's training with an Arabian immortal known as \\"The Bedouin\\" (whom he eventually kills). The novel depicts the Kurgan battling and defeating an immortal Mongol warrior soon before meeting MacLeod in 1536. Another scene reveals how he acquires his customized broadsword. The novel depicts Connor and Kastagir as having a more somber relationship, the two comfortable talking and confiding in each other about their fears. An alternate scene has them meet in the subway before going to the Bridge. The book expands the ending following Connor's last battle with the Kurgan. He returns to his antique shop to say a final goodbye to Rachel before leaving for Scotland. Once there, he and Brenda tour the country for two months then open an antique shop in Camden Alley. On one occasion, Connor returns to the Scottish Uplands alone and stares at the remnants of his home with Heather. There is no croft there but he finds a few stones from the fallen tor and locates the burial place of Ram√≠rez and Heather. Finding two timbers and fashioning a crude cross, Connor tells Heather that she would like Brenda because \\"she is much like you.\\" Sequels and planned or possible remake The film was followed by two direct sequels. Highlander II: The Quickening was released in 1991 and met with an overall negative response, with some considering it among the worst films ever made.Hicks, Chris. \\"Highlander II: The Quickening.\\" Deseret News. Highlander III: The Sorcerer (also known as Highlander: The Final Dimension) was released in 1994 and retroactively erased the canon of Highlander II, acting as an alternate sequel to the first film. The movies Highlander: Endgame (2000) and Highlander: The Source (2007) follow the continuity of the TV show Highlander: The Series. Both movies received negative reviews from fans of both the original film and the TV show. The anime movie Highlander: The Search for Vengeance (2007), which existed in its own continuity with protagonist Colin MacLeod, received largely positive reviews. In March 2008, Summit Entertainment announced that it had bought the film rights to Highlander and was remaking the original film. Chad Stahelski was announced as a new director of the reboot which has been described to be John Wick with swords with the reboot planned as a possible trilogy. As of May 2020, the filming for the remake has not yet begun.  TV Series  Christopher Lambert was offered a chance to return as Connor MacLeod in a TV series adaptation. Lambert turned down the role, so the series became a spin- off, introducing a new character Duncan MacLeod played by Adrian Paul. Highlander: The Series began airing on television in 1992, with Lambert appearing as Connor in the first episode. The series explains Duncan is a man born decades after Connor's banishment and adopted by the Clan MacLeod. After Duncan discovers he is immortal, Connor finds him and trains him before going his separate way. The season two premiere episode \\"The Watchers\\" confirms Connor's battle with the Kurgan still happened in 1985 in the canon of the show, but the Prize was not won because there were still several living immortals in this version of events, including Duncan. Lambert did not appear in any other episode, but he and Duncan meet again in the movie Highlander: Endgame. Highlander: The Animated Series aired 1994 to 1996. A loose science fiction adaptation and sequel of the original film, the series imagines a meteorite causing an apocalypse on Earth. In the wake of this, Connor MacLeod is one of several immortals who decides to help preserve knowledge for humanity rather than continue their war for the Prize, though he is then killed by Kortan, the one remaining evil immortal. Taking place in the 27th century, the series features the young immortal hero Quentin MacLeod, last descendant of the MacLeod Clan. He is trained by another immortal named Don Vincente Marino Ramirez, an old friend of Connor's.

The park is located mauka (up hill) from Kahana Bay. It is Hawaii's only public ahupuaa, and it stretches from the sea to the tip of Puu Pauao at 2670 feet. It has a tropical climate, and it is one of the wettest areas in Oahu, averaging nearly 300 inches per year in parts of the valley. The main purpose of the park is to embrace and teach Hawaiian culture. History Before Western civilization came to the islands, Kahana had a strong community. It had fresh water, abundant seafood, and a stable supply of taro, which was grown in fields with advanced irrigation systems. However, around the time of King Kamehameha's unification of Hawaii in the 1800s, the community fell into steep decline due to foreign diseases, sugarcane cultivation and the military's use of the valley as a World War II jungle warfare training center, through the arrival of Europeans. In the early 1900s most of the valley was owned by Mary E. Foster, and after her death the valley was given to Bishop Estate. The state proposed a purchase of the ahupua'a, which was rejected. The Foster estate was not satisfied with the purchase plan, which was for $5,000,000 being paid 1 million per year for 5 years, as the then current legislature could not ensure future payments. The state forced the purchase through condemnation, later fulfilling their debt.http://hawaii.gov/lrb/rpts01/kahana.pdf The land later became a state park. Today, only 31 families live in the valley. Fauna Kahana State Park supports a wide variety of birds and fish. Oopu naniha (Stenogobius hawaiiensis), a native freshwater fish, can be found in the streams of the lower valley. Amaama (flathead mullet, Mugil cephalus) and milkfish (Chanos chanos) are common in the Huilua Fishpond. Bird species that can be found in the lower valley include Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), sanderling (Calidris alba), wandering tattler (Tringa incana), aukuu (black-crowned night heron, Nycticorax nycticorax), alae keokeo (Hawaiian coot, Fulica alai), and alae ula (Hawaiian gallinule, Gallinula chloropus sandvicensis). The last two species are endangered. In the upper valley are many native species of songbirds, such as the apapane (Himatione sanguinea) and Oahu amakihi (Hemignathus flavus), along with non-native species of mynah, cardinal, dove and ricebird. Feral pigs were introduced to the valley by the first Polynesian settlers. While this is an ideal environment for the pigs, these animals are a serious threat to the rest of the valley. Flora The expanse of land in Kahana Valley from the sea to the mountains contains many different vegetation zones. The lowlands consist of koa (Acacia koa), hibiscus, hala (Pandanus tectorius), and pasture. Further up the valley, in the wetter areas, the dominant vegetation consists of mountain apple (Syzygium malaccense), strawberry guava (Psidium littorale), ti (Cordyline fruticosa) and bamboo. Activities=Hiking There are two hiking trails in the valley, both of which do not require permits and are suitable for whole families. The first is Kapa'ele'ele Ko'a and Keaniani Lookout Trail. It is a mile long loop that takes a decent hiker roughly an hour. The second is the Nakoa Trail, which is named so for the numerous koa (Acacia koa) found along this 2.5-mile trail through tropical rainforest. Hikers on this trail can swim in the Kahana stream, which is traversed twice. Camping and hunting There are ten campsites located on the beach which can be used by permit only. Hunting is also permitted within designated boundaries on weekends and holidays only, and by permit only.

Born in Emerald, Queensland, Egerton was educated at Rockhampton and Mount Morgan High Schools. He started his working life as a boilermaker (his father had also been a boilermaker). Very soon he turned to political activity, with marked success. When only 25 years old Egerton became state secretary of the Queensland Boilermakers Union, and well before reaching the age of 40 he had become one of the leading figures in Queensland politics, as Vince Gair (ALP Premier since 1952) found to his cost in 1957. In addition to being president of the Queensland Trades and Labor Council from 1967 to 1976, Egerton served as president of the Australian Labor Party state executive for much of the same period (1968‚Äì76). Meanwhile, he held high rank in the Australian Council of Trade Unions and was a member of the ALP's federal executive. During the 1970s, Egerton acted as Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's right-hand man in Queensland and frequently clashed with the state's conservative Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Subsequently he fell out with Whitlam, the results of this quarrel being dramatic and unexpected on all sides. In 1976 Egerton became one of the few Australian Labor Party members to accept a knighthood, in violation of the party's general principle to reject titular honours. His recent predecessors included William McKell (1951), Edward McTiernan (1951), Robert Cosgrove (1959), and Dorothy Tangney (1968). Exactly why Egerton broke with ALP tradition and accepted the honour was a question that he never publicly answered. It is said that the only man who knew the secret was former Senator Albert Patrick Field, but Field committed suicide in 1990 without revealing anything about the subject. Malcolm Fraser, who had defeated Whitlam in a landslide at the December 1975 federal election, offered the knighthood to Egerton for service to the trade union movement. The award cost Egerton his ALP membership, and earned him the name of 'Jumping Jack the Black Knight', as well as prompting in some quarters the even more hostile epithet 'Labor Rat'. By odd coincidence, Egerton, the son of a boilermaker, received his knighthood from Governor-General Sir John Kerr, also the son of a boilermaker. An outraged Whitlam would later say the knighthood was \\"the most inappropriate conferral of the title since Queen Elizabeth I knighted Sir Toby Belch\\". Egerton's wife, Lady (Moya) Egerton had her ALP membership restored in 1977, but Sir Jack was never reinstated to the party.Obituary, \\"Jumping Jack paid the price for the gong\\", Canberra Times, 29 December 1998, p. 13 Egerton was later elected as an alderman of the Gold Coast City Council 1979-85, and served as the Deputy Mayor of the Gold Coast for a time.

Finch (February 16, 1951 ‚Äì April 2, 2011\\"Memphis basketball legend Larry Finch dies at age 60\\") was a player and coach for the University of Memphis men's basketball team. He is perhaps most famous for leading the Memphis Tigers to the NCAA men's basketball championship game in 1973 in a heroic loss to the UCLA Bruins, led by Bill Walton.  Playing career  Finch was born in Memphis, and played basketball for Melrose High School in the Orange Mound section of Memphis. He then entered Memphis State and played basketball under famed basketball coach Gene Bartow. This decision was somewhat controversial for both Memphis' black and white communities, given the recent assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the resultant heightened strain on race relations in Memphis, not to mention so few local African-American prep stars had been able to wear a Tiger uniform to that point. Some had advised Finch not to go, but whether or not he saw it as an opportunity to do something even more meaningful than playing for his local university, Finch loved his hometown team. As he led the Tigers to new heights of success, at least during basketball games, Memphians had a chance to see things less in black and white and more in Tiger blue and gray. In his senior year at Memphis State, 1972‚Äì73, he and Larry Kenon led the basketball team to the Final Four. In the championship game, Finch scored 29 points, but lost to John Wooden's UCLA Bruins, a game where Bill Walton went 21 of 22 from the floor. Finch graduated the all-time leading scorer in Memphis history, and is currently the second all-time leading scorer for the University of Memphis. Finch was drafted on the fourth round by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1973, but opted to join the local American Basketball Association team, the Memphis Tams. Finch played professionally for two years with the Tams, the Memphis Sounds and the Baltimore Hustlers and Baltimore Claws.  Coaching career  In the 1980s, Finch was an assistant coach for Dana Kirk at Memphis State. Kirk was forced to leave Memphis State after violating NCAA regulations and becoming the subject of a criminal investigation, and while asking for and getting immunity from prosecution in the Kirk trial, Finch was made head coach in 1986. He would remain at the school, which was renamed the University of Memphis in 1994, until 1997. Finch posted 10 out of 11 winning seasons, seven 20+ win seasons, and six NCAA tournaments. He recruited and developed such players as Elliot Perry, Penny Hardaway, and Lorenzen Wright. His 1991‚Äì92 team led by Hardaway and David Vaughn went to the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament. During his tenure, the basketball players began to graduate in high numbers. As a player, Finch was known for his shooting prowess, and his skills remained intact throughout his coaching days; he would routinely win games of H-O-R-S-E against his players and against assistant coaches in long distance shooting contests after road game practices. Even while head coach, he maintained connections to his roots; he often visited Orange Mound barbershops, often delivering Memphis State posters and other team paraphernalia. Despite Finch's overall success, during the mid-1990s more and more local blue chip recruits began leaving for other schools, specifically Todd Day to the University of Arkansas and others to the University of Tennessee. This began grating on Tiger fans, who had become used to seeing national powers built on primarily Memphis-area talent. While there was the Elite Eight team of 91‚Äì92, several of Finch's teams were considered under- achievers, such as the highly touted 1995‚Äì96 squad which lost to 12th seeded Drexel University in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Finch was forced to resign and his contract was bought out at the end of the 1996‚Äì97 season. The forced resignation was a public relations fiasco for the university and athletic director R. C. Johnson, as the deal was finalized immediately following Finch's final game in one of the concession areas of the Pyramid Arena.Dead Man Walking: The University of Memphis announced the forced resignation of head coach Larry Finch amidst an uncontrollable media frenzy, by Dennis Freeland, The Memphis Flyer Although a portion of the fan base had become disenchanted with Finch, even some of his detractors were critical of the way school officials handled it. He left as the school's all-time winningest coach, a record which stood until John Calipari passed him in 2007‚Äì08. However, after all of the Tigers' wins in the 2007‚Äì08 season were vacated, Finch recovered his standing as the school's winningest coach.  After basketball  In 1998, he ran for the office of Shelby County Registrar and lost to the incumbent by only 127 votes despite having no government experience. He was briefly in the running for coaching positions at Tennessee State, Georgia State, and South Alabama. In 2002, Finch suffered a debilitating stroke. People close to Finch created the Friends of Larry Finch Foundation to help offset his medical expenses. In December 2006, the Foundation released a Larry Finch tribute CD called \\"Eye of the Tiger\\", featuring performers from Memphis' diverse musical community such as Al Green, The Bar-Kays, Gary Johns, John Kilzer, and Al Kapone. Finch died on April 2, 2011, after a long illness.

Maitotoxin is so potent that it has been demonstrated that an intraperitoneal injection of 130 ng/kg was lethal in mice. Maitotoxin was named from the ciguateric fish Ctenochaetus striatus-- called \\"maito\\" in Tahiti--from which maitotoxin was isolated for the first time. It was later shown that maitotoxin is actually produced by the dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus.  Mechanism of toxicity  Maitotoxin activates extracellular calcium channels, leading to an increase in levels of cytosolic Ca2+ ions. The exact molecular target of maitotoxin is unknown, but it has been suggested that maitotoxin binds to the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and turns it into an ion channel, similar to how palytoxin turns the Na+/K+-ATPase into an ion channel. Ultimately, a necroptosis cascade is activated, resulting in membrane blebbing and eventually cell lysis. Maitotoxin can indirectly activate calcium-binding proteases calpain-1 and calpain-2, contributing to necrosis. The toxicity of maitotoxin in mice is the highest for nonprotein toxins: the LD50 is 50 ng/kg.  Molecular structure  The molecule itself is a system of 32 fused rings. It resembles large fatty acid chains and it is notable because it is one of the largest and most complex non-protein, non-polysaccharide molecules produced by any organism. Maitotoxin includes 32 ether rings, 22 methyl groups, 28 hydroxyl groups, and 2 sulfuric acid esters and has an amphipathic structure. Its structure was established through analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance at Tohoku University, Harvard University and the University of Tokyo in combination with mass spectrometry, and synthetic chemical methods. However, Andrew Gallimore and Jonathan Spencer have questioned the structure of maitotoxin at a single ring-junction (the J‚ÄìK junction), based purely on biosynthetic considerations and their general model for marine polyether biogenesis. K. C. Nicolaou and Michael Frederick argue that despite this biosynthetic argument, the originally proposed structure could still be correct. The controversy has yet to be resolved.  Biosynthesis  The molecule is produced in nature via a polyketide synthase pathway. Total synthesis Since 1996 the Nicolaou research group is involved in an effort to synthesise the molecule via total synthesis although the project is currently on hold due to a lack of funding.Chemistry's toughest total synthesis challenge put on hold by lack of funds Katrina Kramer 15 January 2015 Chemistry World http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/01/chemistry-grandest-total-synthesis- challenge-maitotoxin-put-hold-lack-funds See also *Palytoxin  References  Further reading  * Category:Oxygen heterocycles Category:Marine neurotoxins Category:Ion channel toxins Category:Invertebrate toxins Category:Phycotoxins Category:Total synthesis Category:Secondary alcohols Category:Alkene derivatives Category:Tetrahydropyrans Category:Organic sodium salts Category:Polyether toxins Category:Non-protein ion channel toxins Category:Calcium channel openers Category:Conjugated dienes Category:Sulfate esters ","title":"Maitotoxin"},{"id":"4440347","text":"Hatrick may refer to: * Alexander Hatrick (1857 ‚Äì 1918), a New Zealand merchant, shipowner, tourism entrepreneur and mayor * Gloria Hatrick McLean, an American actress and model * Hat-trick, the achievement of a positive feat three times in a game * Hatrick Hodi Maga, (English: Hit a hat-trick son), a 2009 Indian Kannada action-crime film ","title":"Hatrick"},{"id":"4440350","text":"The National Workers Party can refer to: *National Workers Party (Pakistan), a left-wing party. *National Workers' Party (Spain), a far right party. *National Workers' Party, a centre party from Poland. *National Workers' Party (United Kingdom) a far right party led by A.

Eptifibatide is a cyclic heptapeptide derived from a disintegrin protein () found in the venom of the southeastern pygmy rattlesnake (Sistrurus miliarius barbouri). It belongs to the class of the arginin-glycin-aspartat-mimetics and reversibly binds to platelets. Eptifibatide has a short half-life. The drug is the third inhibitor of GPIIb/IIIa that has found broad acceptance after the specific antibody abciximab and the non-peptide tirofiban entered the global market. Indications Eptifibatide is used to reduce the risk of acute cardiac ischemic events (death and/or myocardial infarction) in patients with unstable angina or non-ST-segment-elevation (e.g., non-Q-wave) myocardial infarction (i.e., non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes) both in patients who are to receive non surgery (conservative) medical treatment and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The drug is usually applied together with aspirin or clopidogrel and (low molecular weight or unfractionated) heparin. Additionally, the usual supportive treatment consisting of applications of nitrates, beta-blockers, opioid analgesics and/or benzodiazepines should be employed as indicated. Angiographic evaluation and other intensive diagnostic procedures may be considered a first line task before initiating therapy with eptifibatide. The drug should exclusively be used in hospitalized patients both because of the serious degree of patients' illness and because of the possible side-effects of eptifibatide. Contraindications and precautions * Thrombocytopenia : The drug is contraindicated in patients with platelet counts of less than 100,000 per Œºl because no clinical experience exists regarding such patients. * Chronic kidney disease : Eptifibatide undergoes kidney elimination. In such patients with chronic kidney disease where a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor is likely to provide benefit, Abciximab (trade name: Reopro) is an alternative medication. * Current bleeding tendencies or abnormally prolonged coagulation parameters observed within 30 days before starting therapy with eptifibatide is intended. * Coagulation parameters such as ACT, aPTT, TT, and PT should be followed closely during therapy and afterwards. * Allergy to eptifibatide and/or other ingredients. * Severe, uncontrolled hypertension. * Pregnancy : No experience exists. Pregnant patients should be treated only when clearly needed. * Lactation : No human data exists. Breast-feeding should be avoided during treatment in order to prevent damage to the newborn. * Geriatric patients : No differences in side effects compared with younger patients have been seen. Nevertheless, geriatric patients should be very closely observed for bleeding and other side-effects. * Pediatric patients : Eptifibatide is not indicated in patients below 18 years of age, because no experience exists. Side effects People receiving eptifibatide are typically seriously ill and most of them are concomitantly treated with other drugs known to have the potential to cause significant side effects. Therefore, not all side effects listed as follows may be attributable to eptifibatide treatment alone: The major adverse event in the PURSUIT study was severe bleeding. Bleeding occurred as well at sites of clinical intervention (local sites) as at other sites (systemically) like urogenital bleeds. Sometimes, these events were severe enough to require transfusion of blood or plasma concentrates to stop bleeding and counteract anemia. Severe bleeds occurred in 4.4 and 4.7% of patients respectively depending on the infusion rate (0.5 ¬µg/kg/min vs. 0.75 ¬µg/kg/min). A few cases of death due to severe bleeding events attributable to drug therapy were reported. No cases of hemorrhagic stroke were seen. Thrombocytopenia of unknown origin (allergic reaction?) was also noticed in 0.2% of patients. Additionally, hypotension was seen frequently (6%). Cardiovascular failure was also frequent (2%) as were serious arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation 1.5%, atrial fibrillation 6%). Severe allergic (anaphylactic) reactions occurred in almost 0.2% of patients. These reactions can be life-threatening and may be due to the peptide character of eptifibatide. Other side effects were rare and mild in nature and may not be connected to eptifibatide therapy. Study results Eptifibatide was licensed due to the positive results of the so-called PURSUIT study encompassing 10,948 patients. In this study all patients had suffered either unstable angina or a non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Significantly fewer patients developed a myocardial infarction under therapy with eptifibatide. Death rates showed a tendency in favor of eptifibatide, but this superiority was not statistically significant. Additional information Sometimes the treating physicians require the patient after discharge from hospital to continue treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel for a few weeks, some months or even for life (as usually is the case with aspirin) to prevent recurrence of symptoms, development of myocardial infarction and/or death related to cardiovascular disease. This advice should be strictly followed. Eptifibatide is one of very many antiplatelet drugs that all have different consequences on the platelet's activity. Inventors Eptifibatide was discovered by a team led by Robert M. Scarborough and David Phillips, at COR Therapeutics which was acquired by Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 2001.

In this 309-page book, Bates claimed that John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, was not killed by Union Army Soldiers on April 26, 1865, but successfully eluded capture altogether, and lived for many years thereafter under a series of assumed names, notably John St. Helen and David E. George. Personal life Bates was born on a plantation in Itawamba County, Mississippi, in 1848.1860 Federal Census for Itawamba County, Mississippi, p. 12 He was the ninth of 12 children of planter Henderson Wesley Bates (1807‚Äì1869) and Eliza Elvira Jarratt Bourland (1815‚Äì1900). Finis Bates studied law in Carrollton, Mississippi, and in the 1870s he and his family moved to Texas, where he met John St. Helen. Bates returned to Mississippi, then moved to Memphis, Tennessee, after the death of his first wife and his subsequent marriage. Family In 1869, Bates married Bertie Lee Money (born 1851). They had two daughters, Emma and Olga Bates, and a son, Bertram Money Bates Sr. (1870‚Äì1934), who married Anne H. \\"Annie\\" Koen. Following Bertie's death, in 1890 Finis married Madge Young Doyle (1869‚Äì1944), daughter of Washington Jackson Phepoe Doyle (1838‚Äì1907) and Minerva Hasbrook Selden (born 1851). Finis' youngest son by his second wife was Langdon Doyle Bates (1900‚Äì1989). Langdon D. Bates married Bertye Kathleen Talbert (1907‚Äì1997). They had a daughter named Kathleen Doyle Bates, better known as actress Kathy Bates.Scott's Movie Comments \\"Booth escaped\\" theory=John St. Helen According to The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth, in 1873, Bates met John St. Helen, a liquor and tobacco merchant in Granbury, Texas. The man had a particular tendency toward the theatrical and could recite Shakespeare from memory. Bates and St. Helen cultivated a friendship over five years. In 1878, St. Helen became ill, stating: > \\"I am dying. My name is John Wilkes Booth, and I am the assassin of > President Lincoln. Get the picture of myself from under the pillow. I leave > it with you for my future identification. Notify my brother Edwin Booth, of > New York City.\\"Bates, Finis L., \\"St. Helen's Illness\\", The Escape and > Suicide of John Wilkes Booth, J.L.

Nichols, Memphis, TN, 1907, p. 42 * The identity of the man mortally wounded in the Garrett tobacco barn by Thomas P. \\"Boston\\" Corbett was a plantation overseer by the name of Ruddy. St. Helen/Booth had asked Ruddy to fetch his papers, which had fallen out of his pocket while crossing the Rappahannock River. Ruddy was able to retrieve Booth's papers, and while still in possession of them, Ruddy was mortally wounded in the Garrett barn, thus leading his captors to believe that he was Booth.Bates, Finis L., \\"The Man Killed at the Garret Home\\", The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth, J.L. Nichols, Memphis, TN, 1907, pp. 63‚Äì64 Shortly thereafter, St. Helen moved on to Leadville, Colorado, to pursue mining, and Bates moved to Memphis, losing track of St. Helen.Bates, Finis L., \\"The Separation\\", The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth, J.L. Nichols, Memphis, TN, 1907, p. 83 Bates claimed not to have believed St. Helen's story at the time, calling it an \\"unpleasant side of St. Helen's character.\\" Bates described him as \\"modest, unobtrusive and congenial, ever pleasant in association with me. He was a social favorite with all with whom he came in contact.\\"Bates, Finis L., \\"The Man Killed at the Garret Home\\", The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth, J.L. Nichols, Memphis, TN, 1907, p. 81 Despite his claims of disbelief, in 1900, Bates wrote the War Department in an unsuccessful attempt to claim the $100,000 reward advertised following Lincoln's assassination. He also informed the Department of State. Bates also wrote the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the early 1920s about his theory concerning Booth's purported escape. David E. George David E George at Penniman's David E. George - possibly David Elihu GeorgeAccording to James Hall, in 1902 David E. George filled out an insurance application, giving his personal information thereon as follows: David Elihu George. born on June 14, 1844 in French Camp, Choctaw County, Mississippi. - a house painter with an appetite for drink and a knack for quoting Shakespeare, committed suicide by ingesting poison on January 13, 1903, while staying at room number 4 in the Grand Avenue Hotel in Enid, Oklahoma. He had purchased the strychnine from the Watrous Drug Store, telling the clerk, Frank Corry, that he wanted \\"to poison a dog\\" who had kept him up the night before.Rockwell, Stella, ed., Garfield County, Oklahoma, 1907-1982, Vol. II, Garfield Historical Society, Josten's Publishing Company, Topeka, Kansas. 1982., pp. 789‚Äì792 Shortly thereafter, store owner Eugene Watrous, unaware that his clerk had just sold George strychnine, provided additional strychnine to George \\"to poison a cat.\\"Campbell, W.P., The Escape and Wanderings of J. Wilkes Booth until Ending of the Trail by Suicide in Oklahoma, 1922, page 100 By 10:30 a.m. that morning, other tenants complained of hearing groans and moans in George's locked room. They managed their way into George's room and found him writhing in pain. Despite the efforts of Dr. Champion, the local doctor, the poison had claimed him by 11 a.m. that morning. Acting Coroner Joe S. Jacobs assembled a coroner's jury, which included Mayor Charles O. Wood, and determined that George had died of alcohol and poison induced heart failure. Shortly after George's death, Methodist Episcopal minister Rev. Enoch Covert HarperRev. Enoch Covert Harper ( April 18, 1847 - Feb. 13, 1906 ) - A good obituary of Rev. E. C. Harper can be found in the Oklahoma Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church - Fifteenth Annual Session - Official Record - Held at Enid, Oklahoma, October 10‚Äì15, 1906 - Vol. 4, No. 3 - W. E. Woodward and W. H. Rose ( Publishing Committee ) - To read this obituary see: ( https://books.google.com/books?id=LuUpAAAAYAAJ&pg;=RA3-PA48 ) - Rev. Enoch C. Harper died at Mulhall, Oklahoma. His remains were transported to Ponca City, Kay County, Oklahoma and buried beside those of his first wife in the I. O. O. F. ( International Order of Odd Fellows ) Cemetery in Ponca City. His first wife was named Allis Groves Nicks ( sometimes misspelled Alice Groves Nicks ) ( April 20, 1854 - Aug. 5, 1898 ). came to view the body, and relayed a story to William H. Ryan, who was embalming the body. In April 1900, while staying in El Reno, Oklahoma, George had reportedly confessed to Mrs. Jessie May Kuhn ( who was soon to be Rev. E. C. Harper's second wife - they were married on May 23, 1900 )Mrs. Jessie May Kuhn ( born February 1872 ) - See the following references: ( https://familysearch.org/search/recordDetails/show?uri=https://api.familysearch.org/records/pal:/MM9.1.r/1KS2-3DL/p4 ) and ( https://familysearch.org/search/recordDetails/show?uri=https://api.familysearch.org/records/pal:/MM9.1.r/MMTP- BST/p_18054062 ) that he was John Wilkes Booth.Quigley, Christine, \\"John Wilkes Booth (a.k.a.

George was also quoted as saying, \\"I killed the best man that ever lived.\\" Shortly after George's death, Dr. R.W. Baker examined the body and X-rayed it, but refused to reveal his results on \\"ethical grounds.\\" =George's \\"afterlife\\"= The former Grand Avenue Hotel in Enid, Oklahoma George's body was sent to undertaker William Broadwell Penniman,William Broadwell Penniman ( April 10, 1870 - March 1, 1931 ) - He was born in Honesdale, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, the son of Francis Blair Penniman, Jr. ( 1845 - Jan. 31, 1893 ) ( aka Frank Penniman ) and Susan Fox ( 1842-1920 ). For more information on William's immediate family see: ( https://familysearch.org/search/recordDetails/show?uri=https://api.familysearch.org/records/pal:/MM9.1.r/M3X1-H3H/p2 ). After residing in Enid, Oklahoma for several years, he left Enid and took up residence in Columbus, Ohio, where he was a salesman for a casket company. At the time of his death in Columbus, his address was 522 Eastmoor Boulevard. His obituary appeared in the March 4, 1931 issue ( page 2A ) of the Columbus Dispatch. His body was shipped to the Glen Dyberry Cemetery in Honesdale, PA, where it was buried on March 5, 1931. W. B. Penniman's grandfather ( Francis Blair Penniman, Sr. [Nov. 13, 1812 - July 10, 1889] ) and father are also buried in the Glen Dyberry Cemetery in Honesdale. For more information on William's obituary see: ( http://www.columbuslibrary.org/cmlcnix/fullrecord.cfm?articleid=434210&abstract;=Obituary&publication;=Columbus%20Dispatch&articledate;=1931-03-04%2000%3A00%3A00.0&page;=2%20A&byline;=&searchidlist;=429758%2C434210&sort;=Desc&afterdate;=1990&beforedate;=1996&searchindex;=S&pub;=ALL&headline;=. ) who hesitated to have him buried until the body could be claimed. On December 31, 1902, George had drawn up a will with local lawyer Niles Houston, and it was filed with Judge Milton C. Garber on January 16, 1903. However, the property listed in the will ultimately proved non-existent, and the body remained unclaimed and unburied at Penniman's. The arsenic embalmed body sat for eight years on display in Enid at Penniman's establishment. Penniman had tied the body to a chair, opened its eyes, and placed a newspaper in its lap, creating a spectacle for passersby in the Enid downtown. As a young boy, writer Marquis James led dime tours into the funeral home to view the mummified body where it lay on a shelf. According to Penniman, 10,000 people viewed George's body during its time in Enid, including a few who clipped hair, buttons, and one even attempted to remove his ear.Grice, Gordon, \\"The Mummy\\", Oklahoma Today, Vol. 54, No. 6, November 2004, pp. 54‚Äì57. Other papers found on George requested Finis Bates to be summoned. On January 23, 1903, Bates identified the body as that of his old acquaintance John St. Helen. Ultimately, with no one else to claim it, the body ended up in Bates's care. Bates stored it in the garage of his home located at 1234 Harbert Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee, and toured the alleged mummy of Booth in circus sideshows until after World War I.Finger, Michael, \\"Mummy Mystery\\", Memphis Flyer, September 20, 2007 The body was shown at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair,Logsdon, Guy, \\"Booth Legend \\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture but was rejected by the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.Wallis, Michael, \\"The South's Avenging Angel,\\" The Real Wild West, The Creation of the American West, pp. 35‚Äì37 In 1920, Bates tried to interest the automaker Henry Ford in buying it for $1,000, but Ford refused. William B. Evans (died May 19, 1935) - a charter member of the Showmen's League of America (which is headquartered in Chicago) who was known as the \\"Carnival King of the Southwest\\" - rented the mummy in 1920, paying Bates $1,000 every five months.Johnston, Alva, \\"John Wilkes Booth on Tour\\", Saturday Evening Post, February 10, 1938 In 1920, while traveling to San Diego, the mummy came out unscathed from a trainwreck, where eight of Evans' employees and many of his circus animals died. Before Evans could reestablish a tour, the mummy was kidnapped. Evans ran ads in The Billboard offering a $1,000 reward for its return. Ultimately, the kidnapper himself turned in the mummy for its reward. Evans wanted to return it to Finis Bates, but Bates had died in 1923. Bates' widow sold the mummy to Evans for $1,000. Evans moved to a potato farm in Declo, Idaho, where he displayed George's body in a Pullman train car.Cheney, Thomas E., \\"Facts and Folklore in the Story of John Wilkes Booth,\\" Western Folklore, Vol. 22, No. 3 (Jul., 1963), pp. 171‚Äì177 James Newton Wilkerson (May 11, 1866 - Dec. 13, 1944) - a Kansas City lawyer and expert on John Wilkes Booth - examined the mummy in 1928, comparing its scars to those of J. W. Booth, and began touring the Southwest with it, incorporating as the American Historical Research Society. Enraged by its presence, Veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic, threatened to lynch the mummy. Wilkerson and Evans were often run out of town by health officials and policemen, and ultimately, the two disbanded. Evans died in 1935, killed during a holdup in Chicago. In 1931, the Chicago Press Club hired six doctors led by Dr. Orlando Franke Scott (1885-1950) to examine the mummy: > [...]\\"a scarred right eyebrow that arched upwards, a thickening on the > knuckle joint of the right thumb, and a piece of skin missing from the back > of the neck [...] X-rays of the head, hands, and legs showed a thickening of > the tissues over the right eyebrow, a thickening in the bones of the right > thumb, and a marked thickening of the left fibula at its lower end, > indicating an earlier fracture.\\" The results were not conclusive nor widely accepted. The event was viewed as a publicity stunt, and the doctors did not examine other elements such as height and facial features. X-rays from this examination were later displayed with the body, which now had a large opening in its backside as a result. In 1932, Joseph Barney Harkin\\"Speaking of Pictures is this John Wilkes Booth's body?\\", LIFE, Vol. 5, No. 2, Jul 11, 1938, pp. 4‚Äì7 of the Wallace-Hagenbeck Circus bought the mummy, then named \\"John\\" for $5,000. Joseph and Agnes Harkin shared the back of a truck with \\"John\\" by night, and displayed him by day. Ultimately, in 1937, Harkin teamed up with Jay Gould's Million Dollar Spectacle, which displayed \\"John\\" for 25 cents admission. It was eventually seized as collateral for debt repayment. In the 1950s, \\"John\\" was stored in a Philadelphia basement. R. K. Verbeck purchased \\"John\\" from a female landlord who had held it as collateral from a man who had died owing her rent. Verbeck paid $15.00 and in 1958, traveled back to Philadelphia to claim it, but when he arrived, the entire neighborhood had been razed, and \\"John\\" was gone. It was last seen in a midwestern carnival in the late 1970s. The 1937 short film The Man in the Barn by Jacques Tourneur revisits the story of David E. George as Booth.Fujiwara, Chris, Jacques Tourneur: the cinema of nightfall, 1998, page 51 The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth (1907) In 1907, Finis L. Bates published The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth to support his claim that the mummy of George was, in fact, the corpse of Booth. The book was published as The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth with several variations of the following subtitle, The First True Account of Lincoln's Assassination, Containing a Complete Confession by Booth Many Years After the Crime, Giving in Full Detail the Plans, Plot and Intrigue of the Conspirators, and the Treachery of Andrew Johnson, then Vice-President of the United States. Written for the Correction of History. Memphis publishers Pilcher Printing Company, Bates Publishing Company and Historical Publishing Company; J. L. Nichols & Company of Naperville, Illinois, Atlanta, Georgia; etc.; the Retail Druggist Journal of Detroit; and G.M. Smith of Boston all published various editions of Bates' book in 1907. Bates, Henry Ford and Fred L. Black In order to understand how and why Henry Ford became involved with Finis L. Bates and the controversy over the alleged escape of John Wilkes Booth, it will be necessary to set forth here a little background information on some of Ford's activities in the 1916-1925 time period. Ford v. The Chicago Daily Tribune In May 1916, the Chicago Daily Tribune published an interview between journalist Charles Newton Wheeler and Henry Ford which contained Ford's now famous statement: > \\"History is more or less bunk. It's tradition. We don't want tradition. We > want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinker's > damn is the history we make today....\\" Wheeler, Charles Newton, \\"Fight to > Disarm His Life's Work, Henry Ford Vows\\" The Chicago Daily Tribune, May 25, > 1916, p. 10 About a month later the Chicago Daily Tribune printed an editorial by Clifford Samuel Raymond who wrote: > \\"Inquiry at the Henry Ford offices in Detroit discloses the fact that > employees of Ford who are members of or recruits in the National Guard will > lose their places. No provision will be made for any one dependent upon > them. Their wages will stop, their families may get along in any fashion > possible; their positions will be filled, and if they come back safely and > apply for their jobs again they will be on the same footing as any other > applicants. This is the rule for Ford employees everywhere....\\"Raymond, > Clifford Samuel, \\"Henry Ford is an Anarchist\\", The Chicago Daily Tribune, > June 23, 1916, p. 6. > \\"If Ford allows this rule of his shops to stand he will reveal himself not > merely as an ignorant idealist but as an anarchistic enemy of the nation > which protects him in his wealth....\\" In September 1916 Ford's legal counsel filed a libel suit in the U.S. District Court at Chicago against the Chicago Daily Tribune, seeking $1 million in damages for its \\"ignorant idealist\\" and an \\"anarchistic enemy of the nation\\" statements.\\"Ford Sues for Million Dollars\\", History of the Chicago Tribune, 1922, pp, 95‚Äì103 Originally this case was pending before U. S. District Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis of Chicago, but Ford's legal counsel withdrew it from Landis' jurisdiction and filed a new libel suit against the Chicago Daily Tribune on July 14, 1917 in the State Court of Michigan at Detroit. However, the Chicago Daily Tribune applied for a change of venue on the grounds that too many people in Detroit worked for Ford, and it was agreed among all the parties concerned that Circuit Judge James G. Tucker of the Circuit Court of Macomb County at Mt. Clemens, Michigan would hear the case instead. Jury selection for the trial began on May 12, 1919. The case dragged on for about three months, and the jury finally delivered its verdict on August 14, 1919, finding in favor of Ford and awarding him nominal damages of six cents. During Ford's 8 days on the witness stand he was asked to clarify the meaning of the statement he had made to Charles N. Wheeler that \\"History is more or less bunk.\\" Ford's explanation to the court of what he had meant by this statement provoked extreme ridicule, not only from representatives of the Chicago Daily Tribune but from many observers of the trial proceedings worldwide. Ford became so annoyed over the public response to his explanation of his now famous statement, that in September 1919 after his libel suit was finally over, he vowed to prove to the world it really is true that \\"History is more or less bunk.\\" Fred L. Black Bates' 1907 book on Booth had come to Ford's attention and in September 1919, Ford decided to vigorously explore the idea that if Bates' claims about John Wilkes Booth could be proven to be true by groundbreaking and exhaustive research, it would lend great credibility to his statement that \\"History is more or less bunk.\\" Ford instructed Frederick Lee Black (Jan. 26, 1891 ‚Äì Nov. 7, 1971), business manager of The Dearborn Independent, to locate Finis L. Bates and to begin investigating the validity of the claims in Bates' book. Black did locate Bates and invited him to Dearborn to tell his story, whereupon Bates tried to interest Ford in buying Booth's alleged mummy from him. Between 1919 and 1923, Black, amidst his many other duties for Ford, conducted extensive research, not only into Bates' specific claims as presented in his 1907 book, but into many other controversial topics connected with the Lincoln assassination as well. However, Black at the end of his research concluded that many of Bates' claims were untrue, and advised Ford not to purchase the mummy.Evans, C. Wyatt, \\"Finis L. Bates and the Correction of History,\\" The Legend of John Wilkes Booth: Myth, Memory, and a Mummy, 2004, University Press of Kansas, pp. 124, 147 Black published some of his findings and conclusions in articles in The Dearborn Independent (primarily in the March, April, and May 1925 issues of the newspaper), and he also wrote a manuscript setting forth his research findings which was never published. An archive of the documents Fredrick Black collected and his manuscript are located in the Kresge Library at Oakland University in Michigan. Death Bates died at his home at 1234 Harbert Street in Memphis, Tennessee, of \\"cardio-renal\\" failure on November 29, 1923, and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

History No. 92 Squadron was formed at Kingaroy, Queensland, on 25 May 1945. Its first aircraft, an Avro Anson trainer, was delivered on 19 June followed by a Bristol Beaufort light bomber the next day.

Chronology *The 3rd Reconnaissance Company was activated on 16 September 1942 at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California as the Company E (Scouts), 3rd Tank Battalion, and assigned to the 3rd Marine Division. *On 20 April 1943, they were redesignated as 3rd Scout Company, Headquarters Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. *On 1 July 1943, they were redesignated as Company D (Scout), 3rd Tank Battalion. *On 1 April 1944, they were redesignated Division Reconnaissance Company, Headquarters Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. *Reactivated on 1 March 1952 at Camp Pendleton, they were designated as Reconnaissance Company, Headquarters Battalion and assigned to the 3rd Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force. *In August 1953, they deployed to Camp McGill, Japan; and subsequently redeployed in April 1956 to Camp Hauge, Okinawa. *They were deactivated on 14 April 1958 and reactivated the following day, 15 April 1958, at Camp Schwab, Okinawa, as the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. *3rd Recon Battalion deployed to various locations in the Western Pacific until its stand down and deactivation in 1992. *After de-activation, 3rd Recon Battalion companies devolved to three Regiments in 3rd Marine Division: A Company- Recon Company, 3rd Marine Regiment, B Company - Recon Company, 9th Marine Regiment, and D Company - Recon Company, 4th Marine Regiment. C Company personnel were folded into B and D companies prior to disbandment. *In January 1994, Recon companies, 4th Marine Regiment and 9th Marine Regiment merged to form Recon Company, Headquarters Battalion, 3rd Marine Division at Camp Schwab, Okinawa. Recon Company, 3rd Marine Regiment remained at the Regimental level. *On 2 June 2000, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion was again reactivated by combining the force and company reconnaissance elements. History=World War II In January‚ÄìFebruary 1943, they deployed to Auckland, New Zealand. During the recapture of Guam, the 3rd Marine Division and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade each had its own reconnaissance company. Major General Lemuel C. Shepherd split the 3rd Division's scout and sniper company into its three platoons to attach each to the brigade's regiments, the 4th and 22nd.Bruce F. Meyers, \\"Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Units in the Pacific, 1942‚Äì1945\\", (Annapolis, MD: Naval Press Institute, 2004). The 22nd Marine Regiment's commander, Colonel Merlin F. Schneider, kept his regiment's assigned recon platoon close to the command post (CP). They were used to for rapid deployment on recon missions for the regimental commander, or when not being used on a specific mission, they guarded the CP. Colonel Schneider retired with the rank of brigadier general after receiving the Navy Cross and Bronze Star. At night, a landing was made on W-Day, General Shepherd and each of his regimental commanders waited for the usual nightly Japanese counterattacks. The Japanese forces was led by Japanese Colonel Tsunetaro Suenaga of the 38th Regiment from the Imperial Japanese Army's 29th Division. At 2130, Colonel Suenaga probed his attacks at the juncture of the regimental boundaries between the 3rd Marine Division's 4th Marines and the Marine Brigade's 22nd Marines. The enemy charged in force and overran the forward Marine lines and began to penetrate the thinly held rear areas. Using grenades, small arms, mortars, bayonet and close quarters combat, they were able to hold of the attacking Japanese army. However, one Japanese element during their counterattack managed to reach the 75 mm pack howitzer artillery position before they were ultimately stopped by the gun crews. A Japanese company of infiltrators approached the regimental command post. At this point, the Marine defenders, all hands‚Äîclerks, cooks, and supernumeries, rallied around 1st Lt. Dennis Chavez, Jr. recon platoon. They too immediately stopped the Japanese attack. By dawn, the Japanese 28th Infantry Regiment was eliminated. Colonel Suenaga was wounded and later killed in these attacks.Robert Aurthur and Kenneth Cohlmia, \\"The Third Marine Division\\", ed. Robert T. Vance (Wash., DC: Infantry Journal Press, 1948), 151. Within the 1st Marine Prov. Brigade, on the night of 25‚Äì26 July 1944, Colonel Craig, the commanding officer of 9th Marines and the adjoining 21st Marines were concerned about the front line that was left open.Benis M. Frank and Henry I. Shaw, Jr., \\"History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II\\"; Volume 5: Victory and Occupation (New York City, NY: Penguin Books, 1990). Craig opted to use his regimental scout platoon to help fill the gap between the regiments. At about 2330, a forward operating post reported increased activity. By midnight, artillery and mortar fire bombarded the area starting another major counterattack by the Japanese. As a consequence, the lightly armed scout platoon was forced to fall back. The last reconnaissance on Guam was conducted by a mechanized reconnaissance-in-force. A force consisted of Alpha, Echo (Scouts), and H&S; Company of 3rd Tank Battalion; and I Company of 21st Marines. During the last major actions beginning 3 August 1944, the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) had secured a series of roads that junctioned in Finegayan Village, in the northern section of the islands. Lieutenant Colonel Hartnoll J. Withers led the group, moving north-northwest. Two M3 Half-track, two jeeps for communications purposes and one platoon of tanks supported by an infantry platoon were maneuvering toward Road Junction 177. Their column was immediately hit by heavy concentrated fire from 75-mm and 105-m artillery, tanks, mortars and heavy small-arms and machine guns. The Marines returned fire and after two hours, the Marines managed to destroy two of the 75 mm guns, one Japanese tank, and several machine-gun nests. Recognizing the Japanese held the advantage in terrain and cover, the Marines withdrew their forces back. Later it was determined that the attack was against a full Japanese battalion of Rikusentai, the elite Special Naval Landing Force. Guam was finally declared secured on 10 August 1944, after an intense three-week battle. In December 1945, they returned to Camp Pendleton, and were deactivated on 31 December 1945. Vietnam War The first U.S. military force that landed during the Vietnam War were two Marine units. On 10‚Äì14 April 1965, two battalion landing teams (BLT) of 3rd Marine Regiment landed on the beaches of Da Nang, South Vietnam unopposed. They were the 2nd and 3rd Battalion from the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. Their objectives were to secure Da Nang Air Base and establish an effective beachhead.Edward F. Murphy, \\"Semper Fi‚ÄîVietnam; From Da Nang to the DMZ: Marine Corps Campaigns, 1965‚Äì1975\\", (New York City, NY: Ballantine Publishing Group, 1997). The Marines made their encounter with a small company of Viet Cong on 22 April 1965. A recon patrol from D Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion was scouting 13 kilometers southwest of Da Nang. The Marine patrol was accompanied by a few platoons from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). After a brief intense exchange of small-arms fire, the outnumbered recon Marines radioed in for support. An infantry company from Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines (BLT 1/3) reinforced the small group of D Company and the ARVN. The combined force was able to push the hostile force back several kilometers before losing them in the heavily foliaged terrain. Two days later on 24 April, a recon squad positioned two kilometers south of Da Nang fell under a surprise attack by VC as the Marines were setting up defensive positions for the night. Although the firefight lasted for only a few minutes, each side lost two men. The beachhead was secured a couple of weeks later. In the later afternoon of 7 May 1965, elements of the 3rd Reconnassaisnce Battalion arrived at Chu Lai from Da Nang and secured the beachhead's southern flank as BLT 1/4 was setting up several kilometers inland. A few days later, BLT 3/3 arrived from Okinawa, and 3rd Recon Battalion returned to Da Nang. Actions that summer led to a Marine, 1st Lt. Frank S. Reasoner, becoming the first Marine of the war to receive the Medal of Honor. On 12 July 1965, an 18-man patrol from A Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion led by Reasoner was under fire about 20 kilometers southwest of Da Nang Air Base. Reasoner's patrol was under a barrage of heavy fire. His radio operator was hit by enemy fire. Reasoner came to the operator's aid as he provided cover, killing two VC and interrupting hostile automatic weapons fire. As Reasoner was about to render hasty first aid to his radioman, he was mortally wounded.

The 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion served in the Gulf War including being involved in the Battle of Khafji. In March 2004, elements of B Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On 13 February 2005, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion deployed to Iraq to conduct combat operations in the Al Anbar Province, and was the focus of the documentary film Alpha Company: Iraq Diary. From September 2006 to April 2007, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion deployed to Iraq to conduct combat operations in the Al Anbar Province. From April to November 2008, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion deployed to Iraq to conduct combat operations in Al Anbar Province for its third combat tour. In November 2009, elements of the Battalion deployed in support Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. In May 2011, the Battalion deployed again to Afghanistan, this time to the Sangin District of Helmand Province. They conducted a Relief-In-Place (RIP) with 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, taking over Patrol Base (PB) Alcatraz and began conducting operations in early June, returning home to Okinawa in December 2011.

Area code 412 was one of the original area codes established in 1947. It originally covered the entire southwestern corner of the state, from Butler County to the West Virginia border. On February 1, 1998, nearly all of the old 412 territory outside of Allegheny County was split off into area code 724, which completely surrounds 412. Bell Atlantic, the main telephone provider in Pennsylvania, preferred to implement it as an overlay in order to spare residents the burden of changing their numbers. However, overlays were still a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance due to the need for ten-digit dialing. For this reason, 724 was implemented as a split, making it one of the six pairs of \\"doughnut area codes\\" in the numbering plan. This was intended as a long-term solution, but within two years both 412 and 724 were close to exhaustion once again due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. By this time, overlays had gained more acceptance, and for this reason area code 878 was overlaid onto both 412 and 724 on August 17, 2001. Although numbers were not assigned in 878 until 2013 (and are only being assigned in the 724 area until 412 runs out of prefixes), ten-digit dialing has been mandatory across southwestern Pennsylvania since 2001.

Topspin on a ball propelled through the air imparts a downward force that causes the ball to drop, due to its interaction with the air (see Magnus effect). Topspin is the opposite of backspin. Baseball In baseball, the curveball, a type of pitch which usually has downward movement, is thrown in such a way as to put topspin on the ball. Its close relatives are the slider and the slurve. The \\"curve\\" of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher. Cue sports In snooker, pocket billiards and billiards, players use topspin to keep the cue ball moving, including after it hits other balls. They get top spin by hitting the cue against the top of the ball. Cricket In cricket, a top-spinner is a type of delivery bowled by a cricketer bowling either wrist spin or finger spin. In either case, the bowler imparts the ball with top spin by twisting it with his or her fingers prior to delivery. In both cases, the topspinner is the halfway house between the stock delivery and the wrong'un - in the wrist spinner's case his googly, and in the finger spinner's case his doosra. A topspinning cricket ball behaves similarly to top spin shots in tennis or table tennis. The forward spinning motion impedes air travelling over the ball, but assists air travelling underneath. The difference in air pressure above and underneath the ball (described as the Magnus effect) acts as a downward force, meaning that the ball falls earlier and faster than normal. In cricketing terms, this means that the ball drops shorter, falls faster and bounces higher than might otherwise be anticipated by the batsman. These properties are summed up in cricketing terms as a \\"looping\\" or \\"loopy\\" delivery. Also, the ball travels straight on, as compared to a wrist spin or finger spin stock delivery that breaks to the left or right on impact. A batsman may easily be deceived by the ball, particularly given that the action is quite similar to the stock delivery. In delivery, the topspinner is gripped like a normal side spinner. For a legspinner the back of the hand faces the cover region and the palm of the hand faces the mid wicket region at release. For an offspiner, these directions are reversed. The ball is then released either with the seam going straight on to the batsman, or with a scrambled seam. A spinner will frequently bowl deliveries with both top spin and side spin. A ball presenting with roughly equal amounts of both is usually called an \\"overspinning\\" leg break or off break. Tactically, a bowler will bowl topspinners to draw a batsman forward before using the dip and extra bounce to deceive them. In particular, batsmen looking to sweep or drive are vulnerable as the bounce can defeat them. In modern-day cricket Anil Kumble is considered the foremost leg spin exponent of the top spinner. Muttiah Muralitharan is an example of an offspinner who frequently uses this delivery. Golf In golf, shots may also have topspin, although this is nearly always the undesirable consequence of a topped shot. Racquet sports The topspin shot (also called a topspinner) is primarily used by tennis players and table tennis players as either a \\"safe shot\\" or rally ball, or it can also be used to construct a point. For example, a player may hit three topspin shots crosscourt, and then on the fourth shot hit a flat ball or a slice down the line to set him/herself up to win the point. A topspin shot can be generated by hitting the ball with an up-and-forward swing, with the racquet facing below the direction it is moving. A topspin shot is the opposite of a \\"slice\\". Table tennis Top spin in table tennis. The ball would have fallen off the table if trajectory had not bent downwards due to spin. In competitive table tennis, effective command of topspin is indispensable, not only in order to be able to execute an attack shot counter to a backspin ball, but also in order to be able to execute a speed shot when the ball is already lower than the net. In table tennis the best defense for a top spin loop is a block close to the table which involves a firm fixation of the paddle and a slight movement forwards with an angle less than 90 degrees. Another way of defending the topspin is to counterattack with a topspin or slice the ball. Tennis Other than trajectory in air, top spin affects the bounce of the ball as shown. In tennis, because of a net being in the middle of the court, using topspin will increase the player's consistency. Topspin also allows a player a greater margin of error. Because topspin brings the ball down toward the ground quicker, a player can hit the ball higher over the net, thus increasing the margin of error. This may help in lobbing an opponent who is waiting at the net, or playing directly to a player's feet. Hitting low to high as the player approaches the contact point will impart lift. Keeping the racquet face (the strings) slightly closed from perpendicular will impart the topspin to the ball that the player wants. However, balls that bounce lower due to greater force or backspin are much more difficult to return using a grip that confers topspin such as the semi-western and western grips, as the racket is angled too far downwards to 'lift' the ball back over the net. As such, topspin is more effectively used on slower, higher bouncing surfaces such as clay. Topspin is also far more difficult to impart on backhand strokes due to the physical limitations of an arm stretched across the body. =Physical explanation= The Magnus effect, demonstrated on a ball. v represents the wind velocity, the arrow F the resulting force towards the side of lower pressure. Topspin on a shot imparts a downward force that causes the ball to drop, due to its interaction with the air (see Magnus effect). In racquet sports, it can be generated by hitting the ball with an up-and-forward swing, with the racquet facing below the direction it is moving. A topspin shot is the opposite of the slice; topspin itself is the opposite of backspin. One way of explaining the Magnus effect is that - because of the rotation and the fact that air acts as a viscous or \\"sticky\\" substance on the surface of the ball, a stream of air in the wake of the ball is being ejected upwards. As a reaction to this, the ball is pushed downwards. Often Bernoulli's principle is used to explain the topspin effect, as the difference in speed between ball surface and air is greater on the top of the ball. For example, if the air flowing past the bottom of the ball is moving faster than the air flowing past the top then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the ball will be lower below than above. In other words, since there is more air friction occurring on the top surface of the ball compared to the bottom, this differential causes a greater pressure to be applied on the top of the ball, resulting in the ball being pushed down. =Competitive utility= The topspin shot is very effective on hard surfaces. The ball spins forward and descends toward the ground quicker, so it can be hit with more force compared to another type of shot. On most court surfaces, topspin also makes the ball bounce higher. As a result, it is often used on clay or \\"soft\\" court surfaces which have a naturally higher bounce in order to make the ball harder for the opponent to hit. An opponent with a one-handed backhand is especially vulnerable to a topspin shot because it is difficult to hit a high ball with a one-handed backhand. Disc golf In disc golf topspin is used during spiking and serving to allow players to hit the ball harder , while ensuring that the ball remains in play in the opponent's court. Topspin also stabilises the ball during its flight, allowing for more accurate serving.

The Squadron's B-24 Liberator bombers arrived in July. While the Squadron began training on these aircraft, the war ended before it reached operational status. Following the end of the war the squadron operated in the transport role until December 1945. No. 102 Squadron was disbanded on 19 March 1946. History No. 102 Squadron was formed at Cecil Plains, Queensland, on 30 May 1945 as one of the seven RAAF operational squadrons equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. The squadron's first commanding officer was Squadron Leader John Dennett. The squadron's first draft of 220 airmen arrived on 22 June, and the unit had a strength of 600 personnel on 1 July. No. 102 Squadron's first B-24s were delivered on 4 July, with further heavy bombers and a single Avro Anson trainer being delivered on the 8th of the month; the Anson was later replaced by a de Havilland Tiger Moth. Following the delivery of its B-24s, No. 102 Squadron began an intensive training program; however, the war ended before this was completed. The unit began practising formation flying in early August, and on the 16th of the month nine of its B-24s flew in formation over Brisbane to mark Victory in the Pacific Day. From September to the late December 1945, No. 102 Squadron aircraft operated out of RAAF Station Amberley, from where they flew supplies to Australian forces in Morotai, Finschhafen in New Guinea and Bougainville and returned with demobilised personnel. Two officers from the squadron were also assigned to No. 82 Wing's headquarters on Morotai from September to assist with planning air evacuation flights. No. 102 Squadron's flying program tapered off during December 1945, and ended on the 20th of the month. The squadron began to disband in early January 1946, and it was gradually reduced in size. No. 102 Squadron was disbanded at Cecil Plains on 19 March 1946. The unit did not suffer any flying accidents during its brief existence.

Common themes in recurring dreams Through psychological analyses and studies, some recurrent themes have been identified. These include dreaming of being chased and pursued, which has been repeatedly demonstrated as being the most frequently experienced recurrent theme. The following themes below have been found to contribute to more than half of recurring dreams:Yu, C. (2010). Recurrence of typical dreams and the instinctual and delusional predispositions of dreams. Dreaming, 20(4), 254-279 *Difficulties with house maintenance *Teeth falling out ‚Äì Sigmund Freud believed that if a woman had a recurring dream of her teeth falling out that she unconsciously longed to have children. He believed that if a man had this dream he was afraid of castration.Delaney, G. (1997). In Your Dreams: Falling, Flying and Other Dream Themes. New York: Harper San Francisco *Discovering new rooms in a house ‚Äì Freud believed that houses represented bodies. Others thought finding new rooms represented the dreamer finding out new things about themselves or of their own potential. *Losing control of a vehicle *Being unable to find a toilet *Having the ability to fly The subjects of recurring dreams do vary. The following examples are also common: * Being held down or otherwise unable to move (compare sleep paralysis) * Nakedness in a public place * Being held back in school or failing a test or exam you didn't know about * Losing the ability to speak * Escaping or being caught in a tornado/storm * Drowning, or otherwise not being able to breathe * Finding lost items * Unable to turn on the lights in one's house * Being with a significant other * Missing a bus, plane or train, and possibly attempting to chase it * Having to return to an old school due to an unfinished assignment or other unresolved issues * Being chased by an animal or murderer. Psychological disorders associated with recurring dreams *Posttraumatic stress disorder: People suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder can often suffer from recurring dreams. These dreams are thought of as chronic nightmares that act as a symptom of PTSD. A study found that the degree of trauma had a positive relationship to distress related to dreams.Davis, J.

However, this theory has come with mixed reviews. Zadra et el. found in a study on this theory that 66% of recurrent dreams contained at least one threat. For the most part, these threats involved danger and were aimed at the dreamer themselves. In contrast however, they also found that less than 15% of recurrent dreams involved realistic situations that could prove critical to one's survival. They also found that the dreamer usually did not succeed at fleeing the threat. These provide mixed support for the theory originally proposed by Revonsuo.Zadra, A., Desjardins, S., & Marcotte, E.

Consciousness and Cognition, 15, 450-463 *Gestaltist dream theory - This theory views recurrent dreams as representing the person's current state of psychic imbalance. By bringing this imbalance to consciousness through the recurrent dream, it is possible for the person to restore their self-balance *Freud believed that recurrent traumatic dreams showed expressions of neurotic repetitive compulsions. *Jung believed that recurrent dreams played an important role in the integration of the psyche. *Culturalist dream theory, brought to light by Bonime in 1962, holds that recurrent dreams represent a lack of positive change or development in a person's personality. *Lucid dream theory holds that some people dream in recurrent form and it is a normal phenomenon.

Overcoming Nightmares [Recurrent Nightmares], http://www.lucidity.com/EWLD10.html Treatment methods for recurring dreams *Practicing relaxation techniques and imagery exercises before going to sleep is a popular treatment suggestion. By imagining the dream and an intentional task to be carried out during the dream, the person will remember to carry out that task when they are actually dreaming. Then, when it occurs in the dream it will act as a prerehearsal cue in order to remind the person that they are dreaming, where they then can interact with the dream imagery. Once this is achieved, they can consult with their therapist for the best way to modify their recurrent dream to make it less traumatizing. There are several different proposals suggested to go about doing this. *Confront and conquer the feared scene, suggested by Garfield in 1974. *Alter a small aspect of the dream, suggested by Halliday in 1982. *Have the dream ego engage in conciliatory dialogue along with hostile dream figures, suggested by Tholey in 1988 See also * Dream dictionary * Dream interpretation * Psychoanalytic dream interpretation * Relaxation technique  References  Category:Dream ","title":"Recurring dream"},{"id":"4440497","text":"USS Galaxy (IX-54), was a diesel motor yacht built in 1930 by Pusey and Jones Company, in Wilmington, Delaware for Mr. Bernard W.

This direction of spin imparts an upward force that lifts the ball (see Magnus effect). While a normal hit bounces well forward as well as up, backspin shots bounce higher and less forward. Backspin is the opposite of topspin. 4 phases in a backspin curve in Table Tennis In racket sports, the higher bounce imparted by backspin may make a receiver who has prepared for a different shot miss or mis-hit the ball when swinging. A backspin shot is also useful for defensive shots because a backspin shot takes longer to travel to the opponent, giving the defender more time to get back into position. Also, because backspin shots tend to bounce less far forward once they reach the opposite court, they may be more difficult to attack. This is especially important in table tennis because one must wait for the ball to bounce before hitting it, whereas in tennis the opponent may volley the ball. In golf, a well-struck shot will result in a large amount of backspin that will carry the ball higher into the air and farther. Backspin also helps with distance control, as if there is enough backspin, the ball will \\"check\\" if it lands on the putting surface, and sometimes even creep backwards (in the opposite direction that the ball was flying) upon landing.

He is sometimes called Abagelard and it is sometimes asserted that his father was originally named Abagelard as well. ( 1044 ‚Äì 1081) was the eldest son of Humphrey, count of Apulia and Calabria (1051‚Äì1057), and his Lombard wife, Gaitelgrima of Salerno, also known as Altrude. He was supposed to inherit his father's lands, but Robert Guiscard, his uncle and guardian, who was elected count on Humphrey's death, confiscated them. In April 1064, Abelard joined three discontented barons (Geoffrey I of Conversano; Joscelin, Lord of Molfetta; and Robert, Count of Montescaglioso) in rebellion against Robert, who had just left for Sicily. They received the aid, financial and military, of Perenos, the Byzantine duke of Durazzo, and held out for several years, neither making headway against Robert nor he against them. On 1 January 1068, Romanus Diogenes was acclaimed emperor in Constantinople and the Greeks transferred their military attention to the Seljuk threat to their east. The rebellion fell apart and by February only Geoffrey remained. Abelard was exiled, but Robert forgave him and gave him cities. Abelard was again at the head of a revolt later in December 1071. Then, he recruited not only the Byzantines, but his brother Herman, whose inheritance had also been confiscated by his guardian Guiscard at the same time, and the lords of Giovinazzo and Trani. To their aid came the prince of Capua, Richard Drengot, and the prince of Salerno, Gisulf II, both of whom feared the ascendancy of Robert Guiscard. Robert, however, did not leave the siege of Palermo. He preferred to ignore the insurrection, then spreading to Calabria, in favour of speeding up events in Sicily. Abbey of the Santissima Trinit√†, Venosa Palermo fell in 1072 and Robert returned to the peninsula the next year, easily putting down most of the rebels. However, he fell ill at Trani and was taken to Bari, where Sichelgaita, his wife, had the barons proclaim her son Roger Borsa his heir. Abelard was the only baron to dissent from the election of Roger, claiming that he was the rightful heir to the duchy. He rebelled yet again in 1078, with Geoffrey and Peter II of Trani again, and with the support of Jordan, Prince of Capua, Richard's son. He also married a daughter of the Bariot leader Argyritzos. A separate peace was made with Jordan and the rebellion, which was originally very well-organised, fell apart in 1079. Abelard was exiled in 1080. He travelled to Constantinople with his brother, where he was welcomed cordially by the Emperor Alexius I Comnenus. He died, perhaps assassinated, probably in Illyria, in 1081, around April. He was buried in Greece and never brought back to Venosa, where most of his family lies to this day.

This treasure is also rendered into English as \\"magic wishing mallet\\" \\"lucky hammer,\\" \\"the mallet of fortune\\", etc. In popular belief, the magic wooden hammer is a standard item held in the hand of the iconic deity Daikoku- ten, who is often represented as figurines, statues, netsukes, and in architecture. It is also a stock item in popular tales. In Issun-b≈çshi (\\"One- Inch Boy\\"), the hero gains the mallet defeating an ogre (oni) and amass wealth, while in modern embellishments, he even transforms himself into full adult-size. In Momotar≈ç (\\"Peach Boy\\"), the mallet is captured from the ogres in Onigashima, alongside the kakure mino (raincoat of invisibility) and kakurekasa (hat of invisibility) The notion that ogres possessed this prized mallet dates much earlier than the tales, which are part of the otogi-z≈çshi collection from the Muromachi period. It can be traced at as far back as The Tale of Heike (ca. 1240), or, if the instance of use in the work has any historicity, datable to before ca. 1118. In folkloristics, the uchide no kozuchi is catalogued in the Stith Thompson motif index scheme under \\"\\"magic hammer, D 1470.1.46\\". Issun b≈çshi In the legend, the one-inch tall Issun- boshi, after leaving his parents‚Äô home, comes under the employ of a wealthy daimy≈ç, whose daughter is an attractive princess. Although scorned for his height, he is given the job of accompanying the princess. While traveling together, they are attacked by an oni, who deals with pesky Issun-boshi by swallowing him. He defeats the Oni by pricking him from within with his needle/sword. The Oni spits out Issun-boshi and drops the 'Uchide-no-Kozuchi as he runs away. In the otogi-z≈çshi, he then shakes out opulent riches with the mallet and becomes a court favorite. In the better-known modernized versions, the princess uses the power of the mallet to grow him to full size. At the end of the story, Issun-b≈çshi and the princess are married. History=Etymology The word uchi de no kozuchi literally translates to \\"striking- out [little] hammer\\", or \\"hammer that strikes anything out [that is desired]\\". (Yamagata press, 1935, 1936, 1937; ÂØåÂ£´Â±ã„Éõ„ÉÜ„É´ 1940) In plainer speech it is understood that the hammer is to be shaken or swung. Early usage According to the (1179), the mallet is a \\"wonderful treasure,\\" such that when one goes out into a wide open field, it can be used to tap out a mansion, amusing men and women, useful servants, horse and cattle, food, and articles of clothing. However, all the items wished for reputed disappear at the sound of the bell tolling (hence the necessity of using it in a vacant field), and the moral of this Buddhist sermon-type tale (setsuwa) is that this is no treasure after all. In The Tale of Heike is an anecdote whereby a strangely outfitted person moving about in the night, is mistaken for an ogre (oni), and his kindling wood mistaken for the uchide no kozuchi, attesting to the belief even then that this was a treasure reputedly owned by the ogres. The anecdote occurs in scroll 6 of Heike, under the chapter on (Lady Gion). One night, near Gion Shrine, a figure is witnessed seemingly with hair like a bed of silver needles, and something glowing in his hand, which people feared to be an ogre, carrying the uchide no kozuchi for which these demon-kind beings are famous. The imperial guardsman Tadamori was ordered to investigate, and he discovered it was just a priest trying to illuminate a light in the chapel. The priest had put straws in his head to prevent getting damp. The same anecdote also occurs in the Genpei j≈çsuiki, which states that the priest was blowing on the embers in an earthenware container to keep it from going out, and when he did the straws on his head would illuminate and appear like silver needles. If this was a historical event, it happened sometime before or around the time when Kiyomori (born 1118) was conceived by the Lady Nyogo, who was then mistress to Retired Emperor Shirakawa, and Kiyomori's putative father Tadamori being the guardsman sent on the oni-hunt; but the tale is likely a \\"fable about Kiyomori's royal parentage\\". It has been observed that the treasures of the oni in the later tale of Momotar≈ç incorporated this older lore about treasures the ogres possessed. It has been observed that the same set of treasures as Momotar≈ç's oni, or practically so, are described in The Tale of H≈çgen, regarding Minamoto no Tametomo traveling to Onigashima island. Tametomo discovers that the islanders claimed to be descendants of oni, and named their now-lost treasures as the \\"cloak of invisibility, the hat of invisibility, floating shoes, sinking shoes, and sword\\" in some texts, and in older variant texts (Nakai codex group) one treasure is uchide no kutsu (shoes of wishing), a likely scribal error for uchide no kozuchi according to scholars.

In addition to simulcast programming at www.wvcr.com WVCR is perhaps the only non-commercial licensee to emulate the Variety hits format made popular by the Jack FM approach in the Capital Region. The format is very popular in the region with a very diverse selection from classic 1960s hits to current hits of today‚Äîsomething of a 2,800 Watt iPod for Baby Boomers. Unlike many Variety Hits stations, WVCR's Variety Hits format contains DJs that interact with listeners, and identify songs played on the station. In addition, the station frequently makes uses of jingles to identify themselves. This is a somewhat uncommon practice among stations with this format. On Sundays, WVCR breaks its format for a day of block programming known as Saint Sundays. the programming during this period includes Power & Praise, The Catholic Chorale, Polka Spotlight (19 years in 2008...however a Polish music program has been a continuous music staple on WVCR since February 1975), The Proud to be Irish Show (17 years in 2008), Smitty & Friends (Sinatra Era) and DeSelecciones, which just celebrated its 22nd year on the station in May 2009. The station also broadcasts Siena women's basketball games.  History  During the Fall semester of 1959, three Siena students envisioned a college radio station that would serve the resident students and faculty. Carrier current transmitters were built and installed in the faculty residence and the student residence. The station began broadcasting, using the call sign WVCR (Voice of Collegiate Radio). Although the station only broadcast for six to twelve hours a day, until the end of the spring semester, it was so well received by both students and faculty, that Siena College formally approved the station concept, supported extending its broadcast area to the surrounding community, and provided new broadcast studios in Plassmann Hall. During the spring semester of 1960, WVCR-FM started broadcasting on 89.1 MHz with the purpose of bringing campus news and sports to the off-campus student body (in those days, about 80% of the student body). The station operated with a Class D license from a tower on the Siena campus. The station broadcast a mixed format. The carrier current AM station continued broadcasting, mostly simulcasting the FM signal, but at times broadcasting material that was not intended for the FM outlet. Basketball games, the basis for continued funding by the college, were always broadcast over both AM and FM outlets. In 1970, PBS station WMHT obtained a full-power construction permit for the 89.1 frequency, paying WVCR to vacate the frequency. With WMHT's help, WVCR would relocate to 88.3 MHz in time for the 1971-72 academic year, upgrading to Class A status with a 360W transmitted signal from Pinnacle Mountain in New Scotland, NY. It was at this time WVCR adopted a more eclectic format common of college radio. Although the additional height of the Pinnacle Mountain site opened up the possibility of greatly expanded coverage, the WVCR signal was too weak to be reliably received throughout much of the Capital District and especially the Siena College campus. The situation was further worsened by WVCR's failure to transmit in stereo, with stereo broadcasts finally beginning in 1987. As a result, the station experienced a gradual decline in listenership and member morale throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. 1985 saw a major change at WVCR as a planned dormitory renovation at Plassman Hall forced WVCR to relocate to all new studios across campus. To accomplish this, WVCR-FM spent most of the 1985-86 academic year off the air with the new facilities debuting in December 1986. The relaunch of the station provided the opportunity for a fresh start, and the new student members made many major upgrades to the signal, with the adoption of stereo in 1987, a newer vintage transmitter and antenna in 1988, and the upgrade from class A to B1 status (25000 watts equivalent) in 1989. By 1989, the signal could reliably be received on campus for the first time since 1970. An additional power increase took place in Jan 2001 to bring the signal to its current level or 35,000 watts. As the 1990s started, the number of genres on WVCR declined as student interest in the station began to go towards two genres of music, heavy metal and urban contemporary, both underrepresented in the Albany market. By 1995, WVCR's schedule outside of Sundays was made solely of programming in those two formats. In 1996, the heavy metal programming was replaced prior to the 1997-98 academic year by alternative rock, a decision that was made without the knowledge of the Executive Board, and without any public forum. Many local listeners had felt slighted by the process, as the station had recently completed a 'Listener Appeal\\" to raise the necessary funds to replace the station's aging transmitter. This arrangement would remain in place until the end of the Fall semester of the 1998-99 academic year. On December 27, 1998, WVCR axed all rock programming and took on a Rhythmic Top 40 format, a move done in rapid response to the launch of then-urban contemporary WAJZ. With this move came an upgrade of studio equipment and the expansion of WVCR to a 24-hour broadcast day; previously, it had signed off from 12:00-6:00 am. WVCR relaunched as a Mainstream Top 40 station in September 2001. Popular on campus, WVCR's Top 40 format struggled to get some traction going against the more established WFLY and the seemingly Rhythmic WKKF. The redundancy of the station in the market and the support of the station in the community paling in comparison to past formats led Siena to switch the format to variety hits on April 9, 2006. WVCR-FM continues to be a community leader in the Albany, Schenectady & Troy, N.Y. market while also broadcasting to the neighboring states Vermont & Massachusetts. As of August 2006 Darrin \\"Scott\\" Kibbey serves as General Manager with John F. Kelly (former Chairman of the NYS Broadcaster Assoc.) serving as Director to the station. As of March 29, 2008, WVCR began broadcasting a show that showcases Japanese Popular Music (J-Pop).

Early career King Floyd III was born in New Orleans in 1945. His musical career started as a singer at the Sho-Bar on Bourbon Street. Following a stint in the army, Floyd went to California, where he joined up with record producer Harold Battiste. His debut album, A Man In Love, featuring songs co-written with Dr. John, failed to make an impact on the charts. Floyd returned to New Orleans in 1969 and worked for the Post Office. Recording success In 1970, Wardell Quezergue, an arranger of R&B; scores, persuaded Floyd to record \\"Groove Me\\" with Malaco Records in Jackson, Mississippi. Jean Knight recorded her hit, \\"Mr. Big Stuff,\\" in the same sessions. At first, \\"Groove Me\\" was a B-side to another Floyd song, \\"What Our Love Needs.\\" New Orleans radio DJs started playing \\"Groove Me\\" and the song became a local hit. Atlantic Records picked up national distribution of \\"Groove Me,\\" which topped the United States R&B; chart and reached #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #41 in Britain. This disc sold over one million copies, and received a gold disc awarded by the R.I.A.A. in December 1970. Floyd quit his job at the post office to perform a U.S. tour. His follow-up single, \\"Baby Let Me Kiss You\\" climbed up to number 29 on the Billboard Top 40 charts in 1971. However, differences with Quezergue soon emerged and his 1973 follow-up album, Think About It, failed to make a commercial impact. However, Atlantic released a song from the album, \\"Woman Don't Go Astray,\\" as a single. His 1975 album, Well Done, was released through TK Records with Atlantic distributing. \\"I Feel Like Dynamite\\" from the album, written by Larry Hamilton, was released as its single. Reviewing the album in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau said, \\"Floyd's quiet, chocolatey voice‚Äîcf. Lee Dorsey, Aaron Neville‚Äîis prized by seekers after the New Orleans dispensation, but he's never grooved me without skipping like a cheap bootleg. So I'm pleased to report that side one of his fourth LP, climaxing with the neglected regional hit 'I Feel Like Dynamite,' provides songs as winsome as the straight-ahead Caribbeanisms (even some reggae) of the New Orleans r&b; behind. Location of studio: Jackson, Mississippi.\\" Subsequent career None of his subsequent songs achieved the same, as disco dominated the charts for the remainder of the 1970s. However, Floyd had credits for \\"Boombastic,\\" recorded in 1995 by Shaggy, which became a big hit. Floyd reunited with Malaco Records in 2000 for the Old Skool Funk album, but it failed to make an impact. However, his song \\"Don't Leave Me Lonely\\" was prominently sampled by the Wu-Tang Clan for the song \\"For Heaven's Sake\\" off their album Wu-Tang Forever. Personal life He died on March 6, 2006 from complications of a stroke and diabetes. He is survived by his wife, children, and grandchildren. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed King Floyd among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

Active in the fight for gay rights, Maxey was a central figure in the establishment of facilities for the education and care of HIV-infected individuals, especially the AIDS Services of Austin (ASA). In 2008, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Tax Assessor-Collector in Travis County, Texas. Early life and education Maxey is the son of Byron Hale Maxey and Mary Ursula Ocker. His family ran a traveling rodeo. Maxey was educated at Sam Houston State University. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree and Masters of Education from Sam Houston State University. Maxey taught fifth grade and worked as a reading and math specialist working with migrant students in Navasota, Texas. Political involvement and activism Maxey first entered politics in 1968 as a volunteer on the Texas Democratic Primary campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy. While teaching school, Maxey continued to volunteer for local, state and federal campaigns. In 1980, while teaching in Navasota, Maxey joined the successful campaign of Kent Caperton, a candidate for the Texas State Senate. Caperton, a young Bryan attorney who was seeking to unseat the legendary \\"Bull of the Brazos,\\" William T. \\"Bill\\" Moore. Moore had held the Senate seat centered around Bryan for thirty-two years before Caperton defeated him in the Democratic primary that year. After the election, Maxey joined Caperton's staff in 1981 as a legislative aide. The following year, Maxey ran for an open House seat in College Station against House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Presnal in the Democratic primary, and later joined the campaign of Jim Hightower, who was then a candidate for Texas Agriculture Commissioner. In November 1982, Maxey joined the staff of Democratic State Senator Oscar Mauzy, who was Dean of the Texas Senate at the time, and became his Chief Legislative Aide. While on Mauzy's staff, Maxey was active in HIV/AIDS activism, and urged Mauzy to become involved in the case of a man suffering from HIV who had been threatened with quarantine by the Texas Board of Health. In 2001, Maxey discussed this watershed moment in HIV and AIDS awareness in an interview with the Austin Chronicle: > As Maxey recalls the episode, \\"It was very early in the AIDS crisis, the > disease wasn't very well understood, and the commissioner of health began > talking about declaring HIV a 'quarantinable disease.' I was working with > AIDS activists, and I went to Mauzy and asked him could we get involved. He > answered, as he always did, 'Well, get something organized.' So we called > committee hearings, and I contacted Dr. Mathilde Krim, at the time the > foremost authority on AIDS and an advocate for patients. She came down here > and testified against the quarantine.\\".Austin Chronicle, \\"Capitol Chronicle: > A Profile In Courage\\" , December 7, 2001 In 1987, Maxey left Mauzy's staff and became the first Executive Director of the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas. Legislative service In 1991, Maxey was elected to the Texas House from the Austin seat held by Lena Guerrero, who had been appointed by Governor Ann Richards to the Texas Railroad Commission. Serving from 1991 to 2003, Maxey passed hundreds of bills and substantive amendments and played a leading role in passing the Children's Health Insurance Program. During his six terms in the Texas House, Maxey served on committees including Appropriations, Public Health, Administration, Pensions and Investments, Cultural Affairs and Human Services. He has been the most prolific bill sponsor in the Texas House. During his last terms in that body, Maxey passed more legislation than any other single member of that body. During his tenure in the Texas House, Maxey was also a key player in the group of House members that helped elect Pete Laney Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives and reformed that body's rules. While passing hundreds of bills through the process, Maxey was also well known for his abilities to defeat bad legislation through use of the rules and parliamentary procedures. He was a founding member of the Texas Legislative Study Group, a membership organization of legislators who banded together to work on progressive legislative issues. He served as floor whip for the LSG members for four sessions. Awards and honors Maxey has won numerous other awards for his public service. He has been recognized as Legislator of the Year by several dozens of advocacy organizations, including on three occasions by the Sierra Club. Common Cause of Texas awarded him the \\"Star of Texas\\" award for his work in reforming the House rules of procedure. He has won accolades and awards from the Grey Panthers, Public Citizen, the Austin Police Association, the Brain Injury Association, the Texas Network of Youth Services, United Cerebral Palsy, the Save Our Springs Coalition, ADAPT of Texas, the Texas Nurses Association, Coalition of Persons with Disabilities, Consumers Union, Advocacy, Inc, the Texas AIDS Network, the Human Rights Campaign and many others. Maxey has been voted \\"Best Legislator\\" in the Austin Chronicle Reader's Poll on eight separate occasions. Legislative retirement and later political activities Maxey's final term in the Texas House ended in January, 2003. Maxey was among many veteran House members who announced their retirement following the 2001 Legislative Session. Since retiring from office, he has worked as a lobbyist and public affairs adviser. He ran the Travis County Democratic Party's 2004 coordinated campaign and served as field director in the 2006 coordinated campaign effort. Maxey was a candidate for the Chairmanship of the Texas Democratic Party in 2006. The same year, he served as statewide field director for the gubernatorial campaign of Democrat Chris Bell.Houston Chronicle, \\"Texas Politics\\" Blog , June 27, 2006. In the summer of 2007, Maxey announced his candidacy for Travis County Tax Assessor- Collector. He was beaten by a 74% to 26% margin in the March 2008 Democratic primary by incumbent Nelda Wells Spears. Maxey is currently the Legislative Affairs Director of the Texas Democratic Party.

In general, Norwegian citizenship is conferred by birth to a Norwegian parent, or by naturalisation in Norway. Birth in Norway In general, birth in Norway does not, in itself, confer Norwegian citizenship as its law uses jus sanguinis policy. Exceptions are made for stateless people and foundlings. Descent from a Norwegian parent Regardless of the place of birth, a child acquires Norwegian citizenship at birth if either parent is a Norwegian citizen. Originally, citizenship was only passed on to the children of Norwegian mothers, as they were the only provable parents, but over time a presumption of paternal parentage created citizenship for the child, and eventually even excluded the maternal jus sanguinis. In more recent times, as of 1 January 1979, mothers' rights to automatically pass on their Norwegian citizenship has been reestablished. The requirement that the mother and father be married to one another was abolished on 1 September 2006. Naturalisation as a Norwegian citizen Generally, it is possible to naturalise as a Norwegian citizen after residing in Norway seven years over the last ten years, if the applicant qualifies for permanent residence and does not have a criminal record. Exceptions: * Applicants with a criminal record must wait a further \\"quarantine\\" period dependent on the crime committed before being granted citizenship. * Citizens of other Nordic Council countries may naturalise after only a two-year residence. * The spouses, homosexual partners in civil unions, and non-married cohabitant partners of Norwegian citizens may naturalise as quickly as four years. The requirement is that they have resided in Norway at least three years of the last ten and that the number of years resident and the number of years married, taken together cumulatively, equals at least seven. * The children (under the age of 18 years) of citizens of other Nordic Council countries may automatically receive naturalisation with their parents. The children of citizens naturalised from other countries may themselves receive citizenship if they have resided in Norway for the last two years. * Former Norwegian citizens may naturalise after one year's residence during the last two years. From 1 September 2008 an applicant for Norwegian citizenship must also give evidence of proficiency in either the Norwegian or the Sami language, or give proof of having attended classes in Norwegian for 300 hours, or meet the language requirements for university studies in Norway (i.e., demonstrate proficiency in one of the Scandinavian languages). From 1 March 2014 an applicant for Norwegian citizenship must also pass an exam about Norwegian society, laws and history. Before 2020, a naturalized Norwegian citizen was generally expected to prove they have lost or renounced any former citizenship(s). With effect from 1 January 2020, Norway allows dual citizenship. Notification of Norwegian citizenship Norwegian citizenship may be acquired by notification to the Directorate of Immigration. This is a simplified form of naturalisation exempted from application fees. The following categories of persons are eligible for citizenship by notification * a child aged under 18 who was born before 1 September 2006 to a Norwegian father and a foreign mother who were not married (renunciation of foreign citizenship not required) * a child aged 12-18 adopted by a Norwegian citizen after 1 October 1999 but before 1 September 2006 (renunciation of foreign citizenship not required) * a citizen of another Nordic Council country who has lived in Norway for 7 years * a former Norwegian citizen who has, since the loss of Norwegian citizenship, only been a citizen of another Nordic Council state (no residence period is required provided the person has settled in Norway). Norwegian citizenship by adoption As from 1 September 2006 a child under 18 adopted by Norwegian citizens acquires Norwegian citizenship automatically. In cases where children are adopted outside Norway, the consent of the Norwegian government is required. Loss of Norwegian citizenship Norwegian citizens who acquire citizenship by birth but have resided less than 2 years in Norway or 7 years in Nordic Council countries must apply to retain Norwegian citizenship before turning 22 years of age. Applicants are not required to renounce other citizenships, but are required to demonstrate \\"adequate ties\\" to Norway. Often, frequent travel to Norway or a year of study in Norway are accepted. Effective 1 January 2019, individuals with dual citizenship can be deprived of their citizenship should they be sentenced for serious crimes which can lead to six years prison. Norwegian citizens may also lose citizenship if they formally petition for permission to renounce it. To prevent statelessness, Norwegian citizenship may be renounced only if the person proves that they are a citizen of another state.  Identity fraud  Foreigners who have acquired Norwegian citizenship may lose it if they are found to have lied about their origins, such was the case of about 100 Somalis who along with their children born in Norway lost their citizenship and right of residence after it turned out they were from neighbouring countries. This is considered an affront to Norwegian society which is built on trust. Dual citizenship With effect from 1 January 2020 Norway allows dual citizenship. A Norwegian citizen acquiring a foreign citizenship does not lose Norwegian citizenship. Former Norwegian citizens who lost Norwegian citizenship prior to this date (upon naturalisation in another country) may re-acquire Norwegian citizenship by declaration. Travel freedom of Norwegian citizens Visa requirements for Norwegian citizens As of 1 January 2018, Norwegian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 173 countries and territories, ranking the Norwegian passport 3rd in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley visa restrictions index.

Mike Davis was also a member of Kevin Sullivan's faction known as the Army of Darkness. Career Mike Davis got his start in Eddie Graham's Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) promotion. He was a member of Kevin Sullivan's faction known as the Army of Darkness. In 1984 he lost the NWA Junior Heavyweight Title to Denny Brown. Davis started the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs tag team with Tommy Lane in Memphis where they wrestled in the mid 80's before moving to the World Class promotion, which at the time was still affiliated with the NWA. They were known for their bright colored tights and hanging bandanas. The Rock 'n' Roll RPMs were glorified for their finishing move \\"The Spandex Splits\\". The move was later outlawed due to extensive neck injuries. They had feuds with several teams, including another \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\" tag team known as the Rock 'n' Roll Express. The RPMs feuded with The Fantastics over the WCWA Tag Team Championship, however they were unable to win the championship. The RPMs also competed in the CWA in Memphis, where they won two AWA Southern Tag Team titles. Teaming with Cactus Jack, the Rock-n-Roll RPMs lost a match against Hector, Chavo, and Mando Guerrero at the only AWA pay-per-view SuperClash III. After the demise of World Class, Davis and Lane moved on to World Championship Wrestling, where they were used as jobbers.

He described an effect in six predator‚Äìprey models where increasing the food available to the prey caused the predator's population to destabilize. A common example is that if the food supply of a prey such as a rabbit is overabundant, its population will grow unbounded and cause the predator population (such as a lynx) to grow unsustainably large. That may result in a crash in the population of the predators and possibly lead to local eradication or even species extinction. The term 'paradox' has been used since then to describe this effect in slightly conflicting ways. The original sense was one of irony; by attempting to increase the carrying capacity in an ecosystem, one could fatally imbalance it. Since then, some authors have used the word to describe the difference between modelled and real predator‚Äìprey interactions. Rosenzweig used ordinary differential equation models to simulate the prey population that represented only prey populations. Enrichment was taken to be increasing the prey carrying capacity and showing that the prey population destabilized, usually into a limit cycle. The cycling behavior after destabilization was more thoroughly explored in a subsequent paper (May 1972) and discussion (Gilpin and Rozenzweig 1972). Model and exception Many studies have been done on the paradox of enrichment since Rosenzweig, and some have shown that the model initially proposed does not hold in all circumstances, as summarised by Roy and Chattopadhyay in 2007, such as these exceptions: *Inedible prey: if there are multiple prey species and not all are edible, some may absorb nutrients and stabilise cyclicity. *Invulnerable prey: even with a single prey species, if there is a degree of temporal or spatial refuge (the prey can hide from the predator), destabilisation may not happen. *Unpalatable prey: if prey do not fulfil the nutritional preferences of the predator to as great an extent at higher densities, as with some algae and grazers, there may be a stabilising effect. *Heterogeneous environment: the model for enrichment follows an assumption of environmental homogeneity. If a spatiotemporally chaotic, heterogeneous environment is introduced, cyclic patterns may not arise. *Induced defense: if there is a predation-dependent response from prey species, it may act to decelerate the downward swing of population caused by the boom in predator population. An example is of Daphnia and fish predators. *Autotoxins and other predator density-dependent effects: if predator density cannot increase in proportion to that of prey, destabilising periodicities may not develop. *Prey toxicity: if there is a significant cost to the predator of consuming the (now very dense) prey species, predator numbers may not increase sufficiently to give periodicity. Link with Hopf bifurcation The paradox of enrichment can be accounted for by the bifurcation theory. As the carrying capacity increases, the equilibrium of the dynamical system becomes unstable. The bifurcation can be obtained by modifying the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equation. First, one assumes that the growth of the prey population is determined by the logistic equation. Then, one assumes that predators have a nonlinear functional response, typically of type II. The saturation in consumption may be caused by the time to handle the prey or satiety effects. Thus, one can write the following (normalized) equations: :\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) = x\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{x}{K}\\\\right) - y \\\\frac{x}{1 + x} :\\\\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x, y) = -y\\\\left(\\\\gamma - \\\\delta \\\\frac{x}{1 + x}\\\\right) *x is the prey density; *y is the predator density; *K is the prey population's carrying capacity; *Œ≥ and Œ¥ are predator population's parameters (rate of decay and benefits of consumption, respectively). The term x\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{x}{K}\\\\right) represents the prey's logistic growth, and \\\\frac{x}{1 + x} the predator's functional response. The prey isoclines (points at which the prey population does not change, i.e. dx/dt = 0) are easily obtained as \\\\ x = 0 and y = (1 + x) \\\\left(1 - x/K \\\\right). Likewise, the predator isoclines are obtained as \\\\ y = 0 and x = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha}, where \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\delta}. The intersections of the isoclines yields three equilibrium states: :x_1 = 0,\\\\; y_1 = 0 :x_2 = K,\\\\; y_2 = 0 :x_3 = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha},\\\\; y_3 = (1 + x_3) \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{x_3}{K}\\\\right) The first equilibrium corresponds to the extinction of both predator and prey, the second one to the extinction of the predator and the third to co-existence. By the Hartman‚ÄìGrobman theorem, one can determine the stability of the steady states by approximating the nonlinear system by a linear system. After differentiating each f and g with respect to x and y in a neighborhood of (x_3, y_3), we get: :\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\begin{bmatrix}x - x_3\\\\y - y_3\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\approx \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\alpha\\\\left( 1 - (1 + 2 x_3)/K \\\\right)&\\\\- \\\\alpha\\\\ \\\\delta (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 y_3 & 0\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix}x - x_3\\\\y - y_3\\\\end{bmatrix} It is possible to find the exact solution of this linear system, but here, the only interest is in the qualitative behavior. If both eigenvalues of the community matrix have negative real part, then by the stable manifold theorem the system converges to a limit point. Since the determinant is equal to the product of the eigenvalues and is positive, both eigenvalues have the same sign. Since the trace is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues, the system is stable if :\\\\alpha\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1+2x_3}{K}\\\\right) < 0, \\\\text{ or } K < 1 + 2\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha} At that critical value of the parameter K, the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation. It comes as counterintuitive (hence the term 'paradox') because increasing the carrying capacity of the ecological system beyond a certain value leads to dynamic instability and extinction of the predator species. Arguments against paradox A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra predator‚Äìprey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or Arditi‚ÄìGinzburg model.Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. (1989) \\"Coupling in predator‚Äìprey dynamics: ratio dependence\\" Journal of Theoretical Biology, 139: 311‚Äì326. The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi‚ÄìGinzburg model as the first approximation.Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. (2012) How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology Oxford University Press. . The presence of the paradox is strongly dependent on the assumption of the prey dependence of the functional response; because of this the ratio dependent Arditi‚ÄìGinzburg model does not have the paradoxical behavior. The authors' claim that the paradox is absent in nature (simple laboratory systems may be the exception) is in fact a strong argument for their alternative view of the basic equations.Jensen, C. XJ., and Ginzburg, L.R. (2005) \\"Paradoxes or theoretical failures? The jury is still out.\\" Ecological Modelling, 118:3‚Äì14.

Methylation of histones can either increase or decrease transcription of genes, depending on which amino acids in the histones are methylated, and how many methyl groups are attached. Methylation events that weaken chemical attractions between histone tails and DNA increase transcription because they enable the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factor proteins and RNA polymerase can access the DNA. This process is critical for the regulation of gene expression that allows different cells to express different genes. Function Histone methylation, as a mechanism for modifying chromatin structure is associated with stimulation of neural pathways known to be important for formation of long-term memories and learning. Animal models have shown methylation and other epigenetic regulation mechanisms to be associated with conditions of aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and intellectual disability (Rubinstein‚ÄìTaybi syndrome, X-linked intellectual disability). This modification alters the properties of the nucleosome and affects its interactions with other proteins, particularly in regards to gene transcription processes. * Histone methylation can be associated with either transcriptional repression or activation. For example, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is an active mark for transcription and is upregulated in hippocampus one hour after contextual fear conditioning in rats. However, dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a signal for transcriptional silencing, is increased after exposure to either the fear conditioning or a novel environment alone. * Methylation of some lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues of histones results in transcriptional activation. Examples include methylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me1), and arginine (R) residues on H3 and H4. * Addition of methyl groups to histones by histone methyltransferases, can either activate or further repress transcription, depending on the amino acid being methylated and the presence of other methyl or acetyl groups in the vicinity. Mechanism The fundamental unit of chromatin, called a nucleosome, contains DNA wound around a protein octamer. This octamer consists of two copies each of four histone proteins: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Each one of these proteins has a tail extension, and these tails are the targets of nucleosome modification by methylation. DNA activation or inactivation is largely dependent on the specific tail residue methylated and its degree of methylation. Histones can be methylated on lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues only, but methylation is most commonly observed on lysine residues of histone tails H3 and H4. The tail end furthest from the nucleosome core is the N-terminal (residues are numbered starting at this end). Common sites of methylation associated with gene activation include H3K4, H3K48, and H3K79. Common sites for gene inactivation include H3K9 and H3K27.Gilbert, S. F. (2010). Developmental biology. (9th ed.). Sinauer Associates, Inc. 35-37. Studies of these sites have found that methylation of histone tails at different residues serve as markers for the recruitment of various proteins or protein complexes that serve to regulate chromatin activation or inactivation. Lysine and arginine residues both contain amino groups, which confer basic and hydrophobic characteristics. Lysine is able to be mono-, di-, or trimethylated with a methyl group replacing each hydrogen of its NH3+ group. With a free NH2 and NH2+ group, arginine is able to be mono- or dimethylated. This dimethylation can occur asymmetrically on the NH2 group or symmetrically with one methylation on each group. Each addition of a methyl group on each residue requires a specific set of protein enzymes with various substrates and cofactors. Generally, methylation of an arginine residue requires a complex including protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) while lysine requires a specific histone methyltransferase (HMT), usually containing an evolutionarily conserved SET domain. Different degrees of residue methylation can confer different functions, as exemplified in the methylation of the commonly studied H4K20 residue. Monomethylated H4K20 (H4K20me1) is involved in the compaction of chromatin and therefore transcriptional repression. However, H4K20me2 is vital in the repair of damaged DNA. When dimethylated, the residue provides a platform for the binding of protein 53BP1 involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by non-homologous end joining. H4K20me3 is observed to be concentrated in heterochromatin and reductions in this trimethylation are observed in cancer progression. Therefore, H4K20me3 serves an additional role in chromatin repression. Repair of DNA double-stranded breaks in chromatin also occurs by homologous recombination and also involves histone methylation (H3K9me3) to facilitate access of the repair enzymes to the sites of damage. Histone methyltransferase Front view of the human enzyme Histone Lysine N-Methyltransferase, H3 lysine-4 specific. The genome is tightly condensed into chromatin, which needs to be loosened for transcription to occur. In order to halt the transcription of a gene the DNA must be wound tighter. This can be done by modifying histones at certain sites by methylation. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes which transfer methyl groups from S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) onto the lysine or arginine residues of the H3 and H4 histones. There are instances of the core globular domains of histones being methylated as well. The histone methyltransferases are specific to either lysine or arginine. The lysine-specific transferases are further broken down into whether or not they have a SET domain or a non-SET domain. These domains specify exactly how the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the methyl from SAM to the transfer protein and further to the histone residue. The methyltransferases can add 1-3 methyls on the target residues. These methyls that are added to the histones act to regulate transcription by blocking or encouraging DNA access to transcription factors. In this way the integrity of the genome and epigenetic inheritance of genes are under the control of the actions of histone methyltransferases. Histone methylation is key in distinguishing the integrity of the genome and the genes that are expressed by cells, thus giving the cells their identities. Methylated histones can either repress or activate transcription. For example, while H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K79me3 are generally associated with transcriptional activity, whereas H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me2, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 are associated with transcriptional repression. Epigenetics Epigenetic mechanisms Modifications made on the histone have an effect on the genes that are expressed in a cell and this is the case when methyls are added to the histone residues by the histone methyltransferases. Histone methylation plays an important role on the assembly of the heterochromatin mechanism and the maintenance of gene boundaries between genes that are transcribed and those that aren‚Äôt. These changes are passed down to progeny and can be affected by the environment that the cells are subject to. Epigenetic alterations are reversible meaning that they can be targets for therapy. The activities of histone methyltransferases are offset by the activity of histone demethylases. This allows for the switching on or off of transcription by reversing pre- existing modifications. It is necessary for the activities of both histone methyltrasnsferases and histone demethylases to be regulated tightly. Misregulation of either can lead to gene expression that leads to increased susceptibility to disease. Many cancers arise from the inappropriate epigenetic effects of misregulated methylation. However, because these processes are at times reversible, there is interest in utilizing their activities in concert with anti-cancer therapies. In X chromosome inactivation In female organisms, a sperm containing an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, giving the embryo two copies of the X chromosome. Females, however, do not initially require both copies of the X chromosome as it would only double the amount of protein products transcribed as shown by the hypothesis of dosage compensation. The paternal X chromosome is quickly inactivated during the first few divisions. This inactive X chromosome (Xi) is packed into an incredibly tight form of chromatin called heterochromatin. This packing occurs due to the methylation of the different lysine residues that help form different histones. In humans X inactivation is a random process, that is mediated by the non-coding RNA XIST. Although methylation of lysine residues occurs on many different histones, the most characteristic of Xi occurs on the ninth lysine of the third histone (H3K9). While a single methylation of this region allows for the genes bound to remain transcriptionally active, in heterochromatin this lysine residue is often methylated twice or three times, H3K9me2 or H3K9me3 respectively, to ensure that the DNA bound is inactive. More recent research has shown that H3K27me3 and H4K20me1 are also common in early embryos. Other methylation markings associated with transcriptionally active areas of DNA, H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, are missing from the Xi chromosome along with many acetylation markings. Although it was known that certain Xi histone methylation markings stayed relatively constant between species, it has recently been discovered that different organisms and even different cells within a single organism can have different markings for their X inactivation. Through histone methylation, there is genetic imprinting, so that the same X homolog stays inactivated through chromosome replications and cell divisions. Mutations Due to the fact that histone methylation regulates much of what genes become transcribed, even slight changes to the methylation patterns can have dire effects on the organism. Mutations that occur to increase and decrease methylation have great changes on gene regulation, while mutations to enzymes such as methyltransferase and demethyltransferase can completely alter which proteins are transcribed in a given cell. Over methylation of a chromosome can cause certain genes that are necessary for normal cell function, to become inactivated. In a certain yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a mutation that causes three lysine residues on the third histone, H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79, to become methylated causes a delay in the mitotic cell cycle, as many genes required for this progression are inactivated. This extreme mutation leads to the death of the organism. It has been discovered that the deletion of genes that will eventually allow for the production of histone methyltransferase allows this organism to live as its lysine residues are not methylated. In recent years it has come to the attention of researchers that many types of cancer are caused largely due to epigenetic factors. Cancer can be caused in a variety of ways due to differential methylation of histones. Since the discovery of oncogenes as well as tumor suppressor genes it has been known that a large factor of causing and repressing cancer is within our own genome. If areas around oncogenes become unmethylated these cancer-causing genes have the potential to be transcribed at an alarming rate. Opposite of this is the methylation of tumor suppressor genes. In cases where the areas around these genes were highly methylated, the tumor suppressor gene was not active and therefore cancer was more likely to occur. These changes in methylation pattern are often due to mutations in methyltransferase and demethyltransferase. Other types of mutations in proteins such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) can cause the inactivation of histone demethyltransferase which in turn can lead to a variety of cancers, gliomas and leukemias, depending on in which cells the mutation occurs. One-carbon metabolism modifies histone methylation In one-carbon metabolism, the amino acids glycine and serine are converted via the folate and methionine cycles to nucleotide precursors and SAM. Multiple nutrients fuel one-carbon metabolism, including glucose, serine, glycine, and threonine. High levels of the methyl donor SAM influence histone methylation, which may explain how high SAM levels prevent malignant transformation.

In basic terms it is a measure of the actual revenue earned by assets against the potential revenue they could have earned.http://constructionequipmentdistribution.com/article- detail.cfm?id=10921486 Utilization is key to rental business Calculations Rental utilization is divided into a number of different calculations, and not all companies work precisely the same way. In general terms however there are 2 key calculations: the physical utilization on the asset, which is measured based on the number of available days for rental against the number of days actually rented. (This may also be measured in hours for certain types of equipment), and the financial utilization on the asset (referred to in North America as $ Utilization) which is measured as the rental revenue achieved over a period of time against the potential revenue that could have been achieved based on a target or standard, non-discounted rate. Physical utilization is also sometimes referred to as spot utilization, where a rental company looks at its current utilization of assets based on a single moment in time (e.g. now, 9 am today, etc.). Utilization calculations may be varied based on many different factors. For example: * A company with equipment which requires preventative maintenance activities every 2 weeks, may decide that the number of available days in the month is decreased as it will unavailable due to maintenance for 2 days out of each month. * Some rental businesses give \\"free days\\" on rental contract billing processes, for example on a national or public holiday, and therefore the equipment does not earn any money on those days, even though it is physically on rent. * Some companies charge minimum rates, for example you may rent an excavator for 1 day, but be charged a three-day minimum. The Physical utilization will therefore be 100% on the day, but the financial utilization is actually 300% as you've earned 3 days revenue for 1 day's work. * Rental Software is normally required to assist management teams in measuring and calculating utilization figures. * Asset Tracking software may also be important in increasing or managing utilization figures. Utilization in this context is heavily linked to profitability. Low physical utilization may be mitigated by keeping rental rates high, high physical utilization normally justifies keeping rental rates lower. Different types of equipment may also alter the relationship between rates and utilization.

He was a co-founder of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, which later merged with the National Farm Workers Association to become the United Farm Workers. As the union's long-time vice president, he worked to improve the working conditions for migrant workers. Early life Vera Cruz was born in Saoang, Ilocos Sur, the Philippines on December 25, 1904. As he grew older, he undertook some farm work there, which he described as much easier than the work he would do in California. In 1926, Vera Cruz moved to the United States, where he performed a wide variety of jobs, including working in an Alaskan cannery, a restaurant, and a box factory. He was briefly a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. For a year, beginning in 1931, Vera Cruz studied at Gonzaga University. In 1942, he was drafted into the United States Army, but was later discharged due to age. Labor activities Vera Cruz eventually settled in California, where he became a farmworker. He joined the AFL-CIO-affiliated union, the National Farm Labor Union, in the 1950s. His union local, based in Delano, California, had an Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC). The prime focus of AWOC was to add members to the National Farm Labor Union. AWOC was composed primarily of Filipino American farmworker organizers, although it did hire Dolores Huerta. Huerta eventually quit the AWOC to join the National Farm Workers of America, which had a primarily Mexican American membership. Philip Vera Cruz, a former UFW Vice President, described the start of the great Delano grape strike. \\"On September 8, 1965, at the Filipino Hall at 1457 Glenwood St. in Delano, the Filipino members of AWOC held a mass meeting to discuss and decide whether to strike or to accept the reduced wages proposed by the growers. The decision was 'to strike\\" and it became one of the most significant and famous decisions ever made in the entire history of the farmworkers struggles in California. It was like an incendiary bomb, exploding out the strike message to the workers in the vineyards, telling them to have sit-ins in the labor camps, and set up picket lines at every grower's ranch‚Ä¶ It was this strike that eventually made the UFW, the farmworkers movement, and Cesar Chavez famous worldwide.\\" On September 8, 1965, the Delano local voted to strike against the grape growers. Following the strike call, the growers attempted to bring in Mexican American workers, some of whom were affiliated with the National Farm Workers of America. Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and other leaders of the National Farm Workers of America met with several National Farm Labor Union organizers, including Vera Cruz, Larry Itliong, Benjamin Gines and Pete Velasco. Together, they decided that both unions would strike against the grape growers, an action which eventually led to both unions joining to become the United Farm Workers.Article Index - INQUIRER.net The new union debuted in August 1966, and continued the strike into 1970. In the new union, Vera Cruz served as second vice president and on the managing board. Leaving the UFW and later life Vera Cruz resigned from the UFW in 1977. That year, Cesar Chavez traveled to the Philippines to meet with Ferdinand Marcos, whom Vera Cruz saw as a brutal dictator. Vera Cruz continued to live in the San Joaquin Valley of California after his resignation, and remained active in union and social justice issues for the rest of his life. Vera Cruz received the Ninoy M. Aquino Award in 1987, traveling to the Philippines for the first time in fifty years to accept it. In 1992, the AFL- CIO's Asia Pacific American Labor Committee honored Vera Cruz at its founding convention. He died at the age of 89 in 1994, in Bakersfield, California. Legacy In 2013, the New Haven Unified School District renamed Alvarado Middle School Itliong-Vera Cruz Middle School in honor of Vera Cruz and Larry Itliong; this school is the first school in the United States to be named after Filipino Americans.

He was forced to retire in 1550, but was reappointed and worked there until 1559. Alberti was one of the first composers to use a number of new techniques, including the use of cori spezzati and salmi spezzati, especially within the Passion, where he used it for both the turba and the words of Jesus, or vox Christi. Alberti's Passions were the first to set Jesus' words polyphonically. Although he was an early user of these techniques, he is not believed to have originated them or disseminated them significantly. Despite this, he was an important force in Italian sacred music, especially in the period before Palestrina. His book of masses was the first to be published by a single Italian composer.

The name draws an analogy between efforts to eradicate the production of illegal drugs in South American countries and the phenomenon of the same name when a latex balloon is squeezed: The air is moved, but does not disappear, instead moving into another area of less resistance.Mora, Frank O. \\"Victims of the Balloon Effect: Drug Trafficking and the U.S. Policy in Brazil and the Southern Cone of Latin America\\".

Examples of this displacement in drug traffic include: * Fumigation of marijuana in Mexico caused production to migrate to Colombia. * Marijuana crackdowns in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta moved activity to Cauca. * In the late 1990s, coca was largely eradicated in Peru and Bolivia, only to be replaced by new crops in Colombia. * Recently, with the intense spraying in the Colombian Putumayo Department, coca has been planted in other departments including Arauca, Cauca, Caquet√°, Guaviare, Huila, Meta, Nari√±o, and Santander. As described in The Economist: Brazil and the Southern Cone (Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina) neglected their respective drug trafficking issues and due to the concentration on the Andean region, these were neglected by the United States as well. These nations ignored the problem primarily due to its slow introduction and penetration into their society, the insistence from the U.S. that the sources of the drugs was the only problem and because the governments at the time were more concerned with foreign debt, inflation, economic growth, civil-military relations and political survival. The United States continued to increase their anti-drug operations in the Andean region resulting in displacement.Friesendorf, Cornelius. \\"Squeezing the Balloon, United States Air Interdiction and the Restructuring of the Southern American Drug Industry in the 1990s\\". Crime, Law and Social Crime 44 (2005): 35‚Äì78. York University Libraries. Web. 22 Oct. 2011. This means that the U.S. tactics forced the drug traffickers to search for safer areas with less government pressure to eliminate the flow of narcotics. The drug traffickers took advantage of the neglected Southern Cone and began shifting their routes, locations for cocaine laboratories and money laundering centres. These shifts have also created growing drug consumption issues among the Southern Cone countries. While the role of the Southern Cone had been that of a transhipment point for cocaine produced in the Andean region, further evidence appeared to indicate that in fact since 1984 the region had been used extensively by Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers. Cocaine labs were found in Northern and Western Brazil and in Argentina. It was also found that Uruguay and Chile had become major financial centres for money laundering after the invasion of Panama. Uruguay was particularly attractive as it has one of the most open banking systems in the Western hemisphere and the government has always put great emphasis on having tight bank secrecy laws.

Dating The Moore Bede is traditionally dated to 734-737 on the basis of the so-called Moore Memoranda, a series of chronological notes preserved on f. 128v.

YPJ Canada Logo in 1984 ‚Äì In use until the demise of the organization In 1977, representatives from seven of the eight youth parliaments met to discuss the organization of a national youth parliament. This meeting resulted in the creation of the National Youth Parliament Association (NYPA). The NYPA was a federally incorporated non- profit organization. Two representatives from each provincial youth parliament were appointed as directors of the NYPA, who in turn appointed a six-member executive. The first session of YPJ Canada met during August 16‚Äì23, 1980. The 110 delegates, met in the Senate chambers of the Canadian Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. YPJ Canada modeled itself on the Westminster Parliamentary system, adopting its own rules based upon House of Commons procedures. While YPJ Canada had a Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, cabinet, shadow cabinet, and committee system similar to a real parliament, the members of YPJ Canada did not represent any political parties. At all times, each member, including cabinet ministers, was entitled to vote according to conscience. YPJ Canada usually had eight cabinet ministers, one from each of the provincial youth parliaments. Each minister would introduce \\"legislation\\" for debate. Unlike some of the provincial youth parliaments, YPJ Canada legislation was never for the establishment of any form of ongoing project. The bills would be limited to the consideration of local, national and international issues of the day. Debates occurred in both English and French, with simultaneous translation available for all delegates. By the late 1980s, the NYPA was unable to raise the funds necessary to sponsor the annual YPJ Canada sessions. This, among other reasons, led to the collapse of YPJ Canada. The 8th session held in the summer of 1990 was billed as the \\"10th anniversary session\\". The following session was the last.

Several boat companies give river tours which lead to the grotto. This attraction is known primarily as the most romantic spot on the island of Kauai, and the area can be rented for weddings.  History  Wailua river flows past the Wailua Complex of Heiau which was a gathering place for the island's chiefs. Pu'uhonua or places of refuge, are located near by as well, along with stones marking the births of new chiefs. The ferns that the grotto is known for began growing during the plantation era. A basin for storm runoff was built right above the grotto, and water that leaked through encouraged the growth of maidenhair and Boston sword ferns. Fern Grotto's decline began when it was hit by Hurricane Iwa in 1982. It was then nearly destroyed Kauai was hit by Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Most of the ferns hanging from the grotto were torn from the rocks and, though much of the plant life has rebounded, the grotto has had a difficult time recovering. In spite of the damage, it remains one of the most popular spots on the island. On April 24, 2006, the grotto was closed by the Hawaii State Department of Land and Natural Resources for safety reasons. Heavy rains in March, 2006, caused a number of rocks and boulders to fall from the ceiling of the grotto onto the viewing area below. It was re-opened in 2007 following reinforcement of the rock walls and installation of ramps to access to the grotto. Prior to the 2006 flooding, visitors were allowed to enter the grotto, but today the grotto may only be viewed from the designated observation deck.

He is best known as frontman of the rock band Cog, which disbanded in 2010. He was also a guitarist in now-defunct funk metal band The Hanging Tree. Biography Flynn Gower was born in 1972 in Sydney, Australia, and is the oldest of 3 children. He initiated his career in the early- to mid-90s forming the funk metal band The Hanging Tree, which became one of the most popular bands in the Sydney live circuit. After a few years developing a following through extensive touring, the band released a debut, self-titled album in 1996. Shortly before the recording of this album, Lucius Borich, a childhood friend of Gower joined the band on drums, after leaving ARIA Award nominated grunge band Juice. In 1997, Borich left the band and travelled to the U.S. to do session work. Throughout, however, Gower was communicating with Borich, both writing new music. This led to the formation of Cog in 1998. Gower had, in preparation for a move to the U.S., sold all of his gear. However, Borich had returned home, unhappy with the session work he had been undertaking. For the next 8 years, Cog consumed the musical direction of Gower, though much of the music the band was playing had been written before the 1998 formation of the band. The band recorded demos in 1998, with Borich playing bass. Flynn's brother Luke Gower was brought in on bass guitar for live shows. Initially, Cog played instrumentally, but after failing in a search for a vocalist, Gower took up the role, though without any previous experience. From 1998 to 2002, the band played through Sydney, gathering a following to rival that of The Hanging Tree in the mid 1990s. In 2002, the band came to the fore of Australia's heavy rock/metal scene with the release of the Just Visiting Part One and Just Visiting Part Two EPs. In early 2003, Gower contributed vocals to the track Perception Twin by peers The Butterfly Effect, appearing on their Begins Here album. Cog released the single Open Up in March 2003, and continued to tour Australia. In mid-2004 the band shifted management and labels, before recording a debut album in The New Normal. After its release in April 2005, the album saw a slight shift and a massive growth in the band's fanbase, in accordance with a more commercial sound, while retaining a progressive feel, some tracks topping 10 minutes. After four national tours in the space of a year, the band returned to the US began to record and write tracks for their second album, entitled Sharing Space, in Weed, California. Sharing Space was released on 12 April 2008. In February, the band announced that they will be touring around Australia in support of Sharing Space in May and June. On 24 April 2013 Flynn and Luke Gower released a new single \\"I've been thinking\\" under a project name \\"The Occupants Music\\", recorded late 2012 at Rocking Horse Studios in Byron Bay. Forrester Savell produced the track with Troy Wright on drums.http://www.theoccupantsmusic.comhttps://www.facebook.com/TheOccupantsMusic?fref=ts https://soundcloud.com/the-a-3/ibt-final-master Facial Hair Amongst his musical pursuits, Gower was known for his intriguing facial hair. In a style that evokes images of a catfish, Gower, for the past decade has sported an almost entirely shaved moustache, besides the edges, which are quite lengthy. As of 2018, he has shaved his moustache. Music=Vocals His vocal style is intriguing and unique, particularly in the early stages of Cog's development, alternating between a bizarre high-pitched semi-falsetto sung from the throat and more masculine timbres. His formation of words is also fairly unusual, drawing out diphthongs to extremes. Over the course of Cog's history, the semi-falsetto has been replaced with more conventional singing, but remaining is the odd word formation. Guitar Gower's style is fairly left field, with a lot of contrast between heavier and lighter timbres. Primary influences on his style are not very apparent upon listening, though he has cited Helmet, Tool and Soundgarden. The tuning of his guitars are all the same in the 4 lower strings. The tuning being (low to high) CGCf always for the lower strings, and the 2 highest strings vary in tuning, depending on the song, for example, \\"The Spine\\" and \\"Doors..\\" are tuned (low to high) to CGCfcd. The tunings used were all made up, writing the music first, then tuning the guitar making it easier to play what had been written. In Cog, where rhythm plays a significant part in the music, there is usually a lot of interplay between drums, bass and guitar. Of late, his style seems to be somewhat influenced by heavier post-rock bands such as Isis and Pelican. Equipment Guitars: Flynn Gower uses a selection of guitars made by Gibson(he has been seen using different guitars). His main guitar is a Goldtop Gibson Les Paul Standard. His other tour guitars include another Gibson Les Paul and a Gibson Les Paul Double-Cutaway. * Amplifiers and Effects used Live: ** Marshall 4x12 Cabinet ** Orange 4x12 Cabinet ** Framus 4x12 Cabinet ** Soldano 4x12 Cabinet ** Mesa/Boogie Roadster Head (x2) ** Mesa/Boogie Rectifier Roadster FootSwitch ** Boss DD-20 Giga Delay (x2) ** Boss DD-3 Digital Delay ** Boss OC-3 Super Octave ** Boss PH-2 Super Phaser ** Boss RV-5 Digital Reverb ** Boss DS-1 Distortion ** Boss LS-2 Line Selector ** Electro-Harmonix Sovtek Big Muff ** DOD FX25B Envelope Filter ** Vox V847-A Wah ** TC Electronic G-System Discography=CogThe Occupants * \\"I've been thinking\\" (2013 single) * Hindsight (2014 EP) ReferencesExternal links * Official Website of The Occupants Music * Official Facebook page of The Occupants Music * Official Website * Official MySpace Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Australian guitarists Category:21st-century guitarists ","title":"Flynn Gower"},{"id":"4440806","text":"is a gymnast from Japan.

Larry originated as a low pressure system over the eastern Coral Sea on 16 March 2006, and was monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Brisbane, Australia. The low- pressure area organized into a tropical cyclone two days later and quickly strengthened into a Category 4 storm on the Australian tropical cyclone scale. Larry made landfall in Far North Queensland close to Innisfail, on 20 March 2006, as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale, with wind gusts reaching , before dissipating over land several days later. Throughout Queensland, Cyclone Larry resulted in roughly AU$1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) in damage. At the time, this made Larry the costliest tropical cyclone to ever impact Australia; surpassing Cyclone Tracy in 1974 (not accounting for inflation). Meteorological history Larry began as a low pressure system over the eastern Coral Sea that was monitored by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology from 16 March 2006. It formed into a tropical cyclone off the coast of Queensland, Australia on Saturday 18 March 2006. Larry was a Category 2 cyclone in the Australian intensity scale when the cyclone watch commenced, and gradually intensified to a high Category 5 cyclone on that scale. The eye of Larry crossed the coast in between Gordonvale and Tully between 6:20 am and 7:20 am AEST on 20 March 2006. According to preliminary data, the winds may have reached with gusts to . However, re-analysis based on land observations indicated that Cyclone Larry was a Category 4 cyclone during landfall, as wind gusts were estimated to have reached in the area of impact.Larry was a category four cyclone: BoM. ABC News, 22 March 2007. Larry making landfall on Queensland coast The Australian intensity scale is based on maximum wind gusts, which are estimated to be 40 percent above 10-minute sustained winds. On this scale, Larry peaked as a Category 5 cyclone, during landfall. On the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's maximum 1-minute wind speed assigned to the cyclone define it as a Category 4-equivalent storm. Based on estimated winds speeds required to destroy simple structures, a damage survey of buildings in the Innisfail region estimated peak gust wind speeds (in reference to flat open country at a height of ) across the study area to range from . This estimate correlates with the Bureau of Meteorology's re-analysis of Cyclone Larry at landfall. Their reviews of data suggest that Larry was a Category 5 system when it crossed the coast. It was confirmed by the Bureau of Meteorology in March 2007 that the cyclone made landfall as a Category 5 cyclone. A 10-minute average wind speed of was reported in Innisfail during landfall, theoretically corresponding to 1-minute sustained winds of , and maximum wind gusts generally consistent with a Saffir-Simpson scale Category 5 storm.BoM ‚Äì Tropical Cyclone Frequently Asked Questions At 1 am Australian Eastern Standard Time on 21 March 2006, Larry was downgraded to a Tropical Low pressure system as it moved inland. Ex- tropical cyclone Larry was further tracked as it moved into western Queensland to the north of Mount Isa. Larry's short life as a cyclone is attributed to its speed; the system moved very quickly over the Coral Sea dissipating nearly 24 hours after landfall. Cyclone Larry was considered to be the worst cyclone to hit the coast of Queensland since 1931, until it was surpassed by Cyclone Yasi in 2011; consequently, the name \\"Larry\\" was retired on 12 December 2006.Tropical Cyclone names Impact False-color image showing the extent of flooding in the area around Normanton and Karumba, Queensland. Green indicates vegetation and blue indicates water. The top image is two weeks after the bottom. Cyclone Larry was regarded as the most powerful cyclone to affect Queensland in almost a century. According to Queensland state Counter Disaster Rescue Services executive director Frank Pagano, Cyclone Larry constituted \\"the most devastating cyclone that we could potentially see on the east coast of Queensland for decades ... there was great destruction.\\" Then- Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie declared Larry a disaster situation, comparing it to Cyclone Tracy, giving local governments the authority to enforce mandatory evacuations. Then the Australian Prime Minister John Howard said of Larry, \\"this cyclone is of an enormous magnitude,\\" and reserved several UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters for rescue efforts in the aftermath of the cyclone. He also promised grants of $10,000 to businesses affected by the cyclone. An appeal fund was launched by the Queensland Government, with an initial donation of $100,000; the Commonwealth Bank initially donated $50,000, and then increased its contribution to $1 Million after examining the devastation. Premier Beattie asked \\"everyone to dig deep and help people who have suffered in the devastation wreaked by the cyclone.\\" Cairns airport and harbour were closed, and all flights were suspended. Innisfail, where Larry made landfall, suffered severe damage. In Babinda, north of Innisfail, up to 80% of buildings were damaged. The region's banana industry, which employs up to 6000 people, suffered extreme losses of crops, accounting for more than 80% of Australia's total banana crop.Cyclone devastates banana, sugar crops The Atherton Tablelands also received a great deal of damage from Cyclone Larry, with damage to buildings, and major disruptions to power, water and telephone services. Other towns suffering damage included Silkwood (99% of homes damaged), Kurrimine Beach (30% of homes damaged), and Mission Beach (30% of homes damaged). Cairns, the largest city in the region affected by the cyclone, sustained minor structural damage, mostly comprising fallen power lines and houses damaged by fallen trees throughout the city. Light aircraft were flipped over at Cairns Airport. A damage survey of buildings in the Innisfail region concluded that the majority of contemporary houses remained structurally intact, though many roller doors were destroyed. The report noted that the structures should have been able to withstand the cyclone, as the winds impacting the buildings were below the threshold required for meeting the region's building standards. Buildings constructed prior to the introduction of higher cyclone rating standards suffered comparatively more damage. In total 10,000 homes were damaged. Preliminary reports estimated the cost of loss and damage to domestic and commercial premises is to be in excess of half a billion dollars. After landfall, Tropical Cyclone Larry moved over north-western Queensland on 22‚Äì23 March 2006, with heavy rain falls across the region. Gereta Station, north of Mount Isa, recorded 583 mm of rain in the 48 hours to 9 am on 23 March 2006. Heavy flooding was reported along the Leichhardt River downstream, resulting in the inundation of some cattle properties. Aftermath Cyclone Larry caused extensive and persistent damage to the regions natural rainforest. Normally resilient to high wind speeds of previous cyclones the force of Larry stripped several hundred thousand acres of leaves. A large quantity of major ND upper canopy trees were blown down or broken off. many stripped and damaged trees unable to resist a variety of tropical pests caused a second wave of dying to occur in the following months. The regions forest, famous as being similar paleoforest to the Amazon, became lower in overall height. Edmonton, an outer suburb of Cairns in the aftermath of the storm, on 20 March 2006. On 27 March, the Governor General of Australia, Michael Jeffery, visited the area several days into the recovery. He viewed the devastation from the air and also met with groups of people on the ground. Australian Defence Force A few hours after the immediate effects of the cyclone, the Australian Defence Force dispatched elements of the Townsville based 3rd Brigade and the Cairns-based 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force including: six Black Hawk helicopters, three Iroquois helicopters, one Chinook helicopter, one Seahawk helicopter, three Navy landing craft, two Caribou aircraft, two C-130 Hercules, and several LARC-V amphibious 4WD vehicles. A Combat Services Support Battalion coordinated emergency support at Innisfail Showgrounds, providing health care, environmental advice, fresh food and purified water (as well as testing local supplies), tarpaulins, bath and shower facilities, and up to 500 beds. The Cowley Beach Training Area near Mourilyan Harbour, south of Innisfail, was significantly affected by the cyclone, and its use as a base by recovery teams was therefore limited. QLD Rural Fire Service (Thuringowa Group) The Mourilyan sugar mill after the cyclone Thuringowa Group Rural Fire Brigade volunteers responded immediately after the impact of the cyclone. The rural fire volunteer task force set up a command post at East Palmerston, which was in place for a number of weeks. A newly acquired Emergency Support Unit was quickly prepared for disaster relief operations. This unit had to be sold before STC Yasi slammed the North QLD Coastline however, the Rural Fire Service and QLD Fire & Rescue had honed their incident management skills and along with the LDMG in Townsville, ensured that emergency response during and after the cyclone were suitable and appropriate. Lessons learned. Leadership by General Peter Cosgrove General Peter Cosgrove, head of the Cyclone Larry Taskforce, pictured in 2008 at Canberra. Former Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Cosgrove, took charge of recovery efforts, and was directing activities from Innisfail by 24 March 2006. He called for an economic assessment by state and federal governments, and specified a moratorium on businesses' debt repayments to banks for 3 months. Tradesmen and prisoners About 150 tradesmen from around Australia arrived in Innisfail around 26 March 2006, and worked to reopen schools and other public buildings, and to make private dwellings habitable. The Queensland Government also investigated how many trusted prisoners could be organised for work- gangs. Accommodation Media outlets reported that rental agents were working to find accommodation for displaced persons, after the already tight accommodation market was exacerbated by the severe damage done to homes in the affected areas. Many tenants and owners of severely damaged homes had little chance of finding accommodation in the area, and many were expected to move to Cairns for several months. Many people were sheltered in town halls while the defence force built additional temporary accommodation. Banana Shortage The cyclone destroyed 80‚Äì90% of Australia's banana crop. Australia is relatively free of banana pests and diseases, and therefore does not allow bananas to be imported. Bananas were in short supply throughout Australia for the remainder of 2006, which increased prices across the country by 400‚Äì500%.National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration.

Illuminares is a now-defunct annual lantern festival (starting in 1989) held every summer in John Hendry Park (also known colloquially Trout Lake Park) in east Vancouver. In 2010, the festival moved to Canada Place, but the 2012 festival returned to John Hendry Park. The event was put on by the Public Dreams Society, a group formed in 1985 to encourage community events. Illuminares was a mixture of events put on by the society, such as fire-breathers and bands, and participants bringing their own homemade lanterns. Local artists ran lantern-making workshops to help people make their own personalized lanterns. The festival was paid for through corporate and community sponsors, government grants, and donations from participants at the event. While it began as a small community festival, Illuminares quickly grew into one of the most popular events in Vancouver. About 30,000 people attended each year. Another lantern festival, the North Shore's Wild Lights Lantern Festival, is held in Edgemont Village. Another public event that Public Dreams put on was the Parade of Lost Souls, a parade through Vancouver's Commercial Drive neighbourhood around Halloween, until it was taken over following Public Dreams' demise.

Background Dorman Skinner was arrested while trying to proposition an undercover police officer. He was charged with \\"communicating in a public place for the purpose of obtaining the sexual services of a prostitute\\" contrary to section 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. He was convicted at trial. On appeal, Skinner argued the provision of the Criminal Code violated his right to freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Charter. The Court of Appeal agreed and found a violation that could not be saved under section 1 of the Charter. It was also suggested the provision may also violate the right to freedom of association under section 2(d) of the Charter. The issues before the Supreme Court was whether section 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code violated sections 2(b) and 2(d) of the Charter, and if so, whether the provision was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter. In a 4‚Äì2 decision, the Court overturned the ruling of the Court of Appeal. It held that the provision violated section 2(b) but was saved under section 1, and did not violate section 2(d). Opinion of the Court The majority opinion was written by Chief Justice Brian Dickson. He first found that section 195.1(1)(c) did not violate freedom of association. He stated that the law targets expressive content alone and does not relate to association. The provision does not depend on whether there was an agreement for exchange between consenting individual. Though the law may prevent communication for certain commercial activities it is not sufficient to invoke the freedom of association. In considering the freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Charter, Dickson applies the same reasoning from the earlier Reference Re ss 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man), which found that section 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code violated the freedom of expression but was saved under section 1. Dissent Justice Bertha Wilson, supported by Claire L'Heureux-Dub√©, dissented. She, unlike Dickson, pointed to the Criminal Code reference decision.

He was Army director of public relations in the 1960s when the conduct of the Army's personnel came under scrutiny during the Profumo affair. Early life Monckton was the only son of Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, created Viscount in 1957, and Mary Adelaide Somes Colyer-Ferguson. He was born at Ightham Mote, which was owned by his maternal grandfather, Sir Thomas Colyer-Fergusson. Monckton's sister, Valerie Goulding, founded the Irish Central Remedial Clinic and became a member of the Seanad √âireann. His father was a British lawyer and politician, and became chief legal advisor to King Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis in 1936. Education and Second World War Monckton was educated at Harrow and then read agriculture at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1939. He converted to Roman Catholicism at the University of Cambridge, and was later a Knight of St John of Malta. He was bailiff of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and was awarded the Grand Cross of Obedience. Viscount Monckton was an active supporter and longtime member of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George and held the rank of Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of Justice as well as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Francis I, its sister order. After Cambridge, Monckton immediately joined the Army, being commissioned into the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, which was part of the British Expeditionary Force in France. He commanded a troop on the River Dyle in Belgium, facing the advance of the German blitzkrieg, and he received the Military Cross for his actions on 18 May 1940 in the retreat to the River Dendre. He was evacuated from Dunkirk with his regiment in 1940, and attended the Staff College, Camberley in 1941, serving as a Brigade Major from 1942 to 1943. He then attended the Command and General Staff School in the United States, before joining the 3rd (King's Own) Hussars in Palestine in 1944, moving with it to Italy in 1944. He then rejoined his own regiment in Germany. He attended RAF Staff College in 1949, and was then GSO2 in the 7th Armoured Division. Korean War He returned to his regiment to command \\"A\\" squadron in the Korean War from 1951 to 1952, and became second in command. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel and served in the War Office, and was appointed OBE in 1956. He then commanded the 12th Royal Lancers in Germany for two years, and next was promoted brigadier in 1961 and took a staff posting to the War Office as deputy-director of personnel administration. He was promoted Major General in 1963, and became Army director of public relations, dealing with press scrutiny into the behaviour of soldiers in Germany in the aftermath of unhelpful comments from the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. He became Chief of Staff at the Headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine in 1965. He was appointed a Commander of the Belgian Order of the Crown in 1965 (Leopold III of Belgium was Colonel of his regiment), and Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1966. He left the Army in 1967, but was Colonel of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers from 1967 to 1973. Retirement years In retirement, he ran his farm near Maidstone, Kent. He served on the board of directors of Anglo-Portuguese Bank, Burberrys and Ransomes. He regularly attended the House of Lords, having succeeded to the Viscountcy in 1965, speaking on rural affairs and the armed forces. Originally a Conservative, he resigned the whip to become a cross-bencher. He lost his right to sit and vote in the House of Lords in 1999; in his attempt to become one of the 92 elected hereditary peers, he submitted a manifesto calling for the muzzling of cats outside, and stating his support for the monarchy. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent from 1970, and his wife was High Sheriff of Kent in 1981 and 1982. He was interested in archaeology, and pursued an active interest in heraldry, being President of the Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies for 35 years (1965‚Äì2000).

Of all the species in the family Crotaphytidae, C. reticulatus is the only species which is not restricted to rocky habitats. Description Crotaphytus reticulatus is a tan to brown lizard with reticulations covering most of its dorsum, limbs, and tail. Some of these reticulations are filled with black pigmentation. Unlike the rest of the species in the genus Crotaphytus, there is no color difference between males and females of C. reticulatus except during the breeding season. During this time, males develop a bright yellow coloration on their chests. The collars on C. reticulatus are faint and the anterior collar is complete ventrally. The dewlap, or gular area, is a greenish-gray with black pigmentation in the center. The gular area of the female is white to yellow without the black pigmentation in the center. Symmetrical black spots fill in some of the pattern. The ventral surface is white or a cream color. C. reticulatus grows to a total length (including tail) of . It is sexually dimorphic during breeding season. Males have a black collar around the neck, and yellow chest and throat markings. Females develop orange bars along the underside when gravid. Collared lizards have small pockets at the base of the tail and folds of skin above the front legs. Mites and chiggers gather in these areas. C. reticulatus lacks the postfemoral mite pockets present in the rest of the genus. This suggests this genus broke away from the ancestral group first. C. reticulatus has black oral melanin and black femoral pore secretions. The rest of the genus, except C. antiquus, has gray secretions. Behavior The reticulate collared lizard is diurnal and primarily carnivorous, feeding on invertebrates and other small prey, even other lizards. It spends most of its time perched on rocks, basking in the sun, but is generally quick to flee if approached. C. reticulatus spends its life on the ground much like the closely related leopard lizards. When threatened, it will take refuge in rodent burrows and under brush. Conservation concerns The geographic range of the species C. reticulatus is declining due to habitat destruction and possibly climate change. The reticulated collared lizard is the only crotaphytid species in the United States that is protected from collection.

Indicates the position of Greenwell Springs It was previously distinct unincorporated community in East Baton Rouge Parish. The ZIP code for this area is 70739. History In the 1850s, Robert W. Greenwell purchased land in the area of what is now known as Greenwell Springs and began developing the area into a rural resort that was built around 10 medicinal springs. Despite the springs being in close proximity to each other, each spring was said to have very different and distinct mineral properties from the others. It was believed that this indicated the springs each came from different levels beneath the ground. The resort area became known as the Greenwell Springs Hotel, and was used during the Civil War as a headquarters and staging area by Confederate General John Breckinridge. Prior to the Battle of Baton Rouge in April 1862, Breckinridge's forces marched west to attack Union forces that had occupied the city. After the battle, Confederate forces retreated back to the Greenwell Springs Hotel and used it was a hospital for wounded troops. Both Union and Confederate troops were buried on the grounds of the hotel in unmarked graves. During the war, Robert W. Greenwell joined the Confederate Army, and served as a captain. He was the commander of the East Baton Rouge Guards which was then Company F, 3rd Louisiana Cavalry, during the Battle of Port Hudson. After the war, most of the resort village known as Greenwell Springs, as well as the Greenwell Springs Hotel, was torn down. The lumber from these buildings was used to help rebuild structures in Baton Rouge that had been damaged or destroyed during the war. In 1910, a new Greenwell Springs Hotel was built on the site of the old hotel. A new springhouse was built at the same time as the new hotel. A short time after construction was completed, the springs stopped flowing. The loss of the springs was believed to be because the mouths of the springs were opened too wide which resulted in a loss of water pressure. With the absence of the springs, the new hotel soon lost appeal and was closed down. In 1920, the Greenwell Springs Hotel burned down. The State of Louisiana later bought the property to use as a tuberculosis hospital and eventually as a mental hospital known as Greenwell Springs Hospital. It was during this time that the springs began to flow again. In April 2005, the unincorporated community of Greenwell Springs became part of the territory of the newly incorporated city known as Central.http://cec.wikidot.com/central-history It is the home of former Louisiana State Senator Gaston Gerald, a farmer/rancher in East Baton Rouge and Washington parishes.

He is known for his architectural paintings, capricci, compositions with ruins, and some vedute. He worked in Naples and Rome. He is known in older sources as Viviano Codagora or il Codagora. Life Viviano Codazzi was born in Valsassina near Bergamo around 1604.Ludovica Trezzani. \\"Codazzi, Viviano.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 Apr. 2016 His family relocated to Rome by 1605. View of the Arch of Titus with horsemen at rest, figures by Jan Miel Viviano most likely trained in Rome. He had moved by 1633 to Naples where he worked on commissions at the Certosa di San Martino resulting from his connections with his fellow Bergamasque Cosimo Fanzago. A major commission in Naples was a series of four large canvases representing ancient Roman scenes (including one depicting gladiatorial combats in the Colosseum) for the Buen Retiro in Madrid, with figures by Domenico Gargiulo. Codazzi was a painter of architecture and the figures in his compositions were always painted in by specialist figure painters. In Naples his principal collaborator for the figures was Gargiulo. The artist married on 3 May 1636 Candida Miranda, from Naples. The couple had seven children of whom Niccol√≤ and Antonio became painters.Giuseppe Scavizzi, CODAZZI, Viviano, in: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 26 (1982) After relocating to Rome following the revolt of Masaniello in 1647, he collaborated with painters from the circle of mainly Dutch and Flemish painters active in Rome who were known as the Bamboccianti. His most frequent collaborators were Michelangelo Cerquozzi and Jan Miel. He further collaborated with Filippo Lauri, Adriaen van der Cabel and Vicente Giner during the 1660s. Artemisia Gentileschi relied on Viviano Codazzi to paint in the architectural backgrounds in a number of her paintings. An example of such collaboration is the Bathsheba in the Columbus Museum of Art.Keith Christiansen, Judith Walker Mann, Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Museo di Palazzo Venezia (Rome, Italy), Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), St. Louis Art Museum, 2001, p. 416 Codazzi had several close followers, including Ascanio Luciano and Andrea di Michele in Naples, his son Niccol√≤ Codazzi (1642‚Äì1693), Vicente Giner ( a native of Spain), and Domenico Roberti. In Northern Europe, artists such as Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, Jacobus Ferdinandus Saey, Jacob Balthasar Peeters, Antoon Gheringh and Jan Baptist van der Straeten were also influenced or inspired by his work.Viviano Codazzi at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Viviano's son, Nicolo (Naples, 1642 - Genoa, 1693) was a painter of architectural paintings and capricci like his father.Le vie degli artisti : residenze e botteghe nella Roma barocca dai registri di Sant'Andrea delle Fratte, 1650‚Äì1699, by Laura Bartoni, Roma : Edizioni Nuova cultura, (2012), page 416. Another son called Antonio was also a painter but his work is not well known. Despite his intense artistic activity Viviano Codazzi was registered as poor in 1657. He resided in Rome except for brief absences (around 1653 and possibly between 1659 and 1666) until his death in Rome on 5 November 1670. Work The Nativity in an ancient ruin Most of Codazzi's paintings are medium-sized paintings of architecture, either ruins, ideal architecture, or capricci, in a landscape setting. The type of decorative architectural paintings that Salucci created represent a form that became popular in mid-17th century Rome.Alessandro Salucci (Florence 1590‚Äì1655/60 Rome) and Jan Miel (Beveren-Waes 1599‚Äì1664 Turin), An architectural capriccio with an ionic portico, a fountain, a two story loggia, a Gothic palace and figures on a quay at Christie's Art historians interpret the growing popularity of the architectural piece in 17th century Italy as the result of a shift of patronage from 'committente' to 'acquirente', that is, from painting on commission to painting on the open market. Architectural canvases were particularly welcome within the typical 17th-century decorative ensemble, where walls were completely covered with paintings of various types and sizes. The architectural piece lent variety to such ensembles by introducing the strong verticals and horizontals of its subject matter.David R. Marshall, The Roman Baths Theme from Viviano Codazzi to G. P. Panini: Transmission and Transformation, in\\" Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 12, No. 23 (1991), pp. 129-159 The roots of this type of vedute can be found in 16th-century painting, and in particular in the architectural settings that were painted as the framework of large-scale frescoes and ceiling decorations known as 'quadratture'. These architectural elements gained prominence in 17th-century painting to become stand-alone subjects of easel paintings. St. Peters Basilica A number of artists practiced this genre. Alessandro Salucci was an important contemporary practitioner of the genre whose work was influenced by Viviano Codazzi. Codazzi's vedute where generally more realistic than those of Salucci who showed somewhat greater creativity and liberty by rearranging Roman monuments to serve the purpose of his compositions.Importante architettura di Alessandro Salucci (Firenze 1590-Roma dopo il 1650) at Antiquares Codazzi also did not adhere strictly to the dictations of topography and archaeology. His works show a search for architectural arrangements that evoke aesthetic harmony. Codazzi was acclaimed in his time as close to the ancient architect Vitruvius among 17th-century painters of architectural views. This recognition by his contemporaries was indicative of his mastery of linear perspective and understanding of antique taste.Viviano Codazzi (Bergamo 1604‚Äì1670 Rome) and Filippo Lauri (Rome 1623‚Äì1694), Arches in ruins and Hecuba‚Äôs vengeance over Polymesto at Dorotheum Codazzi's depiction of St. Peters Basilica dated 1636 is more a veduta, i.e. a topographical view, than a capriccio.St Peters Basilica in the Prado Museum, Madrid It was painted in Naples and shows the old entrance to the Vatican palace, which was destroyed when Bernini's Scala Regia and colonnade were constructed, as well as clock towers (campanili) based on an engraving of a never-executed design by Martino Ferabosco. One of his best known paintings is a depiction of the Revolt of Masaniello in the Piazza del Mercato in Naples in which the figures were painted by Cerquozzi. The work was made in 1648 on a commission by Cardinal Bernardino Spada and is now in the Galleria Spada in Rome.

As a result, he is forced to see a competent psychiatrist (from \\"Brake My Wife, Please\\") who suggests Bart get a drum set in order to harness his anger and the energy he has and find the focus and discipline that he needs. Bart gets a kit and instantly becomes a natural at it, imagining that every drum and cymbal is Homer's face. He practices non-stop, even while asleep, and, in the style of \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\"'s video, he walks through Springfield while drumming and leaving a copy of his drum kit behind him, every time he plays it, and literally runs into The White Stripes on the street, earning Bart an enmity with them. They then try to chase him in the same fashion, until they stop in the middle of an open bridge and fall into a nearby garbage barge. Eventually, his drumming drives Homer and Marge mad and Lisa suggests to her parents that she can take Bart to a jazz brunch. Lisa asks Bart to jazz along with her quintet, which he does. Bart easily overshadows everyone, including Lisa, and a legendary jazz group asks him to play with them, much to Lisa's anger, especially as she is the more experienced and passionate of the two. Lisa then tries to overtake Bart in his passion of skateboarding, which ends in failure. Marge, who does not want Lisa to compete against Bart, decides to let her adopt a puppy in order to make her happy. At the animal shelter, Lisa picks the cutest puppy over a very sick dog that would otherwise die. But at night, the sick dog comes in a ghost-like form to tell her that his fate is doomed because she chose the other dog over him. Lisa decides to go back and adopt the sick puppy, but after seeing how sick many of them are, she decides to adopt them all in order to save their lives. On her way home, many other animals join her, including a horde of circus animals. Having nowhere to put them, Lisa puts them in the attic. After dinner that night, Lisa goes into the attic and finds Bart and his jazz group with the animals she rescued. A tiger bites Bart's arm, causing extensive nerve damage that leaves him unable to play. In order to raise money for the operation he needs, Bart organizes a benefit concert. Meanwhile, Lisa is informed that her animals will be taken to a pound and killed if she cannot find a suitable home for them. The benefit is a success, and Bart feels empathy for Lisa and decides to use the money to build a home for the animals. The other musicians begin to discuss the idea of holding another benefit to repair Bart's arm.

Dan Iverson of IGN quotes that like the previous episode, it was decent, and praised the strength of the eighteenth season so far. He called the White Stripes' cameo funny, and called the episode entirely random, starting off with the death of Homer's Vegas wife Amber. He gives the episode a final rating of 7/10, similar to the previous episode. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed The White Stripes' performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. Andrew Martin of Prefix Mag named The White Stripes his seventh favorite musical guests on The Simpsons out of a list of ten. Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press listed them as number four of the top five worst musical guests in Simpsons history.

He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fifth round of the amateur draft and made his debut on September 2, 1987. Along with the Dodgers, Devereaux played for the Baltimore Orioles in two separate stints, and the Chicago White Sox, Atlanta Braves and Texas Rangers. Early life Devereaux was born in Casper, Wyoming. He went to Kelly Walsh High School in Casper. He played collegiately at Mesa Community College and Arizona State University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Finance.1991 Topps baseball card # 758 Career highlights The peak of Devereaux's career was from 1989 to 1993, with his best season coming in 1992 with the Orioles, when he played in 159 games, with 24 home runs, 107 RBIs and a .276 batting average. Devereaux won the 1995 NLCS MVP award with the Atlanta Braves by driving in the game-winning RBI in the 11th inning of Game One and hitting a three run home run in Game Four against Cincinnati. The Braves went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the World Series. On July 15, 1989, Devereaux hit a walk-off home run in an 11-9 win against the California Angels. The call was controversial, as the home run ball came extremely close to the foul pole. Angels manager Doug Rader argued the call with umpire Ken Kaiser the following day and was ejected prior to the start of the next game. Devereaux played his final MLB game with his original team, the Dodgers, on April 17, 1998. In 12 seasons, he had a .254 batting average, and hit 105 home runs with 480 RBIs, three grand slams, 635 strikeouts, 85 stolen bases, and 29 errors. He is second in career home runs by a player born in Wyoming (only John Buck has more). Post-playing career Devereaux served as field coach for the Delmarva Shorebirds (Baltimore Orioles Class-A Affiliate, South Atlantic League) in 2010, replacing former third baseman Ryan Minor, who had been promoted to team manager. Devereaux was the field coach for the Frederick Keys (Baltimore Orioles Class-A Affiliate, Carolina League) in 2011. He was the hitting coach for the Asheville Tourists (Colorado Rockies Class-A affiliate, South Atlantic League) from the 2012 season through the 2016 season, after which in 2017 he was assigned to the Boise Hawks, the Rockies' affiliate in the short-season Class A Northwest League. For the 2018 season, he was the hitting coach for the Cincinnati Reds Double A affiliate, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Southern League.

There are two types of grips commonly used today in competitive foil and √©p√©e: French, which is a straight grip with a pommel at the end of it, and the orthopedic or pistol grip. Virtually all high level foil fencers use a pistol grip; in √©p√©e, both types are used. Both kinds of grip optimize hitting with the point of the sword (a 'thrust'), which is the only way to score a touch with a foil or √©p√©e. There are a number of grips which are no longer common or are currently illegal in competitive fencing. The Italian grip is legal but is not used commonly. A number of grips which combine a French grip pommel with pistol grip style prongs are illegal for competition. The rationale for these grips being illegal is that they would allow both the extended reach of the French and the added strength of the pistol grip. Sabre, which is the only fencing weapon that allows \\"cutting\\" with the edge of the blade, has only one kind of grip, because of the way the blade is handled. Sabre grips are generally made of plastic, rubber over metal or plastic, wood, or leather wrapped over wood. French grip Straight French grip Bent French grip The French grip is straight or slightly contoured to the curve of the hand. It reached its modern form in the late nineteenth century. The French grip allows the fencer to \\"post\\", holding the grip towards the pommel, instead of holding the weapon near the bell guard. This gives the fencer a longer reach while reducing the power of beats and parries, and allows for an expanded repertoire of counterattacks and remises of attacks. A French grip may be bent or canted somewhat where the blade meets the grip, and it may be bent somewhat along its length. The grip may not be bent or canted so far as to take the pommel outside the cylinder formed by the bell guard. A substantial number of √©p√©eists at all levels use French grips while posting to allow for longer reach. Posting is not a technique seen in competitive foil, as it decreases one's ability to parry successfully, and thus increases an opponent's chance of a successful hit or remise. As a result, the use of the French grip in competitive foil is extremely rare. Pistol grip Pistol- grip on an electric √©p√©e. A pistol grip is any grip with a special shape or protrusion intended to aid in holding the weapon. To be legal a pistol grip must fix the hand in one position, and the fencer's thumb must fall within 2 cm of the bell guard when the weapon is gripped. In competitive fencing pistol grips are nearly universally preferred in foil, and are used by a large percentage of √©p√©e fencers because they allow stronger blade movements. Types of pistol grips While individual manufacturers have variations in shape, pistol grips can be classed into a few broad types: File:Absolute visconti.jpgVisconti grip File:Negrini visconti.jpgNegrini Visconti grip File:Uhlmann Belgian.jpgBelgian grip File:Russian grip.jpgRussian grip File:Schermasport grip.jpgSchermasport grip (a loose variant of a Belgian) File:Hungarian grip.jpgHungarian grip Illegal or little-used variations Italian grip A number of grip variations are either no longer used or are no longer legal to use in competitive fencing. The Italian grip is legal, but is not used in modern fencing. It can be viewed as a transitional step on the path to the pistol grip. The names of illegal grips are applied inconsistently and have some overlap with uncommon but legal grips. Rules organizations usually do not list names of grips as legal or not, but rather list general characteristics. In general, aside from the Italian grip, if a grip has both prongs to assist the fencer's grip and also a French grip pommel it is not legal to use for competitive fencing.https://web.archive.org/web/20180105131624/http://www.refereescommission.org/blog/tag/grip/  References  Category:Fencing ","title":"Grip (sport fencing)"},{"id":"4441002","text":"State Trunk Highway 16 (often called Highway 16, STH-16 or WIS 16) is a Wisconsin state highway running from Pewaukee across the state to La Crosse. Much of its route in the state parallels the former mainline of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road). The highway parallels Interstate 90 (I-90) or I-94 for most of its length in the state. It serves local traffic in nearby cities including La Crosse, Tomah, Wisconsin Dells, Portage, Columbus, Watertown, Oconomowoc and Waukesha. The highway is mainly two-lane surface road or urban multi-lane expressway from La Crosse to Oconomowoc, and it is a freeway east of Oconomowoc. Route description The La Crosse West Channel Bridge carrying US 14, US 61, MN 16, and WIS 16 across the Mississippi River between La Crescent, Minnesota, and La Crosse, Wisconsin over the river's West Channel WIS 16 enters from Minnesota via a connection with Trunk Highway 16 on the Mississippi River, running concurrently with US Highway 14 (US 14) and US 61\\\\. After the two US Highways turn south to follow 3rd Street in downtown La Crosse, WIS 16 passes through La Crosse via Cass and 7th streets and West Avenue, crossing WIS 35 at Lang Drive. WIS 16 passes the northern edge of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse campus, then turns north at Losey Boulevard North. The route then turns northeastward and junctions with I-90 northeast of the city. WIS 16 becomes a parallel route to I-90 and passes through West Salem where it connects with WIS 108\\\\. Wisconsin Highway 162 junctions just north of Bangor. WIS 16 crosses into Monroe County in Rockland. WIS 16 enters Sparta and junctions with WIS 21, WIS 27, and WIS 71\\\\. WIS 16 provides access to the Elroy-Sparta State Bike Trail. The route then follows I-90 very closely as a frontage road to Tomah where it junctions with WIS 131 and joins US 12\\\\. The highways continue paralleling I-90 and I-94 southeast and pass through Oakdale and into Juneau County. The freeway section of Highway 16, looking East from the Ryan Street overpass in Pewaukee, Wisconsin WIS 16 and US 12 pass through Camp Douglas and cross WIS 80 in New Lisbon. The highways then junction with WIS 58 and WIS 82 in Mauston as they continue southeast. The routes slowly trek eastward and pass through Lyndon Station where Rocky Arbor State Park is located. The highways turn southeast again and crossing the Interstates and into Sauk County and Wisconsin Dells. WIS 16 turns east off of US 12 onto WIS 13 north and passes through downtown Wisconsin Dells and into Columbia County. WIS 23 East also joins the highways at the same point. WIS 16 turns off from WIS 13 and WIS 23 on the east side of Wisconsin Dells and junctions with WIS 127 southeast of town. WIS 16 follows the Wisconsin River into Portage, meeting the other terminus of WIS 127 at the interchange with I-39. The highway then passes through Portage, crossing WIS 33 and joining US 51 south for . WIS 16 turns east off the US route and crosses WIS 22 in Wyocena and passes through Rio, Doylestown and Fall River. WIS 60 joins WIS 16 and together, they cross US 151, WIS 73 and junction with WIS 89 in Columbus as they enter Dodge County. WIS 16 and WIS 60 turn east and pass through the unincorporated town of Astico and Lowell. WIS 16 leaves WIS 60 and joins WIS 26 at the junction of the two highways in Clyman. WIS 16 leaves WIS 26 and bypasses Watertown to the north and east and into Jefferson County. WIS 19 terminates on WIS 16 east of Watertown. WIS 16 passes around Ixonia, becomes an expressway, and enters Waukesha County along a bypass of Oconomowoc. WIS 67 joins the expressway north of Oconomowoc. WIS 16 turns east onto the freeway segment and passes into Hartland, crossing WIS 83 there. WIS 190, also known as Capitol Drive, terminates at WIS 16 as the freeway turns south in Pewaukee. WIS 16 ends at a flyover interchange and its traffic merges onto I-94 east near Waukesha. History In 1918, today's alignment of WIS 16 was WIS 21 from La Crosse to New Lisbon, along with WIS 12 east of Tomah. The route from Kilbourn (Wisconsin Dells) to Clyman was WIS 29\\\\. WIS 26 followed its current alignment to Watertown and the route from Watertown to Waukesha was WIS 19. WIS 29 was extended westward to La Crosse when WIS 21 was truncated back to north of New Lisbon. When the U.S. Routes debuted in 1926, WIS 29 was removed from the books as the entire alignment was replaced by US 16. WIS 19 was truncated back to its current terminus. The current eastern terminus of WIS 16 was the site of the dedication ceremonies for the first completed segment of Interstate 94 in Wisconsin. The segment was opened on September 4, 1958. The first major interchange on the new Interstate was originally where US 16 turned north towards Pewaukee and WIS 30 continued west with I-94. The section of US 16 between the interchange outside of Waukesha and downtown Milwaukee was truncated at the interchange in the 1960s. US 16's designation was removed from the route and replaced with the current WIS 16 in 1978. The original WIS 16 followed present day WIS 29 from Chippewa Falls to Green Bay via Wausau and Shawano. The route then followed a route that would become US 141 to Manitowoc where it ended at then WIS 17 (present day WIS 42). Oconomowoc bypass The alignment of the eastern section of Highway 16 changed in late 2006 when the rest of the Oconomowoc bypass was opened to traffic. The four-lane, limited access divided highway routes Highway 16 around Lac La Belle on the west side of the city, meeting up with Highway 67 north of downtown. Eventually, the bypass will result in the removal of the state highway designation from Wisconsin Avenue through downtown Oconomowoc. The signs for Highway 16 through downtown Oconomowoc have not yet been changed, due to the reconstruction of Wisconsin Avenue through the downtown area during the summer of 2008. As of November 2008, Oconomowoc officials and WisDOT had not yet set a firm date for the jurisdictional transfer, though it was likely that it will be done by the summer of 2009. Currently, the limited- access highway around Oconomowoc is designated as Wisconsin Highway 16 on signage. Some signage, especially the signs located at the end of the freeway segment on West Highway 16 when a right turn must be made to continue on the bypass, say Bypass West Wisconsin Highway 16.

Independent pharmacies are pharmacist-owned, privately held businesses in varying practice settings. They include single-store operations, pharmacist-owned multiple store locations, franchise, compounding, long-term care (LTC), specialty, and supermarket pharmacy operation. Independent pharmacy owners generally have more flexibility to build personalized customer relationships and they strive to differentiate their services from big-chain corporations. Independent Pharmacies in the United States In 2010, there were 23,064 independent pharmacies in the U.S.2011 NCPA-Pfizer Digest Executive Summary Independent pharmacies dispensed approximately 1.5 billion prescriptions annually accounting for nearly 40% of the retail prescriptions. The average independent pharmacy had total sales of approximately $4 million and average prescription sales of approximately $3.7 million per location (accounting for 92.5% of all independent pharmacy sales). Over 26% of independent pharmacy owners have ownership in two or more pharmacies.Independent Pharmacy Today, www.ncpanet.org, Page accessed December 21, 2011 The average independent community pharmacy location dispensed 64,169 prescriptions (205 per day) in 2010, up from 61,071 in 2005.Honesty/Ethics in Professions. http://www.gallup.com/poll/1654/honesty-ethics-professions.aspx  The Future of Independent Pharmacy  The number of independent pharmacies has been steadily declining over recent years due to the difficulty of competing with large chain corporations. Large chains have the advantage of a vastly greater reach and an abundance of resources, and sometimes independent pharmacies cannot keep up with the level of production. However, this is not the only factor. Independent pharmacists still believe in the power of their services and continue to prove their importance. These community pharmacies strive to bring a level of care that goes beyond filling prescriptions. They offer more specialized, innovative services and a level of personal customer service that is unmatched. Due to their smaller size, they have a better connection to their local community and have the ability to get to know their patients beyond just their medications. For these reasons, many patients still prefer the personal touch of an independent pharmacy and the extra services that they can receive there. There are also a variety of independent pharmacy associations, at state and national levels, that unify pharmacists so they can educate each other on how to move forward most efficiently. Joining these organizations and attending trade shows is a great way for pharmacists to get involved in the movement and constantly innovate their own pharmacies. Patient services and niche practicing=Delivery services The most commonly offered services by independent pharmacies are delivery services. Durable medical goods Most independent pharmacies provide durable medical equipment (DME), such as diabetes testing supplies, therapeutic shoes for diabetics, prosthetics, orthotics and other supplies to meet essential health needs. Compounding Compounding pharmacists provide customized medications ordered by prescribers, sometimes when all other options will not work. Compounded medications are prepared by pharmacists for individual patients, often with special needs, and/or as a result of relationships with medical specialists, such as Dermatologists, Oncologists, Pediatricians, and Veterinarians who are unable to take medication in its originally manufactured form. Diabetes training Independent pharmacists provide diabetes care and management to help patients achieve therapeutic and lifestyle goals. Pharmacists screen patients at high risk for diabetes, assess patient health status, educate patients to care for themselves, monitor outcomes, and when appropriate, refer patients to other health care professionals. Some independent pharmacists provide patients with diabetes self-management education/training (DSME/T) that teaches patients to adhere to the standards of care including, but not limited to, healthy diet, physical exercise, medication, self-monitoring, healthy coping and behavior change, and reducing risks (i.e. diabetic foot care). Medication therapy management Medication therapy management (MTM) programs are designed to optimize the benefits of prescribed drugs, improve medication use, reduce the risk of adverse drug events and drug interactions, and increase patient adherence to prescribed regimens. Immunizations Pharmacists are approved to administer vaccinations in all 50 states. In 2009, pharmacists throughout the nation administered hundreds of thousands of doses of H1N1 influenza vaccine and demonstrated the critical role pharmacists play in public health and the value they deliver to their patients. Independent pharmacies may also offer routine and travel vaccines, including vaccines for pneumococcal, meningococcal, Hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes zoster (shingles), typhoid, and yellow fever. Medicare plan comparisons Many pharmacies offer Medicare plan comparisons. Pharmacists help patients/enrollees navigate their options, but must beware of steering.Stay Within the CMS Marketing Guidelines. Refill Report. http://refillreport.com/articles/pharmacy-news/stay-within-the-cms-marketing- guidelines/ Many pharmacies use plan comparison software available to consumers through the Medicare website. Smoking cessation Independent pharmacies provide tobacco cessation counseling including recommendations for over-the-counter nicotine replacement products, advice, and continuous counseling. Asthma management Independent pharmacists assist patients to manage and maintain asthma control. Asthma management services include education on the types and purposes of asthma medications; demonstrating the correct techniques on using their oral medications, inhaled medications, and peak flow meters; reinforcing and clarifying instructions as outlined in their asthma management plan provided by their physician; and addressing patient concerns. In addition, pharmacists can refer patients who use over-the-counter medications to physicians for medical care. Long-term care Independent pharmacists provide care for the nation's 40.2 million seniors in nursing homes, assisted living facilities, hospice, and home-based care. They also provide many specialty services for seniors such as nutrition assessment and support, intravenous therapy, durable medical equipment, ostomy, and pain management. Front end products Independent pharmacies not only provide prescription products and services, but also offer an array of nonprescription products and services, including cough and cold medications, antacids, vitamins, herbal supplements, ear and eye products, and other health-related products. Some independent pharmacies offer an assortment of gifts and greeting cards. These additional offerings vary from pharmacy to pharmacy. Disposal programs Some independent pharmacies offer medication disposal programs (see www.disposemymeds.org) to help their patients safely dispose of unused and expired medicines that may be dangerous to others and to the environment. Patient satisfaction=Gallup Poll According to a Gallup, for more than a decade, America's pharmacists have been recognized as one of the most trusted professions in America, Pharmacists continue to maintain a high satisfaction rate among consumers, ranking as the 2nd most-trusted profession in 2011.Pharmacists Rank Among Most Trusted Professionals. http://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/pharmacists-rank-among-most-trusted- professionals Consumer Reports Poll In 2011, readers of Consumer Reports magazine scored independent community pharmacies the highest based on overall satisfaction and service among all types of pharmacy providers. Readers who responded to a survey expressed their highest satisfaction rate (94%) regarding their experiences at a neighborhood independent pharmacy, based on pharmacists‚Äô knowledge about drugs and other products, helpfulness and courtesy, speed, accuracy, and personal service. In addition, at independent pharmacies patients were twice as likely as at chain drugstores to encounter pharmacists who were easy to talk to and provided one-on-one consultations.Like a Broken Record. US Pharmacist. http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/c/29135/ Senior editor of Consumer Reports, Todd Marks said, ‚ÄúWe found that the independents made fewer errors, offered swifter service at the pharmacy counter, and were more likely to have medications ready for pickup when promised.‚ÄùConsumer Reports' drugstore ratings: 94% of shoppers \\"highly satisfied\\" with independents (http://pressroom.consumerreports.org/pressroom/2011/04/consumer-reports- drugstore-ratings-94-of-shoppers-highly-satisfied-with-independents.html), Consumer Reports Press Room.

Independents represent 38% of all retail pharmacies but represent 52% of all rural retail pharmacies.Based upon NCPA Analysis of National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) data, Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) Codes, and 2000 U.S. Census data. Throughout this document, ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù and ‚Äúneighborhood‚Äù will be used interchangeably, and are defined at the zip code level. There are just slightly over 1,800 independent pharmacies operating as the only retail pharmacy within their rural community. A study conducted by the RUPRI Center for Health Policy Analysis and the North Carolina Rural Health Research & Policy Analysis Center found that 91% of all sole community pharmacies are located in rural communities and that 22% are located more than 20 miles from the next closest retail pharmacy. Furthermore, the study found that 83% of sole community pharmacists provide important services to other health care organizations, with blood pressure checks, diabetes counseling, and immunizations as the most common services provided. Challenges Faced by Independent Community Pharmacies Independent pharmacies face several key challenges. First, independent pharmacies are unable to negotiation on a level playing field with pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Second, independent pharmacies are disadvantaged when health plan sponsors (employers, et al.) decide to require, or financially incentivize, patients to use mail order pharmacies ‚Äì often against the patients‚Äô wishes. Third, many independent pharmacies are challenged by the growth of ‚Äúpreferred pharmacy‚Äù health plan designs that greatly restrict the patients‚Äô choice of pharmacy. Other key issues for community pharmacists are creating a fair reimbursement system for generic drugs covered under Medicaid, preserving patient access to durable medical equipment provided by local pharmacies, and implementing greater regulations and transparency over pharmacy benefit managers.

Biography Former residence of Tan Yankai in Nanjing. Tan Yankai was born on 25 January 1880 in Hangzhou during the waning decades of the Qing dynasty. He was the son of the Qing minister Tan Zhonglin. A member of Liang Qichao's Constitutionalist Party, he campaigned for a parliament and restrained monarchy. As the party renamed itself the Progressive Party after the Xinhai Revolution, he was a major leader. He left and joined the Kuomintang and became military governor of his home province. He remained neutral during Sun Yatsen's attempt to overthrow President Yuan Shikai in the 1913 Second Revolution, but Yuan removed him anyway. He returned to power after Yuan's death and led his province into resisting the Beiyang Army in 1917's Constitutional Protection War, which saved Sun's Guangdong base. After a brief attempt at spearheading federalism, his subordinates forced him to resign. When Chen Jiongming was driven out of Guangzhou, Tan was made home minister by Sun. He served as Chairman of the National Government during the first half of the Northern Expedition and again during its conclusion. He was a member of Wang Jingwei's Wuhan faction and was the first internationally recognized head of state of the Nanjing-based Kuomintang government. The United States was the first major power to give recognition on October 1, 1928, though they had already given de facto recognition back in July. After the Organic Law came to effect on the Double Ten Day, he was succeeded by Chiang Kai-shek. Tan then became premier, a post he would hold until he died in office. Death He is entombed in the grounds of the Linggu Temple, near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing. Personal life His daughter, Tan Xiang, married Chen Cheng.

It was written and directed by the series creator and executive producer David Chase. Cast=Starring * James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano * Lorraine Bracco as Dr. Jennifer Melfi * Edie Falco as Carmela Soprano * Michael Imperioli as Christopher Moltisanti * Dominic Chianese as Corrado Soprano, Jr. * Vincent Pastore as Pussy Bonpensiero * Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante * Tony Sirico as Paulie Gualtieri * Robert Iler as Anthony Soprano, Jr. * Jamie- Lynn Sigler as Meadow Soprano * Nancy Marchand as Livia Soprano Guest starring * Michael Gaston as Alex Mahaffey * Joe Lisi as Dick Barone * John Ventimiglia as Artie Bucco  Synopsis  It is 1999. New Jersey mobster Tony Soprano, a capo in the DiMeo crime family, has been referred to a psychiatrist, Dr. Jennifer Melfi, after having a panic attack. Tony tells her he is a waste management consultant, but she knows who he is. After Melfi establishes what will and will not fall under doctor-patient confidentiality, Tony begins to partly open up. He has recently been dealing with tensions between his wife Carmela and teenage daughter Meadow, as well as trying to keep Christopher Moltisanti, who he calls his nephew, in check. Tony's uncle, known as Uncle Junior, resents Tony's rise in the crime family and his own decline. Tony also has a strained relationship with his widowed mother Livia, who is resisting his advice to move into a retirement home. A confrontation with his mother triggers another panic attack, and he returns to Melfi. He tells her about a family of ducks that had been living in his swimming pool, but left when the ducklings hatched. Guided by Melfi, Tony realizes he was sad to see them go because he dreads losing his own family; to his consternation, this makes him cry. When a Czech-American criminal organization bids against Tony for a waste management contract, Christopher acts on his own initiative and kills one of the Czechs, Emil Kolar. The Czechs withdraw their bid. Junior wants to kill turncoat \\"Little Pussy\\" Malanga in a restaurant he frequents, owned by Tony's childhood friend Artie Bucco. Thinking the murder would ruin the restaurant's reputation, Tony asks Junior not to do it there, but he refuses. Tony tries to get Artie to close the restaurant for three weeks by giving him cruise tickets, but his wife Charmaine refuses them. Tony then has his right-hand man Silvio Dante bomb the restaurant so that Artie can claim insurance compensation without damage to his reputation. Mahaffey, who Tony calls a \\"degenerate gambler\\", is in debt to Tony and Hesh Rabkin, an old Jewish friend of Tony's father. Tony concocts a scheme for Mahaffey's company to make insurance claims payable to non-existent clinics in order to pay off his debts, and he is intimidated into complying. At Tony's son's birthday party, Christopher, bitter about not receiving recognition for killing Kolar, tells Tony he is thinking of turning his life story into a Hollywood script, which Tony angrily forbids. Driving Livia to the party, an embittered Junior says, \\"Something may have to be done about Tony\\". Livia listens, silently looking the other way with a hint of a smile.  Deceased  * Emil \\"Email\\" Kolar. Shot in the back of the head by Christopher Moltisanti.  Production  Pre-production for the pilot commenced in the summer of 1997, a year and a half before the series debuted on TV. The episode was completed by October 1997. Despite being well received by Chase's closest friends and the cast and crew who watched it, Chase feared the pilot would not be picked up by HBO and, in that case, planned to ask the network for additional money to shoot another 45 minutes and turn it into a feature film. Chase was also pressured by another, completely new development deal offered to him by another network, which he kept postponing until he heard HBO's verdict on The Sopranos. Right before Christmas of 1997, David Chase received a phone call and learned that HBO did like the pilot and ordered a full season, all of which happened about two hours before the deadline for accepting the other network's deal. Chase was relieved as if \\"let out of jail. It was like a reprieve from the governor.\\" \\"The Sopranos\\" is the first of only two episodes directed by Chase. The other is the series finale, \\"Made in America\\". Although this episode is titled \\"The Sopranos\\" on the DVD, Blu-ray and reruns on A&E;, it was referred to as \\"Pilot\\" when originally aired. During the year-long break between the pilot and the start of the shoot of the rest of the 12 episodes of the season, James Gandolfini gained 60 pounds for the role of Tony and underwent voice coaching. Siberia Federico and Michael Santoro play Irina and Father Phil respectively. For future episodes, these roles were recast with Oksana Lada and Paul Schulze. Drea De Matteo was originally simply cast as a restaurant hostess for this one episode only. The filmmakers liked her performance, and her character was developed into the role of Adriana La Cerva in future episodes. The pork store used as a meeting place is Centanni's Meat Market, a real butcher shop in Elizabeth, New Jersey. However, because the shop had a steady business and because local business owners were annoyed with the incidental effects of having a television production being shot on a weekly basis, HBO acquired an abandoned auto parts store in Kearny, New Jersey which became Satriale's Pork Store for use in future episodes.  Awards  David Chase won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing ‚Äì Drama Series for his work on this episode and a Primetime Emmy Award for Joanna Cappuccilli for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series. It was also Emmy-nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for David Chase. James Gandolfini and Nancy Marchand both submitted this episode for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series & Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, respectively. Nancy Marchand additionally submitted the next episode, 46 Long.  Connections to future episodes  * Christopher mentions his cousin Gregory's girlfriend who claims to be a development girl. Gregory and Amy Safir would both make an appearance in \\"D-Girl\\". * Pussy correcting the quote to Christopher that \\"Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes\\" would ultimately foreshadow the former's fate. In the Season 2 finale \\"Funhouse\\", Pussy's dead body gets thrown in the ocean after Tony, Silvio and Paulie execute him for being an FBI informant ‚Äî mirroring the quote. * The opening shot of the first scene in Dr. Melfi's waiting room shows Tony triangularly framed by the legs of a sculpture of a naked woman. In the Season 3 episode \\"Second Opinion\\", this exact framing is replicated, this time with Tony's wife, Carmela seen through the legs of the statue. * Tony talks to Dr. Melfi about Gary Cooper as \\"the strong, silent type\\" and how society has become a far cry from that ideal, with people constantly playing the victim and complaining about their problems instead of doing what they have to do as Cooper's characters did. In the episode \\"Christopher\\", Tony does exactly the same thing when Silvio's complaints about the Native American boycott of the Columbus Day Parade go too far in Tony's eyes. * In episodes, \\"The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti\\" (with Georgie Santorelli's help) and \\"Cold Cuts\\" (with Tony Blundetto's help), Christopher disinters and moves Emil Kolar's remains. * In \\"Whoever Did This\\", Tony suspects Ralph Cifaretto of having Pie-O-My's stable torched. He asks if Ralph has heard from Corky Ianucci lately ‚Äî an expert arsonist who was responsible for setting Artie Bucco's restaurant on fire in the pilot episode. * Carmela wants to take Meadow to the Plaza Hotel for teaa longtime mother-daughter traditionMeadow declines in this episode; it takes place in season four, episode \\"Eloise\\". * Carmela tells Tony that he will go to Hell when he dies. Tony reminds her of this in \\"Whitecaps\\". In \\"Join the Club\\", Carmela tearfully tells a comatose Tony that she regrets saying this. * When describing Uncle Junior, Tony tells Dr. Melfi that his uncle embarrassed him by telling all his girl cousins he didn't have the makings of a varsity athlete. Uncle Junior repeats that declaration to Tony on multiple occasions in the season five episode \\"Where's Johnny?\\". * Tony's ownership of John F. Kennedy's sailing hat, which he keeps on his boat The Stugots, is established in this episode. He later shows it off in the season five episode \\"In Camelot\\". * \\"Little Pussy\\" Malanga, the man Uncle Junior wants to kill in Artie's restaurant, is the same person for whom Junior mistakes Tony when he shoots him in the season six episode \\"Members Only\\". Cultural references * Voicing his discontent to Dr. Melfi about the current trend of people to publicly discuss their personal problems, Tony mentions the Sally Jessy Raphael Show. *Carmela and Father Phil watch Field of Dreams before finding out that Meadow broke curfew. * While touring Green Grove, the theme to The Rockford Files can be heard coming from the television. David Chase was a writer/producer for The Rockford Files for many years. * Christopher is introduced while driving a Lexus LS 400, which was a flagship automobile and seen as a quintessential product of the 1990s. * When disposing of Emil Kolar's body, Christopher says to \\"Big Pussy,\\" \\"Louis Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\\" Pussy corrects him, \\"Luca Brasi.\\" The character Brasi, as well as the famous phrase describing his death as \\"sleeps with the fishes,\\" are from The Godfather. The movie is referred to and homages to it are made throughout The Sopranos entire run. * When Tony grabs Christopher after he was considering selling his life story into a biopic, he mentions mobster Henry Hill whose life story was documented in the true crime book Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family and subsequently adapted into Goodfellas.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 19, 2006. Lisa aids Moe in discovering his inner-poet and he gains swift popularity and recognition from a group of successful American authors, when Lisa helps to get his poetry published. However, Lisa is crushed when Moe enjoys his newfound success with famous writers and deliberately refuses to credit Lisa for her assistance in his poetry. It was written by Matt Warburton and directed by Mark Kirkland. The episode guest stars J. K. Simmons as the voice of J. Jonah Jameson, while Tom Wolfe, Gore Vidal, Michael Chabon, and Jonathan Franzen make cameos as themselves. During its first airing, the episode gained 9.31 million viewers, beating the previous episode.Simpsons Channel  Ratings: Moe 'N' A Lisa Plot The Simpson family go to see Grampa perform at the Senior Olympics. After they leave, Moe calls Homer to remind him about a fishing trip to celebrate his birthday. When the family returns, Homer realizes he forgot Moe's birthday when he sees Moe sitting outside on their front steps. That night, Moe writes an angry letter to the family, and the dramatic writing inspires Lisa to choose Moe for her \\"interesting person\\" report at school. At Moe's residence, a run-down hotel, Lisa finds his notes on the wall and arranges them to form a poem. She submits this to American Poetry Perspectives, and the poem is approved, with author Tom Wolfe inviting Moe and the Simpson family to Vermont to attend a literary conference. After Moe sees another poet ridiculed and exiled for admitting he had help with writing, he falsely claims that he wrote and titled his poem all by himself, devastating Lisa. Moe is featured on a writing panel. Lisa attends and encourages him to share his inspirations, although he insists that he does not have any. However, without Lisa's help, Moe struggles to write a poem in time for a dinner in his honor; when he sees Lisa enter, he improvises a poem about her, thanking her for helping him write poetry. Lisa forgives Moe and they walk out of the dining hall together. Production The writers of the episode first started with the idea of Moe as Charles Bukowski and then teamed him with Lisa. The episode guest stars authors Tom Wolfe, who says The Simpsons \\"is the only show of any sort that I watch on television\\"; Jonathan Franzen and Michael Chabon, who recorded their lines together; and Gore Vidal, who admitted that he was not a regular watcher of the show. In one version of the script, Wolfe, Chabon and Franzen were all killed by a giant boulder. Although the guest stars recorded lines for this part of the episode, the scene was cut from the final version. The Wordloaf conference is based on the real life Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Vermont. Reception Dan Iverson of IGN rates it a 7.3, saying that this episode made up for the previous one. He praises all the guest voices in their appearances, though mainly Tom Wolfe's.

With its realistic look at urban gay life in the Ronald Reagan era and at the height of the AIDS crisis, many film critics consider it an important film in the history of gay cinema. It was also one of the first American films to address the AIDS pandemic. First-time director Bill Sherwood died of complications due to AIDS in 1990 without ever completing another film. Description The story revolves around a gay male couple, Robert and Michael, in their late 20s, living in New York City. Robert (John Bolger) is leaving for two years on a work assignment in Africa while his partner, Michael (Richard Ganoung), stays behind. Michael's ex-boyfriend, Nick (Steve Buscemi), for whom Michael cooks, looks after and still loves, has AIDS. Parting Glances follows a 24-hour period with scenes taking place at a farewell party for Robert hosted by the couple's friend, Joan (Kathy Kinney), and at a dinner party hosted by Robert's employer, Cecil (Patrick Tull), and his wife, Betty (Yolande Bavan), who have an unconventional marriage. While classified as a drama, the film also contains many comedic moments. Critics praised the movie's witty, realistic dialogue and detailed evocation of gay and gay-friendly urbanites in 1980s Manhattan. Parting Glances was also one of the earlier motion pictures to deal frankly and realistically with the subject of AIDS and the impact of the relatively new disease on the gay community. In one scene, Nick talks fondly of the 1970s and early 1980s era of decadence to a younger, college-aged gay man. The film's soundtrack includes Bronski Beat songs \\"Love and Money,\\" \\"Smalltown Boy\\" and \\"Why.\\" Cast * Richard Ganoung as Michael * John Bolger as Robert * Steve Buscemi as Nick * Adam Nathan as Peter * Kathy Kinney as Joan * Patrick Tull as Cecil * Yolande Bavan as Betty * Andre Morgan as Terry * Richard Wall as Douglas * Jim Selfe as Douglas's Sidekick * Kristin Moneagle as Sarah * John Siemens as Dave * Bob Koherr (credited as Bob Kohrherr) as Sam * Theodore Ganger as Klaus * Nada as Liselotte Preservation and restoration In 2006, Outfest and the UCLA Film and Television Archive announced that the film would be the first to be restored as a part of the Outfest Legacy Project.

Reviews and recognition Parting Glances gave Steve Buscemi his first major movie role. \\"It is to both his and the film's credit,\\" wrote Janet Maslin in her New York Times review, \\"that the anguish of AIDS is presented as part of a larger social fabric, understood in context, and never in a maudlin light.\\" Time Out London wrote ‚ÄúSherwood brings a notable grace and droll humour to his story of two male lovers parting against the backdrop of a friend dying of the Big A.‚Äù See also * List of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender-related films ReferencesExternal links  *Reel.com review of Parting Glances Category:1986 films Category:1986 LGBT-related films Category:1986 drama films Category:1980s comedy-drama films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:Films set in Manhattan Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Gay-related films Category:HIV/AIDS in film Category:1986 directorial debut films Category:1986 comedy films ","title":"Parting Glances"},{"id":"4441070","text":"The New Zealand DH class locomotive is a type of diesel-electric heavy transfer and shunting locomotive in New Zealand's national railway network. The class consists of six heavy shunt U10B type locomotives built by General Electric United States at their Erie, Pennsylvania plant in 1978. Five of the class are used in the Auckland area for heavy shunting duties, including services around Auckland and the Port of Auckland, while one is based at the Port of Tauranga in Mount Maunganui.  Introduction  Originally an order for Philippine National Railways 2500 Class, the six locomotives were purchased as by coincidence NZR needed a heavy shunter for Auckland container port transfer work. At the time two DSC class shunters were linked in tandem to perform this task. The DH class are a light locomotive which are geared to run at . They saw occasional service on the then under-used Auckland suburban passenger network where they performed well, but NZR focused them on their intended purpose, heavy shunting. In the late 1980s, NZR provided a DH unit to the Tasman Pulp and Paper mill in Kawerau to trial for sale as a heavy shunter in the mill's rail yards. The mill turned down the offer, instead, they purchased a DA class locomotive to perform shunting duties. In July 1979 DH905 was trialled at the Te Rapa marshalling yards in Hamilton, but the trial was unsuccessful and the locomotive returned to Auckland later that year.  Classification  The class should not be confused with the English Electric DH class of 1956; as all of the old DHs had been reclassified as DG in 1968, the classification was re-used.  Upgrades  DH2816, DH2839 at Westfield in Auckland. The locomotives were upgraded in the late 1990s with shunters refuges at the front and back of the locomotives, in line with other New Zealand shunting locomotives at the time. In the 2010s the class were upgraded again for multiple unit (MU) operation. Other users GE U10B of Ferrocarril Belgrano Sur The Hedjaz Jordan Railway has three GE U10B locomotives of gauge.

These characters remained in Main Street until the closure of the exhibit in 2003. The attraction was modified in mid-2002 to suit the second film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. A few scenes slightly changed to suit the second installment including the addition of a replica of Mr. Weasley's Flying Car. Summary Guests would queue at Platform 9 3/4 right alongside a recreation of the Hogwarts Express. The walk-through began by admitting small groups of guests into a small room with brick walls surrounding. Thanks to the magical expertise of the group's guide, the wall would magically slide away to reveal Diagon Alley. A similar scene appears in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Guests were guided along Diagon Alley, with a quick stop at Ollivanders Wand Shop and into Harry's dormitory. Guests were then able to discover the art of sending an owl with a real-life owl display.

She graduated in 1870 with a law degree, from what is today Northwestern University School of Law. At that time she was prohibited from legal practice by state law that denied women licence to the \\"learned professions\\". She finally was admitted to the bar in 1881, but did not practice. She was an advocate for women's suffrage and temperance. Virginia G. Drachman, \\"Kepley, Ada Harriet Miserfree (11 February 1847‚Äì13 June 1925)\\" American National Biography (1999) https://doi.org/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1100991 Early life Ada Harriet Miser was born in Somerset, Ohio, in 1847. Her parents were Henry and Ann M. Miser. She had a sister, Nora Miser Scott. Her family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1860, and in 1867, Ada married Henry B. Kepley, who had his own law practice in Effingham, Illinois. At his urging, Ada attended the Old University of Chicago's law department (now Northwestern) in Chicago from 1869 to 1870. There she earned her Bachelor of Laws in 1870. She was the first woman to graduate from law school in the United States. However, Illinois state law denied her admission to the state bar because she was a woman. In response, her husband Henry Kepley drafted a bill banning sex discrimination in professional occupations; it became state law in 1872. Kepley, who was more interested in social reform than legal practice, did not apply for admission to the bar in Illinois until 1881, when she gained easy admission. She also was an ordained Unitarian Minister.  Reformer  Kepley's legacy was not in the practice of law, but rather in her passion for temperance and women's suffrage. Her temperance crusade centered around her establishment of the Band of Hope, a youth-oriented temperance group, which focused on educating the youth of the Effingham, Illinois, area concerning the hazards of alcohol addiction. In conjunction with her organization, she also published a monthly temperance newspaper entitled, The Friend of Home which openly attacked the dram shops (saloons) and their patrons. In 1897, an angered saloon-keeper's son broke into Kepley's home and attempted to shoot her with a gun, but missed and shot one of her dogs in the foot. Kepley's association with nationally known women's movement icons Frances Willard (of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union or WCTU) and Susan B. Anthony (co-founder of the National Woman Suffrage Association) gained Kepley national recognition in these organizations. Frances Willard attended a WCTU rally in Effingham at Kepley's request. Upon the death of her husband Henry in 1906, the bereaved Ada moved to the Kepley's farm between Watson and Mason, Illinois (now known as Wildcat Hollow State Forest). There, Kepley wrote her autobiography, entitled, A Farm Philosopher, A Love Story (since edited and re-published), which she published in 1912. The book was printed by Worman's Printery in Teutopolis, Illinois. Of the land that is now Wildcat Hollow she writes Poverty and death Within the next few years, she lost the farm and was forced to move to a small home in Effingham. Kepley died a charity case in St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital in 1925, and is buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Effingham, next to her husband, Henry. Works *A Farm Philosopher, A Love Story, Ada H.

Hasan al-Kawthari (1296 AH - 1371 AH/1879-1952) was the adjunct to the last Shaykh al-Islam of the Ottoman Empire, a Hanafi Ash'ari scholar and a polymath. Overview He was born in 1879 in D√ºzce, now in Turkey (back then in the Ottoman Empire), to family of Circassian descent.Muntasir Zaman, The Life and Thought of ImƒÅm ZƒÅhid al-Kawtharƒ´ After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the Kemalists began a violent crackdown on the religious scholarly class. Fearing that his life may be in danger, Kawthari fled to Cairo, then to Syria and finally returning to Cairo. There, he edited classical works of Fiqh, Hadith and Usul, bringing them back into circulation. In particular, he wrote short biographies of prominent personalities of the Hanafi school of thought. A staunch Maturidi, he held a critical view of Medieval dogmatist Ibn Taymiyya. Kawthari was one of the teachers of Moroccan scholar Abdullah al-Ghumari, who would later go on to become one of Kawthari's most prominent detractors.Gibril Haddad, The Ghumari School. 6 December 2002: Living Islam.

Al-Ash'ari did not give much preference to reason in the presence of sacred texts, even if they were transmitted by lone narrators (khabar abad) rather than through uninterrupted transmission (tawatur) while Maturidi would attempt to reconcile between reason and the transmitted text (manqul), as long as it was possible to do so without too much difficulty or without sacrificing fairness. This slight difference in methodology did not produce any substantial discrepancy in their theological precepts, but indeed served only to make the existing theological discourse all the richer. Al-Kawthari was inclined to the Ash'ari creed because of his preference to being more inclined towards the sacred texts more than reason, even though he was a Hanafi in matters of Fiqh. In his obituary to Shaykh 'Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghuddah, Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani wrote that Imam Al-Kawthari was an Ash'ari in matters of theology while being a Hanafi in matters of jurisprudence.  Recent translations of Kawthari's work  Mufti Muhammad Anwar Khan Qasmi, a Deobandi scholar, has recently translated many of his works into Urdu and published them in Indian academic journals and magazines. For example, al-La Madhhabiyya Qintarat al-La Diniyya, an article Kawthari wrote equating non-conformism to irreligiousness, was translated by Qasmi with extensive footnotes and introduction by him and published by Deoband Islamic Research and Education Trust in 2013 under the title of Ghayr Muqallidiyyat: Ilhad Ka Darwaza. Also, Qasmi translated Kawthari's extensive introduction to Imam Ibn \`Asakir's Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari, published by the same Center in Deoband in 2013, under the title of Islami Firqe: Eik jaiza. Mr. Anwar Qasmi also translated and edited in Urdu one of his great books called Fiqh Ahl al-\`Iraq wa Hadƒ´thuhum: Originally an introduction to Na·π£b al- RƒÅyah, which was published separately with Shaykh  øAbdul FattƒÅ·∏•'s footnotes.

There are 38 languages. The unity of the South Halmahera‚ÄìWest New Guinea subgroup is well supported by lexical and phonological evidence. Blust (1978) has proposed that they are most closely related to the Oceanic languages, but this classification is not universally accepted.Blust, R. (1978). \\"Eastern Malayo-Polynesian: A Subgrouping Argument\\". In Wurm, S.A. & Carrington, L. (eds.) Second International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics: Proceedings, pp. 181-234. Canberra: Australian National University. (Pacific Linguistics C-61). Most of the languages are only known from short word lists, but Buli on Halmahera, and Biak and Waropen in Cenderawasih Bay, are fairly well attested. Classification Traditionally, the languages are classified into two geographic groups: *South Halmahera languages (along the southeastern coast of Halmahera, plus one language in the east of the Bomberai Peninsula). *West New Guinea languages (on the Raja Ampat Islands west of New Guinea, and the islands and shoreline of Cenderawasih Bay). The unity of the South Halmahera and Raja Ampat languages is supported by phonological changes noted in Blust (1978) and Remijsen (2002). This results in the following structure: *Cenderawasih Bay *Halmahera Sea (South Halmahera, in the sea between Halmahera and New Guinea, and Raja Ampat off the western tip of New Guinea) David Kamholz (2014) includes these languages as additional branches: *Lower Mamberamo (if they are not Papuan) *Mor *Tandia *Waropen The following languages groups are problematic ‚Äì they may or may not be SHWNG. Kamholz (2014) does not classify them due to lack of data. *Irarutu‚ÄìNabi: Irarutu, Kuri (Nabi) *Bedoanas‚ÄìErokwanas: Arguni, Bedoanas, Erokwanas Kamholz (2014) The SHWNG languages can be categorized as such (Kamholz 2014: 136-141):Kamholz, David (2014).

Typology At least six SHWNG languages, namely Ma'ya, Matbat, Ambel, Moor, Yaur, and Yerisiam, are tonal.Kamholz, David. 2017. Tone and language contact in southern Cenderawasih Bay. NUSA: Linguistic studies of languages in and around Indonesia, no.62, p.7-39. Klamer, et al. (2008) suggest that tone in these SHWNG languages originated from contact with Papuan languages of the Raja Ampat Islands that are now extinct. There are few lexical similarities with present-day Papuan languages, except for a few words such as ‚Äòsago‚Äô that are shared with the two tonal Papuan isolates Abun and Mpur (both spoken on the north coast of the Bird's Head Peninsula):Klamer, Marian; Ger Reesink; and Miriam van Staden. 2008. East Nusantara as a Linguistic Area. In Pieter Muysken (ed.), From linguistic areas to areal linguistics, 95-149. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. *bi·¥¥ (Ma'ya) *bei (Abun) *bi·¥∏ (Mpur) However, Arnold (2018) traces this etymology to proto-Malayo-Polynesian *Rambia ‚Äòsago palm‚Äô. Arnold (2018) reconstructs tone for proto-Ma'ya-Matbat and proto-Ambel, but not for proto-SHWNG. Other than tonogenesis, these proto-languages had also gone through monosyllabization.Arnold, Laura. 2018. ‚ÄòA preliminary archaeology of tone in Raja Ampat‚Äô. In Antoinette Schapper, ed. Contact and substrate in the languages of Wallacea, Part 2. NUSA 64: 7‚Äì37. The VRK Mutation is characteristic of most the SHWNG languages (except for the RASH languages), where the phonemes /√ü/, /r/, and /k/ surface as the prenasalized voiced stops [mb], [nd], and [≈ãg] in various cluster environments.Gasser, Emily. 2018. Surprising Phonology: Typology and Diachrony of Austronesian VRK Mutation. Talk presented at Yale University. The mutation is found in the Ambai, Ansus, Biak, Busami, Dusner, Kurudu, Marau, Meoswar, Moor, Munggui, Papuma, Pom, Roon, Roswar (possibly equivalent to Meoswar), Serewen (possibly a dialect of Pom), Serui-Laut, Umar, Wamesa, Warembori, Waropen, Wooi, Yaur, Yerisiam, and Yoke languages.Gasser, Emily. 2018.

Paper presented at the 14th International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics (14ICAL), Universit√© d‚ÄôAntananarivo, Madagascar, July 17-20. (Slides) Kamholz notes that SHWNG languages have relatively low lexical retention rates from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, pointing to significant influence from non-Austronesian languages.

Weighted clothing are garments that have heavy materials incorporated into them, to add weight to various parts of the body, usually as part of resistance training. The effect is achieved through attaching weighted pieces to the body (or to other garments) which leave the hands free to grasp objects. Unlike with held weights or machines, weighted clothing can leave users more able to do a variety of movements and manual labour. In some cases certain weighted clothing can be worn under normal clothing, to disguise its use to allow exercise in casual environments. The use of weighted clothing is a form of resistance training, generally a kind of weight training. In addition to the greater effect of gravity on the person, it also adds resistance during ballistic movements, due to more force needed to overcome the inertia of heavier masses, as well as a greater momentum that needs deceleration at the end of the movement to avoid injury. The method may increase muscle mass or lose weight; however, there have been concerns about the safety of some uses of weights, such as wrist and ankle weights. It is normally done in the form of small weights, attached to increase endurance when performed in long repetitive events, such as running, swimming, punching, kicking or jumping. Heavier weighted clothing can also be used for slow, controlled movements, and as a way to add resistance to body-weight exercises. Core=Neck Sometimes, weights are draped over or tied to the neck. As weighted vests often have weight placed here, they effectively have the same benefits. Advantages to neck weights and more upper-body-centric weighted vests is that they allow easier spinal flexion (contracting abdominals or stretching extensor spinae) and extension (contracting extensor spinae, stretching abdominals). This makes them prime for adding resistance to these movements, and takes out the requirement of using the arms to anchor weight to the upper body to add resistance. TorsoVests= The purpose of using a weight vest is to add extra weight for body-weight exercises and to create an overload effect for walking, distance running or speed, agility and quickness (SAQ) drills. Research demonstrates that using an overload during sprinting or speed drills requires lower-body muscles to generate more force against the ground which could lead to gains in strength and power and ultimately faster acceleration during running. Weight vests are used by athletes to increase strength and efficiency during speed, power and agility drills; producing a unique training effect that is unavailable with traditional free weight training equipment. They can also be used by casual walkers or runners. Weight vests are becoming a very popular form of adding weight around the entire core to, for the most part, simulate the fat storage areas of the human body. It is very useful for adding weight to limb-centric movements, and for handling great weights. Due to the large area available, it can also handle more weight. If well-affixed, it is the safest most natural means of mimicking added body mass without unbalancing the body's muscles. They can be used to add resistance to almost any whole-body movement. A study has shown that using a weighted vest can increase the metabolic costs, relative exercise intensity, and loading of the skeletal system during walking.The effect of weighted vest walking on metabolic responses and ground reaction f... One problem with some weighted vests is that due to tightness in the shoulder girdle, in movements like pull-ups or high range of motion pushups, the vest can be shearing, either damaging the person or in some cases, the vest itself being slowly torn away. This can also be seen as an advantage, however, in those who wish to limit their range of motion due to lack of strength or flexibility, to avoid injury. The limitations of front and back bending of the core is for example, contrasted by ergonomic construction to encourage good posture in modern weighted vests such as the x-vest, hyper vest or game-breakers pro suit. Another problem with some weighted vests is the constriction of breathing and overheating due to the use of heavy, non-breathing materials such as nylon and neoprene. The latest developments in weighted vest products offer comfortable weight vests with cool wicking fabric that allow full range and direction of movement, chest expansion for breathing, open sides connected with lacing, and low profile design allowing a vest to be worn under clothing or football pads, unlike traditional vests made of nylon or neoprene. Backpacks Using weighted backpacks is a very common form of weight. It is like clothing when properly affixed, although some backpacks require tension in the pectorals or being held on the arms to keep from sliding off if not properly affixed. Simpler to put on and remove than weighted vests, it simulates how humans carry things, like young or injured comrades or camping supplies, rather than the storage of body fat. For most exercises, like pull-ups or pushups, it is just as effective as a weighted vest in adding resistance from gravity. Limitations in flexibility forward or backward or to the side in arms may or may not be present depending on the pack as they vary greatly. A standard form of military and fire fighter training is not only be able to carry a backpack, but to march and run with one loaded down with a concrete \\"marble\\". Part of SWAT training is to be able to do pull-ups wearing a heavy pack. Hip drags Hip drags are not so much useful due to their weight, but are small attachments which add drag during many movements in swimming by making the swimmer less streamlined. This added resistance allows the swimmer to build up more force, and swim faster when they are later removed. Belts Different from dip belts, weighted belts are affixed to the body and do not use suspended weights or swing. They are useful, like weighted vests, in having weight close to the core and mimic very well the additional weight one might have from body fat stored in the abdomen and lower back. The advantage over other core weights is the flexibility that is freed up by not constraining the upper body, the disadvantage being limited core flexion. There tends to be some overlap in certain larger weighted vests and the region covered by certain larger weighted belts near the upper abdominal muscles. =Dip belts= A dip belt can be used to add weight to exercises Dip belts are a commonly used form of weight training. They are named for the dip exercise, one of the few and best known methods of adding resistance to it. It is also commonly used to add resistant to pull-ups and knee/leg raises in hanging from a pull-up bar. Unlike most weighted clothing, dip belts are not affixed to the body, but rather the weight suspends semi-secured to the usually leather belt, suspending from the back and generally kept up by resting on the gluteus. As such, it is only useful in strength training movements, and not for dynamic movements, making it only pseudo-clothing. Dip belts are also used for added weight in squatting exercises, for people who want to work their quadriceps muscles with more weight without compressing their spine or straining their back muscles or hands. Due to the dangling length, these belt squats are usually done elevated, where the suspended weight will dip much lower than the feet, allowing a sufficient range of motion. How far below the feet it goes can determine the range of motion of the exercise, similar to limitations like squatting in a power rack for working heavy resistance near the top of the movement. Upper body=Upper-arm Upper arm weights are another method of adding weight close to the core beyond that of a weighted vest, or to add resistance to the shoulders with less danger to the elbows than wrist weights or the added biceps/triceps strain. A problem with these is similar to thigh weights in that those with large biceps, triceps, or fat around the region may experience tightness, and the tightness required can be straining in exercises that involve elbow extension, making it more suitable for leg and core movements. Wrist Wrist weights are used in place of holding dumbbells (or to supplement them) or other hand-held weights as a way of adding leveraged resistance to the movement of the arms. Like ankle weights, practicing explosive movements is not advised, and if done, should be approached gradually, with acceleration before full extension, and also reduced gradually, to avoid over-extension injuries. Wrist weights are advantageous in that they do not require a strong grip or wrist extension for added arm resistance like held hand weights do. A disadvantage is that the tightness required to stop movements could possibly increase the damages in those with carpal tunnel syndrome. Gloves Weighted gloves serve a similar purpose to wrist weights. Generally, they are worn to prepare for boxing in some fashion. Their advantage, beyond a slight increase in distance for leverage, is the lack of strain on the wrist from having weight isolated there, and better simulating sparring gloves. They are generally not very heavy, and since they limit the grip anyway, unless being used to practice specific striking fists, light dumbbells are more common. Lower body=Thighs Thigh weights are the most reasonable form of resistance. The location of the mass more readily duplicates the natural fat-storage mechanism of the human body and being closer to the core. In leg raise exercises, it allows more activation of the hip flexors (and abdominals) without putting more strain on the quadriceps muscles for extension, making it good for sports-specific training on movements like knees and jumping. The greater area and safe location allow it to handle much more weight. For those with wide thighs, such as bodybuilders with large quadriceps, or people with large amounts of fat stores on the inner thigh, it may cause chafing. If worn on both legs, however, the chafing would be between the weights and only damage them, possibly only chafing with a lack of tightness. Thigh weights are not ideal for movements involving quadriceps use, as they require tightness which may limit the use of the muscle and blood flow to the legs. For such movements, weights worn higher on the body or free weights are more ideal. Ankles Ankle weights are a commonly found weight used in many activities. Further from the core, fixated above the ankle around the lower shin and Achilles tendon, due to leverage much less weight is needed to increase the forces on the body. As they are attached to a region with a far smaller diameter than the thigh, there is not room for much weight without greatly changing the effective width of the lower leg. An advantage over thigh weights is that they are not attached to any major muscle or fat storage region, so tightness is not a factor and it can be used in almost any exercise. Being above the ankle, movements incorporating the calf muscles such as calf raises can benefit from ankle weights. Ankle weights are useful in adding weight to pull-ups and dips, especially when incorporating leg raises into the movements. They are also useful in slow kicking katas, and static- active stretching of the legs when balancing on one leg, or suspended in the air. Light ankle weights have a history of use resistance for kicking in swimming, and of forward flexion in kicking, walking, jogging, and sprinting exercises. Concern has been expressed regarding this type of training. It may put too much stress on the joints, similar to the shearing forces found in leg extension and leg curl exercises. Practicing weighted movements at high speeds also causes the nervous system to fire at larger intensities. If an individual loses the weight without being trained to adapt to the transition, he may overexert himself without checking at the end of the movement and overextend a tendon. This is more of a risk when people fully extend their limbs in such movements and do not come to a controlled stop at the end, limiting muscle flexion. Generally, the muscle being extended is more at risk, not one held statically. For example, the quadriceps muscle could overexert in a snap kick trained with ankle weights, but in a rising kick, it is the hip flexor muscle more likely to overextend. In either case, the hamstring and associated ligaments would be at risk for a tear. One major advantage to ankle weights, unlike wrist weights, is that it adds a whole new component to exercises that wrist weights do not, since we can't grip dumbbells with our feet like we can with our hands. It is a major advantage in training rotational hip stabilizers, to work on turnout for martial arts and dance postures. To do this, the leg is bent 90 degrees at the knee, and then rotated inwards and outwards to bring the foot upwards. This is commonly seen in footbag kicks and holds. One potential disadvantage to ankle weights is they may add stress to ligaments in ankle or knee. For this reason, some expert physicians discourage running while wearing them. Footwear Weighted footwear, such as \\"iron\\" boots, sandals, and shoes, are generally very similar to ankle weights. The main difference is that being below the ankle, the calf muscle is not activated at all in wearing them. Muscles in both legs only become stimulated when the leg is raised in the air (calf flexion for the rooted leg, hip/knee/ankle for the raised leg, or the entire body if suspended from pull- up bar). For straight-leg flexion (front and back) the slight increase in distance does increase leverage somewhat. In regard to the flexion muscles of the ankle, weighted footwear provides unique methods of working them that ankle weights do not. Leverage is best when the weight is near the tip of the foot, either above the toes or (more often) below the ball of the foot. Flexed to the front, it works the muscle opposite the calf, which is very useful as it is not a commonly activated muscle for movement, generally only a stabilizer to the calf muscle. It is very useful in retaining flexibility. The calf muscle can also be activated, but the leg must be raised behind the body as to make gravity resisting the flexion. At the front of the body, it would only assist calf flexion. An advantage to weighted footwear is that they can be inconspicuous, depending upon the weight and the form of the footwear in question. This mainly applies to those with a fixed weight, adjustable weighted footwear is more obvious, and may not even be used as normal footwear at all inherent to their design, an example being weighted boots with a pole for the weight stack extending directly from the sole of the foot. For footwear which can be worn normally, an advantage to wearing them beyond additional training stimulus, is their additional mass, which creates far more downward force than one would otherwise have, with foot-dropping attacks such as axe kicks and stomps. To gain this energy, more initial energy must be expended in hip flexion (and possibly knee extension) to raise the foot from the ground. Therapeutic use Sensory integration therapy, a popular therapy for children with autism and other developmental disabilities, often employs weighted vests, weighted belts and weighted blankets, under the theory that behavioral problems such as inattentiveness and stereotypy are due to over- or under-sensitivity to sensory input, and that weighted belts and weighted blankets provide proprioceptive feedback that has a calming effect. Only a limited amount of scientific research is available on this treatment, but it suggests no significant improvement with weighted vests.\\"The Use of Weighted Vests with Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Other Disabilities,\\" Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, Jan. 2009, vol. 39, pp. 105-114 Sunday, May 31, 2020 Cultural references=Literature *In the Kurt Vonnegut short story Harrison Bergeron, physically strong individuals are weighted down with weights of varying heaviness in accordance to the individuals' strength. This is done to handicap them and make them physically \\"equal\\" to a normal person. *Tamora Pierce's Protector of the Small quartet, knight-trainees wear weighted leather harnesses in general training to increase strength and prepare for wearing armor. Manga and anime * 1984: In Dragon Ball many of the characters wear weighted clothing as a form of training to increase their strength. Master Roshi wears a heavy-weighted turtle shell on his back, as do Goku and Kuririn during their time training with him, though they are not shown with the shells after this point. In a martial arts tournament Goku goes up against Tenshinhan, to which he throws off his clothes which were weighted, he then gains in speed and power. Goku and Piccolo hide weights in their gis. Removing the clothing visibly increased their power levels on Raditz' scouter. Later in the series, some characters use high gravity environments such as gravity-multiplying chambers to train. By increasing their body-weights, they no longer require potentially cumbersome weighted clothing to train properly, as the higher bodyweight movements suffice, though at times they have also used weighted clothes during gravity training. In some scenes where the higher gravity environments are not available, characters also use weighted wrist bands and ankle bands, sometimes weighing several tons each. * 1989: In Hajime no Ippo, the Osaka brawler boxer named Sendo Takeshi adds ankle weight to his training routine in order to build up greater lower body strength. The effects of this addition do not show themselves until his second Japanese title defense when the training results in increased weight shifting and dashing power. * 1994: In Rurouni Kenshin, Kenshin's master Hiko Seijuro wears a white coat (modeled after Spawn) containing weighted springs that constrict the garment and require a person's muscles to work from being crushed. The resistance it provides is more due to the tensile force of the springs rather than their weight, though they would contribute somewhat. Upon removing it, the strength built through wearing it can be used against opponents. A suit like this could be dangerous to wear. As nothing like it currently exists, it may be hard to design in real life. Some similar simplified attempts using similar ideas exist using stretch bands anchored on the shoulders and feet. While the springs could have significant weight, technically making it weighted clothing, it is more so resistance clothing as it primarily uses a force other than gravity to resist the movements. It will remain here until resistance clothing has its own article. * 1998: In Hunter √ó Hunter, before seeing Killua, Gon, Kurapika and Leorio wear weighted slippers and clothing during their stay at the gatekeeper's house. * 1999: In Naruto, the taijutsu expert Rock Lee uses stone-weighted clothing. He wears extremely dense ankle weights, and rarely removes them. When he does, he gains an exceptional increase in speed. He later wears weighted sandals, a weighted belt, and wrist weights for training. * 1999: In The Prince of Tennis, Sadaharu Inui uses various weighted clothing to exercise his body while reading and taking notes. * 2000: In Beyblade, Kai Hiwatari wears wrist weights all day and during bey blade battles, keeping them as an emergency reserve (much like Goku) for added power and speed to unleash the power of his beast when they are removed. * 2001: In Samurai Jack a native tribe of monkeys have immense jumping ability required by Jack. He trains with massive rocks tied to his ankles until the day he can jump a very small amount (less than 1mm). The tribe unbind him, and upon jumping he leaps an enormous distance into the air.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 24, 2006. In this episode, Marge learns carpentry, but uses Homer as a front when she wants to make money off her talents since no one in Springfield believes that women can be carpenters. Meanwhile, Principal Skinner and Bart fight each other when Bart discovers that Skinner is allergic to peanuts and Skinner discovers that Bart is allergic to shrimp. It was written by Matt Warburton and directed by Mike B. Anderson and Ralph Sosa. In its original broadcast, the episode received 9.72 million viewers.Simpsons Channel ratings: \\"Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em\\" Plot On a trip to the extremely rundown Springfield Mall (Bart says that this is because Mayor Quimby's father was murdered there), Homer happens across the Time‚ÄìLife Carpenter's Library, and Marge encourages him to buy them. Homer's interest in carpentry fades, and Marge decides to use them herself to fix up the house, starting with her broken nightstand. She begins to learn more about carpentry and Lisa suggests to Marge that she try to earn some money as a handywoman, thus opening up \\"Simpsons Carpentry\\". However, potential clients (Superintendent Chalmers and Krusty the Clown) turn her down, dismissing the idea of a female carpenter. Commenting on how people expect carpenters to be male, Marge develops a plan. She uses Homer as a front to the customers, while Marge, hiding in an accompanied red tool chest, does all of the work as Homer rests in the toolbox, and switching back when the customers come to check on Homer's work. While business is going great, when she is out buying supplies Marge becomes discouraged by Helen Lovejoy and Lindsay Naegle, who taunts her for being Homer's \\"helper\\". That night, Marge tells Homer that she feels he is taking too much credit and wishes she would get some recognition for the work. Homer, however, does not want to be humiliated by revealing his wife has done everything. Marge continues to get angry after an incident in which Homer mocks Marge's carpentry skills with Lenny and Carl, and when he tells her he has been hired for the biggest commission yet in repairing Springfield's old wooden roller coaster, \\"The Zoominator\\", she quits and tells Homer he will have to do the work by himself. Homer tries to fake his way through being a foreman in front of his newly hired construction crew, but they eventually abandon him when he reveals he cannot pay them and does not know anything about construction. The big reopening day arrives, and Homer stands in front of a crowd gathered to witness the unveiling of the refurbished roller coaster. Marge has a video camera at the ready, so she can catch Homer being exposed as a fraud on tape. When revealed, the crowd is in awe at the seemingly repaired roller coaster, but with a hit from Homer's popped cork from his champagne, the coaster starts to break, becoming as rundown as it had been before. Still not wanting to admit the truth, Homer proves the coaster is safe by riding it himself, even though there are large gaps in the track. Acting quickly, Marge repairs each broken piece just before Homer's cart runs over it. While riding, Homer finally reveals to the crowd that Marge has done all the handiwork. The crowd applauds as the coaster comes to a stop at the beginning, and just as Marge is about to tell Homer that she loves him, the entire roller coaster structure comes crashing down on top of Homer. At the hospital, Marge visits Homer, who is immobilized in a full-body cast, and he sweetly tells her that marriage is the real rollercoaster and he is thrilled to have Marge as his \\"safety bar\\". Meanwhile, a note is sent out from the school, informing parents that someone at the school has a peanut allergy so foods containing peanuts will no longer be allowed on school premises. An indignant Bart claims it to be unfair not to disclose the identity of the \\"kid\\", but he soon discovers the \\"kid\\" is actually Principal Skinner. With this newfound knowledge, and with the assistance of a peanut on a stick, Bart forces Skinner to do his bidding (publicly humiliating and injuring himself). After being advised by Comic Book Guy that the only way to stop Bart is to find his \\"kryptonite\\", Skinner breaks into the Springfield General Hospital and searches through medical records of Bart in the night. He finds out that Bart is allergic to shrimp. The next day, Skinner counters Bart's peanut stick with his own: a shrimp on a stick. Bart and Skinner clash Star Wars style with their respective \\"sticks\\" with \\"Duel of the Fates\\" played in the background. They eventually get led into a Thai food factory in the \\"Little Bangkok\\" section of town. They battle over a rickety catwalk, which is straight over the top of a vat of shrimp-peanut mixture. Skinner sees this and attempts to end the battle, but Bart defiantly rushes at Skinner, causing both of them to topple into the vat, and putting them in the hospital in the same room as Homer for their allergic reactions, though the reactions are just hives. Skinner is outraged to hear that Marge thinks Bart saved Skinner's life, and the two proceed to throw shrimp and peanuts at each other to set off their respective allergies again, and a disgusted Marge decides to head over to the maternity ward observation room to see the new babies. Cultural references The episode's title is a reference to MC Hammer's album, Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em. The arcade features a games machine marked Polybius - an urban legend supposedly constructed as an experiment by the U.S. government. Bart and Skinner's peanut‚Äìshrimp fight is a parody of lightsaber duels from the Star Wars film series; it is set to \\"Duel of the Fates\\", a piece from the Star Wars prequel trilogy by John Williams. The song playing during the montage of Bart threatening Skinner with peanuts is \\"Beat on the Brat\\" by The Ramones. At the run-down mall bookstore where Homer spots the carpentry series of books, Marge is shown standing in front of a tome called \\"Kansas City Royals--Forever World Champions\\"; at the time this episode aired, the Royals were 21 years removed from their lone World Series title and were the worst team in baseball, but in 2014 they returned to the World Series and narrowly lost in a seven-game battle with the San Francisco Giants and in 2015 they won their first World Series crown in 30 years. Bart and Skinner fall to a vat of shrimp-peanut mixture is quite similar to Red Hood who fall in to the vat of unnamed chemicals that change him to a mutant evil clown of Gotham, called THE JOKER. Reception Mike B. Anderson (pictured) directed the episode. In its original run, the episode received 9.72 million viewers. Dan Iverson of IGN calls it a brilliant episode; despite the fact the Simpsons have tunneled down a similar storyline, he quotes they've done better in making this plot unique. He gives it a final rating of 7.5/10, better than the previous episodes. Adam Finley of TV Squad, like Iverson, enjoyed the episode's secondary plot with Bart vs. Skinner.TVSQUAD: \\"Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em\\" References External links  * * Category:The Simpsons (season 18) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes ","title":"Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em"},{"id":"4441226","text":"The Rev.

However, Vic (Sarah Strange), Kat's best friend (and ex-lover) still has a crush on her, hates Big Al and doesn't approve of the relationship. Big Al is almost arrested in a police sting, but is released when they realize he is unarmed...as Kat was holding the guns. Returning home, they catch a thief trying to take their new TV out the window, and Big Al gives him a beating. They call the police and berate them for not catching the 'real crooks', all the while surrounded by the stolen goods that are their livelihood. Meeting up with his old partner, Reilly (Stephen Dorff), they steal a car as Al tries to convince him to come back to help Al run the gun business. However, Kat has plans on her own; she wants to sell guns on her own to provide since she wants to move out of Queens and into a classier neighborhood, maybe by the beach. She meets up with Jose (Vincent Laresca), a drug dealer and Big Al's rival, and sells him a gun. However, Clancy (Tony Munch), a local snitch working for Al, notices them. Kat returns home and pretends to have been out with Vic, upsetting Al. When Jose brazenly comes to Al's local bar and comes on to Kat, Al, Clancy, and their friends punish him by appearing to cut off his fingers. Al comes home later, and based on comments from Clancy, accuses Kat of having sex with the 'spic'. He forces her to confess to lying to him and then beats her up, leaving her with a black eye and bleeding lip and even cuts off chunks of her hair. After he leaves the apartment the next day, Vic and Reilly come over to console her, swearing revenge, but Al arrives home and in the ensuing scuffle, AL fires a shot that grazes Kat, and then is arrested and detained. At the police precinct, Kat is questioned by Liz (Aisha Tyler), a member of a battered women\`s group that offers protection via sanctuary or court order. Liz explains that Al doesn't really love her, and she used to be in an abusive marriage of her own. However, Kat refuses to press charges but ultimately decides to leave. Subsequently, Big Al sneaks in through the window as she is packing, threatens her with death if she ever leaves and says there is nowhere she can hide from him. When Liz and Vic arrive to take her, he convinces Kat to tell them she wants to stay. Liz threatens to \`end him\` if he ever touches Kat, but they ultimately leave without her. While convincing Al the relationship is back the way it was, she secretly devises a plan; seeming to seduce Vic, Reilly, Jose and Liz, and telling each of them she\`ll do anything to be rid of Big Al. After convincing Al to stay home one evening, a hooded figure takes Big Al's special jacket with his name on it, his registered .45 handgun, and shoots Clancy. The next day, Big Al goes into church and threatens the priest, Father Duffel (Hardie Lineham), saying that he abhors weakness. Leaving, he is arrested for Clancy's murder as a crowd of locals watch from across the street, Kat, Vic, and Reilly among them. Later at the police station, Big Al begs Kat to find the real killer, knowing he has been set up, but can't figure out who did it. Slowly Kat reveals that she is behind the plot, and is now in charge. Later, Reilly and Vic discuss who the killer is, and then realize they both fear the hard change in Kat, and decide to start a relationship together. Soon enough, Kat meets up with the hooded killer: it was Liz. Kissing, Liz says now they can be together but Kat explains she only used her, and thanks her for her advice about being a strong woman (\`Lips, tits, hips\`) and leaves Liz heartbroken. Kat picks up the gun business and the film ends with her narrating the whole story from the beach neighborhood she wanted to live in before walking away.

It was initially located beneath Mount Gargaron, one of the three peaks of Mount Ida, today known as Koca Kaya ().Cook (1973) 256-7. At some point in the 4th century BCE the settlement moved approximately 5.8 km south of Koca Kaya to a site on the small coastal plain near the modern villages of Arƒ±klƒ± and Nusratlƒ± (), at which point the previous site came to be known as Old Gargara ().Cook (1973) 256-7. Both sites are located in the Ayvacƒ±k district of √áanakkale Province in Turkey. Mount Gargaron Mount Gargaron has been identified with the mountain today called Koca Kaya (Turkish Great Rock), a western spur of Mount Ida with a maximum elevation of 780 m.Cook (1973) 257. The poet Epicharmus (fl. 540 - 450 BCE) refers to the mountain as \\"snowcapped\\" (·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨ŒΩŒΩŒπœÜŒ±), and the Etymologicum Magnum (ca. 1150 CE) knew a tradition according to which the inhabitants of Old Gargara moved to their new site to escape the cold of their old home.Epicharmus, PCG fr. 128 K-A = Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.20.3-6: ŒñŒµ·Ω∫œÇ ·ºÑŒΩŒ±Œæ ‚Ä† ŒëŒùŒëŒëŒîŒëŒù ‚Ä† ŒΩŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ± ·ºÄŒ≥Œ¨ŒΩŒΩŒπœÜŒ±, which Schneidewin emends to ·ºÄŒΩ‚Äô ·ººŒ¥Œ±ŒΩ (\\"Lord Zeus who dwells ‚Ä† on Ida ‚Ä† at snow-capped Gargara\\").

In Homer's Iliad it is said to have had an altar to Zeus at its summit, and hence is a place the god frequently visits.Homer, Iliad 8.47-52 (watching the battle on the plain of Troy), 14.292-3, 352-3, 15.151-3 (found here by his wife Hera), cf. Epicharmus, PCG fr. 128 K-A. In one passage Zeus is said to have come to Mount Gargaron from Mount Olympos to view the battle between the Trojans and the Acahaeans, about 50 km NE of here.Homer, Iliad 8.47-52. In writers of the 1st and 2nd century AD such as Statius and Lucian Zeus is said to have abducted the Trojan prince Ganymede from Mount Gargaron while he was hunting in the nearby forests.Statius, Thebaid 1.548-9, Lucian, Dialogues of the Gods 10, Pseudo-Lucian, Charidemus or On Beauty 7. Lucian also represents the Judgement of Paris as taking place on Mount Gargaron rather than in its more traditional location further to the east above Antandrus.Lucian, Judgement of the Goddesses 1, 5. The anonymous author of On Rivers thought that Gargara was Mount Ida's previous name, while the Latin poet Valerius Flaccus used it as a learned way of referring to Ida.Pseudo-Plutarch, De fluviis 8.3, Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 2.360, 582-3. The Etymologicum Magnum explains the name of Gargaron either as deriving from the verb Œ≥Œ±œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒØŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ ('to gargle') on account of the springs thought to bubble up on the summit (an inference taken from Homer's reference to 'many-fountained Ida' in conjunction with Gargaron), or as deriving from Œ≥Œ±œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ≠œâŒΩ ('uvula') on account of the mountain's shape.Etymologicum Magnum s.v.

ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ±. History=Foundation There is no indication in the relevant passages of the Iliad that Homer considered Mount Gargaron inhabited.Cook (1973) 257-8. This is partly confirmed by the fact that the earliest archaeological remains found at the site (fortification walls around the acropolis and the foundations of a temple) date no later than the 6th century BCE.Cook (1973) 255-61, St√ºpperich (1995), Schulz (2000) 28. In the 7th century BCE the poet Alcman said that the settlement was inhabited by Leleges, an Anatolian people, but this may simply be an inference from Homer's remark elsewhere in the Iliad that the whole southern coast of the Troad was inhabited by Leleges.Alcman, Poeti Melici Graeci fr. 154 = Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ±, with Cook (1973) 259 n. 3. Hecataeus of Miletus (ca. 550 - 476 BCE) and Hellanicus of Lesbos (ca. 490 - 405 BCE) say that Gargara was inhabited by Aeolian Greeks originally from nearby Assos and Myrsilos of Methymna (first half of the 3rd century BCE) that Assos was a foundation of Methymna, hence the Aeolian ethnicity of Assos and the secondary foundations of Gargara and Lamponeia.Hecataeus of Miletus FGrHist 1 F 224 = Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ±, Hellanicus of Lesbos FGrHist 4 F 160 Myrsilos of Methymna FGrHist 477 F 17 = Strabo 13.1.58, cf. 13.1.5. If Alcman was correct to indicate the existence of an Anatolian settlement named Gargara in the 7th century BCE, then this fact could be harmonized with the apparently contradictory story of Gargara instead being a Greek foundation by noting that many settlements in this region had a mixed Greco-Anatolian heritage in which the local Anatolian population became assimilated with the Greek newcomers.Mitchell (2004) 1000. With respect to how the early settlement came to adopt the name of the mountain, John Cook, the archaeologist who identified the site of Old Gargara on Koca Kaya, remarked that: \\"What we can believe is that the people of Methymna across the strait pointed to this bold peak as the Homeric ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒøŒΩ ·ºÑŒ∫œÅŒøŒΩ and that the settlers there felt themselves entitled to appropriate the name\\".Cook (1973) 258. Classical In the 5th century BCE Gargara was a member of the Delian League and paid a tribute to Athens of between 4,500 and 4,600 drachmas as part of the Hellespontine district.Mitchell (2004). It is currently thought that the Gargarians moved from the site at Koca Kaya down to the coast in the 4th century BCE, although this has not been confirmed by excavation.Cook (1973) 255-61. A long inscription found at Ilion indicates that by ca. 306 Gargara was a member of the koinon of Athena Ilias, a regional association of cities in the Troad which held an annual festival at Ilion. The inscription records a series of honorific decrees passed by the koinon which praise a prominent and wealthy citizen, Malousios of Gargara, for providing interest free loans to finance the annual festival.Syll.¬≥ 330 Hellenistic The local antiquarian writer Demetrius of Scepsis (ca. 205-130 BCE) relates that Gargara received an influx of settlers who were forcibly moved from their home in Mysia, Miletoupolis, by 'the kings' (presumably those of Bithynia) in the late 3rd or early 2nd century BCE. Miletoupolis was a semi-Greek settlement, and so Demetrius relates that as a result of this influx of immigrants there are hardly any Aeolians left in Gargara.Demetrius of Scepsis in Strabo 13.1.58: œÜŒ∑œÉ·Ω∂ Œ¥·Ω≤ ŒúœÖœÅœÉŒØŒªŒøœÇ ŒúŒ∑Œ∏œÖŒºŒΩŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ Œ∫œÑŒØœÉŒºŒ± Œµ·º∂ŒΩŒ±Œπ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºåœÉœÉŒøŒΩ, ·ºôŒªŒªŒ¨ŒΩŒπŒ∫œåœÇ œÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œë·º∞ŒøŒªŒØŒ¥Œ± œÜŒ∑œÉŒØŒΩ, ·Ω•œÉœÑŒµ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∞ ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·º° ŒõŒ±ŒºœÄœâŒΩŒØŒ± Œë·º∞ŒøŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ <Œµ·º∞œÉŒØŒΩ>. ·ºàœÉœÉŒØœâŒΩ Œ≥Œ¨œÅ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπ Œ∫œÑŒØœÉŒºŒ± œÑ·Ω∞ ŒìŒ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ±, Œø·ΩêŒ∫ Œµ·Ωñ œÉœÖŒΩŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœçŒºŒµŒΩŒ±‚Ä¢ ·ºêœÄŒøŒØŒ∫ŒøœÖœÇ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ Œø·º± Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµ·øñœÇ Œµ·º∞œÉŒÆŒ≥Œ±Œ≥ŒøŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ ŒúŒπŒªŒ∑œÑŒøœÖ œÄœåŒªŒµœâœÇ ·ºêœÅŒ∑ŒºœéœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ·ºêŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ, ·Ω•œÉœÑŒµ ·º°ŒºŒπŒ≤Œ±œÅŒ≤Œ¨œÅŒøœÖœÇ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ≠œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ œÜŒ∑œÉ·Ω∂ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·ΩÅ Œ£Œ∫ŒÆœàŒπŒøœÇ ·ºÄŒΩœÑ·Ω∂ Œë·º∞ŒøŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ ('Myrsilos says that Assos is a foundation of the Methymnaeans, and Hellanicus also says that it is Aeolian, so that Gargara and Lampanoia are also Aeolian.

This episode should perhaps be connected with the invasion of this region by Prusias II of Bithynia in 156 - 154 BCE. Elsewhere in the Hellenistic period, citizens of Gargara are found serving as proxenoi at Chios and as mercenaries at Athens, participating in a private association of resident foreigners on Rhodes, making dedications to Ptolemy III Euergetes and his family in Egypt, receiving honours at Ilion, and making dedications on Delos.Chios: Revue de Philologie (1937) 325-32 (4th century BCE). Athens: IG II2 1956.162-3 (ca. 300 BCE - ca. 315-309 according to SEG 46.243, but ca. 301-295 according to SEG 51.571. Rhodes: Archaiologikon Deltion 21 A (1966) 56, lines 8, 23 (late 3rd or early 2nd century BCE). Egypt: SEG 27.1206 (ca. 246-240 BCE). Ilion: Frisch (1975) no. 53. Delos: Inscriptions de D√©los no. 2578 (undated). In the 230s or 220s BCE Gargara was one of the places at which Theorodokoi of Delphi were received, and in the 120s BCE it is attested as a port at which customs dues was being paid soon after Attalus III had bequeathed the Asia to Rome in 133 BCE.Plassart (1921) 8, lines 17, Cottier et al. (2008). Roman While Gargara continued to exist in the Roman period, we hear about it primarily in the context of Latin literature, since it became a by-word for agricultural prosperity in Latin poetry following Virgil's reference to it in the Georgics: :::humida solstitia atque hiemes orate serenas, :::agricolae; hiberno laetissima pulvere farra, :::laetus ager: nullo tantum se Mysia cultu :::iactat et ipsa suas mirantur Gargara messis. :::Pray for wet summer, farmers, and for clear skies in winter :::(since after winter dust most joyous is the corn and joyous the :::fields); never else than after such seasons does Mysia take such :::pride in its tillage, and Gargara itself marvel so at its harvests.Virgil, Georgica 1.100-3. Gargara is likewise used as an expression of proverbial fertility in Ovid's Ars Amatoria, Seneca's tragedy The Phoenician Women, and as late as the 5th century CE in the odes of Sidonius Apollinaris.Ovid, Ars Amatoria 1.57-9: Gargara quot segetes, quot habet Methymna racemos, / aequore quot pisces, fronde teguntur aves, / quot caelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma puellas. Seneca the Younger, The Phoenician Women 608-9: hinc grata Cereri Gargara et dives solum / quod Xanthus ambit nivibus Idaeis tumens. Sidonius Apollinaris, Odes 7.147, 22.174. Macrobius in his Saturnalia (early 5th century CE) devoted a chapter to the question of what had given Virgil the idea of using Gargara this way in the first place, concluding that it was an inference firstly from Mount Ida's reputation for being well-watered in Homer, secondly from Mysia's general reputation for fertility, and thirdly from the use of Œ≥Œ¨œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ± (gargara) in Old Comedy to express an immense quantity of anything.Macrobius, Saturnalia 5.20, esp. 5.20.11: haec Gargara tanta frugum copia erant, ut qui magnum cuiusque rei numerum vellet exprimere pro multitudine inmensa Gargara nominaret. Byzantine Gargara appears to have been continuously occupied until at least the 9th century, and perhaps as late as the 14th. It was a suffragan bishopric of the metropolis of Ephesus for which we know the names of three of its bishops: John (518), Theodorus (553), and Ephraim (878).Catholic Encyclopaedia. In addition to possible middle Byzantine remains seen at Gargara by John Cook, other documents such as the Epistulae Dogmaticae of Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople (715-730) and the Notitiae Episcopatuum also attest Gargara's continued existence throughout this period.Cook (1973) 260, 374. Germanus I, Epistulae Dogmaticae 4.1070, Notitiae Episcopatuum 1.86, 2.101, 3.110, 4.95, 7.126, 9.18, 10 col. 1.17, 13.19. Finally, four documents from the Monastery of Great Lavra on Mount Athos dating to 1284 and 1304 attest a Constantine of Gargara and his family.ŒöœâŒΩ(œÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑ·øñ)ŒΩŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ ŒìŒ±œÅŒ≥Œ±œÅŒ∑ŒΩœåœÇ: Actes de Lavra.

The latest period of occupation at the site may be represented by the nearby castles of Mente≈üe and ≈ûahin Kale which Cook thought could be either Byzantine or Genoese.Cook (1973) 374.

It was a weekly show airing in a block of several hours on the Spanish channel Antena 3, and later Telecinco. The show was created by television producer Jocelyn Hattab, and first premiered in Italy as Il Grande Gioco Dell'Oca. Hosts Each season had a different trio of presenters ‚Äì a lead male host and two female assistants ‚Äì that shared hosting duties: * Emilio Arag√≥n, Lydia Bosch, and Patricia P√©rez (1993‚Äì94) * Pepe Navarro, Eugenia Santana, and Ivonne Reyes (1994‚Äì95) * Andr√©s Caparr√≥s, Elsa Anka, and Paloma Mar√≠n (1998, El nuevo juego de la oca) In all seasons, at least one celebrity was invited as a guest host per episode, and was brought out several times to explain and/or participate in some of the challenges. Premise and gameplay Four adult contestants, two men and two women, played a giant board game based on the centuries-old children's game, Juego de la oca (Game of the Goose). A 63-space game board was set up around the perimeter of a large arena, with the object being to reach space 63 by exact count. Contestants earned money with each roll of the dice, which they then used to bet on how well they could perform pruebas, or Hollywood-type challenges and stunts that tested the contestants' minds, bodies, and nerves. The majority of these challenges took place either on a main stage (one of two in the second season), a giant cage, a circular swimming pool in the middle of the set, or on one of several large playing floors for the more elaborate challenges. A contestant began the game with ‚Çß100,000 (‚Ç¨601, then-equivalent to roughly US$800). On a turn, he or she \\"rolled\\" the electronic \\"dice\\", and advanced the number of spaces rolled. Each space traveled was worth ‚Çß10,000. After landing on the designated space, the contestant was shown a prueba that he had to perform. After the host explained how to accomplish the task, the contestant wagered some or all of his money, depending on how confident he/she was that he/she could succeed. Successfully completing the stunt added the player's wager to his or her score, while a failed stunt deducted the wager. Not attempting a prueba, or refusing to go through a \\"punishment\\" sequence (such as the haircut space) where required, resulted in a contestant losing all of his or her money accumulated to that point; however, this rarely happened. Spaces Special spaces were distributed along the path, with the game generally getting more \\"dangerous\\" the further along a contestant moved. The special spaces included: * Ocas (Geese): Landing on an Oca resulted in that player being escorted to the next Oca and rolling again. Ocas were found at spaces 5 (first season only), 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, and 54. (If a contestant landed on space #54, he advanced to space #63 and automatically won the game.) : Traditionally, before a contestant took his second roll, he and the host recited a rhyme from the board game: De oca a oca... tiro porque me toca (From Goose to Goose, I roll because it's my turn.) * Dados (Dice) (#7, Season 1): Dados was a special shortcut that advanced the contestant to space number 20, at which point he rolled again. Before the second roll, another poem was recited: De dado a dado... tiro porque me ha tocado. (From Die to Die, I roll because it's my turn.) * Mud Wrestling (#8 in Season 1, 31 in Season 2, 22 in Season 3): This space was next to a mud pit; landing here resulted in the contestant having to perform a stunt in the mud while being hindered by a female mud wrestler (two in the third season). * Restaurante chino (Chinese Restaurant ‚Äì #19, Season 2): Any contestant who landed here had to take a seat at the mock Chinese restaurant. The \\"waiter\\" brought out a disgusting food (such as a whole rat cooked in sweet and sour sauce), and the contestant had to at least sample the food to avoid losing all his money. *Watermelons (#31 in Season 1, 33 in Season 3): If a contestant landed here, his challenge was to use a machete to chop watermelons that rolled randomly out of a large tube. *Pintacuerpos (Body painting ‚Äì No. 34 in Season 1, 40 in Season 3): Landing here resulted in the contestant having to spin a wheel to determine which part of his or her body got the show's goose head logo painted on it. The spaces on the wheel were arm, back, chest, stomach, and bottom. *Snake Den (#47 in Season 1, 53 in Season 2, 52 in Season 3): If someone landed here, he or she had to enter an acrylic glass pit filled with sand and boa constrictors. The door was locked behind the contestant, and he or she had a certain amount of time to find the key to the other side and get out. In the first season, any contestant landing here also advanced to No. 50 (the exit); no extra spaces were awarded in subsequent seasons. *Castle Wall (#51 in Seasons 1 and 2, 30 in Season 3): The contestant was required to scale the adjacent castle wall in some manner, which changed weekly, and kiss the prince or princess (depending on the contestant's gender) waiting at the top. *Haircut (#52 in Season 1, 48 in Season 2, not a fixed space in Season 3): The contestant was seated in a barber's chair at this space and had to answer three questions (the last of which was always impossible to answer in the five seconds allotted.) Getting any question wrong resulted in the player receiving a severe haircut by a deranged barber. Men were usually shaven bald, while women had their hair cut very short. *Cage Match (#57 in Season 1, 43 in Season 2, 30 in Season 3): If a contestant landed on the space at the entrance of the large cage, he or she had to enter it and battle the gladiator-type fighters inside on bungee cords. The challenge was usually to retrieve a key attached to the backside of the female gladiator, who was allowed to do anything to hinder the contestant. In all three seasons, the host stated very clearly that there were no rules as far as what the gladiator (and presumably the contestant) could do. Other challenges took place inside the cage that did not require the contestant to land there or involve the gladiators. *Depilaci√≥n (Waxing) (#57 in Season 2, not a fixed space in Season 1): This space had a hospital bed and a woman dressed as a nurse standing next to it. Any male contestant who landed here was asked five questions, with each incorrect answer resulting in part of his leg hair being waxed off; three correct answers won the challenge. *La muerte (Death) (#58, Season 1): This space was marked by a skull and crossbones; landing here resulted in the contestant being sent back to start (however, he kept his money). This space was featured on the original board game. This was replaced by la catapulta in the second season; any contestant who landed on No. 55 was usually, but not always, placed on a large catapult and \\"launched\\" via bungee cord back to start. *Ruleta cruel (Cruel Roulette ‚Äì No. 61, all versions): If a player landed here, he had to spin the adjacent wheel and lost whatever percentage of money it landed on. In the second and third seasons, the player was strapped to a large version of the wheel and spun around rapidly. The pointer was above his head, and again the contestant lost the percentage of money on which it stopped. Characters and personalities Regular characters and/or personalities on the show included: *Oquettes ‚Äì an eight-member dance team that \\"sang\\" the theme song, escorted contestants to certain spaces, and participated in some of the challenges *Chicos/chicas oca ‚Äì random male and female cast members that participated in the workings of some of the challenges *Guest hosts ‚Äì every week, a celebrity from Spain came on the show as a guest host *Romy ‚Äì the mudwrestler in Season 1 *Marvel ‚Äì the mudwrestler in Season 2 *Calzoncillo Man (\\"Underwear Man\\") ‚Äì an anti-superhero dressed in pink pajamas who hindered the contestants' progress on several episodes *Maxtor ‚Äì a muscular African male dressed as a warrior, who competed against contestants in later episodes *Promotional Characters ‚Äì Super Mario (representing Nintendo), a cow (representing milk), and elves (representing Boskys cereal) appeared to promote their products; usually, the game involved their product as well *Flequi (pronounced \\"FLEH-kee\\") ‚Äì the barber during the first season; he became quite popular with the show's fans and got more involved in other parts of the show (especially final stunts) as the season progressed *Rizot√≠n ‚Äì the barber during the second season; he gave wilder haircuts to men than did Flequi and had a much more flamboyant personality (vaguely resembling Salvador Dal√≠). *Danny ‚Äì the offstage judge who made decisions on close calls during Season 1 *Fernando, el mimoso pringoso (the \\"Greasy Lover\\") ‚Äì a disgusting, fat, smelly man who ate spaghetti like a two- year-old; a Q&A; game was played in which correct answers resulted in him kissing the female host, and incorrect answers resulted in him kissing the contestant *La fea besucona (\\"the ugly kissing lady\\") ‚Äì an ugly hag who played a kissing game similar to Fernando's, this time involving a male contestant and Emilio *Sound guys ‚Äì played the background music and inserted sound effects for comic relief. *Los monstruos ‚Äì goofy monsters who wore shredded Sunday clothes *Alberto Murroni ‚Äì a world-famous knife thrower who appeared with his assistant Vesna Peracino on all episodes of the show including the Italian version. After a brief demonstration, the contestant was usually asked to guess the outcome of another, or successfully perform a stunt with Murroni. *El mago M√°rtin (Martin the Magician) ‚Äì performed magic tricks during the second season *El invitado (\\"the Undertaker\\") ‚Äì escorted a contestant off the stage after landing on Death *Las ocas ‚Äì live geese that were allowed to roam freely around the stage on all versions Challenges ‚Äì las pruebas * Beso o Tortazo (Kiss or Slap): A male contestant landing here was presented with a (usually sexy) conversation by one of the Oquettes, which was left incomplete. He had to guess whether the outcome would be a kiss (beso) or a slap (tortazo), indicated for the viewing audience on the back of each Oquette's jacket. In order to win, the contestant had to guess at least five out of the eight Oquettes' responses correctly. Regardless, right or wrong, the contestant received the kiss or slap anyway. If the contestant was female, the Oquettes would kiss or slap the host (or occasionally in later seasons, the guest host); however, on the final episode of the first season, the in-house judge was brought out and he received the kisses and slaps. Final mission ‚Äì la reoca A contestant who reached space 63 won the game and kept all the money he had accumulated. In the first season, he then was given until the taping of the next show (one week) to perform a reoca, an additional mission attempted outside the studio, in order to win a car. The whole thing was taped and watched at the beginning of the next episode; the participating player was then informed whether or not he won the automobile. Tournament After 32 standard games had been played (excluding celebrity episodes), a lottery was held to determine who would be invited back to participate in the Tournament of Champions. The names of all winning male contestants were placed into one hopper, while the names of the winning female contestants were placed into another. Eight names were drawn from each, and these were divided up into four semifinal games with two men and two women each. The four semifinal winners competed in a final episode to determine the Grand Champion for that season. In the second season, all finalists began the game with ‚Çß250,000 (‚Ç¨1,502, then-equivalent to approximately $2,000) instead of 100,000. Notes The entire first season of this show was aired in the United States on Telemundo and Mexico on TV Azteca in the 1994‚Äì1995 television year, exactly one year after airing in Spain. Episodes from the second and third seasons were never shown in the US. A New Year's Eve special featured four celebrities including Mr. T. The special was not aired in the US.

It was said they built the city of San Francisco twice: once before the great earthquake and fire of 1906 and then again afterwards. One building alone, the Palace Hotel, required 1.5 million Remillard bricks to complete. The three brothers who began the brick making company, and began the Remillard fortune, immigrated from St. Valentin (near Napierville), Quebec to California toward the end of the Gold Rush. Pierre- Nicolas ‚ÄúPeter‚Äù Remillard was born April 2, 1837, at St. Valentin, Quebec.https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid;=61024024 Find a Grave In 1854 he came to California as an aspiring and self-reliant seventeen- year-old. He became involved in gold mining and saved what was later described in his obituary as a ‚Äúsnug sum‚Äù of money. In 1861, at the age of twenty-four, he moved to Oakland, where he became an employee of a brickyard. Within five years, he rose from hired hand at the brickyard to its owner and opened an office and yard at Clay and 2nd Streets and a brick plant in nearby Brooklyn. His brothers Hilaire and Edward also came from Quebec to join him in the enterprise. The business expanded and, in 1879, was incorporated as Remillard Brick Company. For a number of years, the Remillard brothers provided contracting service to the building trade in addition to manufacturing bricks. In 1882, the company established a large yard at Pleasanton. The Remillards supplied bricks for many important buildings including the old Palace Hotel in San Francisco and many large and important buildings in Oakland. For some forty years the Remillards were the only brick manufacturing company in Alameda County, supplied material for nearly every brick building in the county, and held a near monopoly on supplying bricks to the western states and Pacific Islands. In 1890, a yard was established at Greenbrae in Marin County and two years later in 1892, the Remillards established a yard that employed over 300 men at San Jose, Santa Clara County. Pierre-Nicolas Remillard married Cordule Laurin in January 1867 in San Francisco. He died suddenly on August 3, 1904 at his home on Adams and Perkins Street in Oakland, California from a heart attack. Although he had been in poor health for the previous year, he was able to go to his office until about three months before his death. Pierre Remillard was one of the founders of the First Unitarian Church of Oakland and one of the first members of the Athenian Club.\\"P. N.

At the age of nineteen, he went to Boston where he learned brick making. He remained at Boston from 1852 to 1854 before heading west to San Francisco by the ‚ÄúNicaragua Route‚Äù through the Isthmus of Panama where he arrived February 17, 1854. He first went to the mining areas in Nevada where he remained until 1860. He made some money in and around Auburn, California and then went to Oakland. He became interested in what was called the ‚ÄúIdaho excitement‚Äù and went there until 1862 when he returned to East Oakland. By 1864, he was involved in brick making in a very modest way and the business soon expanded to become the largest of its kind in the area. In 1878, he purchased a block at the corner of Adeline and 42nd Street, where the family home remained until about 1883 when his widowed mother erected a beautiful home at 999 43rd Street (not extant). Unmarried, he was referred to as \\"one of the most popular clubmen of Oakland\\" and a \\"bon vivant.\\" He died March 12, 1901 after a fall. He was vice president of Remillard Brick Company at the time of his death.\\"Falls From Second Story Window of Delmonico Restaurant,\\" San Francisco Call, March 10, 1901. Quoted at Find a Grave. Edouard \\"Edward\\" Remillard was born February 1, 1840, at St-Valentin, Quebec. In 1859 he left Quebec and went to California to join his two older brothers. He first went to the mines for a brief period and soon went to Oakland and San Francisco where the three brothers became partners in the Remillard Brothers Brick Company. He returned to Canada in about 1866 and there he married his cousin Virginie Remillard on January 14, 1867, at Napierville. She was the daughter of Narcisse and Rosalie Monjon and was baptized December 15, 1847, at Napierville. He and Virginia first lived in East Oakland, where they erected a comfortable dwelling before moving to Clay Street, where they lived until 1887 when they moved to 1355 Webster Street. He died March 10, 1903, in Oakland at the age of 63 years while sitting in a chair talking to his brother, P.N. Remillard. Countess Lillian Remillard Dandini was the daughter of Pierre- Nicolas and Cordule (Laurin) Remillard. She was born April 28, 1880, in Oakland and died July 17, 1973 in San Francisco She inherited the company from her father after the accidental death of her brother Philip from a fall from a San Francisco restaurant fire escape in March 1901. She was noted for her ownership and preservation of the architectural gem, Chateau Carolands in Hillsborough, California, at one time the second largest house in the United States, which she bought in 1953 and lived in until her death. She willed the Chateau to the city of Hillsborough for a museum of music and art, but left no money to acquire the music or the art and in the end, the city of Hillsborough sold the house. She married Count Alessandro Dandini about 1932; they divorced about 1939. Many members of the Remillard family were buried in the Remillard Mausoleum in Mountain View Cemetery (Oakland, California), where many Bay Area millionaires are buried. Edward and his wife were buried in the adjacent Saint Mary's Cemetery.  References  Additional references at California Bricks website.

Biography The eldest son of Latin-American immigrants, he was born in Oakland, California, in 1932. He taught at the University of Notre Dame and the Western New Mexico University in Silver City, New Mexico. He studied English literature at University of California, Berkeley in the early 1950s. Gutierrez left Berkeley in 1958 to pursue a career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Library in New York, and wound up at book publisher Grosset & Dunlap. He returned to California to receive a PhD from UCLA in 1964 and later joined the Notre Dame English department. Gutierrez returned to Notre Dame on a research scholarship, shortly before finishing a book on Kenneth Rexroth that renowned former Notre Dame president and head, Reverend (\\"Father\\") Theodore M. Hesburgh, placed in Notre Dame's Hesburgh Library (Special Collection). Career Gutierrez was a scholar of D. H. Lawrence, and wrote about the last period (late 1920s) of Lawrence, whom Gutierrez describes as having dealt with death and symbolic renewal in an \\"ontological\\" manner, a lens through which Lawrence offered keen insights into humankind and society. An erstwhile Berkeley student who observed the \\"Bohemian-literati\\" world in the 1950s, Gutierrez has also written memoirs and commentaries on the \\"Beat\\" scenes of Berkeley and San Francisco. Gutierrez also produced many works on Kenneth Rexroth and other writers of that time. Gutierrez' post-2000 work and writings moved away from an academic focus of literature and fine arts, and he latterly wrote articles and essays more as a social and political commentator, with topics of: social justice, human rights abuses, economic inequities, and the major role he feels U.S. domestic and foreign policy plays in these. He was an outspoken critic of political repression, international war criminals (Chile's Augusto Pinochet, Guatemala's Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt, Nicaragua's Somoza, Panama's Manuel Noriega, etc.), the United States' \\"School of the Americas\\" (the Department of Defense's Spanish-speaking training facility), the U.S. military engagements in Iraq, Bosnia, Vietnam, the current torture and imprisonment practices the U.S. is claimed to participate in (including \\"extraordinary rendition\\" and \\"dark cells\\") and the policies of the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Gutierrez wrote six books, more than 100 essays, papers and book reviews. He contributed numerous essays to journals, newspapers, universities, and online publishers, including the El Dorado Sun,Contributing Writers, El Dorado Sun, May 2004 the North Dakota Quarterly,Content, North Dakota Quarterly; Volume 71, Number 4; Fall 2004 Progressive San Francisco Latino newspaper, El Tecolote, the D.

In earlier times, it was held midday, but later began to be held in evenings. It was a focal point of social life, along with the public baths, the frequenting of which often preceded the meal. Seating during dinner was in the triclinium, three couches for reclining arranged as three sides of a square, with a small table for food in the middle of all these. The cena traditionally consisted of three parts. The appetizer course often included eggs, olives, and honeyed wine. The second, main course often included a main meat dish, like roasted pig.

In the early 19th century, the building was requisitioned by the British military, and in 1842 it was leased to Bishop George Tomlinson, being renamed Gibraltar House. At this point, a neoclassical portico was added to the fa√ßade, by then the major addition to the exterior since the 16th century. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the auberge was also used as a printing press and a school. It was converted in a hospital during World War II. It housed the Office of the Prime Minister in 1921‚Äì33 and 1947‚Äì72. Since then, various government ministries have used the building, and as of 2019 it houses the Ministry for European Affairs and Equality. History=Hospitaller rule Auberge d'Aragon was designed by the Maltese architect Girolamo Cassar in 1566, making it the oldest auberge in the city of Valletta. The plot of land on which it was built was purchased on 20 September 1569 for the sum of 80 scudi and 8 tari. Construction began in 1571. In 1674, the Langue of Aragon built the Church of Our Lady of Pilar adjacent to the auberge. The 1693 Sicily earthquake caused serious damage to the fa√ßade and the southeast face of the auberge, but the damage was later repaired. The church was also damaged, and it was rebuilt in a new design, being completed in 1718. The Auberge has a large underground which was originally used for horses. A water system was installed at some point, possibly after the construction of the Wignacourt Aqueduct. In the 18th century the underground was converted and used as an oven. This part of the Auberge was later buried, probably sometimes in the British period. Initial studies claim that the oven served as a bakery. The access of the underground was substantially altered after the earthquake and the later erection of nearby buildings. After the rediscovery of the bakery, it was decided to restore it and open it to the public. French and British periods Plaque on the auberge The Order of St. John was expelled from Malta with the French invasion and occupation in 1798. Two years later, the Maltese Islands became a British protectorate, and the auberge was requisitioned by the Quartermaster. From 1822 to 1824, the building housed the government printing press. In the late 1830s, the building was the residence of the Chief Secretary to Government. In 1842, the auberge was leased to George Tomlinson, the Anglican Bishop of Gibraltar, and the building was known as Gibraltar House. The only major alteration to the auberge, a Doric portico leading to the main doorway, was probably built at this point. The building in 1846 After Malta was granted self-government in 1921, the auberge was converted into a school. In 1924, upon Ugo Pasquale Mifsud's election as Prime Minister of Malta, the building became the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). In 1931, there were plans to move the parliament from the Grandmaster's Palace into the auberge, but nothing materialized. The building continued to house the OPM until the office was abolished upon the suspension of the constitution in 1933. From 1933 to 1939 the building was left vacant. In 1939, the auberge was given to the British Institute. It was used as a hospital for British families during WWII known as the Military Families‚Äô Hospital. A new constitution was granted in 1947, restoring self-government and reestablishing the position of Prime Minister. At this point the British Institute moved to nearby Casa Bolino. The auberge was once again used as the OPM, with Paul Boffa being the first Prime Minister to use it as his office. On 16 January 1951, Prime Minister George Borg Olivier presented a small bronze model of Les Gavroches, created by artist Antonio Sciortino, to Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) in a ceremony held at the building. The islands became independent as the State of Malta in 1964, and the independence was drafted on a table which still remains in the auberge today. Independent Malta Auberge d'Aragon continued to house the OPM until 1972, when Dom Mintoff moved the Office to Auberge de Castille, where it remains to this day. The building subsequently housed the Ministry of Education and Culture, which was then led by Minister Agatha Barbara, who later became President of Malta. After the 1987 elections, Parliamentary Secretary for Industry John Dalli took up his offices in the auberge, and he also used it later as the Ministry for Economic Affairs. This was later renamed the Ministry of Economic Services, and after 2003 the Ministry of Finance and Economic Services. In March 2004, the auberge became the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Ministry for Justice and Home Affairs. From 2012, it was used by the Ministry for Home and Parliamentary Affairs, and it later became the Ministry for Home Affairs and the Ministry for EU Affairs. In 2016, the building housed the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister as well as the Parliamentary Secretary for the EU Presidency 2017 and EU Funds. Since 2017, the auberge has housed the Ministry for European Affairs and Equality. During restoration works carried out in 2019, an early 18th century bakery oven, some wells and water canals were discovered buried under debris in an underground part of the auberge. The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925 together with the other auberges in Valletta. It is now scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture View of the auberge Auberge d'Aragon is built in the Mannerist style typical of its architect Girolamo Cassar, and it is the only auberge in Valletta which still retains its original design. It is a single-story building with a rectangular plan and a central arcaded courtyard. The building does not have a symmetric fa√ßade, despite the effort of the architect to make it appear so. It contains a main doorway flanked by three moulded windows on either side. It is rather plain, with its decorative emphasis being the continuous cornice along roof level and the rusticated corners. A Doric portico leads to the doorway, and it is the only major alteration to the auberge. The building was originally painted in red ochre, a colour used by the Order to mark public buildings.https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/when-malta-was-painted-red- part-2.794177 Some traces of the paint can still be seen at the rear part of the auberge. The interior of the building contains some Renaissance-era rooms.

Formed late in the war, the squadron ultimately did not see action as it became combat ready just as the war came to an end. After the war, it undertook general transportation duties before being disbanded in mid-1946.  History  No. 99 Squadron was formed on 1 February 1945 at Leyburn, Queensland, as a heavy bomber squadron. The squadron's first commanding officer was Squadron Leader James Marshall. Personnel began marching in and by the end of the month, the squadron's strength had reached 17 officers and 394 other ranks. The squadron's B-24 Liberator bombers arrived in early March and the squadron was transferred to Jondaryan, Queensland, for further training. In early April, Wing Commander Arthur Cross took over command of the squadron, which had grown in size to include 82 officers and 581 other ranks, equipped with a variety of aircraft: eight Liberators, as well as one Tiger Moth and one Avro Anson. That month the squadron was declared operational in April and it began moving to Darwin, Northern Territory, in May ahead of commencing combat operations. As the move continued, the squadron received another six Liberators. The squadron was still in the process of concentrating in Darwin when the war ended in August, with the move finally being completed in late September. As a result, the squadron did not see action against the Japanese. Following the end of the war No. 99 Squadron operated in the transport role and was responsible for flying personnel and supplies between Darwin and southern Australia. The squadron suffered its first loss on 14 September when a Liberator crashed near RAAF Base Amberley, killing five crew members. Transport operations continued throughout October, with the squadron's aircraft transporting around 800 passengers, most of whom were recently liberated Allied prisoners of war, and large quantity of freight. In November, No. 99 Squadron moved from Darwin to Tocumwal, New South Wales, where, the following month, further losses were incurred when one member was killed and four injured in a vehicle accident on the ground. As the demobilisation process began, the squadron was warned out for disbandment in March 1946. In early May, command of the squadron passed to Flight Lieutenant B.S. Garvin. The squadron was finally disbanded on 5 June 1946.

Hadley was recruited from the East Fremantle Football Club junior system in the Western Australian Football League (WAFL) to the Brisbane Lions in the 2000 AFL Draft. He made his AFL debut in 2001. While suffering from osteitis pubis, he spent the 2001, 2002 and 2003 seasons as a prolific ball-winner player in the Lions' reserves team. After a long wait, he was finally recalled to the Lions lineup in the 2003 finals series, and in his fourth senior game of AFL football, he was part of Brisbane's premiership side. In 2004, Hadley's fourth season on the Lions' list, he took the Rookie of the Year award (he was still eligible because he had only played four games previously and was 20 years of age at the start of the year, just below the under-21 threshold). During the 2005 season, he injured his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and missed the entire season. While his schedule to a return was on track, he again injured his ACL during a NAB Challenge game against Collingwood at Carrara on 18 March 2006. He then missed the entire 2006 season. Hadley was traded to Carlton at the end of the 2007 season for Carlton's fourth-round selection in the 2007 AFL Draft (number 52 overall). He continued to be troubled by injuries, playing six games in 2008, eleven in 2009 and eight in 2010. He also played several games for Carlton's , the Northern Bullants. Hadley announced his retirement from AFL football after the 2010 season, at the age of 27. After spending ten seasons on an AFL playing list, injuries had restricted him to 66 AFL games.Carlton Football Club, Hadley announces his retirement, Retrieved 14 October 2010 He returned to East Fremantle, where he had played as a junior, and played 49 WAFL matches for the club between 2011 and 2013, including serving as vice-captain, before retiring at the end of the 2013 season.

Bush hammers exist in many forms, from simple hand-held hammers to large electric machines, but the basic functional property of the tool is always the same ‚Äì a grid of conical or pyramidal points at the end of a large metal slug. The repeated impact of these points into stone or concrete creates a rough, pockmarked texture that resembles naturally weathered rock. They can help to increase bonding effectiveness when applying new concrete to an existing concrete surface by increasing the surface area of the bonding zone.  Modern Bush Hammer  Figure-3 Modern Mobile Bush Hammer The bush hammer has since been modernized in the past years, making it easier for the users to perform tasks while still having intended impression the tool gives. These machines are built to give the impression that a bush hammer has been applied to the concrete. This allows contractors to work on a larger amount of the material without using individual hammers for the project. This saves time and labor costs for those working with the tool. There are angled points that rotate to help imitate this tool. See figure 3 and figure 4  Inventor  Figure-4 Up close Image of Modern Bush HammerIn 1831, Joseph Richards ( 1784-1848) invented the bush hammer or otherwise known to some as the axe hammer. The US patent was issued February 20th 1828 for a Stone-working tool, with a patent number of 5010X. Joseph Richards invention sparked many other inventors designs for the bush hammer.  Similar Tools  The bush hammer is the patented title for this tool but has also been called different names over the years. The other most common name was the patent hammer which is described to have the same features and was used around the same time of the bush hammer. Another name this tool can go by is the axe hammer. This is due to the sharp conical edges the face of the hammer would contain.

The Festival dei Due Mondi (Festival of the Two Worlds) is an annual summer music and opera festival held each June to early July in Spoleto, Italy, since its founding by composer Gian Carlo Menotti in 1958. It features a vast array of concerts, opera, dance, drama, visual arts and roundtable discussions on science. The \\"Two Worlds\\" in the name of the festival comes from Gian Carlo Menotti's intention to have the worlds of American and European culture facing each other in his event; this concept would then be strengthened by the fact that it was held in conjunction with its \\"twin\\", the Spoleto Festival USA held annually in May/June in Charleston, South Carolina. That twinning lasted some 15 years and, after growing disputes between the Menotti family and the board of Spoleto Festival USA, in the early 1990s a separation occurred. Under Menotti's direction in 1986, a third installment in the Spoleto Festival series was held in Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne's Spoleto Festival changed its name to the Melbourne International Festival of the Arts in 1990. Following Menotti's death in 2007, changes occurred in the administration with the result that the Italian Minister of Cultural Affairs appointed a new Artistic Administrator who continues to run the Festival. The Italian Festival's location and activities Because Spoleto was a small town, where real estate and other goods and services were at the time relatively inexpensive, and also because there are two indoor theatres, a Roman theatre, and many other spaces, it was chosen by Menotti as the venue for an arts festival. It is also fairly close to Rome, with good rail connections. Changes in administration Following Menotti's death in February 2007, the city administrations of Spoleto and Charleston started talks to re-unite the two festivals, which resulted in the Mayor of Spoleto, Massimo Brunini, attending the opening ceremony of Spoleto Festival USA in May 2008. However, at the time of the 2007 Festival, the President and Artistic Director was Menotti's adopted son, Francis \\"Chip\\" Menotti and, in the fall of 2007, the Italian Minister of Cultural Affairs, Francesco Rutelli‚Äîafter unsuccessful negotiations with Menotti‚Äîremoved him from his positionWakin, New York Times and named Giorgio Ferrara new artistic director of the festival.

The game celebrates the series' 10th anniversary by featuring cameo appearances of characters from the previous games. It was developed by Media.Vision for the Sony PlayStation 2 platform. Gameplay= Combat system  During combat, the field is split into seven hexagonal sections, some of which may have special properties. The player and enemies can move to different hexagons during their turn. This time around, the party count is three instead of four. Dean's party members and enemies can act instantly when they move onto the next hexagonal platform. The Force meter returns from Wild Arms 4. This meter increases as Dean's party members make physical attacks or are attacked. This can be used for Original attacks, Team Combos or summoning Guardian beasts to attack enemies. The more powerful the attack is, the more the Force meter will be drained. The characters can summon guardian beasts to the field to attack enemies. They can also use combination attacks that utilize most or all of the party. A new feature in Wild Arms 5 is the ability to chain attacks together. This lets one of Dean's party members attack two to five times provided they have the Violator Badge equipped and enough bullets to make the attack. Wild ARMs Each playable character is equipped with an ARM, a specialized kind of gun that deals physical damage in a range that varies for each character, from one-hex away to any hex. The ARMs must be reloaded after a number of shots by having the character defend for one round. While each character has a specific ARM, there are cartridges that can be added to increase its firepower. The ARMs also have their own stats that can be boosted by using \\"dragon fossil\\" items acquired during play. Like in other Wild Arms games, ARM is an acronym, though its actual meaning is obscure. There are two versions given in the game. By the time the player is able to control three characters at once early in the game, the tools known as mediums are introduced. In this version, they are portable computer devices with mystical qualities. Each character can only equip one medium at a time and there are six available mediums throughout the game. Each medium specializes in affecting specific parameters and granting the character unique Original and Force abilities. Exploration Wild Arms 5 is a third-person video game. The world map is not scaled down, and towns and dungeons can be seen in their real size. The player traverses the world by walking, or employing various vehicles, including a train and monowheel. The field avatar cannot be changed; Dean is always the leader. Dungeon exploration has two modes. In Action mode, the player can jump, slide, and interact with objects. In Shooting mode, Dean draws both of his ARMs and can fire them freely. By employing various cartridges, the player can interact with the environment in a number of ways. Some examples include activating distant switches, breaking down obstacles, and lighting torches. Plot= Story  Like every game in the Wild Arms series, Wild Arms 5 takes place on the world of Filgaia. Humans are currently being ruled over by the Veruni, an alien race that landed on Filgaia 100 years ago. Dean Stark, the protagonist of the story, lives in a secluded village away from all the turmoil. He dreams of one day leaving the village to pursue his dream of becoming a Golem Hunter, someone who excavates ancient robots, like his idol Nightburn. While in the mountains, Dean and his childhood friend Rebecca spot a Golem's arm fall from the sky and land in a cave just in front of them. Upon entering the cave, they find a girl curled up within the Golem's hand. The girl only remembers two things, her name (Avril), and the words Johnny Appleseed. After receiving the pair of ARMs (special guns) she was holding, Dean, along with Avril and Rebecca, decides to embark on an adventure to find out what the words \\"Johnny Appleseed\\" really mean. Meanwhile, a revolt has begun within the Veruni government. A man named Volsung has overthrown the leader of the Radical faction, sworn enemies of the more peaceful Moderater faction, claiming that his violent actions are necessary for the survival of the Veruni.

Their goal is to ensure the survival of the Veruni race at any cost. Note that all these characters (except Elvis) are named for figures from various mythologies, although this is not mentioned in the game. Volsung (voiced by Kyle Hebert in English and Hiroki Tochi in Japanese) comes from Norse myth, Fereydoon (voiced by Jin Yamanoi in Japanese) from Persian myth, Persephone from Greek myth and Kartikeya (voiced by Yutaka Aoyama in Japanese) from Hindu beliefs. *Other characters include Nightburn Acklund (voiced by Kenji Nomura), a famous golem hunter who is Dean's hero, and Captain Bartholomew (voiced by Katsuhisa Hoki in Japanese), the captain of the Moderate ship Mayflower. *Cameos from other games include all the playable characters (excluding Lucied from 2nd Ignition) from Wild Arms and its remake, Wild Arms Alter Code: F, Wild Arms 2, Wild Arms 3, and Wild Arms 4. Some may or may not be the characters they resemble, but most are likely just cameos. These characters are not playable, though many of them are part of the game's sidequests. The anime series, Wild Arms: Twilight Venom, is also given a nod in the form of a boss by the name of \\"Twilight Venom\\". Development The game makes use of CGI to create a 3D effect, including a slow camera pan drift. The player can zoom in and out from different angles during gameplay. There are also several computer generated cut scenes. The art style for the characters is a typical anime look, as opposed to a realistic or super deformed one. In addition, the game features a wide selection of alternate costumes for all the playable characters, including several originally used by characters from the previous Wild Arms games, that can be obtained during gameplay. The game features voiceovers in several of its cutscenes and battles. The music for Wild Arms 5, the only video game title where the original series composer Michiko Naruke did not contribute, was provided by Masato Kouda along with series newcomer Noriyasu Agematsu. Unlike past Wild Arms, Nana Mizuki, who voiced Rebecca in the game, sung the opening \\"Justice to Believe\\" and ending \\"Crystal Letter\\" theme rather than Kaori Asoh. Release In the United States, the first print run of Wild Arms 5 came in a commemorative \\"Series 10th Anniversary\\" box and included an art book featuring character art from all five Wild Arms games. This limited edition was later replaced by a standard edition with different cover art and no extras. The European version was released in two different versions: a limited edition, including an 80-page art book, and a standard edition, without the art book. Both featured the \\"Series 10th Anniversary\\" cover from the US release. Reception Wild Arms 5 garnered generally positive reviews; the game has an average review score of 74% according to GameRankings, and 71/100 on Metacritic. Total PlayStation rated the game 9.5/10. Famitsu scored 34 out of 40. IGN scored the game 7.3 out of 10. GameSpot gave it 7.5 out of 10.

The Frame of Government has lasting historical importance as an important step in the development of American and world democracy. Background William Penn, as an English Quaker, sought to construct a new type of Community with religious toleration and a great deal of political freedom. It is believed that Penn's political philosophy is embodied in the West Jersey Concessions and Agreements of 1677, which is an earlier practical experience of government constitution prior to the establishment of Pennsylvania. Although his authorship of the Concession is questioned, it is believed that he gave his full consent to it as the trustee of that colony. In the Concession, all legislative power was granted to an assembly selected by the \\"inhabitants, freeholders and proprietors\\" of the colony. A commission was to be appointed by the assembly as its executive. The government structure in West Jersey demonstrated the enlightened constitutional theory that Penn had been promoting. Also under the influence of republican political theory and humanism, the first version of the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania (now known as the Frame of 1682) incorporated a few pioneering ideas, which were later developed into important elements of modern constitutionalism. It required capital punishment to be applied to a strictly limited scope of criminal offenses only, including murder and treason. Freedom of worship in the colony was to be absolute. The assembly could bring a request of impeachment of the governor before the council for its trial. Unconstitutional laws should be invalidated, although it did not specifically grant courts the power to declare the unconstitutionality. It included an amendment process where six-sevenths of the legislature and the governor had to approve any change. However, the government structure speculated by the Frame of 1682 was far less liberal than that in West Jersey Concessions and Agreements of 1677. The Frame of 1682 The Frame of 1682 constituted a parliament consisting of two houses. The upper house, or the council, consisted of 72 members who were the first fifty purchasers of 5,000 acres or more in the colony and had the exclusive power to propose legislation. They were also authorized to nominate all officers in church and state and supervise financial and military affairs through committees. The lower house, or the assembly, consisted of smaller landowners. It had no power to initiate legislation but could accept or reject the council's legislative proposal only. The two-house parliament assists the governor with his executive functions. Commentators believe that the Frame of 1682 was significantly influenced by Penn's supporters, primarily the earliest landholders in the colony. Little direct evidence suggested that they imposed a pressure upon the government constitution process. However, it is believed that the earliest settlers, who heavily invested in Pennsylvania, demanded a voice in constructing the framework of government. William Markham, a trusted deputy executive of Penn in the colony for many years, commented: \\"I knew very well [the Frame of Government] was forced upon him by friends who unless they received all that they demanded would not settle the country.\\" This partly explained Penn's deviation from his political ideas on government constitution to accommodate the demands of the settlers. One of the most controversial provisions in the Frame of 1682 was if the governor should be allowed a veto to legislation presented by the parliament. To attract colonists, Penn had at first reserved himself only a single vote in the council and no power to reject legislation passed by the assembly. However, the Frame of 1682, in its final form, granted the proprietor a greater power ‚Äì he was allowed a treble vote in the council and a veto in the legislative process. In December 1682, an assembly of 42 men was convened to ratify the Frame of 1682. Although leading Quakers secured their places in the assembly, their proposal to establish a proprietary government was adamantly opposed by the non-Quakers in the assembly, including representatives from the Lower Counties, which had been under the light control of the deputy governors appointed by the Duke of York (later James II & VII.) In particular, they rejected the monopoly of the council in initiating legislation and requested a more powerful assembly. As a result, the Frame of 1682 was voted down. The Frame of 1683 An assembly convened in 1683 to model a new frame of government in place of the rejected Frame of 1682. The tension which resulted in the rejection of the Frame of 1682 remained ‚Äì although leading Quakers dominated the council, half of the seats in the assembly were occupied by non-Quakers from the Lower Counties who were steadfastly against the concentration of power to Quaker elites. The proprietor's voting power in the legislative process remained one of the major concerns in framing the government. As provided in the colonial charter granted by the King, laws were to be made by the proprietor. Thus, it would be a violation of the charter if the proprietor did not possess a veto power in legislation. Over lengthy debate, Penn managed to convince the assembly that the proprietor's veto power was necessary, but guaranteed that he would exercise the power only with the council's advice and consent.PA State Archives ‚Äì RG-21 ‚Äì Series Titles ‚Äì Proprietary Government Once again, the assembly sought to enlarge its role and insisted that it be granted to power to initiate legislation, as it demanded when it rejected the Frame of 1682. Although it was regarded as unacceptable to both the proprietor and the council, they conceded that the assembly is allowed to confer with the council before passing a law. A compromised frame of government, or the Frame of 1683, was eventually approved by the assembly. It provided that all laws should be passed \\"by the Governor and the freemen in Council and Assembly met\\", and granted the governor a right to approve or veto. However, the proprietary governance speculated by the Frame of 1683 did not function effectively after Penn returned to England in 1684. He relied on the council to act as governor collectively in the first few years during his absence. However, the council neglected Penn's constitutional authority and promulgated laws without obtaining approval from Penn or the King. Penn subsequently appointed five commissioners to replace the council as his deputy executive. Having granted any three of the commissioners a power to enact, annul or vary laws \\"as if I myself were there\\", he instructed the commissioners to annul the laws passed without his approval. However, the commissioners never carried out such instructions. In 1687, Penn appointed John Blackwell to replace the five commissioners as a single executive. As an aggressive Puritan governor, Blackwell clashed with the Quakers‚Äô assembly immediately after he was appointed. The disorder in Pennsylvania and William III's increasing distrust in Penn led to the suspension of Penn's charter as the colonial proprietor in 1692. The Frame of 1696 (Markham‚Äôs Frame) Penn's charter was restored in 1694. Presumably, he intended his colonists to return to the Frame of 1683, as one of the conditions on which his charter was restored was that the colony should be under proprietary governance. William Markham, the lieutenant governor commissioned by Penn in 1694, ruled the colony imperialistically and acted aggressively towards the assembly. However, certain practical needs in the colony significantly changed the political structure and dramatically resulted in liberal governance in this period, which was reflected in the Frame of 1696 (also known as Markham's Frame). The assembly continued to make effort to further its power in the 1690s. In March 1695, David Lloyd, the chief spokesman of the Quakers, warned that there was no special virtue in returning to the Frame of 1683, and proposed a charter granting the Assembly a controlling role, including the sole power to initiate legislation. The council turned to support the shift of power from itself to the assembly in anticipation of a possible reestablishment of a royal government. The Quakers dominating the council understood that with Penn's charter under heavy attack by neighboring governors and English government officials, the reestablishment of royal government was \\"highly possible ‚Äì even probable\\". In that situation, the Quakers found it necessary to invest the assembly with \\"the widest possible powers in advance of such a change\\". The council might be appointed by a royal governor and thus susceptible to a royal control. However, the assembly would always be elected. Outnumbering other factions, including the Anglicans, the Quakers believed that they would be able to dominate in the assembly. Thus, even if the Quakers lost their control over the council, they could still operate from the assembly to defend against a royal control. In response to the Quakers‚Äô request, William Markham, the lieutenant governor and a member of the Church of England, took it as an opportunity to urge the Quaker-dominated assembly to cooperate in appropriating fund for military preparations, and promised that a discussion of constitutional revision would become possible if the military appropriation bill was passed by the assembly. Although having been committed to nonviolence and consciously objecting to participating in wars, Quakers compromised in this regard in exchange for a more powerful assembly. Coupled with a bill raising a fund of ¬£300 for military use, the assembly passed a new frame of government, which is known as the Frame of 1696, or Markham's Frame. The new frame significantly changed the allocation of political power within the legislature by conferring upon the assembly the power to initiate legislation, sit on its own adjournment and judge the qualifications of its members. It also reduced the size of the legislature to a more manageable level ‚Äì each county elected only two representatives to the council and four to the assembly. In addition, it provided for more stringent voting requirements to exclude non-Quakers from voting. A person needed to reside in the colony for two years before he could vote, suggesting an attempt to diminish the strength of the ever-growing number of non-Quaker immigrants newly arrived in the colony. In rural areas, where Quakers had a dominant representation in the population, the voting requirement was relaxed to include all freeholders with 50 acres rather than 100 acres as before. In urban areas where the number of non-Quakers was growing, the voting requirement was tightened to exclude anyone without a ¬£50 estate free of debts. The validity of the Frame of 1696 was questionable, as Markham did not have a conceivable right to approve it. It was never approved by Penn either ‚Äì actually, Penn criticized it harshly. However, it functioned as the colonial constitution in practice for several years until Penn returned to Pennsylvania in 1699. The Frame of 1701 (The Charter of Privileges) After his 15 years‚Äô absence, Penn returned to Pennsylvania in 1699 and found the assembly resisting his proprietary authority. His attempts to reinforce proprietary governance turned out to be unpopular. Hostility towards proprietary politics and desire for the legislature's autonomy prevailed among the Quaker elite. In 1701, on the eve that Penn left Pennsylvania to defend his colonial charter before the King in London, the assembly presented him with a new draft of the frame of government, which is subsequently known as the Frame of 1701, or the Charter of Privileges. The Frame of 1701 further strengthened the controlling role of the assembly. An elective council was not even mentioned in the legislative process, and thus the assembly became the sole legislative authority. Meanwhile, the assembly obtained several Anglo- Saxon standard parliamentary privileges constitutionally for the first time: the right to prepare legislative bills, elect its own officers, appoint committees, sit on its own adjournment, judge the qualifications of its own members, and impeach officers of government. The assembly was to be elected annually by freemen and composed of four representatives from each county. The governor may appoint a council to assist with executive affairs, the council does not have a role in the legislative process. In addition, the Frame of 1701 required all claims relating to properties to be directed to ordinary courts of justice, and thus neutralized the power of the Board of Propriety, the center of proprietary land administration. Another significant concession in the Frame of 1701 was that the Lower Counties, or Territories, are permitted to establish their home rules. In 1705, the Territories took advantage of this provision and set up their own assembly. Although Penn steadfastly refused to approve the Frame of 1696, he yielded to the Frame of 1701, which was different from the Frame of 1696 only in details. Some writers regarded his concession as a sign of his losing control over the colony. He admitted that he approved the Frame of 1701 only because he saw a majority had been convinced by David Lloyd that it was a form of government \\"nearer to English methods, which they called for so often.\\" Also, in anticipation of the possibility that his rights of government in the colony might be stripped of by the English Parliament, a more democratic governmental structure might provide the Quakers in the colony with a shelter from an arbitrary royal governor. The Frame of 1701 remained the governing constitutional document in Pennsylvania in the following seventy-five years until the Revolution of 1776. Characteristics The establishment of Pennsylvania may be the most successful effort of Quakers in colonizing in America. Penn's close relationship with the Crown significantly contributed to the success. His ruling over Pennsylvania was largely based on the royal charter, which curbed his political experiment and led to a hierarchical governmental structure. The compromise diluted the liberalism in the constitution of government, which Penn and his contemporary political thinkers had been promoting. However, the human rights provisions in the Frame of Government successfully reflected certain important values inherent in human thinking prevailing in the colony and Quakerism and contributed to the development of constitutionalism in America. Legacy and reception The Frame of Government has been seen as a significant move towards democracy in America. The political philosophy expounded in the preface to the Frame of 1682 has often been cited and quoted. Voltaire applauded Penn's efforts, saying he might \\"with reason, boast of having brought down upon earth the Golden Age, which in all probability, never had any real existence but in his dominions.\\" The Supreme Court of the United States quoted the 1682 Frame of Government in a February 2019 decision regarding excessive fines imposed by the state of Indiana.

Markham was the acting governor of Pennsylvania from 1681 to 1682 and from 1693 to 1699. He was a member of the Church of England and tended to favor the interests of minority religious groups in the primarily Quaker colony. In Pennsylvania On 10 April 1681, Markham was appointed by his first cousin, Governor William Penn, and served as acting governor while Penn was in England. Markham sailed for America soon after his appointment. He landed in Boston and made his way to New York where he showed his credentials and took official control of the Delaware territories which had also been given to Penn. On 3 August 1681, Markham arrived in Upland (now Chester, Pennsylvania), the only town in the colony at that time. He assembled a governing council that included six Quakers and three other early colonists. As governor, Markham helped select the site for Philadelphia, bought land from the Indians along the Delaware River and Pennsbury Manor, and began the discourse with Lord Baltimore over the disputed boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. Penn first arrived in Pennsylvania in October 1682 and relieved Markham of his duties. Markham became a representative for the colony in England and lobbied on its behalf in the boundary dispute with Maryland. He served in various other positions including secretary of the province, secretary to the proprietary, a commissioner to sell lands, and an auditor of accounts. Markham supported John Blackwell over Thomas Lloyd in their dispute over the governorship. In 1691, Delaware was separated from Pennsylvania, and Markham became the acting deputy governor of the new colony. The Glorious Revolution overthrew the Stuart dynasty with which Penn had his connections. By 1693, he temporarily fell from court popularity and lost control of the colony. The crown gave official control to Benjamin Fletcher, but Markham served a second term as acting governor as Fletcher's deputy. Penn was reinstated as official governor in August 1694, but Markham maintained control of the colony until Penn's return from England in December 1699. Markham had several disputes with the legislative body and issued his own version of the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania in an attempt to resolve some of this conflict. Markham's version of the Frame gave greater power to the lower house of the legislature, the General Assembly, and greatly weakened his executive power as well as that of the upper house, the Council. Markham was criticised by the surveyor-general of customs and fellow Governors such as Francis Nicholson for, among other things, allowing pirates such as Thomas Day to run rampant. Pennsylvania did not have the military capacity to protect the Delaware Bay. Penn also complained of fraudulent financial transactions with Markham, but still had him appointed, through the deputy governor, register- general of wills in 1703.

It was built with private funds between 1872 and 1884 in a dominant position overlooking the city. The site it occupies was once the Roman forum of Trajan, the forum vetus (old forum), thus its name (as an inverted corruption of the French Vieux-Forum). Role in the history and life of the city The main entry to the basilica Fourvi√®re is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to whom is attributed the salvation of the city of Lyon from the bubonic plague that swept Europe in 1643.Basilica Notre Dame de Fourvi√®re Website Each year in early December (December 8, day of the Immaculate Conception), Lyon thanks the Virgin for saving the city by lighting candles throughout the city, in what is called the F√™te des Lumi√®res or the Festival of Lights.Brennan, Jim. \\"An Unplanned Pilgrimage\\", St. Anthony Messenger, January 2013 The Virgin is also credited with saving the city a number of other times, such as from a Cholera epidemic in 1832, and from Prussian invasion in 1870. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1), Prussian forces, having taken Paris, were progressing south towards Lyon. Their halt and retreat were, once again, attributed by the Church to the intercession of the Virgin Mary. Speculating on the reasons for the construction of such an elaborate and expensive building, one author makes the statement that: \\"The reaction to the communes of Paris and Lyon were triumphalist monuments, the Sacr√©-Coeur of Montmartre and the basilica of Fourvi√®re, dominating both cities. These buildings were erected with private funds, as gigantic ex-votos, to thank God for victory over the socialists and in expiation of the sins of modern France.\\"Bertrand Taithe, Citizenship and Wars: France in Turmoil, 1870‚Äì1871, chapter \\"Religious Identities and Citizenship\\" 2001:100 Perched on top of the Fourvi√®re hill, the basilica looms impressively over the city of Lyon, from where it can be seen from many vantage points; not unintentionally, the Basilica of Fourvi√®re has become a symbol of the city. The Basilica, which offers guided tours and contains a Museum of Sacred Art, receives 2 million visitors annually. At certain times, members of the public may access the basilica's north tower for a spectacular 180-degree view of Lyon and its suburbs. On a clear day, Mont Blanc, the highest point in Europe, can be seen in the distance. The basilica interior Design and construction The design of the basilica, by Pierre Bossan, draws from both Romanesque and Byzantine architecture, two non-Gothic models that were unusual choices at the time. It has four main towers, and a belltower topped with a gilded statue of the Virgin Mary. It features fine mosaics, superb stained glass,The stained-glass window depicting Marshal P√©tain that was installed during the Nazi occupation of Vichy France was removed after the war.

Fourvi√®re actually contains two churches, one on top of the other. The upper sanctuary is very ornate, while the lower is a much simpler design. Work on the triumphant basilica was begun in 1872 and finished in 1884. Finishing touches in the interior were not completed until as late as 1964. Bossan's first sketches for the basilica seem to date from 1846. At the time he was in Palermo.Biblioth√®que municipale de Lyon The basilica has acquired the local nickname of \\"the upside-down elephant\\", because the building looks like the body of an elephant and the four towers look like its legs.

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway ran the London to Portsmouth Line via Hove, and refused to allow the London and South Western Railway to use any of that track to reach Portsmouth. The LB&SCR; blocked the line just north of the intended junction, prompting the L&SWR; to open a temporary station at Havant. The station was opened on 1 January 1859. Passengers would travel from Havant New in a horse-drawn omnibus to , bypassing Havant. The passengers could then carry on into Portsmouth by train. After two years the companies came to an agreement and the L&SWR; were allowed access to the disputed line. The station closed on 24 January 1859. The site today Nothing remains of the station today; the site is marked only by some old semaphore signal posts, some slates and a platelayers' hut. The station was the only one on the line built of blue bricks. The surrounds were not developed at the time of the station's existence so having fulfilled its political function it closed, in 1859.

Consisting of songs that the pair had been writing since August 2001, the songs would be performed live several times and even demoed before being recorded at Inner Ear Studios with Don Zientara during the summer of 2004. A reaction against what MacKaye had perceived to be the commercialization of rock music driven by the industry's \\"idea of youth\\", the album's \\"post-post- hardcore\\" sound is more stripped-down, minimal and personal in comparison to his work with Fugazi. The more direct and politically-charged lyrics, penned by both members, deal mainly with \\"the loss of community and the struggle to recapture it\\", though some of them feature romantic themes as well. Released through Dischord Records in the spring of 2005, the album received positive reviews from a number of different sources. Much of the praise (& even criticism) centered around the duo's sound, performances and songwriting, with publications such as Pitchfork and Cokemachineglow considering the album to be an impressive and even \\"vital\\" debut. Background MacKaye and Farina had known each other for nearly a decade prior to the album's recording - with Farina's band Mr. Candyeater playing frequently with Fugazi & being friends with the band in general. After the break-up of The Warmers, and with many Fugazi members being busy with family life, the two got together and began playing, according to MacKaye, during the \\"late summer - August [...] - of 2001.\\" After Fugazi went on hiatus, the duo would write for each other and play together \\"all the way through\\" till 2003. The duo first gained attention in late 2003 when they created a video for their original children's song \\"Vowel Movement\\", which was made for Pancake Mountain, a Washington, D.C. internet-based children's program. The clip fueled furthered rumors of Fugazi's breakup amid their hiatus, whilst resulting in speculation as to MacKaye's new musical direction. The song itself featured sing-along lines and upbeat music in the vein of Sesame Street and other children's educational programs, while the video showed dancing children and colorful vowels. Having recorded their demo in December that year, the duo began performing their songs live. However, performing live had resulted in many of the songs changing significantly, hence leading to their decision to re-record the songs 6 months later during the summer of 2004. Recording The album ended up being recorded at Inner Ear Studios in Washington D.C. with the help of \\"Dischord resident engineer\\" Don Zientara. Wanting to emphasize the percusiveness of the music as well as to \\"fill out\\" the low-end of the duo's sound owing to a lack of bass, MacKaye chose to use a $250 Danelectro baritone guitar with flat wound strings, calling its sound \\"really interesting\\". When asked about the authorship of the material, he stated: \\"I think it‚Äôs safe to say that if there‚Äôs a song where one of us is sort of singing by ourselves, chances are fair that the lyrics were written by that person.\\" Composition=Style The Evens, like much of the duo's work, is more stripped down and minimal than MacKaye's work with Fugazi. Rob Theakston notes that he \\"provides quiet, contemplative harmonies only hinted at briefly in latter-day Fugazi material\\" (citing \\"Pink Frosty\\" and \\"I'm So Tired\\" as points of comparison). Matthew Murphy called the album MacKaye's most \\"laid-back\\" and \\"personal\\" work till date, noting a \\"disarming sweetness\\" in the music brought about by his \\"particularly appealing\\" vocal delivery. Many have also noted Amy Farina's \\"angular\\" & \\"wildly inventive\\" drumming and vocal harmonies, a Tiny Mix Tapes reviewer noting that the former drove most of the songs, especially on tracks such as \\"Around the Corner\\". Her vocals, displaying a \\"strange mix of fragility and strength\\", have also earned comparisons to \\"early-90s [...] femme-led indie outfits like Tsunami and Scrawl\\" as well as Mimi Parker, with her more subdued drumming on tracks such as \\"Sara Lee\\" and \\"Minding One's Business\\" casting them in \\"Tortoise-like post-rock hues\\". MacKaye's baritone guitar playing has been described as being more repetitive, textured, hypnotic and understated in comparison to Farina's drumming. Overall, the album has been described as \\"the love child of Things We Lost in the Fire-era Low and One Beat-era Sleater-Kinney\\", as well as a collection of \\"likably moody lo-fi sing-alongs\\". The sound has also been likened to \\"post-post-hardcore\\". Themes The politically-charged lyrics deal mainly with \\"the loss of community and the struggle to recapture it\\". They have also been called \\"some of the most straightforward and politically caustic of MacKaye's career, packing a punch equal to some of his most visceral moments in Minor Threat.\\" The personal is political lyrics to the opening track \\"Shelter Two\\" explore the minutiae of a new relationship & \\"crucial, seemingly trivial moments that so often comprise the highlights of our lives\\" through a \\"trip to the hardware store\\". The song features the refrain \\"It's all downhill from here\\". \\"All These Governors\\" begins with MacKaye proclaiming: \\"Generally, I don't speak ill of the dead. However, I may make an exception in this case.\\" The song then goes on to launch \\"a litany of charges against elected officials with the line, \\"When things should work, but don't work, that's the work of all these governors.\\"\\" The song \\"Mt. Pleasant Isn't\\" references & discusses the riot of the same name as well as touching upon issues such as gentrification. \\"Around the Corner\\"'s lyrics deal with preserving one's youthful beliefs and ideals as one grows older, while songs such as \\"On the Face of It\\" and the closing track \\"You Won't Feel a Thing\\" offer \\"vague warnings about capitalism\\" and tackle \\"modern-day propaganda ministers\\" respectively. Packaging The cover image of the album depicts a silhouetted elephant in a cage, taken by MacKaye's sister-in-law Lely Constantinople. Of the image's political significance, MacKaye stated: \\"I think you‚Äôll have to see the whole thing to really get the sense of it. I hadn‚Äôt even thought about the more overt, obvious political reference. To me, there‚Äôs a whole other level. But I think people will look at it and take what they want; I think it‚Äôs a beautiful picture.\\" Release The album was released through Dischord Records in the spring of 2005, on CD, 12\\" vinyl and digitally. A free MP3 download of the album came with the (now out-of-stock) vinyl when purchased directly from the label. It also marked the first non-Fugazi album released by Ian MacKaye since 1987's Embrace. Reception The album received mostly positive reviews, scoring a 72 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 19 reviews, indicating a \\"[g]enerally favorable\\" reception. Tiny Mix Tapes described the songwriting on the album as \\"excellent\\" and \\"remarkably diverse\\", whilst Rob Theakston of Allmusic called the album a \\"major leap\\" forward for both MacKaye and Farina. \\"Ultimately,\\" writes Matthew Murphy for Pitchfork, \\"this eponymous debut not only introduces the Evens as a wholly distinct and vital group, but also contains performances that MacKaye would likely have been unable to deliver in any other context.\\" Despite warning that the listener shouldn't expect any \\"hair-raising shouts of defiance\\", Spin commended the album for the \\"wobbly spirit\\" shared by the duo. According to Todd Burns, writing for Stylus, the album \\"sees one side of the Fugazi sound being completely fleshed out and it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to hear.\\" Peter Hepburn of Cokemachineglow praised the album as \\"an impressive debut\\" and called the MacKaye's \\"caliber of experimentation [...] more than welcome.\\" A mixed review came from Popmatters' Evan Rytlewski, who criticized MacKaye's \\"newfound sense of melody he['d] mastered on The Argument\\" as being stale without that album's \\"prevailing dissonance\\", and found the album's instrumental format more suited to Farina's vocals than MacKaye's.

He is best known for his nude and still life paintings, such as German Girl and Skull. Biography Euan Uglow was born in 1932 in London. As a child, he lived in Tulse Hill in south London, where his father was an accountant. Uglow went to the local grammar school in Tulse Hill, Strand School. Afterwards he studied at Camberwell School of Art from 1948 to 1950, during a time when Camberwell students studied under artists such as Victor Pasmore, Lawrence Gowing, John Minton, Kenneth Martin and William Coldstream. Uglow was influenced by Coldstream whilst at Camberwell, although he believed that another tutor there, the painter Claude Rogers, was more significant in his development.Tom Rosenthal, 'Review of Euan Uglow The complete paintings by Catherine Lampert and Richard Kendall', in The Independent (London newspaper), 27 May 2007 Nonetheless, when Coldstream left Camberwell to teach at the Slade School of Art in 1951, Uglow followed him, and remained a student at the Slade until 1954. Refusing compulsory military service, Uglow was registered as a conscientious objector in 1954, and spent two years undertaking community work, assisting in the restoration of a war-damaged church by Christopher Wren in the City of London, redecorating the house of the artist Patrick George, and helping on a farm in Surrey.June Ducas, 'The irresitable Mr Uglow, in The Daily Telegraph (London newspaper), 5 April 1997 Success in art was not immediate, and he did not sell a painting until eight years after leaving art school. During this time he took a variety of part-time teaching jobs, most notably at the Slade from 1961, an institution with which he was to be associated for the rest of his life. In 1962, he was at the centre of a storm at the municipal art gallery in Bradford, Yorkshire, when a local councillor, Horace Hird, had one of Uglow's paintings, German Girl, removed from an Arts Council exhibition at the gallery.'Nude portraits cause uproar in England', in The Dispatch, (newspaper from Lexington, North Carolina), 22 August 1962, p.2 Hird claimed the painting 'offended decency'.'Nude Paintings Taken Down', in The Herald (Glasgow newspaper), 21 August 1962, p.7 Despite this, Uglow was generally a shy artist who shunned publicity as well as honours, including an offer to become a member of the Royal Academy in 1961.Keith Perry, 'UK's 'unknown' master painter dies of cancer', in The Guardian (London newspaper), 1 September 2000 However, he did become a trustee of the National Gallery in London in 1991, although, in his own words, he was generally ignored by the other trustees.June Ducas, 'The irresistible Mr Uglow, in The Daily Telegraph (London newspaper), 5 April 1997 Uglow's first solo show was in 1961 at the Beaux Arts Gallery, but his slow and methodical working method did not lead to a large number of solo shows. In 1969 he exhibited drawings at the Gardener Centre at Sussex University, in 1974 at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London and then periodically at the Browse & Darby Gallery in London. He also took part in numerous group shows, including exhibitions of the London Group and the annual John Moores Prize exhibitions in Liverpool. In 1981 he took part in the exhibition Eight Figurative Painters at the University of Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, and in 1984 in The Hard Won Image at the Tate Gallery, London. In 1992 he featured in the exhibition British Figurative Painting of the 20th Century at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and in 2000 in the exhibition Encounters at the National Gallery in London. In 2002 a posthumous retrospective was organised by the Arts Council for England, entitled Spotlight on Euan Uglow, which toured around Britain. In 2003 there was a retrospective Euan Uglow: Controlled Passion, Fifty Years of Painting at the Abbot Hall Gallery, in Kendal. In 1980, Uglow was invited by the artist Stass Paraskos to become the first artist-in-residence at the new Cyprus College of Art arts centre in village of Lempa on the island of Cyprus.Michael Paraskos, et al, Stass Paraskos (London: Orage Press, 2010) He has work in the collections of the Arts Council of England, the British Council, the National Museum of Wales, the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull, Glasgow Art Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Southampton City Art Gallery, the British Government Art Collection, the Tate Gallery and The Hepworth in Wakefield. Uglow died of liver cancer at his home in Wandsworth, London, in 2000. The Estate of Uglow is represented by Marlborough Fine Art, London. Style and influences Uglow was predominantly a painter of the human figure, although he also painted still life and landscapes. His method was meticulous, involving a great deal of measuring and correction to create images that are not hyper real, but appear almost sculptural.Andy McSmith, '¬£600,000 to see Cherie in the nude', in The Independent (London newspaper), 19 March 2009 Writing in 1990, Tim Wilcox said \\"[Uglow's] staple is the traditional studio nude but set in relation to an artificial space contrived by the artist himself with geometrical markings and the odd prop used as if by a minimalist stage designer.\\"Wilcox, T., Causey, A., Checketts, L., Peppiatt, M., Manchester City Art Gallery., Barbican Art Gallery., & Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum. (1990). The Pursuit of the real: British figurative painting from Sickert to Bacon. London: Lund Humphries in association with Manchester City Art Galleries. p. 17. The measuring process was laborious and time-consuming to the point that Uglow himself joked that one model he began painting when she was engaged, was still painting when she got married and did not finish painting until she was divorced.Eric Pace, 'Euan Uglow, 68, British Realist Who Won Praise for His Still Lives', in The New York Times, 2 September 2000 As this indicates, Uglow worked directly from life, and one of the features of his paintings was that he did not attempt to hide the process of construction. Remnants of the measurements he took and the drawing guide he used remain visible in the finished paintings.Christopher Andreae, 'Figurative Art Isn't What It Used To Be', in The Christian Science Monitor, 5 June 1990 This was a process that Uglow developed from his early studies under William Coldstream,Sebastian Smee, 'The artist who would not doubt', in The Daily Telegraph (London newspaper), 30 July 2003 and it was to become a mainstay of teaching at the Slade School of Art in London tying into an already long standing emphasis on drawing there. The result was paintings that had a strong sculptural quality, but within the tradition of the shallow picture plane of modernism, particularly as it was understood by C√©zanne, although Uglow's work has also been compared to the simple classicism of the Renaissance artist Piero della Francesca particularly for the way he would make his life models pose in ways to emphasise simple geometric shapes.Unsigned obituary, 'Euan Uglow', in The Daily Telegraph (London newspaper), 1 September 2000 Planes are articulated very precisely, edges are sharply defined, and colours are differentiated with great subtlety. Uglow preferred that his canvas be a square, a golden rectangle, or a rectangle of exact root value, as is the case with the Root Five Nude (1976).Lambirth, Andrew, \\"A State of Emergency\\", Modern Painters, Summer 1993 He then carried out careful measurements at every stage of painting, a method Coldstream had imparted to him and which is identified with the painters of the Euston Road School. Standing before the subject to be painted, Uglow registered measurements by means of a metal instrument of his own design (derived from a modified music stand); with one eye closed and with the arm of the instrument against his cheek, keeping the calibrations at a constant distance from the eye, the artist could take the measure of an object or interval to compare against other objects or intervals he saw before him. Such empirical measurements enable an artist to paint what the eye sees without the use of conventional perspective. The surfaces of Uglow's paintings carry many small horizontal and vertical markings, where he recorded these coordinates so that they could be verified against reality. Colour was fundamental to his understanding, and painters such as Matisse and the Venetians influenced him all his artistic life along with many others, although perhaps C√©zanne, Morandi, Poussin and Ingres were closest to his heart. Uglow described to an interviewer the inspiration for his still life Lemon (1973): > I'll tell you what Lemon is about ... It's the dome at Volterra that > Brunelleschi was supposed to have helped with. It's most beautiful, very > simple, very lovely. I couldn't paint the dome there, so when I came back I > thought I'd try to paint it from a lemon. Zagi (1981‚Äì82), which depicts a standing nude, was inspired by a children's toy of an acrobat, with the word Zagi itself being Chinese for acrobat.Life: The Observer Magazine - A celebration of 500 years of British Art - 19 March 2000 Uglow's paintings made whilst he was an artist-in-residence at the Cyprus College of Art in 1980 and again in 1983 are almost wholly landscapes, and he used the clear summer skies of Cyprus as a stark contrast of flat colour against the geometrical and sculptural forms he painted at ground level.Christopher Woodward, 'Behind the scenes at the museum', in The Guardian (London newspaper), 16 December 2006 But Uglow was also well travelled to other countries, spending six months in Italy on a Prix de Rome scholarship in 1953, and later making work in France, Spain, Morocco, Turkey, India and China. One of the most notable paintings made by Uglow was a nude painting of Cherie Booth, future wife of the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, left unfinished in 1978.Geoffrey Levy, 'Cherie's brush with a seducer', in The Daily Mail (London newspaper), 15 December 2006 Art critic Frank Whitford, writing in The Sunday Times has jokingly suggested Uglow made such an impression on the young Cherie that 30 years later the Blairs named their son after him.Frank Whitford, 'The Sunday Times best art books of 2007', in The Sunday Times (London newspaper), 25 November 2007.  Legacy  Uglow's perceptual work continues through those he taught and inspired such as Robert Duke, John Long, Suresh Patel and Andy Pankhurst.

He was the author of several books about medicine and herbs, and contributed to the field of astronomy with many papers and data recordings.

He later taught at the university and counted Jan Hus among his students. In 1403 he served as dean of the Faculty of Arts and 1405 as rector of the university. In 1405 he was appointed pastor of The Church of St. Michael the Archangel in Prague's Old Town; it is not known where he was ever ordained. Together with Johannes Cardinalis von Bergreichenstein, he attended the Council of Pisa in 1409. In 1415 he defended Jan Hus at the Council of Constance. Returning to Prague, he served as dean of the Faculty of Philosophy from 1417. Ten years later, in 1427, he was forced to flee from the Hussites. He returned two years later and in 1434 was once again elected rector. Christian of Prachitice died on 4 September 1439, a victim of the Black Death.

Mintz was the former Managing Director for Corporate Tax at Enron and a whistleblower during the Enron scandal. Early life and education Mintz holds an LL.M. degree from New York University School of Law, a J.D. from Boston University School of Law, and a B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania. Career Mintz began working at Enron in 1997, where he started as Vice President for Tax at Enron North America, formerly Enron Capital and Trade. He was Vice President and General Counsel for Enron Global Finance from October 2000 until November 2001. He now works at Kinder Morgan Energy Partners as Vice President and Chief Tax Officer.Kinder Morgan: Jordan Mintz He has also served as Senior Vice President for Tax at Centex (now PulteGroup), as a partner at Bracewell and as Senior Tax Attorney at Exxon Corporation. Role as an Enron whistleblower Upon moving to the Finance Department, Mintz recognized many problems at Enron and \\"took matters into his own hands,\\" hiring outside legal counsel to evaluate Enron's business practices. Mintz was also known for writing a memo to Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer of Enron in 2000, concerning some \\"sweetheart\\" deals in favor of Mr. Fastow three months before Sherron Watkins wrote her memo, raising red flags about the growing number of improperly leveraged partnerships. In addition to expressing his concerns with Enron's business practices, he also proposed many solutions to fix the problems. In 2002, Mintz testified before Congress, explaining that he tried in vain to ensure that Enron's deals were properly vetted by all necessary executives ‚Äî including former CEO Jeff Skilling. =SEC issues= On March 28, 2007, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil complaint against Mintz, claiming that he participated in fraud in 2001 by arranging murky disclosures of Enron's repurchase of a money-losing Brazilian power plant from a partnership run by former finance chief Andrew Fastow. Mintz's lawyer, Christopher Mead of Washington, said that Mintz will fight the charges vigorously, reminding reporters: \\"If you can find anyone at Enron who did more to regulate the relationship between Andy Fastow and Enron, please let me know who that is.\\" This complaint by the SEC came as a surprise, since Mintz was praised as a whistleblower and even considered a \\"hero\\" by followers of the Enron scandal. In 2009, Mintz resolved these charges, admitting no wrongdoing.

Life and work He was born in Alexandria and taught at both the al-Azhar Mosque and the Mansuriyyah madrasa in Cairo. He was responsible for systematizing ShƒÅdhilƒ´ doctrines and recording the biographies of the order's founder, Abu- l-Hassan ash-Shadhili, and his successor, Abu al-Abbas al-Mursi. He is credited with having authored the first systematic treatise on dhikr, The Key to Salvation (MiftƒÅ·∏• al-FalƒÅ·∏•), but is mostly known for his compilation of aphorisms, the ·∏§ikam al- øAtƒÅ‚Äòiyya. Ibn  øA·π≠ƒÅ AllƒÅh was one of those who confronted the controversial theologian Ibn Taymiyya, who was jailed several times for his views on religious issues and for his perceived excesses in attacking the Sufis. His confrontations with Ibn Taymiyya saw Ibn  øA·π≠ƒÅ AllƒÅh leading a procession of some 200 Sufis against Ibn Taymiyya as well as confronting him on issues. Death and legacy He died in 1309 while in Cairo. The wide circulation of Ibn  øA·π≠ƒÅ AllƒÅh's written works led to the spread of the ShƒÅdhilƒ´ order in North Africa, where the order's founder had been rejected in earlier attempts. The Wafai Sufi order was also derived from his works. Over the past 700 years the teachings of Ibn ‚ÄòAta‚Äô Allah have been repeatedly studied, commented on, reiterated, and have spread to the point where they are available across the globe, having been translated into almost every major language. Commentaries on the ·∏§ikam have been made by some of the most famous masters of the Shadhili order such as Ibn Abbad al-Rundi, Ahmad Zarruq and Ahmad ibn Ajiba as well as non-Shadhilis like the Indian Chishti Sufi  øAbd Allah Gangohi and the Syrian Islamic law Professor Sa'id Ramadan al- Bouti.

A clock/calendar did not become standard in the Apple II line of computers until 1986 with the introduction of the Apple IIGS. Although many productivity programs as well as the ProDOS operating system implemented time/date functions, users would have to manually enter this information every time they turned the computer on. Power users often had their Apple II's peripheral slots completely filled with expansion cards, so third party vendors came up with some unique solutions in order to mitigate this problem with products like the Serial Pro and No-Slot Clock.  No-Slot Clock (Dallas Semiconductor)  The No-Slot Clock, also known as the Dallas Smartwatch (DS1216E)http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1216-DS1216H.pdf, was a 28-pin chip-like device that could be used directly in any Apple II or Apple II compatible with a 28-pin ROM. Dallas Semiconductor produced the device as an easy implementation for a real-time clock for a variety of applications. The clock was powered by an embedded lithium battery, electrically disconnected until power was first applied to retain freshness. The non- replaceable battery had a life expectancy of 10 years. These are still commonly available on eBay shipped from China. Software and documentation can be found on Asimov In an Apple II, the No-Slot Clock resided under any 28-pin ROM chip, including one on a peripheral card. A user had to remove the ROM from its socket, insert the No-Slot Clock, and then reinsert the ROM chip into the top of the No-Slot Clock. The No-Slot Clock was both ProDOS and Dos 3.3 compatible, however a software driver had to be patched into ProDOS or integrated into the applicable DOS 3.3 program. Once the driver was installed it emulated the Thunderclock. The No-Slot Clock was usually installed in the following locations on the motherboard in the following computers:apple2.org: Apple Reference Web * Apple IIe: under the CD ROM (or CF ROM in later models) * Apple IIc: under the Monitor ROM * Apple IIc+: under the Monitor ROM * Laser 128: under the ROM behind the metal cover on the bottom  Serial Pro (Applied Engineering)  The Serial Pro was a multifunction serial interface and clock/calendar card from Applied Engineering. By combining the functions of two cards into one, the Serial Pro freed up an extra slot for those with highly populated machines. This card was unique in the sense that it did not use \\"Phantom Slots\\" to achieve this functionality. Previous multifunction cards required that a secondary function be \\"mapped\\" to a different slot in the computer's memory, rendering that slot unusable. The card was capable of a 12‚Äë and 24‚Äëhour clock format, was both ProDOS and DOS 3.3 compatible, and had on-screen time and date setting built into its ROM, eliminating the need to run a program in order to set the time. The battery was a GE DataSentry rechargeable Ni-cad battery which had a lifespan rating of 20 years. The card retailed for $139 during the late 1980s.Applied Engineering Spring/Summer '88 Catalog For more on the Serial Pro's communication capabilities, see its entry in Apple II serial cards.  Thunderclock Plus (Thunderware Incorporated)  When the Thunderware Thunderclock Plus was released in 1980,Manual for DOS support and ProDOS support it quickly became the de facto standard for an Apple II system clock. When Apple Computer released its new ProDOS operating system in 1984, a Thunderclock software driver came built-in. From that point on, all new Apple II system clocks strived to emulate the Thunderclock. The card itself was more compact than the earlier \\"The Clock\\" from Mountain Computers and contained two battery holders for off the shelf alkaline batteries which were easily replaceable.  Time Master H.O. (Applied Engineering)  The Time Master H.O. clock card from Applied Engineering was possibly the most advanced system clock ever designed for any Apple II. The card utilized an onboard VIA 6522 and was capable of emulating all other system clocks which preceded it. The Timemaster H.O. was powered by a GE Datasentry rechargeable Ni-cad battery which had a lifespan rating of 20 years. It was capable of 24‚Äëhour format or 12‚Äëhour with AM/PM format, millisecond timekeeping with an accuracy of 0.00005%, and an onboard timer which could time down any interval up to 48 days. It also maintained an internal calendar, separate of the 7‚Äëyear cycle which ProDOS mapped. The Timemaster H.O. was 100% ProDOS and DOS 3.3 compatible. The \\"H.O.\\" in Timemaster H.O. stood for \\"High Output\\". This referred to the 8-pin Digital I/O port on the card for advanced applications. Through this port, one could hook up Applied Engineering's BSR X-10 interface and \\"command console\\" to remotely control lights and electrical appliances. The BSR system could send signals over existing 120‚Äëvolt wiring, eliminating the need for additional wires. The system could also be used for low‚Äëvoltage implementations. The Timemaster H.O. retailed for $99 during the late 1980s while the BSR option cost an additional $29. The command console cost $39.

Career Witzenmann received his decisive study and work impulses through personal conversations with Rudolf Steiner. In the 1930s Witzenmann studied with Karl Jaspers in Heidelberg. His thesis On the Concept of Work According to Nietzsche and Hegel could, however, no longer be accepted because of Jaspers' forced exile under the National Socialists. Evidence for Jasper's acceptance of Witzenmann's promotion candidacy has not been presented. According to Witzenmann his dissertation manuscript was destroyed by fire due to phosphor bombings of Pforzheim by U.S. airplanes in World War II. After studies in mechanical engineering, Witzenmann was employed by the family firm in Pforzheim for many years. Witzenmann expressed his regret that he had refused to attend lunch held at his family home by his father for Adolf Hitler, who sought financial support for his political ambitions. Witzenmann had refused to attend out of protest against Hitler. In retrospect, Witzenmann regretted not having met Hitler because of the latter's later most destructive historical role. In 1963 Witzenmann was \\"co-opted\\" as a member by the Executive Committee of the General Anthroposophical Society. Several years later Witzenmann was suspended because he refused to accept a new policy advocated by the majority i.e. all other members of this Committee regarding the Rudolf Steiner Nachlassverwaltung. His door key literally no longer fit the lock to his office as member of the Executive Committee of the Anthroposophical Society. Presumably by order of his four other colleagues, after he walked out of an annual General Assembly meeting of the Anthroposophical Society in protest. At this meeting Witzenmann did not sit in front with his Executive Committee colleagues, but at the rear of the auditorium. In 1973 he founded the \\"Seminar for the free Striving of Youth, Art and Social Order\\" in Dornach, Switzerland. His work has been published by the Gideon Spicker Verlag, Verlag Freies Geistesleben, and Rudolf Steiner Press. Very little has been translated into English because those persons in control of the copyrights discouraged translation (note above reference to U.S. airplanes by one of these persons) and refused to allow translation published. His work is believed by some to be among the most significant in furthering Rudolf Steiner's work in The Philosophy of Freedom. References *Klaus Hartmann, Herbert Witzenmann 1905‚Äì1988.

It is situated on the banks of the Ithikkara River. It is surrounded by several small satellite villages: Ugramkunnu in the south, Chenkulam in the west, Mylode in the north and Karingannoor in the east. visit: http://oyoormates.in/ for more. Landmarks The main centers of public activity in Oyoor consist of a market, a bus stand, a primary health center, lower and upper primary schools, a village administrative office, a post office, a temple, Mosques and Christian churches. A social service club '(occ)' centralizing in Oyoor. Education The Government aided upper primary school was established over 75 years ago by Shri T. Abraham and T. Benjamin sons of Shri (Idupadical) Tharian Koruthu. A primary health center (established in 1956 by Dr A .R .Menon, who was then the Health Minister of Kerala state) is situated at Chunkathra. Etymology The place derives its name from an old Forest Office where chunkom (taxes) were collected during the Raj. The Ithikkara River The Ithikkara River flows south of Ugramkunnu. Prior to public works improvements in 1975, the river used to become swollen and flood during the monsoon season. Both the widest and the narrowest parts of the river may be found near Oyoor, as there is a spot where the water has to flow between two huge rocks. The rocks are named \\"Unnikkannan Paras\\", a reference to Lord Krishna. The width between the rocks is only two feet. In summer, when the flow is at its ebb, one can cross the river by jumping. Once the river passes between the rocks, it widens to approximately two furlongs. During summer seasons the water recedes to one side of the river and exposes a large part of the bed covered with white, fine sand. It is here that the \\"Manali Kachhavadam\\", an annual flea market of household necessities and other domestic products, takes place. The SreeRama Temple is located on northern bank of the river but, due to a bend in the river, appears to be on the west, looking to the east. A road along a sandy bank passing the temple leads to the northernmost part of Trivandrum district: Pakalkuri, which is home to the nearest government high school. Students from Oyoor have to ferry across the Ithikkara River, in front of the temple (see the picture below, taken in 2006, a view from the bridge connecting Kollam and Trivandrum Dist, the bridge was constructed in 1961‚Äì63, foundation stone laid by Sri Pattom Thanupillai, the then chief minister of Kerala The white spot in center of the picture is the temple.) Local temples and history The SreeRama Temple is also the site of the \\"Kaala Vayal\\" cattle auction/show, a part of the annual \\"Rohini Nakshathram Ulsavam\\" (festival) at Velinalloor. This festival has been the subject of a documentary on Jeevan TV. The famous Sri Ramaswamy kshetram (temple), dating back more than 1,000 years, is located in Velinalloor. It is believed that His Highness Marthanda Varma of Travancore was the last king who supported and maintained the temple. Velinalloor has its own significance in the epics. It is believed that Ugramkunnu is the place where Sugerevan lived (Sugreevan Kunnu-Ugramkunnu) and that Valiyan Kunnu is the place where Bali lived (Baliyan Kunnu-Valiyan Kunnu). There is some evidence that Jadayu Para in Chadayamangalam is the place where Ravanan cut Jadayu's wings. Peykavu is a Kavu 100 meters away from the Sree Keezhuttu Devi Temple. Its distinct feature is that no idol of any Lord is installed inside the Kavu. Devotees believe in the presence of Lord Shiva and he is called \\"Appooppan\\" (Grandfather). The rituals are performed by the male devotees who visit here, without the presence of Brahmin priests. Women are not allowed inside the Kavu. The most important offering to the Appooppan is \\"Pey-Oottu\\" or serving the lord with food, especially bananas. Keezhuttu Devi Temple was recently renovated by the public. It is one of the special temple where both Durga and Bhadrakali resides in the same Nalambalam. Among the nearby attractions are the Velinalloor Sri Ramaswamy Temple, Kuzhithrachalil Sree Murugan temple, which is about 500 and above years old temple, the Mathiyodu Madan Kavu and the Kaithakkal Devi Temple. Kottarakara Ganapathi Temple is easily accessible. Celebrities Oyoor resident Kochu Govinda Pillai (1916‚Äì2008) was a great Kathakali artist who trained Kathakali under the great Sri. Chennithala Kochu Pillai Panicker and Sri. Kurichi Kunjan Panicker and winner of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1989. The Sri Ramavilasam Kathakali school, under Sri Vasukutty, a former Kalamandalam Principal Sri. Kalamandalam Gangadharan Nair (Kathakali music), is located nearby in Veliyanallur. Kalabharathi Kathakali school is also close by at Pakalkuri. Award-winning Kadhakali performers namely Kalamandalam Ratheesan and Kalamandalam Ramachandran hails form this village. Kalamandalam Ratheeshan is well famous for his 'Nalan' and Kalamandalam Ramachandran for his female characters especially the 'Kurathi'. In Ugramkunnu there is a government school near the Sri Ramaswamy Temple, founded 55 years ago by Sri Krishna Pillai (the Panchayat President) as a private school.

Before his NFL career, he played college football at Angelo State University. Professional career Garrett is best known for replacing injured starter Art Monk in the 1982 NFL playoffs. Although he only caught one pass during the regular season, he caught 13 passes for 231 yards and four touchdowns in Washington's three playoff games. Then in Washington's 27-17 win in Super Bowl XVII, he caught two passes for 13 yards and another touchdown. He also ripped off a 44-yard run on a reverse play during the third quarter, setting a field goal by kicker Mark Moseley. At the time, it was the longest run by a receiver in Super Bowl history. His best season came in 1983 with the Redskins when he played in fifteen games, catching 25 receptions for 332 yards and one touchdown. He went on to catch a pass for 17 yards and gain 100 yards returning kickoffs in Super Bowl XVIII. He finished his five-season NFL career with 32 receptions for 412 yards and two touchdowns, 43 punt returns for 334 yards, and 50 kickoff returns for 1,013 yards in 55 games. The Cosell incident During the first half of the September 5, 1983 Monday Night Football game between the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins, Howard Cosell's commentary on Garrett included \\"That little monkey gets loose doesn't he?\\" Cosell's references to Garrett as a \\"little monkey,\\" ignited a racial controversy that laid the groundwork for Cosell's departure from MNF at the end of the 1983 season. The Rev. Joseph Lowery, then-president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, denounced Cosell's comment as racist and demanded a public apology. Despite supportive statements by Jesse Jackson, Muhammad Ali, and Alvin Garrett himself, the fallout contributed to Cosell's decision to leave Monday Night Football following the 1983 season. \\"I liked Howard Cosell,\\" Garrett said. \\"I didn't feel that it was a demeaning statement.\\" Cosell explained that Garrett's small stature, and not his race, was the basis for his comment, citing the fact that he had used the term to describe his own grandchildren. Among other evidence to support Cosell's claim is video footage of a 1972 preseason game between the New York Giants and the Kansas City Chiefs that features Cosell referring to athlete Mike Adamle, a 5-foot, 8-inch, 195-pound Caucasian, as a \\"little monkey.\\" ReferencesExternal links *http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/GarrAl00.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211824/http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=GARREALV01 *http://howardcosell-littlemonkeycomment.blogspot.com/ Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American football wide receivers Category:Angelo State Rams football players Category:New York Giants players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"Alvin Garrett"},{"id":"4441723","text":"Ivan Ira Esme Morris (29 November 1925 ‚Äì 19 July 1976) was an English author and teacher in the field of Japanese Studies.\\"Ivan Morris\\" Biography Ivan Morris was born in London, of mixed American and Swedish parentage to Edita Morris and Ira Victor Morris (son of diplomat Ira Nelson Morris and grandson of meat-packer Nelson Morris).

In Gesta Danorum, she is the daughter of the j√∂tunn Vagnophtus and the nurse of the Danish hero Hadingus.  Name  The Old Norse name 'Har√∞greipr' has been translated as 'hard-grip'. It is a compound formed with the adjective har√∞r ('hard, strong') attached to the root greip- ('hand [with spread thumbs], handle'). The meaning could be explained by the episode in which Harthgrepa (Har√∞greipr) grips a gigantic hand that is trying to enter her shelter. The 13th-century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus gives her name as Harthgrepa in Gesta Danorum.  Attestations  In Gesta Danorum (Deed of Danes), Harthgrepa (Har√∞greipr) becomes the wet-nurse, lover and road companion of the Danish hero Hadingus (Hadding), who his seeking revenge after the murder of his father the king Gram. Harthgrepa is trying to seduce Hadingus, but the latter answers that \\"the size her body [is] unwieldy for human embrace\\". Since she is a j√∂tunn, however, Harthgrepa is able to disguise as a man and accompany Hadingus on his journey. Later on, \\"desiring to probe the will of the gods by her claivoyant magic\\", she has Hadingus place a stick carved with \\"most gruesome spells\\" (perhaps in runes) under the tongue of a dead man. The corpse, forced to speak \\"in a voice terrible to ear\\" by the magical item, curses the one who summoned him, then predicts the death of Harthgrepa, \\"weighted down by her own offence\\". In the following episode, she is able to defeat a gigantic hand that is trying to enter their brushwood-made shelter as she and Haddingus are sleeping. As the corpse has predicted, Harthgrepa eventually pays for the offence she has made to him, and she ends up \\"lacerated by companions of her own race [j√∂tnar]\\". The author of Gesta Danorum, Saxo Grammaticus, adds that \\"neither her special nature nor her bodily size helped her to escape the savage nails of her assailants\\". In the Icelandic √æulur, Har√∞greipr appears in a list of j√∂tnar.  Theories  According to scholar John Lindow, Hadingus has \\"numerous Odinic traits\\" and \\"certainly tarrying with a giantess is an Odinic act...\\" Lindow interprets the episode of Har√∞greipr having Hadingus place spells under the tongue of a corpse as an initiation into one of Odin's realms, necromancy. Georges Dum√©zil's interpretation In The Saga of Hadingus, Georges Dum√©zil tries to demonstrate that the legend of Hadingus shows many similarities with myths concerning the god Nj√∂r√∞r, and more generally that Hadingus shares many features with the Vanir. Some of his arguments have to do with Hadingus' relationship with Harthgrepa. Before their integration into the √Üsir, the Vanir used to have incestuous relationships (Freyr and Freyja are for instance Nj√∂r√∞r and his sister's children). Hadingus' relationship with Harthgrepa is a quasi-incestuous one, all the more so that Harthgrepa insists on the fact that she was like a mother to him. Dum√©zil also draws a parallel between Hadingus / Harthgrepa relationship and the one between Freyr / Gunnar helming and Freyr‚Äôs priestess as related in √ñgmundar √æ√°ttr dytts. He also reminds that the Vanir used to practise this kind of magic known as seid. Even if Harthgrepa's magic (compelling a dead man to speak) does not come within the seid practices, both are described as shameful and liable to a punishment. In this respect, Harthgrepa's death can be compared to the √Üsir's attempts to kill Gullveig.Saxo Grammaticus does not give the reason for Harthgrepa's death. Dum√©zil explanation is only one among others. Axel Olrik (Kilderne tit Sakses Oldhistorie, 2, 1894) for instance argued that she was killed by creatures of her own race for having betrayed them, since she had sided with a human.

In an eight-page article in 2015, for example, \\"Long Walk to Justice\\", staff writer Mike White asked if New Zealand‚Äôs justice system should establish an independent commission to investigate wrongful convictions. Issues involving justice in New Zealand provide a theme for many of his stories for North & South. Editor-at-large Donna Chisholm specialises in health and science writing. The editorial content also includes profiles of New Zealanders, brief stories, essays, opinion, music, film and book reviews, food, and travel. History and profile North & South was launched in April 1986 by Metro Publications ‚Äì Mick Mason and Bruce Palmer, under editor Robyn Langwell. ACP Magazines then sold to ACP. It is now published by Bauer Media NZ, based in Auckland. Bauer Media NZ acquired the title in September 2012. Virginia Larson succeeded Robyn Langwell as editor in 2008 until 2020. The magazine has won more than 300 journalism, photography and design awards, including multiple MPA Magazine of the Year awards, Citi Journalism Awards for Excellence and Wolfson Fellowships to the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. In early April 2020, the Bauer Media Group closed down several of its New Zealand brands including North & South in response to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand. On 17 June 2020, Sydney investment firm Mercury Capital purchased North and South as part of its acquisition of Bauer Media's New Zealand and Australian media assets. On 17 July, Mercury Capital confirmed that it would be selling North and South to independent publishers Konstantin Richter and Verena Friederike Hasel.  Contribution to press freedom  In 1995, North & South published an article by Joe Atkinson in which he called ex-Prime Minister David Lange lazy. Lange objected to this and other criticisms in the article, and sued Atkinson and the publishers for defamation. The subsequent case ran for five years, and resulted in the media being able to use a defence of qualified privilege when reporting on politicians. This was a ground-breaking extension of press freedom, which was subsequently subsumed in a more general defence of public interest communication. Controversy In November 2006, Deborah Coddington Deborah Coddington wrote a cover article, \\"Asian Angst\\", questioning immigration and referencing the high profile of \\"Asian\\" crime, talking of a \\"gathering crime tide\\" and an \\"Asian menace\\". Coddington's article attempted to justify this language by pointing to a 53% increase in police arrest figures for \\"Asians\\" over the last 10 years. However, she neglected to mention that the corresponding overall \\"Asian\\" population had increased by more than 100% in that time and that the arrest rate among that \\"Asian\\" population (which was already very low compared to the general population) had halved. A member of the general population was now four times more likely to be arrested than an \\"Asian\\". Outraged reaction swiftly followed, and formal complaints to New Zealand Press Council came from the Asia New Zealand Foundation, the head of Journalism at Massey University and a consortium of mostly academics, journalists and ethnic Asian community leaders led by Tze Ming Mok.\\"Reporting on diversity in New Zealand: The case of 'Asian Angst'\\", Grant Hannis, Massey University The following month, the New Zealand Press Council condemned Coddington's article and ordered North & South to print an apology. The Press Council found the language of the article \\"misleading\\" and \\"emotionally loaded\\". The Council stated that even though journalists are \\"entitled to take a strong position on issues they address ... that does not legitimise gratuitous emphasis on dehumanising racial stereotypes and fear-mongering and, of course, the need for accuracy always remains\\".

Gregory Smith; October 7, 1819 ‚Äì January 6, 1905) was an American author. She was president of the board of managers for the Vermont woman's exhibit at the Centennial Exposition of 1876, at Philadelphia, and was frequently chosen in similar capacities as a representative of Vermont women. During the Civil War, she coordinated a response to the Confederate raid on St. Albans on October 19, 1864. In 1870, Governor Peter T. Washburn, who had served as adjutant general of the Vermont Militia during the war, recognized her efforts and presented her with an honorary commission as a lieutenant colonel on his military staff. Early life and education Ann Eliza Brainerd was born in St. Albans, Vermont on October 7, 1819. The daughter of Senator Lawrence Brainerd and Fidelia B. Gadcombe, she was raised and educated in St. Albans. Career In 1842, she married J. Gregory Smith, who served as Governor during the Civil War. They were the parents of six children, including Edward Curtis Smith, who also served as governor. Author From the December, 1901 issue of The Vermonter magazine Smith wrote essays, poems and other works, and is best known for her three novels, Seola, Selma, and Atla. Her first published work, From Dawn to Sunrise (1876) dealt with the historical and philosophical religious ideas of mankind. Its success caused Henry K. Adams, author of A Centennial History of St. Albans Vermont to call it \\"[t]he smartest book ever written in Vermont.\\" Her second work was Seola (1878), which was written as an antediluvian diary. The next novel published was Selma (1883), a Viking love story. The third novel, Atla (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1886), was about the sinking of the legendary lost island called Atlantis. At least one reviewer, The Churchman, was highly critical of it:‚Äî Undated cabinet photo by W. D. Chandler of St. Albans, Vermont In 1924, Seola was revised by the \\"Bible Students\\"‚Äîlater known as Jehovah's Witnesses‚Äîand retitled Angels and Women. Smith usually wrote under her married name, Mrs. J. Gregory Smith, but both Seola and Angels and Women were published anonymously; they were later ascribed to her by the Library of Congress. St. Albans Raid On the afternoon of October 19, 1864, the northernmost land event of the Civil War occurred, the St. Albans Raid. Confederates infiltrated the town, robbed several banks, wounded two citizens (one mortally), and fled north to Canada. Since he was serving as governor, the home of J. Gregory Smith was a target of the raid. Governor Smith was not at home, and when Mrs. Smith appeared in the front doorway carrying an unloaded pistol (the only weapon she could find), the raiders decided to bypass the house. She then worked to organize the people of St. Albans to mount a pursuit of the raiders, which unsuccessfully attempted to prevent them from escaping to Canada. For her actions in defending the Smith home and efforts to rally the people of St. Albans in pursuing the raiders, Governor Washburn named Mrs. Smith a brevet lieutenant colonel on his staff. Washburn, who served as governor from 1869 until his death in 1870, had served in the Union Army early in the Civil War, and then spent the rest of the conflict as Adjutant General of the Vermont Militia. Under Washburn's direction, units of the militia had attempted to pursue the Confederate raiders, and later patrolled the border with Canada to ensure there were no further efforts to conduct Confederate activities in Vermont. Smith wrote of her personal reminiscences of the St. Albans Raid in The Vermonter:‚Äî Death and legacy Smith died in St. Albans on January 6, 1905. She was buried in Greenwood Cemetery.

Born in 1898 to an American mother and a Canadian father, she lived to see three centuries before her death at 101 years of age on January 19, 2000. A member of the Communist Party, she was active in immigration issues and was at one point nearly deported herself, though she was later granted citizenship. During the later years of her life, she became known as an environmental activist and served as secretary for the Seattle Audubon Society for 35 years. Biography Hazel Wolf was born in Victoria, British Columbia. She grew up poor and her early years were largely dominated by class and poverty issues. Her father was a sergeant in the Canadian merchant marines and her mother was a native of Indiana. In 1901, her brother, named after her father but generally referred to as \\"Sonny,\\" was born. In 1903, her sister Dorothy was born. Her father died in 1908. Hazel was formally trained as a social worker, but felt most at home among her people. This led to her involvement in the Communist party, where she felt she was doing 'real' social work. By the time of McCarthyism, Wolf was being targeted by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service as a subversive foreign national. Her deportation cases lasted from 1949-63. She later became a United States citizen, but made no apologies for having been a member of the Communist Party. Her later years were largely dominated by her environmental activism, which led her to Washington D.C. to lobby congress on issues that were important to her. She became nationally recognized and was awarded the National Audubon Society's Medal of Excellence. On June 12, 1999, she was the guest speaker at the AILA Annual Conference.

A Marquesan tattoo is a tattoo design originating from the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific. Marquesan tattoos can be recognized by 'trademark symbols', such as geckos, centipedes, Ti'i's, the Marquesan Cross (which is also commonly confused with other designs) and other geometric designs. Marquesan designs distinguish themselves through the use of symbols and consistent artistic renderings of lines, arches and circles, which are uniquely attributed and linked through history to the South Pacific Islands. Marquesan Tattoos are a part of the Polynesian Tattoo art. The Marquesan Cross is often incorporated into larger Polynesian Tattoo Designs as it symbolises the balance between the elements and harmony. Tradition Boys received their first tattoos in their teens in a ritual setting, and by old age often had tattoos all over their bodies. Women were also tattooed, but not as extensively as men. The designs share many symbolic motifs, but were never copied entirely; every individual's tattoos were different and signified heritage, accomplishments, the specific Marquesan island the individual came from and their familial position. Sailors on board the ships of Captain James Cook and other explorers from the West brought tattooing back with them, influenced by the designs they had seen on the inhabitants of these islands. These early tattoos, on the bodies of sailors, began the reintroduction of tattooing to the West. Tattooing is still performed on the Marquesas Islands, though now performed with a tattoo machine rather than traditional methods.

During his career he was a star columnist for leading newspapers and magazines published in SFR Yugoslavia and Serbia, editor in chief of several prominent television stations, political advisor to prominent Serbian politicians, and Information Minister for four months in 1996 in the government headed by Mirko Marjanoviƒá during the rule of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. He was very much a polarising figure in Serbian society and gathered a great deal of admirers as well as enemies throughout the years. He died on October 28, 2013 from a heart attack. Early life Tijaniƒá was born in ƒêakovica, FPR Yugoslavia. After finishing high school in his home town, he moved to Belgrade to study journalism at University of Belgrade's Faculty of Political Sciences. He did not complete his studies. Journalism career After working his way up during the late 1970s and early 1980s in Politika publications such as Auto Svet, he got a sought-after job at NIN magazine, where he first wrote for the supplement on vehicles and eventually advanced to a position on the editorial board. His job in NIN was a springboard for other top editorial positions. In the mid-1980s he was editor-in-chief of Intervju, another weekly magazine from Politika AD family. In parallel, he wrote for periodical publications in Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia. Following the 8th Session of the Serbian Communist League in September 1987, which was essentially the official date of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's ascent to power in Serbia, Tijaniƒá lost all of his writing engagements in the Belgrade publications and was thus reduced to mostly writing in Croatian papers. He became particularly well known as a political columnist writing for the Split- based weekly newspaper Nedjeljna Dalmacija, which soon earned him the moniker of \\"the giant of Croatian journalism\\". In his column titled En Passant he often expressed views critical of the Yugoslav government and Communism in general - something that his Croatian colleagues, silenced after the collapse of the Croatian Spring, seldom dared to do. His column effectively ended in 1990, following the shift in the newspaper's editorial policy as his column was deemed too critical of the new Croatian vice-president Antun Vrdoljak, although Tijaniƒá was allowed to write one last entry in late March 1991. Simultaneous to his Nedjeljna Dalmacija engagement, Tijaniƒá also wrote for Croatian newsmagazines Danas and Start. Tijaniƒá, the RTS general-director, meeting with pop star ≈Ωeljko Joksimoviƒá in 2012. In the meantime, during first part of 1991, he was part of the hosting trio on Umijeƒáe ≈æivljenja talk-show along with Mirjana Bobiƒá-Mojsiloviƒá and Dragan Babiƒá. Conceptualized as a free format taped in front of live theater audience at Sarajevo's Teatar Obala, the programme quickly gained country-wide recognition and notability. Tijaniƒá conducted memorable interviews with, among others, Milovan ƒêilas, notable communist dissident, and Stjepan Mesiƒá, at the time high-ranking official of Franjo Tuƒëman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and soon to become last president of SFR Yugoslavia's presidency. The show abruptly ended in May 1991 when a crowd of Muslim extremists mentored by the SDA political party attempted to lynch Tijaniƒá and Bobiƒá-Mojsiloviƒá on the day when the interview with Serbian right-wing politician Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj was supposed to be taped. Coming back to Belgrade, Tijaniƒá began an editing stint at Sportski ≈æurnal sports daily in June 1991. In 1993, Tijaniƒá became the head of programming at the recently launched TV Politika.

Fictional character history The Devil Hulk is a alternate personality of Bruce Banner, personifying all of Bruce's resentment at the way he is treated by the world, and all his negative emotions such as self-hatred. The Devil Hulk is also one of the Hulk's enemies, constantly threatening to escape the confines of Bruce's mind and destroy the world that has tormented and abused them.The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics. While the character's physical appearance varies, he is always depicted as having glowing red eyes, and reptilian traits. The Devil Hulk first appears when Bruce uses a machine created by Angela Lipscombe to travel into his own mind, which is being overtaken by the Guilt Hulk as he begins to die of Lou Gehrig's Disease. In a cavern containing innumerable other personalities frozen in ice, Bruce finds the Devil Hulk unfrozen but bound by chains. After explaining the nature of his existence, the Devil Hulk says he will banish the Guilt Hulk (his inability to feel guilt giving him the advantage over the entity) if Bruce releases him from his shackles, but Bruce refuses the Devil Hulk's offer to help, and flees, managing to keep the Devil Hulk contained and ensure the future safety of the world by making a deal with the three 'primary' Hulk personas (Savage Hulk, Grey Hulk, and Professor Hulk) that they will share control of the body once Banner's disease becomes too serious while leaving Banner with some degree of awareness and control. Later, Bruce's mind is thrown into disarray by the experiments of John Ryker, allowing the Devil Hulk to escape the cave from which he taunts Bruce.The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics.

During a conversation with Doc Samson, the Devil Hulk (now also known as the \\"Immortal Hulk\\"‚Äîdue to it manifesting at night even if Banner is killed during the day and apparently cannot be killed itself) reveals that it actually embodies Banner's desire for a protective father figure, and that Banner's inability to \\"imagine love without pain\\" is why he had previously perceived it as being a malevolent, Satanic entity.

In the end, Bruce, Joe Fixit, and Savage Hulk agree to collaborate with the Venom Symbiote and Devil Hulk storms off, saying they are making a mistake.Absolute Carnage: Immortal Hulk #1 (October 2, 2019). Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Like the traditional Hulk, he possesses superhuman strength and stamina. As it took both the Savage Hulk and the Joe Fixit Hulk personas to hold him down when he attempted to escape while Banner was being treated for a presumably incurable disease, the Devil Hulk appeared to be stronger than any of the previously introduced Hulks. However, since this confrontation took place on the mental plane, it is most likely simply reflecting the force of the Devil's will compared to the more child- minded Hulks and the subsequent effort needed for their weaker-willed personas to hold him down rather than providing a clear indication of their actual physical strength. In other media Devil Hulk appears as the boss in The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction voiced by Richard Moll. In the game, the Devil Hulk is attempting to gain control of Banner's body, claiming to be a natural stage in the gamma-evolution process, and regarding the Hulk as a frightened child crying out to be loved. With the aid of his ally Doc Samson, Banner is able to construct a machine that allows him to enter his mind and battle the Devil Hulk at the \\"Crossroads\\".

History Sanford High School was built in 1902. In 1911 the student population necessitated the building of a new Sanford High School on Sanford Avenue. In 1927 a much larger building opened on French Avenue, and the school was renamed Seminole High School. By 1961 a new sprawling campus was opened at the present location on Ridgewood Avenue, and the old building on French Avenue became Sanford Junior High School (later renamed Sanford Middle School). Seminole High School has grown not only in the size of the campus, but also in student population ‚Äì in 1907, only four students attended and graduated Seminole High School. Today, the graduation rate in Seminole High School is 86%.

Publication history The first character to use the name was Lex Luthor, who appeared as the Kryptonite man in Action Comics #249 Action Comics (vol. 1) #249 (February 1959) . The second character to use the name first appeared as the Kryptonite Kid in Superboy #83,Superboy (vol. 1) #83 (September 1960) and as Kryptonite Man in Superman #299.Superman (vol. 1) #299 (May 1976) and was created by Jerry Siegel and George Papp. The K. Russell Abernathy version of Kryptonite Man first appeared in Superman #650 and was created by Kurt Busiek, Geoff Johns, and Pete Woods. The Clay Ramsay version of Kryptonite Man first appeared in Action Comics Annual #1 and was created by Grant Morrison, Rags Morales, Sholly Fisch, and Cully Hamner. Fictional character biography=Pre-CrisisLex Luthor= Lex Luthor drank a serum dissolved from a Kryptonite meteor he found to gain the ability to emit Kryptonite radiation. =Kryptonite Kid= The original Kryptonite Man started out as a teen-age alien criminal called the Kryptonite Kid. On the planet Blor. Facing a 20 year sentence, he volunteered for a scientific experiment, a satellite that required a test passenger. He favored dying in deep space to rotting in jail, with the added bonus of a 10,000 to 1 chance of surviving the test. He was loaded in the satellite together with a laboratory dog, and the satellite was shot into deep space, never to return. To pass the time, they watched a telescopic viewer of Earth and learned of Superboy's existence. On their course for Earth, they passed through a green cloud of gaseous Kryptonite. Exposure to the Kryptonite turned both him and his dog green, bestowing each of them with Kryptonite-based powers. This incarnation is most well known pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths from his appearance and death in the non-continuity story Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?. In this story, he is depicted as somewhat older and uses the name Kryptonite Man. Action Comics Vol 1 583 =Alien Kryptonite Man= A second Kryptonite Man appeared in Superman #397. Superman #397 He had been the ruler of a race of humanoids who inhabited Krypton (called \\"Ny'L'Uyl\\" in his language) eons before Superman's ancestors. When a nearby cosmic body threatens life on Krypton, the second Kryptonite Man, whose real name is never given, sends all of his people into stasis deep underground, while he himself remains on the highest mountain peak, to act as guardian. He is then placed in suspended animation for what is to be 20 years, at which time, he will awaken to determine if the planet is habitable once again. For some reason, the machinery fails, and the unnamed ruler slept for over a thousand years. Unfortunately, the very day he awoke is the day Krypton exploded. The mountain that the unnamed ruler's observatory was on is sent into space. Somehow, the king is able to feed off of the Kryptonite radiation the mountain produced. He eventually became dependent upon these energies to sustain his life at all times, weakening outside of its influence. This second Kryptonite Man blames the pink-skinned humanoid inhabitants (Superman's race) with the death of Krypton, never realizing it was a natural disaster. Eventually, after the Kryptonite radiation of the mountain began to fade, the Kryptonite Man encounters a race known as the Seeders. For unknown reasons, the ships of this race produce radiation similar enough to Kryptonite radiation, that Kryptonite Man could feed off of, and survive. Kryptonite Man discovers the existence of Kryptonians on Earth, and stealing a Seeder ship, travels there to confront and kill them. Kryptonite Man attacks Superman, but their battle was interrupted by the Seeders, who took offense to Kryptonite Man's theft.Superman (vol. 1) #397 (July 1984) The story continued in Supergirl #21 where Supergirl joined Superman in fighting Kryptonite Man and the Seeders. Supergirl Vol 2 21 Post-CrisisSuperman Clone= In the post-Crisis era, the Kryptonite Man appears in Superman (vol. 2) #43 as a green-skinned clone of Superman, grown by the scientific spies Simyan and Mokkari.Superman (vol. 2) #43 (May 1990) =Living Radiation version= A character in the ongoing series Superman/Batman also uses the name Kryptonite Man. Superman/Batman #20-21 This version of the character is created when Captain Atom absorbed the explosive energy from Major Force, then went out to destroy a Kryptonite meteor. The Kryptonite energy somehow combined with the remaining energy from Major Force in Captain Atom to create a sentient energy force. After being siphoned from Captain Atom by Toyman, the energy was able to jump from body to body, taking over the personality and causing the body to release Kryptonite radiation. Superman/Batman #25 =K. Russell Abernathy= Most recently, soon after DC Comics' One Year Later jump, a scientist named K. Russell Abernathy was working on an experiment to use Kryptonite to develop a new energy source. The experiment explodes, infusing Abernathy's body with radiation. Clark Kent, powerless, summons the current Supergirl. Abernathy, in a misguided attempt to prove his energy theories, goes on a violent rampage; this includes deliberately attempting to injure Kryptonians. He is soon subdued and imprisoned.Superman (vol. 1) #650 (May 2006) He is taken to Stryker's Island, Metropolis' local prison. Lex Luthor sends insectile warriors who free Abernathy.Superman (vol. 1) #651 (June 2006) The man is used in conjunction with large amounts of Kryptonite to free an ancient Kryptonian spaceship.Action Comics (vol. 1) #838 (June 2006) He later resurfaced in Action Comics #853, having Superman on the ropes until the timely intervention of Jimmy Olsen and Krypto.Action Comics (vol. 1) #853 (October 2007) The New 52Clay Ramsay= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Kryptonite Man is reintroduced in Action Comics #5, by Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert. His origin is told in Action Comics Annual #1 (Dec. 2012) (penned by Sholly Fisch). In this origin, Clay Ramsay was an abusive husband living in Metropolis. One night, Superman broke into his house while he was beating his wife and threw him into Hob's Bay. His wife subsequently left him and no one in the justice system could help him. Seeking revenge, he joined the mysterious \\"Project K-Man\\" (a private super- soldier project) after receiving an invitation from Dr. Abernathy (a nod to the pre-New 52 version of the character). Gaining superhuman powers, he attacked Superman but was defeated and arrested. He was released shortly afterwards by General Sam Lane who believed he was needed as a countermeasure to keep Superman in check. K-Man agreed under the condition that the General would help him locate his wife.Action Comics Annual (vol. 2) #1 (December 2012) It was revealed that Lex Luthor had played a major role in the K-Man's creation. Also (as revealed in flashback), he had stolen Kryptonite crystals from the government while being employed by them.Action Comics (vol. 2) #13 (December 2012) His subsequent activities are unknown, but a version of him from the near future was a member of the Anti-Superman Army. He was seen alongside two people with similar powers (one equipped with Red another with Blue) as part of a group called the \\"K-Men\\".Action Comics (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013) Other versions In the Elseworlds storyline Superman: The Last Family of Krypton, when Jor-El and Lara accompany Kal-El to Earth, they have two more children, Bru-El and Valora, whose genetic potential is slightly 'stunted' compared to their brother due to them being born on Earth. Superman: The Last Family of Krypton #1-2 As part of his vendetta against the El family, Lex Luthor is able to turn Bru-El against his family, using a series of nanites designed to make him immune to kryptonite to make him essentially addicted to it, transforming him into a kryptonite-powered superhuman with too little willpower to defy Luthor's orders. He subsequently kills his mother in the attack on the El compound, but Kal-El is able to defeat his brother when he expends too much of his energy. With Luthor's plot defeated, Bru-El is purged of the nanites, at the cost of losing his memory; with Lara's last words being that Bru-El never learn of his role in his mother's death, he is last recorded as having reached an eighth-grade level following his mindwipe. Superman: The Last Family of Krypton #3 Powers and abilities The original Kryptonite Man was an alien with natural powers of telepathy. After passing through the Kryptonite cloud, he gained enhanced strength and endurance. The second Kryptonite Man could absorb Kryptonite energy, which gave him increased strength and abilities. The third Kryptonite Man was a duplicate of Superman, with all the basic Kryptonian powers. The fourth Kryptonite Man was a living cloud of kryptonite radiation that could possess others and could also heal the injuries of those it possessed (as evidenced when it took over a wounded Batman). The fifth Kryptonite Man possesses a Kryptonite-enhanced physiology, the ability to see radiation spectrums, and the power to fire Kryptonite beams from his eyes. When he becomes angry, however, he loses his ability to think rationally, becoming a raging maniac. The sixth Kryptonite Man can absorb radiation to fuel his superhuman abilities. This grants him flight and super- strength to rival Superman's abilities. If properly powered he has the ability to expel a large amount of radiation as a blast. This radiation can be detrimental or fatal to organisms based on what they are. In other media=Television * The Kryptonite Kid appeared in the Superboy episode \\"Kryptonite Kid\\", played by Jay Underwood. A young man named Mike Walker, working at a military research base, was caught in a Kryptonite explosion while trying to find a way to make Superboy immune to Kryptonite radiation. The Kryptonite entered his bloodstream, as well as his nervous system, turning his skin green and affecting his mind in vicious ways. Walker became \\"living, breathing Kryptonite,\\" able to fire Kryptonite radiation from his hands. Superboy was able to defeat him through enlisting the aid of a human man who had been arrested for fraud in taking advantage of his resemblance to Superboy in order to make money and attract girls. In exchange for getting the charges dropped, Superboy convinced the man to stand up to Walker, whereby Walker's Kryptonite beams had no effect on him. With Mike Walker distracted as to why he was not harming the Superboy impersonator, Superboy then wrapped up Walker in a lead tarp, where eventually the Kryptonite would be cleansed from Walker's body. * In Smallville, while there is no distinct 'Kryptonite Man', many of Clark's foes in the first few seasons of the show gained their powers through exposure to kryptonite (called Meteor-Freaks), with the result that Clark was weakened by proximity to various foes who would otherwise not have been a great problem for him, such as being unable to come close to enemies using kryptonite-based cream and tattoos to turn themselves invisible and intangible, or a meteor-mutated human able to erase memories completely wiping Clark's memory where he normally just wiped the last few minutes of a person's experiences.

Londos was one of the most popular stars on the professional wrestling circuit in the 1930s and 1940s.  Career  Jim Londos was born Christos Theofilou in 1894 in Koutsopodi, Argos, Greece as the youngest of thirteen children of Theophilos and Maria. Before arriving in the United States, in his native Greece young Londos was a shepherd. His father, Theophilos was an amateur wrestler of considerable reputation, and is credited with having instructed his young son in some of the fundamentals.Hackett, T: Slaphappy: Pride, Prejudice, and Professional Wrestling, page 36. HarperCollins, 2006. At age thirteen he ran away from home and eventually emigrated to the United States. Working whenever he could, Theofilou took several odd jobs including cabin boy, construction jobs, and posing nude for figure drawing classes.Hackett, page 37. Theofilou landed a job as a catcher in a carnival acrobatic act. It was during this period that he was exposed to professional wrestling and began training. Londos' first matches, from 1912,http://wrestlingclassics.com/.ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=10;t=003280#000000 were as \\"The Wrestling Plasterer\\" Christopher Theophelus, a gimmick that saw him coming to the ring in overalls. After a number of years, he dropped this in favour of wrestling under the name Jim Londos and being a no-nonsense professional wrestler. Londos became the most popular wrestler in the 1930s & 1940s while continuing to attract large crowds until 1959. Just before his retirement he married Anglo-American woman Arva C. Rochwite (1912-1998), who was born in Clayton, Missouri. At the time of their marriage, Rochwite was described in press reports as a \\"St. Louis Aviatrix.\\" The couple had three daughters: Diana, Demetra, and Christina. The Londos family moved to Escondido, California, where they settled on a 10-acre site nestled in an avocado grove. There, Londos quietly managed his orchard and other investments; he devoted the rest of his public life to charity. Londos was considered a national hero in Greece. When he traveled there, one of his matches drew a crowd estimated as nearly 100,000 fans.  Retirement  Londos retired in 1953. He spent the rest of his life working for charitable organizations. His favorite charity was Greek war orphans of World War II. He was honored by both United States President Richard Nixon and King Paul of Greece for his philanthropic efforts. Londos died of a heart attack August 19, 1975 and is buried at Oak Hill Memorial Park in Escondido, California.

The creators of the Center were inspired by the Penrith Whitewater Stadium built for the 2000 Olympics. The Center's primary feature is the world's largest and most complex recirculating artificial whitewater river. The facility cost $38 million to build, and costs $6.8 million per year to operate. The river channels were designed by three-time Olympian Scott Shipley.Scott Shipley resume In June 2016, prompted by the death of a teenage park-goer from Ohio, the USNWC voluntarily closed the park's whitewater channels following the discovery of Naegleria fowleri, in the park's water.http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article85846642.html 1 micron particulate filters, an ozone system, and chlorination systems were installed before the whitewater reopened in 2017. In the meantime, land and Catawba river activities remained open for business, and the rapids reopened for a brief period of time at the end of the summer in 2016 after extensive cleaning and draining. Whitewater channels right USNWWC whitewater features The Center's recirculating river is filled with 12 million gallons of well water, which is cleaned every 24 hours by a filtration and ultraviolet system. The whitewater portion of the river has a total of of channel divided between two channels: the Olympic-standard slalom competition channel and the longer wilderness channel, which splits around an island at the top. The rapids are Class II to IV and can be navigated via canoe, kayak or a guided raft. The different channels are linked by an Upper and Lower Pool which are connected via a moving-belt boat-lift conveyor. The facility is equipped with a total of seven, 620hp submersible pumps manufactured by Flygt. Each channel is watered by three of the pumps. Six pumps will water both channels simultaneously. The electricity cost of each pump is about US$45 per hour. When only one channel is used, a low pressure, air bag actuated, Obermyer Gate separates the top of either the Wilderness or Competition Channel from the upper pond thus preventing water from entering. Since both channels have the same drop, , the extra length of the Wilderness Channel gives it a gentler slope. Most of the water diverters are natural boulders cemented in place, but there is some use of moveable plastic bollards attached to the bottom. There are five barn door diverters hinged to the channel sides and positioned by hydraulic pistons, two above the M-Wave on the long channel, and three in the slalom competition channel. The M-Wave is designed to replicate the famous M-Wave in an irrigation channel near Montrose, Colorado. The Wilderness Channel has six named drops, Entrance Exam (class 2), Huey Lewis (class 2), Bread and Butter (class 2+), Sunset (class 3), and M-Wave (class 3+). The Competition Channel has two named drops, Bridge Drop (class 3), and Big Drop (class 4). Commonly kayak surfed waves on the Wilderness Channel include Entrance Exam, Dave's Dilemma, Bread and Butter, Freestyle Wave, Well Hole, Sunset, Snake Lips, M-Wave, Shut Down, and Biscuits and Gravy. Commonly kayak surfed waves on the Competition Channel include Cheese Grater, Sketch Wave, Bridge Drop, and Big Drop.
